        Setting: MADISON, PENNSYLVANIA 1972

        CLOSE UP OF VADA

                                 VADA
                        (to camera)
                I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet 
                seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. 
                And i've learned to live with this chicken 
                Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the 
                past three years, so I knew Dad would be 
                devastated when he learned of my latest 
                affliction.
                        (to Harry)
                Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left 
                breast is developing at a significantly faster 
                rate than my right. It can only mean one 
                thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.

                                 HARRY
                        (ignoring Vada)
                O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of 
                the fridge.

        FRONT OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE

        Vada closes front door and goes down the steps to a group 
        of boys

                                 VADA
                All right, who's in raise your hand.

        All the boys raise their hands except Thomas J

                                 BOY
                Are you coming or not Thomas J?

                                 THOMAS J
                I don't think so.

                                 VADA
                I knew he wouldn't come.

                                 THOMAS J
                I can't, I have to go home.

                                 BOY#2
                Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.

                                 VADA
                Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.

        Group of boys enters house lead by Vada

        Once inside, the group is suddenly stopped

                                 VADA
                        (to boy#2)
                Hey, you didn't pay me!

                                 BOY#2
                How do I know you were gonna show us one?

                                 VADA
                You're such a baby.

                                 BOY#2
                All right, here.

        Boy reaches inside his pocket, gets money out and gives it 
        to Vada

                                 VADA
                All right, follow me and don't say a word.

        They walk towards two large doors, stop, and Vada turns 
        around

                You ready?

        They enter the coffin display room, and move over to the 
        coffin in the middle of the room

                You sure you wanna see it, or is someone 
                gonna go yellow belly?

                                 BOY#3
                I'm not chicken!

                                 VADA
                Okay. Lean forward.

        A tense moment as the coffin lid is flung open by Vada and 
        the boys gasp as they look inside

                                 GIRL#1
                It's empty!

                                 BOY#2
                You're so weird!

                                 BOY
                I want my money back!

                                 VADA
                I was afraid of this.

        They begin to move into another part of the house

                                 BOY#2
                Of what??

                                 VADA
                Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not 
                completely dead, you know, like when they cut 
                a chickens head off and it still runs around 
                crazy.

                                 BOY#3
                You're full of shit.

                                 VADA
                I bet she's roaming around this house 
                somewhere.

        They open the door into the living room, where Grammoo is 
        in her rocking chair

                There she is, in the rocking chair.

        Pause, then Grammoo begins to rock the chair gently. The 
        boys all gasp and then all exit very quickly

                                 VADA
                Hi Grammoo.

        Vada seats herself upon Grammoo's lap

                                 HARRY
                        (in distance, from 
                        downstairs)
                Vada would you bring down my cigarettes?

        Vada gets up and begins to leave

                                 VADA
                Seeya later.
                        (kisses Grammoo on forehead)

        BASEMENT, HARRY & ARTHUR WORKING ON MR. LAYTON

                                 HARRY
                Did I tell you, he was my woodshop teacher.

                                 ARTHUR
                You took woodshop?

                                 HARRY
                Yeah, I made a tie rack.

                                 ARTHUR
                I made a tie rack.

        Vada comes down the stairs and stops just before the corner 
        that would allow her to see the corpse of Mr. Layton

                                 VADA
                Ahem.

                                 HARRY
                Vada, just put 'em on the stool.

        Vada places the packet on a stool

                                 VADA
                Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly 
                yesterday.

                                 HARRY
                        (completely ignoring Vada's 
                        comment)
                Ya, that rack holds six ties.

                                 ARTHUR
                I still have mine.

        Vada recognizes Arthur's voice

                                 VADA
                Arthur!!

                                 ARTHUR
                Vada!!

                                 VADA
                I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.

                                 ARTHUR
                Good for you baby.

                                 VADA
                Once you put the hotels on board walk and 
                Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.

                                 ARTHUR
                I like to buy off all the railroads.

        Harry is slightly annoyed at Vada distracting them

                                 HARRY
                Vada, we're trying to work here.

                Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she 
                was gonna make a fur out of 'em!

                                 HARRY
                        (to Arthur)
                Hand me the canula.

        Vada begins to sing doo-wah-diddy-diddy, Arthur joins in

                                 HARRY
                        (annoyed)
                VADA!

                                 VADA
                Dad?

                                 HARRY
                I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't 
                sing.
                        (beat)
                All right Arthur, just a slide of the 
                needle.....
                        (fades out as Vada climbs 
                        stairs)

        Vada climbs stairs and stops to read patient note, CAUSE OF 
        DEATH - CANCER OF PROSTATE

                                 HARRY
                        (to corpse)

                journey, yeah, you look like a champion.

        OUTSIDE SULTENFUSS' HOUSE DAY, STRANGE WOMAN GETS OUT OF 
        CAMPER, WALKS UP TO DOOR AND RINGS BELL, VADA ANSWERS

                                 STRANGER
                Is Mr. Harry Sultenfuss in?

                                 VADA
                Sure, come on in.

        Vada and strange woman make their way to a desk in the 
        foyer, and sit down

                So, have you had the unfortunate experience 
                of recently losing a loved one?

                                 STRANGER
                        (puzzled look)
                Could I see your Dad, just for a second?

        Vada runs across to call downstairs

                                 VADA
                DAD, SOMEBODY'S HERE!!

        Vada runs back to the desk

                He's downstairs working on Mr. Layton. 
                Prostate Cancer. Once it hits your prostate, 
                you're a goner.

                                 STRANGER
                Oh.

        Harry enters

                                 HARRY
                How may I... Help you?

                                 STRANGER
                I'm Shelly devoto. We spoke, the other day 
                regarding the make up artist job.

                                 HARRY
                Oh yes.

                                 SHELLY
                It's still available I hope?

                                 HARRY
                I think it's still available.

                                 SHELLY
                I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for 
                two years, at the "Dino Raphael" Salon, all my 
                customers cried when I told them I was 
                leaving.

                                 HARRY
                Uhh, Miss devoto...

                                 SHELLY
                I have a wonderful disposition, I put people 
                right at ease.

                                 HARRY
                Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at 
                ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a 
                Funeral Parlor.

                                 SHELLY
                They're dead?

                                 HARRY
                Yes they are.

                                 SHELLY
                Stiffs??

                                 HARRY
                        (for want of a better word)
                Deceased.

                                 SHELLY
                The add just said "Makeup Artist"

        Doorbell rings

                                 HARRY
                Ahh, excuse me a second will you?
                        (opens door)
                Hi George, this is a twelve-fifty-eight, I 
                didn't want the burnished handles.
                        (door closes off scene)

        Vada looks out the window at Shelly's camper

                                 VADA
                Is that your camper?

                                 SHELLY
                Yes it is.

                                 VADA
                That's really cool.

        Grammoo walks past in a fixed stare

                                 SHELLY
                        (to Grammoo)
                Hello.

        Grammoo keeps walking as if she hadn't heard

                                 VADA
                She's shy.

                                 SHELLY
                Oh.

        Harry is standing at the door directing the men with the 
        coffin

                                 HARRY
                Just put it back in the display room fellers.

                                 MEN
                Okay Harry.

        The men move off, Vada walks over to Harry

                                 VADA
                Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?

                                 HARRY
                They come in all sizes honey, just like 
                shoes.

                                 VADA
                Is it for a child?

        Harry hesitates

                                 HARRY
                Of course not.

                                 VADA
                Then who's it for?

        Small pause while Harry thinks of a reply

                                 HARRY
                Short people, very short people.

        Shelly walks over to Harry

                                 SHELLY
                Excuse me, what about the job?

                                 HARRY
                Pardon?

                                 SHELLY
                I need the job.

                                 HARRY
                Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...

                                 SHELLY
                Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my 
                former clients will eventually die, and all 
                your clients used to be alive, so they have 
                something in common.

                                 HARRY
                You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering 
                the phone.

                                 SHELLY
                Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.

                                 HARRY
                Great, you can start right away. Call me 
                Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally 
                wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, 
                very much, but the....

                                 SHELLY
                I promise i'll take good care of these 
                people, they deserve it, they're dead, all 
                they've got left is their looks.

        Harry and Vada exchange weird looks

        OUTSIDE SHOPPING MALL-AREA DAY

        Vada and Thomas J are riding their bikes through town

                                 THOMAS J
                Hey look at this, no feet!

                                 VADA
                Oh wow, a real evil canieval.

        Vada and Thomas J ride up through a garage

                                 PSYCHO MECHANIC
                WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING IN MY GARAGE, GET 
                OUTTA HERE!!!

        Vada and Thomas J arrive outside the entrance to the 
        Doctors surgery, Vada enters and climbs stairs, she passes a 
        small boy in a wheelchair in the corridor, Vada enters room

        INSIDE DOCTOR WELTY'S WAITING ROOM

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                Hi Vada, what's wrong today?

                                 VADA
                I'm very sick.

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                Okay, take a seat, i'll check if the doctor 
                can see you.

        She picks up phone and whispers something inaudible to the 
        doctor

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                Okay, he'll see you, why don't you go in?

        Vada opens door to doctors surgery and enters

        OVER DR WELTY'S SHOULDER, CLOSE UP OF VADA HAVING HER EAR 
        EXAMINED

                                 VADA
                Well, what is it? I can handle it.

                                 DR WELTY
                You are perfectly healthy.

                                 VADA
                That can't be, I have all the classic 
                symptoms.

                                 DR WELTY
                Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your 
                house today?

                                 VADA
                Yes.

                                 DR WELTY
                Vada you've gotta stop this, there's 
                absolutely nothing wrong with you!

        Vada gets up in a mood, puts hat on, and walks to the door, 
        stopping and says with condescending intonation...

                                 VADA
                I'll just have to get a second opinion.

        OUTSIDE DOCTORS SURGERY DAY

        Vada emerges from the building and gets on her bike

                                 THOMAS J
                So, what'd he say was wrong with you?

        Vada is turning and beginning to ride away

                                 VADA
                The whole medical profession is a crack.

        Thomas J is trying to catch up

                                 THOMAS J
                Hey wait up for me!

        BIKE RIDE DOWN MAIN STREET IN TOWN

        VADA & THOMAS J ARE SINGING

        Vada slows down, stops and looks at a person on a ladder 
        painting a house

                                 VADA
                Hey look!

        Thomas J stops also

                                 THOMAS J
                At what?

                                 VADA
                That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.

                                 THOMAS J
                I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!

                                 VADA
                Hi Mr. Bixler!

        Mr. Bixler turns around and sees Vada and Thomas J

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. 
                J! How's the summer treating you?

                                 VADA
                It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the 
                books for summer reading.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Really? Already? The summer's just begun.

                                 VADA
                Yes, and now I'm reading War & Peace for fun.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about 
                you Thomas J?

                                 THOMAS J
                I haven't started yet.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Better get on his case Vada.

        Mr. Bixler gets down off his ladder

                                 VADA
                Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old 
                house?

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.

                                 VADA
                This is one big house for one single person.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Well, you never can tell...
                        (Vada gets worried look on 
                        her face)
                I might get a pet.
                        (Vada's expression relaxes, 
                        she smiles)

                                 VADA
                How are you gonna get the money for this old 
                house if you're not working?

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this 
                summer, so, I'm doing some work.

                                 VADA
                How much does it cost?

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Thirty five dollars.

                                 VADA
                What do you get for that?

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. 
                This an interrogation Vada?

                                 VADA
                No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off 
                War & Peace.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                It's summer! You're kids! Go play!

        Vada and Thomas J ride off down street

        SIDE ON SHOT OF VADA AND THOMAS J RIDING DOWN STREET, 
        CAMERA IS MOVING WITH THEM

                                 THOMAS J
                Wanna go to Gray's orchard and pick some 
                peaches?

                                 VADA
                No, I'm going home.

                                 THOMAS J
                Why? It's not dinner time yet.

                                 VADA
                Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go 
                home to eat.

        Vada accelerates leaving Thomas J in her tracks

                Don't pee on the hydrant!!

        VADA'S BEDROOM

        Vada puts a record on to play.
                        (song is "Wedding Bell 
                        Blues")
        She then opens a drawer and picks up a class photograph, 
        with Mr. Bixler enhaloed in a heart shape. Music begins to 
        play and Vada sings along the first few bars whilst looking 
        at the photo longingly

        SULTENFUSS' DINING ROOM TABLE NIGHT, VADA IS LYING ON THE 
        FLOOR SPRAWLED OUT, HARRY AND PHIL ARE HAVING A 
        CONVERSATION, AND GRAMMOO IS SITTING STARING INTO SPACE, 
        SHELLY ENTERS

                                 SHELLY
                Excuse me Harry, I finished Mr. Layton's 
                hair. He kinda looked......
                        (she sees Vada lying down 
                        sprawled out on the floor)
                Harry, what's wrong with her??

                                 HARRY
                Oh, she's just pretending. Vada, get up here 
                and eat your broccoli!

        Shelly moves over and crouches down next to Vada

                                 VADA
                        (very sick sounding voice)
                I think it's my prostate.

        All of a sudden, Grammoo begins to sing

                                 GRAMMOO
                I got rhythm, I got music, I got my man who 
                could ask for anything more? I got daisies, in 
                green pastures, I got my man, who could ask 
                for anything more?

        As this is being sung, Shelly slowly looks up with a VERY 
        weird expression, this is too much for her

        OUTSIDE FRONT OF HOUSE, VADA AND THOMAS J SITTING ON STEPS 
        DAY

        Shelly exits house and closes door behind her, and then 
        crouches down beside Vada and Thomas J

                                 SHELLY
                Who's winning?

                                 VADA
                I am.

        As Vada and Thomas J continue to play, three Vada-aged 
        girls come up to the end of the Sultenfuss' driveway

                                 GIRL#1
                Look, there's Vada and her little BOYFRIEND
                        (very mocking voice)

                                 VADA
                He is not my boyfriend!

                                 GIRL#2
                I bet she kissed him on the lips!

                                 VADA
                Do you think I kissed that ugly old thing?

                                 THOMAS J
                Yeah anyway.

                                 GIRL#2
                Come on let's go.

                                 GIRL#1 & GIRL#2
                Judy's father owns the movie theater and we 
                get to see all the movies WE want for free.

                                 JUDY
                Maybe you can come some time.

                                 GUY#2
                Eeeuww, don't invite HER, she'll have to 
                bring her boyfriend.

        The two girls begin to walk off, Judy follows slowly 
        looking guilty and embarrassed by her friends

                                 GIRL#2
                        (together)
                Vada and Thomas, sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-
                I-N-G, first comes love, then comes marriage, 
                then comes Thomas J in a baby carriage.

        Judy wanders off screen, looking sorry for Vada

                                 SHELLY
                You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls 
                upset you.

                                 VADA
                I'm not upset. I will never play with those 
                girls. I only surround myself with people who 
                I find intellectually stimulating.

        Thomas J looks at Shelly and smiles, he is proud to be the 
        friend of such an intelligent girl

                                 SHELLY
                        (to Vada)
                Want a piece of chocolate?

        Vada shakes her head

                                 SHELLY
                Thomas J?

                                 THOMAS J
                I'm allergic to it.

                                 SHELLY
                To chocolate?

                                 VADA
                He's allergic to everything.

                                 SHELLY
                Chocolate?

                                 VADA & THOMAS J
                TO EVERYTHING.

        Shelly notices a ring that Vada is wearing on her right 
        index finger

                                 SHELLY
                Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.

                                 VADA
                It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.

                                 THOMAS J
                It doesn't work, it always stays black.
                        (NOTE ring is BLACK)

                                 VADA
                It's only black when you're around 'cause you 
                put me in a bad mood.

                                 SHELLY
                Maybe black means you're happy?

                                 VADA
                I don't think so.
                        (pause)
                Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?

                                 THOMAS J
                She's crazy, she wants to go to school over 
                the summer.

                                 VADA
                It's not a real school, it's a writing class, 
                I wanna be a writer.

                                 THOMAS J
                She only wants to do it because her sweetie 
                pie's the teacher.

        Vada is annoyed that Shelly now knows her little secret and 
        pushes Thomas J

                                 VADA
                Shut your big fat mouth!

                                 SHELLY
                I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask 
                your Dad?

                                 VADA
                He won't give it to me.

                                 SHELLY
                Well you don't know that. Ask him.

        SULTENFUSS' LIVING ROOM, GRAMMOO AND HARRY WATCHING TV,

        Vada passes Grammoo and Harry who are watching a TV show, 
        she then seats herself next to Harry

                                 VADA
                Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?

                                 HARRY
                That's a lot of money for a little girl.

                                 VADA
                It's for school, for summer writing class.

                                 HARRY
                        (engrossed with TV show)
                Any more soda left?

        Vada pours Harry another soda

                                 VADA
                Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.

                                 HARRY
                Last month you wanted to play the violin. 
                Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.

        Harry keeps his gaze fixed the entire time upon the TV 
        screen

                                 VADA
                Dad?

                                 HARRY
                        (referring to TV)
                I love this guy!
                        (he laughs)

                                 VADA
                Dad??

                                 HARRY
                What?

                                 VADA
                The money?

                                 HARRY
                Ahh, maybe next summer.

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                He forgot about the time I wanted to be a 
                magician, I was really great at making myself 
                disappear.

        FOYER OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, VADA BOUNCING BASKET-BALL, 
        ARTHUR ENTERS

                                 VADA
                Wanna play?

                                 ARTHUR
                No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your 
                head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.

        Arthur grabs ball and begins to dribble it properly as a 
        demonstration

                See. You were looking at the ball. All right? 
                Keep your head up. Gimme some skin,

        They both give each other five i.e. Slap each others hands, 
        Arthur exits. Vada continues bouncing the ball, which 
        accidentally veers off and goes down the stairs into the 
        basement

        SCARY MUSIC

        Vada goes very slowly down the stairs, and peeks round the 
        corner, she is clearly very scared of the basement and the 
        corpses contained in it, she then rushes down and grabs the 
        ball. As she turns around, Shelly, who is upstairs walking 
        through the house and sees the door ajar, slams it shut 
        unaware that Vada is down there. Vada runs up the stairs and 
        tries to open the door, she can't, drops the ball and starts 
        to yell out for help and bang on the it. Shelly hears the 
        noise and comes to the door. Vada, overcome with fear, sits 
        on a step, covers her ears and begins to sing doo-wah-diddy-
        diddy. Shelly yanks the door open and sees Vada crouched on 
        the step

                                 SHELLY
                Vada? VADA?? What happened??

                                 VADA
                        (extremely frightened and 
                        timid)
                My ball, I lost my ball.

                                 SHELLY
                        (picking Vada up onto her 
                        feet)
                Come on sweetie.

        The two exit the scene

        SHELLY PUTTING MAKEUP ON DEAD LADY, BASEMENT OF SULTENFUSS' 
        HOUSE

                                 SHELLY
                Excuse me Harry?

                                 HARRY
                Uh huh?

                                 SHELLY
                Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?

                                 HARRY
                Yeah.

        Harry gets up from his desk, moves over to Mrs. Porter and 
        observes Shelly's work, he looks unimpressed

                Didn't I give you a picture of what she 
                looked like?

                                 SHELLY
                Yeah,
                        (searches pockets, eventually 
                        pulling out a photo)

        Harry compares photo with Mrs. Porter's face

                                 SHELLY
                You don't like it?

                                 HARRY
                This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have 
                her looking like a two dollar hooker.

                                 SHELLY
                        (a little offended)
                I think she looks nice! Her lips are very 
                thin so I used the gloss to give them a more 
                sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a 
                little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, 
                nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.

                                 HARRY
                She did. This photo was taken a month ago at 
                the church food drive.

                                 SHELLY
                I just wanted to get past this "old school 
                Marm" image.

                                 HARRY
                That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school 
                Marm.
                        (beat)
                Fix it.

        Harry begins to leave

                                 SHELLY
                Harry?
                        (Harry stops and turns 
                        around)
                I was just wondering, if there is anything 
                wrong with Vada.

                                 HARRY
                What do you mean??

                                 SHELLY
                Well the other night at dinner...

                                 HARRY
                Oh that, she just likes to play.

                                 SHELLY
                I don't think so, I think she's confused 
                about death.

                                 HARRY
                She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a 
                thing or two about it.

                                 SHELLY
                Harry, I really think she.....

                                 HARRY
                        (annoyed)
                She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, 
                look, don't give me any advice about my 
                daughter, okay?

        OUTSIDE FRONT OF HOUSE, VADA AND THOMAS J ARE TURNING A 
        SKIPPING ROPE AND PHIL IS JUMPING IN IT PUFFING AWAY, VADA & 
        THOMAS J ARE SAYING A RHYME THAT GOES WITH SKIPPING GAMES, 
        SHELLY PULLS UP IN HER CAMPER

                                 VADA
                There's Shelly!

        Vada and Thomas J stop turning the rope leaving Phil 
        standing there exhausted, and run over to Shelly's camper, 
        Shelly gets out

                                 SHELLY
                Hi.

                                 VADA
                Can we look around in your camper?

                                 SHELLY
                Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.

        Vada and Thomas J rush inside the camper

                        (surprised at Vada and Thomas 
                        J's eagerness to get inside)
                Woah! Gosh!

        Thomas J seats himself at the drivers seat and makes "vroom 
        vroom" noises, Vada sits at the table, selects a book from a 
        small bookshelf on the side, and begins to read it

                                 THOMAS J
                Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you 
                really eat and sleep here?

                                 SHELLY
                Uh huh.

                                 THOMAS J
                I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.

                                 SHELLY
                Liverpool?

                                 VADA
                Big Ringo fan.

                                 SHELLY
                Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?

                                 VADA
                I would.

                                 SHELLY
                Thomas?

                                 THOMAS J
                Yes please.

        Thomas uproots himself and sits opposite Vada at the table

                                 THOMAS J
                What are you reading?

        Vada makes a gesture at Thomas J with her finger up to her 
        lips implying that he should be quiet

        Shelly notices Vada reading the book

                                 SHELLY
                Oh! You shouldn't be looking at that, it's a 
                little too old for you.

        She takes the book away from her

                                 VADA
                Did you read ALL these books?

                                 SHELLY
                Uh huh.

                                 VADA
                What are they about?

                                 SHELLY
                Mostly love, and romance.

                                 THOMAS J
                Eeeeuuuww, gross.

                                 SHELLY
                They're just fun to read.

        Shelly hands the soda around

                Here, cheers.

        Everybody takes a mouthful of drink

                                 VADA
                Are you married?

                                 SHELLY
                No, I'm divorced.

                                 VADA
                Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.

                                 SHELLY
                Well, sometimes married people just find out 
                they can't live with each other.

                                 THOMAS J
                Mine aren't divorced.

        Thomas J gets up and reaches for the cookie jar

                Shelly, can I have a cookie?

                                 SHELLY
        With bottle of soda in mouth
                Hmmmph gurgle gurgle...

        Thomas pulls out a few bank notes of largish denomination

                                 THOMAS J
                Hey, where are all the cookies??

        Vada sees the money and the expression on her face shows 
        she has an idea

                                 SHELLY
                Well, I guess you found my secret hiding 
                place.

                                 THOMAS J
                What are you saving for?

                                 SHELLY
                Nothing in particular, just putting it away 
                for a rainy day.

        Cuckoo clock goes "Cuckoo." Lunch time, 12 o'clock

                                 THOMAS J
                I'm supposed to be home at noon for lunch, 
                thanks Shelly.

        Thomas J leaves

                                 SHELLY
                Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head 
                back?

                                 VADA
                Can I use your bathroom first?

                                 SHELLY
                Sure.

                                 VADA
                You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if 
                you're late.

                                 SHELLY
                Okay.

        Shelly exits and Vada enters toilet with a VERY guilty look 
        on her face

        SUMMER WRITING CLASS, FOCUS ON MR. BIXLER

                                 MR. BIXLER
                The great way, is not difficult for those 
                with no preferences, with the absence of both 
                love and hate, everything becomes clear and 
                undisguised. That was written by a Chinese 
                Philosopher in the year 600. Now why would I 
                choose to bring that up in a creative writing 
                class? Because, the absence of judgment helps 
                us to appreciate reality. In other words, I 
                want you to listen to your classmates writing, 
                with a clear and open heart, okay? So who's 
                gonna go first?

                                 GUY
                I got one.

        He gets up

                I sang a song for you to hear, I painted a 
                picture for you to see, I picked a rose for 
                you to smell, I planted grass for you to 
                touch, But you did not hear my song, You did 
                not see my picture, You did not smell my rose 
                and YOU did not touch my grass.

                Woman
                Maybe she was outta town?

                                 GUY#2
                That's not funny, his poem is about futility, 
                we toil in unrewarded obscurity.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Now, I hear judgment, let's not forget the 
                part about the open heart...

        The door at the back of the room opens and Vada enters 
        holding a writing pad and pen looking nervous

                Vada, is there, something I can do for you?

                                 VADA
                        (very nervous)
                I paid the money.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                For this class?

                                 VADA
                Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Vada, this is an adult writing class.

                                 JUSTIN
                Hey, I think it's real beautiful. She want's 
                to be a writer.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Vada, you sure you wanna do this?

        Vada nods her head

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Welcome to the class, go find a seat.

        The class applauds

                Okay ahh, who's next?

                                 RONDA
                I experienced something with my boyfriend the 
                other day, and I wrote a few words down.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                The floor's yours Ronda.

                                 RONDA
                He covers me like a blanket, from the cold, 
                dark night, As I look into his eyes, I know 
                it's right, To touch, To feel, I know he's 
                real, Flesh all a mush, Flesh ALL a mush, I 
                can't fight it, There's no point, I wake up in 
                Lighter joint.

        Several looks glance around the room. Vada raises her hand

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.

                                 VADA
                I wrote a poem too.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Please.

                                 VADA
                Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss
                I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good 
                when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, 
                This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate 
                or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.

                That's all I got so far.

                                 JUSTIN
                I hear that Vada, Flesh all a Mush or Rocky 
                Road, it's about desire.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Vada that's... It's very sweet, and it rhymes 
                and that's also good  but, you're not 
                expressing to me what's in your soul. I want 
                you to show me how you see the world, your 
                fears, your desires, your innermost secrets.

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                My fears and secrets. I'm afraid I killed my 
                mother.

        OUTSIDE SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, THEN INSIDE ON SHELLY AT DESK, 
        TUBA IS BEING PLAYED IN THE BACKGROUND

        Shelly gets up smiling when she hears the music and 
        proceeds to the living room

        Shelly pokes her head in the door to see Harry playing a 
        tune to Grammoo on his tuba

                                 HARRY
                        (sung, to Grammoo)
                Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.

                                 SHELLY
                Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let 
                you know that the flowers were delivered. And 
                the room's all set up.

                                 HARRY
                Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the 
                other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a 
                little harsh.

                                 SHELLY
                I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's 
                business. It's just that I like Vada, very 
                much.

                                 HARRY
                After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to 
                help take care of Vada. They were very close, 
                but lately as her mind's been wandering more 
                and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm 
                sure she'll snap out of it though.

                                 SHELLY
                I'm sure she will.

        VADA AND THOMAS J AT THEIR FAVORITE SPOT, EDGE OF LAKE WITH 
        VERY LARGE BEAUTIFUL WEEPING WILLOW JUST UP THE BANK A 
        LITTLE FROM A SMALL PIER WHERE TWO FISHING POLES ARE SET UP, 
        ONE HELD BY VADA AND THE OTHER BY A HOLDER AS THOMAS J HANGS 
        UPSIDE DOWN FROM THE TREE

                                 THOMAS J
                Nothing's biting today.

                                 VADA
                Maybe they had a big breakfast.

                                 THOMAS J
                        (hanging from tree)
                I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.

                                 VADA
                Big deal, I can do that too.
                        (Thomas J's reel begins to 
                        click)
                Thomas J, you got something!

                                 THOMAS J
                Oh no!
                        (he jumps down from the tree)
                UUH.

                                 VADA
                Hurry!

                                 THOMAS J
                I'm trying.

                                 VADA
                Reel it in.
                        (Thomas J reels the fish in)
                He's only tiny, throw him back.

                                 THOMAS J
                I don't like touching fish, how do you pull 
                the hook out without touching it?

        Thomas J puts his foot on the fish and pulls

                                 VADA
                You're hurting him, don't kill him!!

        The hook is out of the fish's mouth and sitting on the pier

        Vada then removes the hook from the fish's mouth {minor 
        error in film} and in the process pricks herself

                                 VADA
                Ouch! Darn hook!

        Vada puts the fish back

                                 VADA
                I'm bleeding, did he get away? Go look.

        Thomas J looks and sees the fish, dead, floating on top of 
        the water

                                 THOMAS J
                Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.

                                 VADA
                Hey, we can become blood brothers.

                                 THOMAS J
                Naah, I don't wanna.

                                 VADA
                You could pick that scab on your arm.

                                 THOMAS J
                It's a mosquito bite.

                                 VADA
                It'll bleed.

                                 THOMAS J
                If I do it, can we go?

                                 VADA
                Uh huh.

                                 THOMAS J
                Okay, OW!

        Thomas J picks the scab on his arm which begins to bleed

                                 VADA
                Okay, rub them together.

        They rub their cuts together

                                 VADA
                Now we're blood brothers for life.

        HARRY IS TYPING UP A DEATH NOTICE IN HIS STUDY, SHELLY 
        ENTERS

                                 SHELLY
                Hi.

                                 HARRY
                Oh Hi, what can I do for you?

                                 SHELLY
                Nothing, I was just wondering what you were 
                doing.

                                 HARRY
                Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you 
                know when someone dies people want it in the 
                paper usually, it's a service we provide for 
                the family.

                                 SHELLY
                Oh right, right,
                        (she picks up the newspaper). 
                Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 
                1972 Devoted husband to 
                Nicolette. Cherished father of 
                Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu 
                of flowers, please send 
                donations to the holy names 
                society.

                                 HARRY
                I wrote that.

                                 SHELLY
                No kidding?

        Harry gives Shelly a matter-of-fact look

                                 SHELLY
                Oh it's good, "In lieu of" I love that word 
                lieu.

                                 HARRY
                I prefer it to "instead", it has more 
                dignity.

                                 SHELLY
                In lieu... "instead".... No contest.

                                 HARRY
                It's no big deal.

                                 SHELLY
                You have to learn how to take a complement.
                        (Shelly turns the newspaper 
                        over)
                Movies, movies, ahhhh, "Love Story" at the 
                drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?

                                 HARRY
                I haven't been to the movies in AGES.

                                 SHELLY
                I love going to movies, especially at the 
                drive in. I don't think there's anything more 
                romantic than going to the drive in.
                        (subtle HINT)
                I'll let you get back to work.

        Shelly begins to exit with a look of failure on her face

                                 HARRY
                I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to 
                join me for a game tomorrow night at church 
                you're welcome to.

                                 SHELLY
                        (considers for a moment)
                Okay.

        Harry resumes typing

        VADA IS RUNNING THROUGH FOYER AND BEGINS TO PASS BATHROOM 
        WHERE SHELLY IS PUTTING ON MAKEUP

                                 SHELLY
                Hi Vada.

                                 VADA
                Are you going out somewhere?

                                 SHELLY
                No.

                                 VADA
                So how come you're putting lipstick on?

                                 SHELLY
                A girl's always gotta look her best.

                                 VADA
                I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are 
                that color.

                                 SHELLY
                Have you ever tried any?

                                 VADA
                No.

                                 SHELLY
                Come here, sit down.

        Vada enters bathroom and sits down on the closed toilet 
        seat, Shelly brings up a stool and sits down in front of 
        Vada. Vada gets some lipstick put on her

                                 SHELLY
                Now, first we blot.

        Vada blots her lips on some tissue

                                 SHELLY
                Take a look. I think it looks real nice on 
                you.

        Vada looks in Shelly's mirror

                                 VADA
                Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?

                                 SHELLY
                Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've 
                got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest 
                little nose, an amazing mouth.

                                 VADA
                The boys at school don't think I am.

                                 SHELLY
                They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna 
                bring out the gorgeous color in them. The 
                first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can 
                never wear enough blue eye shadow.

                                 VADA
                Do you like putting makeup on people?

                                 SHELLY
                Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to 
                Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the 
                stars, I haven't gotten there yet.
                        (she finishes her work)
                All right, open your eyes.

        Vada opens her eyes and looks in the mirror

                                 VADA
                Shelly, I would definitely hold off on that 
                Hollywood thing.

        VADA EXITS HOUSE THROUGH FRONT DOOR, RAUNCHY MUSIC IS 
        PLAYING AND SHE DOES A GROOVY WALK TO THE STEPS WHERE THOMAS 
        J AWAITS HER, SHE LIES DOWN LENGTH WAYS ACROSS THE STEP AND 
        LOOKS AT HIM

                                 THOMAS J
                Your lip bleeding?

                                 VADA
                No.

                                 THOMAS J
                What's wrong with your eyes?

                                 VADA
                A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.

                                 THOMAS J
                Where's your bike?

                                 VADA
                Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.

        The two enter the garage, where a large black hearse is 
        parked

                                 VADA
                It's only a garage, come on.

        Vada notices that one of her streamers on her bike is gone

                                 VADA
                Hey, one of my streamers is gone! It probably 
                fell off in here.

        Thomas J walks over to a model of a head

                                 THOMAS J
                Hey look at this!

                                 VADA
                That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, 
                they used to study the bumps in your head to 
                see if you had a good personality or not. Come 
                here, i'll diagnose your head.

                                 THOMAS J
                No, I don't wanna.

                                 VADA
                Come on, it's fun.

        Vada examines Thomas J's head and then compares it with the 
        chart

                                 VADA
                Hmmmm, interesting.

                                 THOMAS J
                What?

                                 VADA
                You have no personality.

                                 THOMAS J
                Hey, where does it say that?

                                 VADA
                Never mind.

        Thomas J knocks the lid off a small box and reveals a photo

                                 THOMAS J
                Is that your Dad?

                                 VADA
                Yes.

                                 THOMAS J
                Who's that with your Dad?

                                 VADA
                It's my mother.

                                 THOMAS J
                Do you remember her?

                                 VADA
                No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.

                                 THOMAS J
                What do you think it's like?

                                 VADA
                What?

                                 THOMAS J
                Heaven.

                                 VADA
                I think, everybody gets their own white 
                horse, and all they do is ride and eat 
                marshmallows all day, and everybody's best 
                friends with everybody else, when you play 
                sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets 
                picked last.

                                 THOMAS J
                But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?

                                 VADA
                It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular 
                horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal 
                if you fall, you just land in cloud.

                                 THOMAS J
                That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll 
                never find that streamer.

        As they leave, Vada turns back and grabs the photo, then 
        returns to Thomas J

        HARRY'S BEDROOM, HARRY IS DRESSING AND GETTING READY FOR 
        HIS DATE WITH SHELLY

        The tune "Moonglow" is playing on the radio

                                 PHIL
                Well well well, what's going on in here?

                                 HARRY
                Nothing, I'm dressing.

                                 PHIL
                Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry 
                Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to 
                lie to your big brother?

        Phil then proceeds to give Harry a noogie

                                 HARRY
                HEY! WATCH THE HAIR!! THIS SHIRT GIVES!!! ALL 
                RIGHT!!!!

        Phil stops

                I'm going out with Shelly.

                                 PHIL
                Oh yes, oh that's great.

                                 HARRY
                I'm very nervous.

                                 PHIL
                Why?

                                 HARRY
                The last date I had was twenty years ago.

                                 PHIL
                That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me 
                fill you in on today's women, since the last 
                time you dated, something happened, "The 
                Sexual Revolution", now before that, you used 
                to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull 
                her chair out, pick up the check, no more no 
                more, you wanna know what else is missing? 
                BRAS!

                                 HARRY
                Oh come on.

                                 PHIL
                Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this 
                woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her 
                like every Tom Dick and Harry.

                                 HARRY
                Are you sure about all this?

                                 PHIL
                Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?

                                 HARRY
                Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any 
                minute.

                                 PHIL
                Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the 
                right track.

                                 HARRY
                No, she's just driving over here, then we're 
                taking my car. How do I look?

                                 PHIL
                Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em.

        Harry runs down the stairs and passes Vada on the way

                                 HARRY
                Goodnight Vada.

                                 VADA
                Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?

                                 HARRY
                Ahh, I just wanna look nice.

                                 VADA
                You never cared before.

                                 HARRY
                Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go 
                together.

                                 VADA
                Why?

                                 HARRY
                She likes to play bingo.

                                 VADA
                Can I go too?

                                 HARRY
                Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep 
                Grammoo company.

        Harry leaves and then Vada makes a decision, she goes out 
        the door

        OUTSIDE THE SENNET'S HOUSE, VADA IS CREEPING ALONG NIGHT

        Vada approaches the Sennet's house and signals through the 
        window for Thomas J to come outside, which he does

                                 THOMAS J
                Vada? Vada?? Where are you??

        Vada springs up from her hiding place

                                 VADA
                Here.

                                 THOMAS J
                Don't DO that!!

                                 VADA
                Sorry.

                                 THOMAS J
                What do you want? My mom will skin me alive 
                if she finds I'm out here.

                                 VADA
                Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo 
                tonight.

                                 THOMAS J
                I told you i'll get in trouble.

                                 VADA
                Pacifist!

                                 THOMAS J
                I am not.

                                 VADA
                Bed wetter!

                                 THOMAS J
                I stopped that!

        AT THE CHURCH, FOCUS ON THE BINGO ANNOUNCER WHO IS CALLING 
        OUT THE NUMBERS

                                 HARRY
                Don't worry, there's a strategy to bingo. For 
                instance, on a given night anybody can win, 
                but I play the odds, when choosing bingo 
                cards, I use a range of theories from the laws 
                of probability to avoiding duplicate number 
                systems. This way you get much more activity.

                                 SHELLY
                        (hopeful)
                Does it make it easier to win?

                                 HARRY
                No. Just, more activity.

        Harry then pulls a seat out and sits down in it, cutting 
        Shelly off, who has to pull her own seat out and sit down

                                 HARRY
                        (as he sits down, to the 
                        person next to him)
                Hi Carl.

        OUTSIDE THE CHURCH NIGHT

        Vada and Thomas J are walking up to the church

                                 THOMAS J
                They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.

                                 VADA
                We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.

                                 THOMAS J
                Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.

                                 VADA
                Duck!

        Vada and Thomas J are ducking behind a counter on one side 
        of the church, Harry and Shelly are quite clearly visible on 
        the other side of the room

                                 SHELLY
                        (in the distance, as a number 
                        is announced)
                Oh great!

                                 THOMAS J
                Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.

                                 VADA
                Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.

                                 SHELLY
                        (in the distance again, as 
                        another number is announced)
                Aarrggh.

        CLOSE UP OF HARRY AND SHELLY

        As Shelly looks around the bingo table, she notices that 
        everyone around her is chronologically advantaged in a big 
        way

                                 SHELLY
                I just had a terrible thought Harry.

                                 HARRY
                What's that?

                                 SHELLY
                I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these 
                people very soon.

                                 HARRY
                Why d'you think these seats were empty.

        OUTSIDE

                                 THOMAS J
                Can we go yet?

                                 VADA
                Go???

                                 THOMAS J
                You know I'm not allowed outside my myself 
                after dark.

        CLOSE UP AGAIN

                                 SHELLY
                Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.

                                 HARRY
                Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending 
                upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 
                10 cards could win just as easily as a guy 
                with 100.

                                 SHELLY
                Kinda like men.

                                 HARRY
                Oh, how do you mean?

                                 SHELLY
                You can be in a room with 100 men, and not 
                like any of them, or you can be in a room with 
                just one man, and he's exactly the one you 
                want.

        Harry and Shelly are about to kiss each other, Vada sees 
        this and doesn't look too happy about it

                                 VADA
                        (in semi-deep fake voice)
                BINGO!

                                 BINGO ANNOUNCER
                We have a winner. Will the winner please 
                raise their hand?

                                 CARL
                There was no bingo, it came from outside.

                                 VERNON
                How could someone outside get a bingo?

                                 CARL
                Someone outside didn't get a bingo, someone 
                outside yelled bingo you moron!

                                 VERNON
                Who are you calling a mowon?
                        (false teeth)

                                 VERNON'S WIFE
                Put a lid on it Vernon!

                                 CARL
                Put a lid on it?? If you weren't 200 years 
                old, I'd kick your wrinkled ARSE!!

        The two old men then have a fight, Harry attempts to break 
        it up

                                 HARRY
                Hey fellers fellers, it's just a bingo game.

        Meanwhile, Shelly has found it all rather amusing

        OUTSIDE

                                 VADA
                We can go now.

        Vada and Thomas J run off down the street

        VADA'S BEDROOM NIGHT, VADA IS LYING ON HER BED THINKING

        As she hears Harry's car approaching, she goes to her 
        window and looks out it through the venetian blinds

        OUTSIDE STOPPED CAR

        Harry gets out of his side, comes round to the other side 
        and then hesitates before deciding to follow his brothers 
        advice and let Shelly get out herself, which she does, 
        eventually

                                 SHELLY
                I had a good time tonight.

                                 HARRY
                I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.

        They walk up to Shelly's camper

                                 SHELLY
                Would you like to come in and see my house? 
                Just for a minute.

                                 HARRY
                Okay, sure.

        They enter, Vada continues to watch them from her room

        INSIDE CAMPER, HARRY AND SHELLY ENTER

                                 SHELLY
                Home sweet home.

                                 HARRY
                It's nice.

                                 SHELLY
                I did it myself. I read a magazine article 
                about how to maximize small spaces.

                                 HARRY
                Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.

                                 SHELLY
                You can look in the bathroom if you want. 
                People are always curious about that, like 
                what happens when you flush.

        Harry moved toward the back of the camper and looks in the 
        bathroom, and then flushes the toilet

                                 HARRY
                Yeah.

                                 SHELLY
                Are you mad at me?

                                 HARRY
                No, why?

                                 SHELLY
                I don't know, tonight you just seemed a 
                little cool, not opening car doors and...

                                 HARRY
                Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice 
                on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of 
                touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not 
                since my wife died.

                                 SHELLY
                What happened to her?

                                 HARRY
                Ahh, complications during child birth, she 
                died two days after Vada was born.

                                 SHELLY
                Did she ever see Vada?

                                 HARRY
                I brought the baby into the room a couple of 
                times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think 
                she saw Vada. It was.....

        Harry looks at the item that he picked up and was fiddling 
        with to calm his nerves

                Did I ruin this?

                                 SHELLY
                Dance with me?

                                 HARRY
                Here?

                                 SHELLY
                This is where we are.

                                 HARRY
                Is there enough room?

        Shelly moves an object from the floor, which creates more 
        room

                                 HARRY
                I haven't danced in.....

                                 SHELLY
                In ages, I know, me neither.

        They begin a slow dance

                                 HARRY
                Rock?

                                 SHELLY
                See, you're not that out of touch.
                        (they dance)
                You're good.

                                 HARRY
                At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot 
                date, I did a killer frugue.

        Shelly smells Harry's neck

                                 SHELLY
                What are you wearing?

                                 HARRY
                Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.

        They continue to dance

                                 SHELLY
                Do you want to?

                                 HARRY
                Want to what?

                                 SHELLY
                Kiss me.

                                 HARRY
                Yes.

                                 SHELLY
                Good.

        They then have a long kiss

                                 SHELLY
                Good at kissing, and dancing, I'm very 
                optimistic.

        They then kiss again, this time interrupted by the clock 
        cuckooing

                                 HARRY
                I ahh, better go.

                                 SHELLY
                It's only eight o'clock.

                                 HARRY
                Goodnight Shelly.

                                 SHELLY
                Goodnight.

        Harry exits the camper followed by Shelly who stands at the 
        door

        OUTSIDE CAMPER NIGHT, HARRY HAS JUST GOT OUT OF SHELLY'S 
        CAMPER

                                 SHELLY
                Well, I guess it's official we had a date, 
                maybe we can play bingo again sometime.

                                 HARRY
                I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that 
                drive in of yours.

                                 SHELLY
                Goodnight.

        Harry waves

        VADA'S ROOM

        Vada finishes watching, and goes to bed

        SUMMER WRITING CLASS DAY

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Before the class started, Ronda and Justin 
                wanted to lead the class in a group 
                meditation.

                WOMAN
                Ooooh that's really cool.

                                 JUSTIN
                Okay what we're gonna do is, send our vibes 
                out into the group.

        Justin turns on some kind of tape deck which begins to play 
        weird music

                                 RONDA
                Everybody hold hands, and close your eyes. 
                Relax your muscles and take deep breaths.

                                 JUSTIN
                Now, try to feel what the other person is 
                feeling, without speaking any words, send out 
                your vibe, and receive the vibes around you at 
                the same time. Can you feel it?

                                 RONDA
                Okay, open your eyes. What did everybody 
                feel?

                                 GUY
                I felt Mrs. Hunsaker's strength.

                OTHER GUY
                I can feel that Ronda is one with the Earth, 
                she's so cosmically in tune.

                                 RONDA
                So right on, that's exactly what I sent out, 
                and I felt like, you were full of inner peace 
                and harmony.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Vada, what did you feel.

                                 VADA
                I felt Justin's hangnail.

                                 JUSTIN
                No Vada, that's not what we're looking for, a 
                hangnail is insignificant. What's in my soul, 
                feel my aura.

                                 VADA
                I don't think I'm allowed to.

                                 JUSTIN
                I tell you what, let's try it again, hold 
                hands.

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                Grammoo once had a hangnail on her big toe. 
                It got infected and traveled to her vocal 
                chords, it ruined her singing voice, I don't 
                think Grammoo thought it was insignificant.

        VADA'S ROOM, VADA LYING ON BED THINKING

        Vada gets out of bed and goes down corridor to see Grammoo, 
        she seats herself cross legged next to Grammoo on her bed 
        and takes her hands in an attempt to do some spiritual 
        healing

        SUPERMARKET DAY, VADA AND HARRY ARE SHOPPING

                                 HARRY
                Lettuce, watch out for the rust when you get 
                lettuce.

        Suddenly Shelly appears behind them and calls out

                                 SHELLY
                Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.

                                 VADA
                Hi.

                                 HARRY
                I'm just picking some things up for the 
                barbecue.

                                 SHELLY
                Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?

                                 HARRY
                Not at all. Lot of potatoes!

                                 SHELLY
                It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.

                                 HARRY
                I'm looking forward to that.

        Vada, who is pushing the shopping trolley behind Harry and 
        Shelly, obviously does not like the idea of Harry & Shelly, 
        and she rams her cart into Harry

                                 HARRY
                HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're 
                doing.

                                 VADA
                Sorry.

                                 SHELLY
                You know this is gonna be my first 4th of 
                July picnic in a long time.

                                 HARRY
                Really?

                                 VADA
                        (picking up large can of 
                        prunes)
                Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL 
                bad?

                                 HARRY
                Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the 
                cart, anything at all.
                        (to Shelly)
                I don't know what's gotten into her today.

        Vada begins to throw cans of every description from the 
        shelf into the shopping trolley at regular intervals, not 
        giving a stuff what they contain

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                I used to like to play with my Ken and Barbie 
                dolls, Ken was my favorite. Then one Christmas 
                I got them a camper, and all they wanted to do 
                was hang out in it by themselves. So I wasn't 
                too upset when they took that wrong turn and 
                went over a cliff.

        CLOSE UP OF AMERICAN FLAG DAY, HARRY - PLAYING TUBA, 
        SHELLY, PHIL & VADA SINGING "STAR SPANGLED BANNER" AND 
        GRAMMOO STANDING NEXT TO THEM WATCHING

        MUSTANG PULLS UP NEXT TO SHELLY'S CAMPER, IT STOPS AND TWO 
        MEN GET OUT

        HARRY COOKING MEAT PATTIES ON BARBECUE, WHICH ARE BEGINNING 
        TO LOOK CHARRED, PHIL IS STANDING NEXT TO HIM

                                 PHIL
                Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to 
                use fewer briquettes and now look what you've 
                done. You've cremated them.

                                 HARRY
                That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??

                                 PHIL
                No, no no....

                                 HARRY
                Look if you think you know how, why don't you 
                pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, 
                put out a product, support me for a while!

        Phil exits scene, Shelly comes up behind Harry

                                 SHELLY
                How's it going chef?

                                 HARRY
                Okay.

        Vada is seen turning her head to look at Harry and Shelly, 
        she doesn't like Harry and Shelly standing so close 
        together, she decides to make her move and pushes in between 
        Harry and Shelly

                                 VADA
                Are they ready yet?

                                 HARRY
                No, sweetie, not yet.

        Shelly begins to brush Vada's hair with her fingers, which 
        Vada does not like and she shakes her head to get Shelly off

                                 VADA
                When?

                                 HARRY
                Soon honey, soon.

        Shelly again tries to fix up Vada's hair
                        (which there doesn't appear 
                        to be anything wrong with)
        And Vada shakes her off again

                                 VADA
                When??

                                 HARRY
                In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll 
                burn your nose, look out.

        Vada backs off, followed by Shelly

        THE TWO MEN THAT GOT OUT OF THE CAR ARE PROCEEDING UP THE 
        SULTENFUSS' DRIVEWAY

        FOCUS ON PHIL, HARRY, VADA, SHELLY AND GRAMMOO AT THE TABLE 
        OUTSIDE, SHELLY SAYS A SEMI-GRACE

                                 SHELLY
                Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.

                                 HARRY
                I'll second that.

                                 VADA
                Hey Shelly, like seafood?

                                 SHELLY
                Uh huh, why?

                                 VADA
                See food!

        Vada opens her mouth and displays half chewed BBQ cuisine 
        to Shelly

                                 SHELLY
                        (laughing)
                That's attractive.

        Shelly's glance moves to behind Grammoo on the other side 
        of the table and beyond, where the two men are standing 
        looking around

                                 SHELLY
                        (under her breath)
                Oh shit! Excuse me...

        Shelly gets up and moves off to talk to the men, Vada and 
        Phil turn so they can see what is going on, Harry can 
        already see, Grammoo just sits staring into space

                                 MAN
                Hey Shelly, who lives here?
                        (pointing at hearse)
                The Addams Family?

                                 SHELLY
                Danny, what are you doing here?

                                 DANNY
                What am I doing here????? What am I doing 
                here?

                                 SHELLY
                        (to other man in background) 
                Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?

                                 DANNY
                You told everybody where you were going, I'm 
                here for the motor home.

        Scene shifts to Vada, Phil and Harry for a moment

                                 PHIL
                These two people do not have a good 
                relationship.

                                 SHELLY
                        (in background)
                No! _I_ bought it, _I_ paid for it...

        Scene shifts back to close up of Shelly and Danny arguing

                                 SHELLY
                I've been living in it for over a year, the 
                camper is mine.

                                 DANNY
                Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the 
                lawyer said, it's supposed to be "OUR MUTUAL 
                ASSET", not "Shelly's recreational vehicle". 
                Gimme the keys.

                                 SHELLY
                Keep your voice down!

                                 DANNY
                What?

                                 SHELLY
                The boss is watching us...

                                 DANNY
                        (sarcastic)
                I'm impressed.

                                 SHELLY
                God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.

                                 DANNY
                Yeah, all right...

        Shelly and Danny walk over to the table where the rest of 
        the family are seated, Ralph follows close behind

                                 SHELLY
                        (Talking to Danny, pointing 
                        at the people respectively)
                This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada 
                Sultenfuss...

                                 DANNY
                Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.

                                 VADA
                        (matter-of-fact)
                I like my name.

                                 SHELLY
                        (to the Sultenfuss')
                This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino 
                Raphael salon in Detroit.
                        (pointing at Danny)
                We used to be married.

                                 VADA
                        (extremely hopeful, to Danny)
                Are you here to take Shelly back?

        Danny shakes his head at Vada, then Harry gets up and walks 
        round the table

                                 HARRY
                Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got 
                burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to 
                join us?

                                 DANNY
                Can't stay, I'm just here because my 
                wife.....

        Shelly quickly interjects

                                 SHELLY
                Ex...ex, ex...

                                 DANNY
                My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my 
                camper.

                                 HARRY
                Shelly?

                                 SHELLY
                Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I 
                promise.....

                                 DANNY
                I don't think so, I got a copy of the 
                property settlement right here.

        Danny pulls out a piece of paper

                Ahh Shit, this is my lease...... Damn it, I 
                keep forgetting things, I'm getting senile.

                                 HARRY
                Danny?

                                 DANNY
                WHAT?

                                 HARRY
                Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, 
                and there's really nothing anyone can do to 
                comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the 
                times you had with the camper, the trips you 
                took, the sights you saw, those days are gone 
                now, but they'll live on in your heart 
                forever.

                                 DANNY
                        (to Shelly)
                This guy bonking you?

                                 SHELLY
                        (disgusted)
                Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!

                                 HARRY
                        (to Danny)
                Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.

                                 DANNY
                Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?

                                 HARRY
                It's her home! It's where she lives!!

                                 DANNY
                Oh really, okay fine look, go cook,
                        (to Shelly)
                Gimme the goddam keys.

        Danny tries to grab the keys from Shelly

                                 SHELLY
                Stop it! That hurts!!

        Harry is now VERY annoyed

                                 HARRY
                Danny.....

        As Harry says "Danny" for a second time he plants his fist 
        in Danny's stomach with force, winding him and shutting him 
        up

        FOCUS ON VADA AND PHIL'S FACES, WHICH ARE STARTLED

        FULL SCENE, SHELLY IS GAPING, DANNY IS BENT OVER WITH RALPH 
        HOLDING HIM UP, VADA AND PHIL WATCHING CLOSELY AND GRAMMOO 
        STARING INTO SPACE

                                 RALPH
                What'd you do that for??

                                 HARRY
                Who are you?

                                 RALPH
                I'm his brother.

                                 HARRY
                Oh then you'll probably be visiting us here 
                quite often.

                                 RALPH
                WHY??

                                 HARRY
                Because if he ever tries to take Shelly's 
                camper again, I'm gonna bury him in my front 
                yard.

        Ralph looks rather disturbed by this

        FOCUS ON VADA AND PHIL, VADA STILL GAPING

                                 PHIL
                        (quiet voice, to Vada)
                Your father is a savage.

        Vada looks up at Phil, Phil looks back and nods

        ROAD IN FRONT OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, DANNY AND RALPH IN CAR, 
        SHELLY LEANING OVER WITH HER HEAD IN WINDOW NIGHT

                                 SHELLY
                Bye Ralph.

        The car with Danny and Ralph in it pulls away and Shelly 
        waves

                                 SHELLY
                        (to Harry)
                Well, you were pretty great!

                                 HARRY
                Is it really your camper?

        Shelly makes gesture with her right hand suggesting "sort 
        of"

        Suddenly a sky rocket screams up in the sky and then 
        explodes, Harry and Shelly look up and watch the fireworks

                                 SHELLY
                Can we see it from the back yard?

                                 HARRY
                You can get the general idea...

        They move off to the back yard...

                                 HARRY
                Yep, there they are... They always look the 
                same every year...

                                 SHELLY
        Pointing upwards Look...

                                 HARRY
                Did you ahh, love him?

                                 SHELLY
                I would never marry anybody I didn't love.

        VADA AND PHIL SITTING ON SEAT-SWING WATCHING FIREWORKS

                                 VADA
                He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit 
                anyone in his life.

                                 PHIL
                He likes her.

                                 VADA
                Does he love her?

                                 PHIL
                Probably.

                                 VADA
                Do you like her?

                                 PHIL
                Yes I do, and I think she's very good for 
                your father.

                                 VADA
                Why?

                                 PHIL
                After your mother died, he was sad all the 
                time, but before that, he was pretty funny.

                                 VADA
                Really?

                                 PHIL
                Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he 
                seems like the old Harry.

                                 VADA
                My Dad was funny?

                                 PHIL
                Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but 
                he made me laugh.

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                My Uncle fought in the Korean war, he had a 
                steel plate put in his head, Daddy said he 
                didn't come back the same, one night, he 
                picked up a radio station from Oklahoma in his 
                teeth, it was really neat.

        DR WELTY'S SURGERY, LOOKING AT VADA WHO HAS HER MOUTH OPEN 
        WITH A TONGUE HOLDING STICK DOWN HER THROAT

                                 VADA
                Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh.

                                 VADA
                        (with stick in mouth)
                Carnnk yu sheeee ik??

        Dr. Welty removes stick from Vada's mouth

                                 VADA
                Can't you see it?

                                 DR WELTY
                No.

                                 VADA
                It's there.

                                 DR WELTY
                Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your 
                throat.

        Vada looks at the Dr.'s certificates up on the wall

                                 VADA
                Dr. Welty, are you sure those are yours?

        WAITING ROOM, NURSE RANDALL IS DEMONSTRATING A SYRINGE TO 
        THOMAS J, HOW TO USE IT AS A WATER GUN

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                So you fill it with water like this, and what 
                have you got? A water gun.

                                 THOMAS J
                Cool, can I get one for Vada?

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                Oh yes, yes.

        She gets another one out of her drawer

                Thomas, let me ask you a question. Does Vada 
                ever tell you why she comes down here so much?

                                 THOMAS J
                Cause she's dying.

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                Do you think she is?

                                 THOMAS J
                No.

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                Why do you think she says that?

                                 THOMAS J
                Cause she gets scared of all those dead 
                people in her house, and you know that saying, 
                If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if 
                she's one of them, she won't be as scared.

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                You know what I think? I think Vada's very 
                lucky to have a friend like you.

        Nurse Randall hands Thomas J another syringe

                                 THOMAS J
                She's my best friend.

        The door to the doctor's surgery opens and Vada exits

                                 NURSE RANDALL
                Miss Vada, how are you feeling?

                                 VADA
                As good as can be expected.

        CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DOCTORS WAITING ROOM

                                 THOMAS J
                Hey Vada, guess what we got?

                                 VADA
                What?

        Thomas J begins to run, and as he passes Vada he squirts 
        his syringe at Vada

                                 THOMAS J
                THIS!!
                        (squirt)

                                 VADA
                HEY YOU!!!!
                        (squirt)
                I'm gonna get you!!!
                        (squirt)
                I'll get you!!!!

        Vada at this point is unarmed, and she chases Thomas J down 
        the stairs

        FOREST DAY, VADA AND THOMAS J ARE RUNNING THROUGH IT FIRING 
        THEIR WATER GUNS AT EACH OTHER AND YELLING AT EACH OTHER, 
        HAVING FUN

        Suddenly Thomas J stops in his tracks

                                 THOMAS J
                Woah!!

                                 VADA
                What?

                                 THOMAS J
        Pointing There's a beehive right there!

                                 VADA
                So?

                                 THOMAS J
                Stand back.

        Thomas J stands a pace back behind a branch on the tree and 
        begins to squirt the beehive

                                 VADA
                Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!

                                 THOMAS J
                You're right, let's knock it down.

                                 VADA
                What do you want it for anyway?

                                 THOMAS J
                For their meat.

        The two start throwing rocks at the hive, which gets 
        damaged and eventually falls to the ground

                                 THOMAS J
                Got it!

                                 VADA
                My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!

        They begin to search for Vada's mood ring

        Suddenly bees begin to swarm, luckily Thomas J notices in 
        time

                                 THOMAS J
                They're alive!! Run for your life!!!

        Vada just stands there looking, Thomas J comes back and 
        grabs her arm, this wakes her up and they begin to run

                                 THOMAS J
                Run faster they're after us!!

                                 VADA
                I am running faster!!

                                 THOMAS J
                Hurry!!!

        They have run to the spot with the weeping willow and the 
        pier, they run out on to the pier

                                 VADA
                Jump in the water!!

                                 THOMAS J
                But I have my clothes on!

                                 VADA
                Do it!

        UNDER WATER VIEW OF THEM BOTH, HOLDING THEIR BREATH

        INSIDE VIEW OF FRONT DOOR TO SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, VADA ENTERS 
        DRENCHED

                                 HARRY
                        (in the distance, from 
                        upstairs)
                Vada is that you?

                                 VADA
                Yes..

                                 HARRY
                Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival 
                tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.

        Vada likes this news, she hurries up the stairs

                                 HARRY
                Shelly's coming with us.

        Vada is now not so happy

        CARNIVAL  NIGHT, FERRIS WHEEL IS SPINNING, MANY PEOPLE ARE 
        SCREAMING IN A TYPICAL CARNIVAL MANNER, SLOW ZOOM ON HARRY, 
        SHELLY AND VADA

                                 SHELLY
                So Vada, what's your favorite ride?

                                 VADA
                I like the freak show.

                                 HARRY
                I know, I know, let's go on the "sit on the 
                bench and rest" ride.

                                 SHELLY
                I don't think that that roller coaster agreed 
                with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have 
                to watch what you eat here, I remember one 
                time I went to a carnival with my cousins 
                David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, 
                and the next day they came down with 
                nephritis.

                                 VADA
                Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't 
                get it from hot dogs.

                                 SHELLY
                Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next 
                day they had really high fevers, and their 
                faces got very fat. They baffled medical 
                science, they were in a magazine.

        Vada and Harry give Shelly a "yeah RIGHT" look

                                 SHELLY
                They were!! "Popular Mechanics", no "Popular 
                Science". I don't know, popular.

        HARRY, SHELLY AND VADA ARE STANDING AT A STALL WHERE OBJECT 
        IS TO GET A BALL IN FISH BOWL

                                 SHELLY
                Oh look they're trying to hit that poor 
                thing.

                                 HARRY
                Watch you don't knock out a fish.

                                 SHELLY
                Perfect.

                                 HARRY
                I don't know which ball's mine.

        Vada gets a ball in a bowl

                                 VADA
                I won, I won!!!

                                 SHELLY
                Oh great!!

                ATTENDANT
                Hooray, we have a winner,
                        (picks up fish in plastic 
                        bag)
                There you go little girl.
                        (gives fish to Vada)
                See how easy it is folks!

        Shelly inspects fish, holding it along with Vada

                                 SHELLY
                Oh Vada, that's a gorgeous goldfish.

        Vada notices something on Shelly's hand

                                 VADA
                Where'd you get that ring?

        All of a sudden Shelly looks up with a guilty look

                                 VADA
                        (extremely hopeful)
                Did you win it?

        Harry and Shelly exchange looks, Harry smiles, followed by 
        Shelly

                                 SHELLY
                Vada we have something to tell you. Harry?

        Harry sits down on table and looks at Vada in a matter-of-
        fact way

                                 HARRY
                Vada we have some good news, Shelly and I are 
                getting married.

        Vada's expression begins to change from hopeful, to horror, 
        but then she drops her fish

                                 VADA
                Oh my fish!!!

        Vada quickly bends over to pick up the fish

                                 HARRY
                We're having the wedding sometime near the 
                end of the summer.

                                 VADA
        Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little 
        fish.

                                 SHELLY
                Vada? Would you like us to get you another 
                goldfish?

                                 VADA
                        (angry)
                NO!, He's fine.
                        (less angry, talking to fish)
                Fish are very resilient animals you know. 
                Don't worry, I won't get another fish.

        Shelly and Harry exchange worried looks, Vada doesn't seem 
        to have understood

                                 ANNOUNCER

                                 SHELLY
                Oh bumper cars, oh you can't go to a carnival 
                and not ride the bumper cars.

                                 HARRY
                I fall asleep at the wheel.

                                 VADA
                        (malicious grin)
                I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!

                                 SHELLY
                Oh great Vada, come on...

        They run off leaving Harry to carry the teddy bear and the 
        fish

                                 SHELLY
                        (to the attendant)
                Uhh, two.
                        (to Vada)
                I got the blue one!!

        Vada runs in past Shelly and seats herself in a car

                                 VADA
                NO!

                                 SHELLY
                Yes!!

        Shelly gets in the blue one

                                 SHELLY
                        (pointing at Vada)
                I am gonna get you.

        Vada straps herself in, Shelly turns around and gives Vada 
        the thumbs up, Vada looks VERY intent on brutally murdering 
        something now, and she returns the thumbs up, as she does 
        so, music begins to play and the power is turned on, the 
        song is "Bad Moon Rising"

                                 HARRY
                Vada, keep your hands on the wheel!!

        Vada rushes straight at Shelly and rams into her at top 
        speed, so that Shelly's car is spun around a little, Shelly 
        screams, this is all in good fun, at the moment. Then Vada 
        rams her again, and again, and again, and again, and 
        eventually, Shelly does not look too pleased, she can't 
        escape Vada

                                 HARRY
                Careful Vada, careful.

                                 HARRY
                Shelly LOOK OUT!

        WWHHAAMMM

        Shelly and Vada pull up along side each other, Vada gives 
        Shelly a satisfied but still spiteful grin

        VADA IS RIDING HER BIKE ALONG HER STREET TOWARDS THE 
        CAMERA, SHE STOPS AND DISMOUNTS OUTSIDE THOMAS J'S HOUSE

        Vada rings the Sennett's doorbell, and Mrs Sennett answers

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Hi Vada.

                                 VADA
                Hi, can Thomas J come out?

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Sure, come in.

        Thomas J is coming down the stairs

                                 THOMAS J
                Hi Vada.

                                 VADA
                Hi, wanna ride bikes?

                                 THOMAS J
                Sure.

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Ohh, did you make your bed?

                                 THOMAS J
                Yes.

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                You're sure?

                                 THOMAS J
                It's made.

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Come here, you've got a milk mustache.

        Mrs. Sennett wipes Thomas J's lip

                                 THOMAS J
                Come on, let's go.

                                 VADA
                Bye Mrs. Sennett.

                                 THOMAS J
                Bye Ma.

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Have fun kids.

        The two exit the house

        OUTSIDE FRONT OF SENNETT'S HOUSE, VADA AND THOMAS J ARE 
        WALKING DOWN THE STAIRS

                                 VADA
                I'm running away.

                                 THOMAS J
                Where you running to?

        They get on their bikes and begin to ride off

                                 VADA
                California, I'm going to Hollywood to live 
                with the Brady Bunch.

                                 THOMAS J
                I wanna live with them too.

                                 VADA
                No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll 
                have to live with the Partridge Family.

                                 THOMAS J
                Really?

        SOMEWHERE ON A PATHWAY IN A LIGHT FOREST, VADA AND THOMAS J 
        ARE RIDING THEIR BIKES

        Thomas J stops and then does Vada

                                 THOMAS J
                That's it.

        Thomas J goes and sits down on the river bank, Vada follows 
        with an annoyed look

                                 VADA
                Get up!?

                                 THOMAS J
                I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past 
                this place two times already. We're not 
                getting nowhere.

        Vada sits down next to Thomas J

                                 THOMAS J
                Why are you running away?

                                 VADA
                My Dad gave Shelly a ring.

                                 THOMAS J
                Wow, was it a decoder ring?

                                 VADA
                You're such a retard, it was an engagement 
                ring.

                                 THOMAS J
                They're getting married?

        Vada nods her head

                                 THOMAS J
                So now you'll have a mother.

                                 VADA
                I don't like her.

                                 THOMAS J
                I do, she's real funny.

                                 VADA
                He likes her better than me.

        A TREE DUSK, THOMAS J AND VADA ARE UP THE TOP OF IT

                                 THOMAS J
                I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.

                                 VADA
                Then go home, baby.

                                 THOMAS J
                I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.

                                 VADA
                Leave then, some friend you are.

                                 THOMAS J
                You can come to my house for dinner?

                                 VADA
                No, I'm hiding out.

                                 THOMAS J
                Okay, seeya.

        Thomas J climbs down from tree, and leaves

        DISSOLVE INTO NEXT SCENE

        VADA STILL IN TREE NIGHT, SHE LOOKS AROUND AND THEN DECIDES 
        TO GET DOWN

        Vada jumps down, and we can now see that the tree was on 
        the Sultenfuss' front lawn

        INSIDE VIEW OF FRONT DOOR, VADA ENTERS AND CLOSES IT

        As soon as Vada has entered, she waits for someone to come 
        running and ask her if she's all right, where she's been, 
        they were so worried etc., Nothing happens, all she can hear 
        is the noise that the TV is making. So she opens the door 
        again and slams it. Still nothing. She decides to give up, 
        and go find Harry, she walks to the living room where the TV 
        is on, Harry and Grammoo are asleep in their chairs

        Vada begins to ascend the stairs, depressed

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                In social studies we learned some people 
                stole the Limburg baby right out of his house, 
                I think i'll sleep with my window OPEN 
                tonight.

        OUTSIDE SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, A LOUD HIGH PITCHED SCREAM IS 
        HEARD

        VIEW OF CORRIDOR LEADING TO BATHROOM

                                 VADA
                OH MY GOD!!!

        Vada bursts out of the bathroom and screams down the stairs

                                 VADA
                DADDY!! Daddy daddy!!!! Daddy!!??!?!

        Vada runs into a room where Shelly is

                                 VADA
                Daddy??!?!?!

                                 SHELLY
                Vada, Vada, what's the matter?

                                 VADA
                Where's Daddy?

                                 SHELLY
                Well he just left, what's wrong?

                                 VADA
                I'm hemorrhaging.

                                 SHELLY
                What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?

                                 VADA
                        (very weak, scared voice)
                I don't want, I don't need your help....

        Vada tries to run away, but Shelly stops her

                                 SHELLY
                Vada, did this happen in the bathroom?

        Vada nods her head

                                 SHELLY
                How old are you?

                                 VADA
                I'm eleven and a half.

                                 SHELLY
                It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have 
                a little talk.

        They exit

        VADA'S BEDROOM, VADA AND SHELLY SITTING ON BED

                                 VADA
                My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?

                                 SHELLY
                It's actually a very beautiful thing, and 
                look there wouldn't have been a Vada.

                                 VADA
                I think it should be outlawed.

                                 SHELLY
                Believe me, some day, you'll feel 
                differently.

        Door bell is heard ringing

                                 VADA
                Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna 
                see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to 
                boys.

        OUTSIDE FRONT DOOR OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, VADA OPENS DOOR

                                 THOMAS J
                Hi Vada, can you come out?

                                 VADA
                I dunno..

                                 THOMAS J
                Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go 
                swimming?

        Vada is angered by this, she comes storming out

                                 VADA
                NO!

        Vada pushed Thomas J hard enough to make him fall over, she 
        is angry

                Get outta here!! And don't come back for five 
                to seven days!!!

        Vada runs inside and slams the door, leaving poor Thomas J 
        sitting on the porch looking startled

        FUNERAL ROOM OF SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, PIPE ORGAN IS BEING 
        PLAYED, MANY PEOPLE ARE SEATED AND THERE IS AN OPEN COFFIN 
        UP THE FRONT

        LIVING ROOM, VADA IS READING A BOOK, AND WATCHING GRAMMOO 
        TO BE SURE THAT SHE DOESN'T WANDER OFF, VADA PUTS THE BOOK 
        DOWN

                                 VADA
                Grammoo, I'm going to the bathroom, i'll be 
                right back.

        She then gives Grammoo a little kiss, and makes her way out 
        of the living room to the bathroom, closing the door behind 
        her, as she goes to enter the bathroom she hears giggling 
        coming from the next room, so she goes to investigate. Harry 
        and Shelly are kissing and giggling. As she is watching 
        this, Grammoo gets up, enters the funeral room and makes her 
        way to the front, when she gets there, she picks up a rose, 
        takes a look at the dead man, and begins to sing into the 
        rose as if it were a microphone

                                 GRAMMOO
                It's quarter to three, there's no-one in the 
                place, just you and me.

        As this is being sung, Vada hears and turns around with an 
        OH SHIT look on her face, Harry and Shelly also hear it 
        and make off for the funeral room, Vada quickly retreats 
        into the room where Harry and Shelly were, closing the door 
        behind her

                So santa-macho, I got a little story you 
                oughtta know, we're comin' my friend, to the 
                end of a brief episode, so make it one for my 
                baby and one more for the road.

                                 HARRY
                I'm so sorry, it's all right ma, I'm very 
                very sorry.

        ROOM IN SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, HARRY BURSTS IN, CLEARLY HE IS 
        VERY ANGRY

                                 HARRY
        Grabs Vada by the shoulders 
                Now what were you thinking, huh? HUH???? It's 
                your responsibility to watch her!! Do you have 
                any idea how upset those people are in 
                there???!

        Vada breaks free from Harry's grip, and walks briskly out 
        of the room. Shelly looks back at Harry expectantly

        WEEPING WILLOW TREE DOWN AT THE LAKES EDGE, VADA AND THOMAS 
        J ARE SITTING UNDER IT RESTING QUIETLY

                                 VADA
                Why do you think people want to get married?

                                 THOMAS J
                Well when you get older, you just have to.

                                 VADA
                I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.

                                 THOMAS J
                You can't marry a teacher, it's against the 
                law.

                                 VADA
                It is not.

                                 THOMAS J
                Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's 
                and it won't be fair.

                                 VADA
                Not true.

                                 VADA
                        (nervously, uncertain)
                Have you ever kissed anyone?

                                 THOMAS J
                Like they do on TV?

                                 VADA
                Uh huh.

                                 THOMAS J
                No.

                                 VADA
                Maybe we should, just to see what's the big 
                deal.

                                 THOMAS J
                But, I don't know how.

                                 VADA
                Here, practice on your arm like this.

        Vada brings her forearm up to her mouth and starts to kiss 
        it, Thomas J follows

                                 THOMAS J
                Like this?

                                 VADA
                Uh huh.
                        (they kiss their arms for a 
                        while)
                Okay, enough practice.

                                 VADA
                Close your eyes.

                                 THOMAS J
                But then I won't be able to see anything.

        Vada raises her fist

                                 VADA
                Just do it.

                                 THOMAS J
                Okay, okay.

                                 VADA
                Okay on the count of three.

        CAMERA SWITCHES ANGLES TO GIVE A CLEAR SIDE ON OF THOMAS J

                                 VADA
                One.

                                 VADA
                Two.

                                 VADA
                Two and a half.

                                 VADA
                Three.

        Vada leans forward and kisses Thomas J on the lips, they 
        both look surprised, Vada then sits back against the tree, 
        long pause

                                 VADA
                Say something it's too quiet.

                                 THOMAS J
                Umm, Ummmmm

                                 VADA
                        (agitated)
                Just, hurry.

        Thomas J stands up and begins to say something along the 
        lines of...

                                 THOMAS J
                On political agents to the flag of the United 
                States of America,

        Vada stands up and joins in

                                 THOMAS J & VADA
                And to the republic for which it stands, one 
                nation, under God, individual, with liberty 
                and justice for all.

        When they finish, they both still look a little 
        uncomfortable

        ROAD DAY, VADA AND THOMAS J ARE WHEELING THEIR BIKES BACK 
        DOWN IT

                                 VADA
                You better not tell anyone.

                                 THOMAS J
                You better not either.

                                 VADA
                Well, let's spit on it.

                                 THOMAS J
                Okay.

        Both of them raise their hands to their mouths and spit on 
        them, they then shake hands and when finished wipe them off 
        on their trousers

                                 VADA
                Seeya tomorrow.

                                 THOMAS J
                Okay, seeya.
                        (Vada starts off down the 
                        road)
                Vada?

                                 VADA
                What?

                                 THOMAS J
                Would you think of me?

                                 VADA
                For what?

                                 THOMAS J
                Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.

        Vada smiles, and gets on her bike

                                 VADA
                I guess.

        As Vada rides off, Thomas J smiles

        BACK IN THE WOODS WHERE VADA AND THOMAS J HAD FOUND THE 
        BEEHIVE

        Thomas J comes across the beehive, inspects it and then 
        kicks it, he waits and then once he is adamant that there is 
        no danger, he begins to search for Vada's mood ring, he 
        searches, and as he does so, bees begin to swarm, he finds 
        the mood ring, and by the time he notices that there are 
        bees everywhere, it is too late..

                                 THOMAS J
                        (as he finds the mood ring)
                Yes!

                                 THOMAS J
                        (reacting to the bees)
                Ow, ahh, NO!, Get away!!!

        We see Thomas J's glasses fall off onto the ground

        OUTSIDE FRONT DOOR, SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, POLICEMAN PRESSES 
        DOORBELL, HARRY ANSWERS

        A policeman enters, takes his hat off and explains what has 
        happened to Thomas J to Harry, who becomes clearly very 
        distressed

        VADA'S ROOM, VADA IS FEEDING FISH, HARRY ENTERS

                                 HARRY
                Hi Vada.

                                 VADA
                Hi.

                                 HARRY
                What are you doing.

                                 VADA
                Feeding my fish.

                                 HARRY
                Is that the fish you won at the carnival?

                                 VADA
                Yes.

                                 HARRY
                He's getting big.
                        (sad pause)
                Vada, come here and sit down for a minute.

        Vada sits down next to her Dad

                                 HARRY
                Vada, something happened to Thomas J last 
                night, he stepped on a beehive.

                                 VADA
                        (beginning to look worried)
                I told him not to tease those bees. Did he 
                get stung?

        Harry nods

                                 VADA
                Maybe I should go over and yell at him.

                                 HARRY
                No sweetheart, you can't.

                                 VADA
                        (looking very worried)
                Why not?

                                 HARRY
                He was allergic to bees.

                                 VADA
                        (extremely worried)
                He's okay isn't he?

                                 HARRY
                        (shakes head, near tears)
                There were just too many of 'em.

        When Vada hears this, her eyes begin to flood with tears 
        and the expression on her face changes movingly, it looks as 
        though she just lost the most special and important part of 
        her life. And she has

        VADA RUNNING UP STAIRS INTO DOCTORS OFFICE

                                 VADA
                Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??

                                 DR WELTY
                Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?

                                 VADA
                I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.

                                 DR WELTY
                Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, 
                come up here and we'll have a look.

        Dr. Welty lifts Vada up onto bed

                                 VADA
                It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.

                                 DR WELTY
                What Hurts Vada?

                                 VADA
                The bee stings! I can't breathe!

        OUTSIDE SULTENFUSS' HOUSE, HARRY AND ARTHUR ARE BRINGING 
        THOMAS J IN ON A STRETCHER

        INSIDE, CORRIDOR OUTSIDE VADA'S ROOM, SHELLY IS CLIMBING 
        STAIRS CARRYING A TRAY OF FOOD, SHE STOPS OUTSIDE VADA'S 
        ROOM

                                 SHELLY
        Knocks Vada?

        View shifts to inside Vada's bedroom, where she is curled 
        up in a little ball on her bed

                I'm leaving some food for you by the door, in 
                case you get hungry.

        Vada remains where she is, the doorbell rings

        DOWNSTAIRS, SHELLY OPENS DOOR TO REVEAL JUDY

                                 SHELLY
                Hi.

                                 JUDY
                Hi, is Vada home?

                                 SHELLY
                Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's 
                not seeing anyone.

                                 JUDY
                Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I 
                wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.

                                 SHELLY
                Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of 
                days.

                                 JUDY
                Will you tell her I came by?

                                 SHELLY
                Sure.

                                 JUDY
                Thank you. Bye.

                                 SHELLY
                Bye.

        Shelly closes the door

        PEOPLE ARE ENTERING THE FUNERAL ROOM

                                 REV
                Hi Harry.

                                 HARRY
                Ahh, Reverand Miles.

                                 REV
                The Sennetts want to thank you for taking 
                care of things so quickly.

        THE FUNERAL ROOM IS FILLING UP, WITH THOMAS J AT THE FRONT 
        IN A COFFIN

        CORRIDOR OUTSIDE VADA'S ROOM, SHELLY STOPS OUTSIDE IT

                                 SHELLY
                        (knocks)
                Vada? I see you took your tray in,

        Vada is looking out her blinds at all the black cars and 
        people dressed in black entering her house

                Maybe you should come down for the funeral, 
                sometimes it helps. Vada?

        HARRY'S STUDY, HARRY IS LOOKING AT A PIECE OF PAPER, SHELLY 
        ENTERS

                                 SHELLY
                She won't come out. It's been a whole day. 
                You have to do something Harry.

                                 HARRY
                The funeral's starting.

        Shelly is now very emotional

                                 SHELLY
                Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her 
                only friend in the world is dead.

                                 HARRY
                I know that, but what do you want from me?

                                 SHELLY
                Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I 
                first came here, the idea of working with dead 
                people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I 
                saw a family lived here, I thought, "if I'm 
                living without a family, at least I can work 
                with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be 
                invited in for supper."

                                 HARRY
                Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted 
                because there's a car crash, or there's a 
                fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.

                                 SHELLY
                I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those 
                people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't 
                ignore the living, especially your daughter.

        Arthur enters

                                 ARTHUR
                Excuse me Harry, Shelly, the minister's about 
                to begin.

                                 HARRY
                Thank you Arthur.

        FUNERAL ROOM, MINISTER IS WALKING UP THE FRONT

                                 MINISTER
                We are here to honor Thomas James Sennett. He 
                was born, May 7 1961, in Madison, 
                Pennsylvania, and he was survived by his 
                loving parents, Charles and Susan Sennett......
                        (fades as camera changes)

        CAMERA IS ON VADA, WHO IS SLOWLY MAKING HER WAY OUT OF HER 
        ROOM

        The minister is heard to say this in the background

                                 MINISTER
                The family has asked me to say a few words 
                before we proceed. No words that I could say, 
                would begin to describe the loss and grieving, 
                one word that keeps ringing in my ear is 
                Why?. Why would God choose to take this 
                little boy from us? I can't give you an answer 
                to that question, but I can tell you that God 
                has chosen Thomas J for some very special 
                reason, we must find solace in knowing that 
                Thomas J is now in Gods care. In that face, 
                there is no sorrow such as....

        The ministers words fade into the very moving music

        CAMERA IS ON VADA SLOWLY DESCENDING THE STAIRS AND LOOKING 
        INTO THE FUNERAL ROOM, THE MUSIC, SCENE AND ACTIONS OF 
        CHARACTERS IS GETTING TO THE POINT OF MAKING THE VIEWER CRY

        Vada stops and sits on a step where she can look through 
        and see Thomas J lying in his coffin, she begins to cry

        BACK IN FUNERAL ROOM, VADA ENTERS AT THE BACK AND BEGINS TO 
        SLOWLY MAKE HER WAY UP TO THE FRONT

                                 MINISTER
                ....disciples began to chastise them, and 
                Jesus said "Let the children come to me, do 
                not hinder them, for the Kingdom of God 
                belongs to such as these.
                        (the minister notices Vada 
                        coming around the front of the 
                        room)
                He laid his hands on their heads before he 
                left that place, let us pray in silence.

        Vada has made it right up to the coffin, which she leans 
        over and crying, says the following

                                 VADA
                Wanna go tree climbing Thomas J?

        CAMERA DOES A CLOSE UP OF THOMAS J'S BEE STING COVERED FACE

        CAMERA GOES BACK TO PREVIOUS SHOT INCORPORATING VADA AS 
        WELL

                                 VADA
                His face hurts, and where is his glasses? He 
                can't see without his glasses! Put his glasses 
                on!
                        (Harry and Shelly are rapidly 
                        approaching Vada, Shelly takes 
                        hold of her and tries to pull 
                        her away)
                Put on his glasses! He was gonna be an 
                acrobat.

                                 HARRY
                He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!

                                 VADA
                Get away, get away!!

        Vada breaks away from Harry's grip and runs out of the 
        room, followed closely by Harry and Shelly

        OUTSIDE THE HOUSE, VADA IS RUNNING DOWN THE STEPS, FOLLOWED 
        CLOSELY BY HARRY

                                 HARRY
                Vada wait! Vada! Vada!!

        Harry stops running after Vada as she sprints off down the 
        road

        Vada arrives at Mr. Bixler's house

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Vada! I was just on my way to your house. Are 
                you all right? I'm so sorry about Thomas J.

        Vada covers her ears and begins to sing "doo-wah-diddy-
        diddy"

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, 
                Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, 
                it's okay. We won't talk about him all right?

                                 VADA
                        (crying)
                Justin and Ronda say that I should tell 
                people what I feel.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                        (nods)
                Come here, sit down over here.

        The two of them sit down on Mr. Bixler's porch

        Vada is clearly in a lot of pain and she wants it to stop

                                 VADA
                Mr. Bixler,
                        (emotional pause)
                I love you.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Oh, Vada...

                                 VADA
                I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna 
                live here.

                                 MR. BIXLER
        Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss 
        you.

                                 VADA
                No he wouldn't, I can't go home.

        A woman appears at Mr. Bixler's front door

                                 SUZANNE
                I'll be ready in a second, I just can't seem 
                to find my other earring....

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Suzanne, this is Vada.

                                 SUZANNE
                        (comes over to Vada and 
                        crouches)
                Vada, hi, I'm really sorry.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Could you just give us a minute?

                                 SUZANNE
                Yeah.

        Suzanne goes back inside

                                 VADA
                Who's that?

                                 MR. BIXLER
                That's Suzanne.
                        (pause)
                She and I are gonna be married this Fall.

        As soon as Vada hears this, she reacts, shaking her head 
        and backing off

                                 VADA
                No....

                                 MR. BIXLER
                I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. 
                I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please 
                honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, 
                Vada sweetheart don't.....

                                 VADA
                Get away from me!

        Vada runs off down the road

        WEEPING WILLOW, VADA AND THOMAS J'S FAVORITE SPOT, VADA IS 
        UP HIGH IN THE TREE

        Vada is climbing around in the tree, clearly trying to get 
        somewhere of significance

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                Why do you think people wanna get married?

                                 THOMAS J'S VOICE
                When you get old, you just have to.

        Vada pulls out her photo of her mother

                                 THOMAS J'S VOICE
                Who's that with your Dad?

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                It's my mother.

                                 THOMAS J'S VOICE
                I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
                        (pause)
                Vada, would you think of me? Well if you 
                don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                Now we're blood brothers for life.

        Vada gets out to the end of a branch, and makes a daring 
        jump to another, had she fallen she would be dead

                                 SHELLY
                But I....

        Shelly is cut off as the door opens and in walks a very 
        shaken Vada

                                 SHELLY
                Vada. Are you okay?
                        (Vada nods)
                Oh God.

        Shelly embraces Vada

        VADA'S ROOM, SHELLY AND VADA ARE SITTING ON VADA'S BED, 
        SHELLY IS BRUSHING VADA'S HAIR

                                 VADA
                I should have told Thomas J that he was my 
                best friend.

                                 SHELLY
                I'm sure he knew.

        Shelly puts a nightie on Vada

                                 VADA
                Shelly, I stole some money from your cookie 
                jar, to pay for the writing class.

        Shelly ponders this for a moment

                                 SHELLY
                It's okay sweetheart.

                                 VADA
                I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll 
                ever go to class again.

                                 SHELLY
                I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first 
                book to me, and we'll forget about the whole 
                thing.

                                 VADA
                I will I promise.

                                 SHELLY
                Okay, get in to bed.

        Vada gets into bed and extends her arms to Shelly, they hug 
        each other, Vada has finally accepted Shelly

                                 SHELLY
                Goodnight.

                                 VADA
                Goodnight.

        Shelly exits and turns off the lights

        DOWNSTAIRS, HARRY ENTERS

                                 SHELLY
                        (sitting on stairs)
                She's in.

        BACK IN VADA'S ROOM

        Harry enters, walks over and kisses Vada, then turns around 
        and begins to exit

                                 VADA
                Did I kill my mother?

                                 HARRY
                What??

                                 VADA
                The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my 
                mother.

                                 HARRY
                No, no.

        Harry pulls up a chair and sits down next to Vada

                                 HARRY
                No sweetie that wasn't your fault, things 
                like that aren't anybody's fault, it just 
                happened.

        Vada pulls out the photo of Harry and Vada's Mom from under 
        her pillow

                                 VADA
                I found this.

                                 HARRY
                I forgot about that picture, where did you 
                find it?

                                 VADA
                In the garage.

                                 HARRY
                Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers 
                favorite car.

                                 VADA
                What was my mama like?

                                 HARRY
                She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. 
                Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when 
                you laugh, you sound just like her.

                                 VADA
                Really?

                                 HARRY
                Uh huh. You know what your mother did when 
                she found out she was gonna have you? She came 
                home and painted this whole room pink. She was 
                so sure she was gonna have a little girl.

                                 VADA
                Do you miss her?

                                 HARRY
                Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and 
                even now, I get a little sad when I think of a 
                pretty flower or a sunset that your mother 
                would have liked.

                                 VADA
                I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll 
                think of Thomas J.

                                 HARRY
                That's good, memories are good sweetheart. 
                Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from 
                you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and 
                I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump 
                like me.
                        (Vada puts the photo back 
                        under her pillow, Harry gets 
                        up and kisses her)
                Seeya in the morning.

        Harry begins to leave room

                                 VADA
                Daddy, it's not so bad to be like you.

        A CAFE IN TOWN, HARRY IS EATING, MRS. SENNETT COMES AND 
        KNOCKS ON THE WINDOW

        Harry makes his way out of the cafe to talk to Mrs. Sennett

                                 HARRY
                Mrs. Sennett, how are you doing?

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Some days I think i'll be okay, others, well 
                I have to force myself even to get out of bed, 
                I know it's crazy, but sometimes I think he's 
                just away at summer camp. How's Vada?

                                 HARRY
                Oh she's doing much better. Ahh she's just 
                inside.
                        (walks over to entrance)

                VADA!

        Vada, who is inside talking to someone, hears and comes 
        outside

                                 VADA
                Mrs. Sennett.
                        (she runs and gives her a 
                        hug)

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Vada. I've been wanting to come over to see 
                you,
                        (she reaches inside her purse 
                        and gets out something, it is 
                        Vada's mood ring)
                Thomas J had this on him, I thought you might 
                like to have it.

        Vada slides the ring onto her finger, the ring is BLUE

                You were such a good friend to him, I hope 
                you'll still come by and visit me.

                                 VADA
                I will, I promise.

        Mrs. Sennett looks at Harry as if to say good-bye, and then 
        walks off slowly

                                 VADA
                Mrs. Sennett.
                        (she stops and turns around 
                        to look at Vada)
                Thomas J will be all right, my mother will 
                take care of him.

                                 MRS. SENNETT
                Thank you Vada.

        She then turns and walks off

        SUMMER WRITING CLASS, FOCUS ON MR. BIXLER

                                 MR. BIXLER
                        (reading from book)
                Encased in talent, like a uniform, the rank 
                of every poet, is well known. They can amaze 
                us like a thunderstorm, or die so young, or 
                live for years alone. My advice to you on our 
                last class, be a thunderstorm.

                                 JUSTIN
                What exactly do you mean by that?

                                 MR. BIXLER
                I mean, be dangerous
                        (Vada enters the back of the 
                        room)
                And unpredictable. And make a lot of noise.

        Mr. Bixler sees Vada

                                 MR. BIXLER
                Vada.

        As Vada is noticed, she goes around getting hugged by 
        everyone

                                 JUSTIN
                Hey, we missed you man! Gimme a hug!

        Vada gives Justin a hug, she then proceeds towards Mr. 
        Bixler

                                 MR. BIXLER
                I was hoping you'd stop by today.

        Vada and Mr. Bixler hug each other

                                 VADA
                I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.

                                 MR. BIXLER
                We'd love to hear it.

                                 VADA
                Weeping willow with your tears running down, 
                Why do you always weep and frown, Is it 
                because he left you one day, Is it because he 
                could not stay, On your branches he would 
                swing, Do you long for the happiness that they 
                would bring, He found shelter in your shade, 
                He thought his laughter would never fade, 
                Weeping willow stop your tears, There is 
                something to calm your fears, You think death 
                as if you forever part, But I know he'll 
                always be in your heart.

        There is a long pause as it sinks in, everybody remains 
        silent, then just before the scene changes, the Temptations 
        song "My Girl" begins to play

        OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL, VADA COMES OUT THE DOOR AND DOWN THE 
        STEPS WHERE JUDY AWAITS HER

                                 VADA
                Hi Judy.

                                 JUDY
                Hi Vada.

                                 VADA'S THOUGHTS
                Things are a little better these days; I 
                finally swallowed that chicken bone, Judy and 
                I are gonna be in the same home room and the 
                republican party just re-nominated Mr. Nixon.

        Vada and Judy ride off down the road on their bikes, the 
        camera angle rises and the credits begin to roll as the song 
        My Girl plays


        THE END
