                                (Pause)
                         Yes.
Shot of father and son, son in jeans, boots and vest,
long hair, early     twenties, his hair getting longer with
the progress of the movie, his features, icily handsome,
becoming more and more expressive and tender.
                         You quit.

          A :* :                (Inwardly)
                        Yea.
(A.'s small pocket knife is out, playing the edge with his
nail, shot close of his hands slightly quivering with
inner tension.)

                        I can see you're on acid,
             Father:

                        my mind is blown.
(Gently out of tension rubs the inside of his upper leg)

                                (Looking at him as he
             Father:
                               does this)
                        I think you're sick.

A. striking match, watches it burn.            Telephone      rings.
Father picks up phone.         Pause.
Strange voice hissing over the phone:

                        sssssss.
Hanging up.
Father, bothered, hanging up.            The match in A.'s hand
burns out.      Father sees it go out.
A; rising, not looking at his Father, walking to elevator
which opens directly on the luxurious apartment.

                      I need a woman, Dad. I'm
                      going out and find a woman, Dad-
F. startled, very distant, slowly wondering aloud:

                      You really are sick . . . You
                     have no idea      really of what
                      reality is.
A, turning around at entrance to elevator which opens
as he talks.                                 Then softer:
                Looking at Father hard.
                                           Right here.
                      Reality I have.
                            (Gesturing with his
                           hand to his genitals)
                      Right here.

inside the Temple and two of the Brothers are dancing
softly to the sound of soul music.
            The white world is for the most part outside the
Temple, sprawled about it in the thick grass, relaxing.
Some have beards, others have shaved, but their faces are
hard and dirty, dust and dirt is deeply ingrained in the
cracks of skin,    Anthony is an exception, he has kept him-
self clean, his beard barely visible, although there are
small lines of fatigue under his eyes and a small scar
under his left eye, the result of a previous wound, not
serious.    He tends to rub it occasionally.    Ironically,    in
the war, he has become even softer. Time has crumbled:
he is spacing himself.
            The contrast is made then, by camera CloseuPs,
of the black and white features,     The Blacks are tenderer,
softer.     The Whites are tired, cruel.   The blacks Sing-
Dance.     Although inside they are as blue as the sky, and
scared.

as he walks, the sun gleaming through the trees, almost
moving with him, seen and then not seen and seen again.
From a distance, inside the temple, on the radio, Sam
Cooke's song "Cupid" is playing loud, and sort of sad like
all Cooke's songs , giving a texture of music and sunlight
to his walk.

             He breaks through the thicket into the crystal
clear sun shining over the tiny clearing around the
Temple.     The Whites sprawled about.
             As he breaks through the thicket, Anthony, wear-
ing silver bracelets and a Buddhist medallion around his

neck and a ruffled dirty shirt, his hair unkempt, longer
than before, is taking his picture from a distance through
a telephoto-lensed        camera, which for the first time, he

has a very high singing voice, though not as good as
Smokey's whom most people mistake for a woman he sings so
'tenderly,   starts to sing with the radio:

             People say I'm the life of the party

             As he sings, the rest do not look at him sing,
they know he can sing, they've heard this song a hundred
times, they know it too.      They lie where they are, look at
what they do, and deep inside, where it's blue, they listen.

some relationship to the surrounding dream world of The

to search for new interpretations, there is a real feeling
for love, which is really a source without words.

a stream.        Perhaps they are the enemy, it is not made clear

children, white and black.                  They dance hugging each other,
their long hair jumping, in all sorts of love contortions
