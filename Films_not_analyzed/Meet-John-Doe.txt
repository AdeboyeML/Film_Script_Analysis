                         works. He is painting HENRY CONNELL's 
                         name on the door. It opens and a flip 
                         office boy emerges. The painter has 
                         to wait until the door closes in order 
                         to resume his work.

                         activity of the office seems to suddenly 
                         cease, as all eyes are centered on the 
                         office boy.

                         has a small sheet of paper in his hand. 
                         He walks jauntily to a desk, refers 
                         to his paper, points his finger to a 
                         woman, emits a short whistle through 
                         his teeth, runs a finger across his 
                         throat and jerks his thumb toward managing 
                         editor's office. The woman stares starkly 
                         at him while her immediate neighbors 
                         look on with sympathy. The office boy 
                         now goes through the same procedure 
                         with several other people. All watch 
                         him, terror written in their eyes.

                         where painter works. It opens and three 
                         people emerge. Two men and a girl. The 
                         girl is young and pretty. All three 
                         look dourful. The painter again has 
                         to wait for the door to shut before 
                         resuming his work. The two men exit. 
                         The girl suddenly stops.

                         ANN MITCHELL. She stands, thinking, 
                         and then suddenly, impulsively, wheels 
                         around. Camera pans with her as she 
                         returns to CONNELL's office door, flings 
                         it open and disappears. The painter 
                         remains poised with his brush, waiting 
                         for the door to swing back. There is 
                         a slight flash of resentment in his 
                         eyes.

                         of sandwiches and a glass of milk, half 
                         gone. Near him sits POP DWYER, another 
                         veteran newspaperman. ANN crosses to

                         finish this column.

                         Suddenly she stops pacing. Her eyes 
                         widen as a fiendish idea strikes her.

                         She flops down in front of her typewriter.

                         set.

                         dumbly at her.
                                      
                         Med. shot: ANN bangs away madly. Finally 
                         she finishes. She whips the sheet out

                         "Below is a letter which reached my 
                         desk this morning. It's a commentary 
                         on what we laughingly call the civilized 
                         world. 'Dear Miss Mitchell: Four years 
                         ago I was fired out of my job. Since 
                         then I haven't been able to get another 
                         one. At first I was sore at the state 
                         administration because it's on account 
                         of the slimy politics here we have all 
                         this unemployment. But in looking around, 
                         it seems the whole world's going to 
                         pot, so in protest I'm going to commit 
                         suicide by jumping off the City Hall 
                         roof!' Signed, A disgusted American

                         JOE pauses to absorb this.

                         JOE glances up toward ANN, in mild protest.

                         it?
                                      
                         Full shot: ANN has just about accumulated 
                         all her things. JOE stares at her, knowing 
                         it's a fake.

                         JOE shrugs, shakes his head, and exits. 
                         ANN stuffs her things under her arm 
                         and also goes.

                         gets another idea, picks up a book from 
                         a desk, and reaches back to heave it.

                         The painter lifts his head slowly, his 
                         wrath too great to find utterance.

                         a mother and two kids. What do you know 
                         about that?

                         feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So 
                         what does he do? He decides to commit 
                         suicide in protest against the state 
                         of civilization. He thinks of the river! 
                         But no, no, he has a better idea. The 
                         City Hall. Why? Because he wants to 
                         attract attention. He wants to get a 
                         few things off his chest, and that's

                         by John Doe." He protests against all 
                         the evils in the world; the greed, the 
                         lust, the hate, the fear, all of man's 
                         inhumanity to man.
                                      
                         Arguments will start. Should he commit 
                         suicide or should he not! People will 
                         write in pleading with him. But no!

                         Darling, there are so many complaining 
                         political speeches. People are tired 
                         of hearing nothing but doom and despair 
                         on the radio. If you're going to have 
                         him say anything, why don't you let 
                         him say something simple and real, something 
                         with hope in it? If your father were 
                         alive, he'd know what to say.

                         right. I'll be right over there pulling 
                         for you.
                                      
                         JOHN starts to follow ANN away from 
                         mike. ANN leads him back to mike again.

                         tries the door, to see that it opens 
                         readily. Standing near him is BEANY 
                         and the others.

                         up ready to give the signal. He listens 
                         a moment, then abruptly drops his hand.

                         This is Kenneth Frye, speaking for the 
                         New Bulletin . Tonight we give you something 
                         entirely new and different. Standing 
                         beside me is the young man who has declared 
                         publicly that on Christmas Eve he intends 
                         to commit suicide, giving as his reason혰quote: 
                         "I protest against the state of civilization." 
                         End quote. Ladies and gentlemen, the 
                         New Bulletin takes pleasure in presenting 
                         the man who is fast becoming the most 
                         talked-of person in the whole country, 
                         JOHN DOE!

                         is an outburst of music.

                         Med. shot: Group around BEANY. They 
                         all applaud, except for MIKE and the 
                         COLONEL. MIKE, with his hand hanging 
                         down, nudges the COLONEL.

                         we see the envelope change hands. Camera 
                         pans up to the COLONEL's face which 
                         is twisted into a miserable grimace.

                         uncertainly.
                                      
                         Close shot: Of MIKE and the COLONEL. 
                         MIKE elbows the COLONEL to throw his 
                         signal. The COLONEL looks toward JOHN 
                         and nods his head.
                                      
                         Close shot: Of JOHN. He catches the 
                         COLONEL'S signal and quickly his hand 
                         goes to his pocket. Just as he is about 
                         to bring it out, his hand pauses. He 
                         turns and looks at ANN.
                                      
                         Close-up: Of ANN. A warm, pleading look 
                         in her eyes.
                                      
                         Med. shot: Around JOHN. He is still 
                         staring at ANN, when the ANNOUNCER reaches 
                         over and nudges him혰pointing to the

                         in his pocket혰and starts reading ANN'S 
                         speech.

                         all know as John Doe.

                         the average man, and that's me.

                         Med. shot: The COLONEL and MIKE. The 
                         COLONEL realizes JOHN is not going to 
                         make SPENCER'S speech, and his face 
                         breaks into a broad grin. He takes MIKE'S 
                         hand and slaps the envelope into his 
                         palm. Over the shot we hear JOHN'S voice.

                         gonna jump off the City Hall roof at 
                         midnight on Christmas Eve. Now, I guess 
                         I'm not average any more. Now, I'm getting 
                         all sorts of attention, from big shots, 
                         too.

                         SPENCER stares at the envelope, frothing 
                         at the mouth.

                         Suddenly they are startled by SPENCER's 
                         voice.

                         a pack of lies you're telling!

                         I know a lot of you are saying to yourselves: 
                         "He's asking for a miracle to happen. 
                         He's expecting people to change all 
                         of a sudden." Well, you're wrong. It's 
                         no miracle. It's no miracle because 
                         I see it happen once every year. And 
                         so do you. At Christmas time! There's 
                         something swell about the spirit of 
                         Christmas, to see what it does to people, 
                         all kinds of people . . .

                         Now, why can't that spirit, that same 
                         warm Christmas spirit last the whole 
                         year round? Gosh, if it ever did, if 
                         each and every John Doe would make that 
                         spirit last three hundred and sixty-five 
                         days out of the year, we'd develop such 
                         a strength, we'd create such a tidal 
                         wave of good will, that no human force 
                         could stand against it.

                         inherit the earth when the John Does 
                         start loving their neighbors. You'd 
                         better start right now. Don't wait till 
                         the game is called on account of darkness! 
                         Wake up, John Doe! You're the hope of 
                         the world!

                         we heard your broadcast, and we got 
                         quite a bang out of it, especially my

                         Kept me up half the night saying "That 
                         man's right, honey. The trouble with 
                         the world is혰nobody gives a hoot about 
                         his neighbor. That's why everybody in 
                         town's sore and cranky at each other."
 
                                                              
                         And I kept saying, "Well, that's fine, 
                         but how's a guy gonna go around loving 
                         the kind of neighbors we got? Old Sourpuss 
                         for instance!"

                         You see, Sourpuss Smithers is a guy 
                         who lives all alone next door to us. 
                         He's a cranky old man and runs a second-hand 
                         furniture store. We haven't spoken to 
                         him for years. I always figured he was 
                         an ornery old gent that hated the world 
                         cause he was always slamming his garage 
                         door and playing the radio so loud he 
                         kept half the neighbors up.

                         Well, anyway, the next morning I'm out 
                         watering the lawn and I look over and 
                         there's Sourpuss on the other side of 
                         the hedge straightening out a dent in 
                         his fender and, er, my wife yells to 
                         me out of the window. She says, "Go 
                         on. Speak to him, Bert." And I figured, 
                         well, heck, I can't lose anything혰so 
                         I yelled over to him "Good morning, 
                         Mr. Smithers." He went right on pounding 
                         his fender, and was I burned! So I turned 
                         around to give my wife a dirty look 
                         and she said, "Louder, louder. He didn't 
                         hear you." So, in a voice you could 
                         of heard in the next county, I yelled. 
                         "Good morning, Mr. Smithers!"

                         Well, sir, you coulda knocked me over 
                         with a feather. Old Sourpuss turned 
                         around surprised like, and he put on 
                         a big smile, came over and took my hand 
                         like an old lodge brother, and he said. 
                         "Good morning, Hansen. I've been wanting 
                         to talk to you for years, only I thought 
                         you didn't like me." And then he started 
                         chatting away like a happy little kid, 
                         and he got so excited his eyes begin 
                         waterin' up.

                         Well, Mr. Doe, before we got through, 
                         I found out Smithers is a swell egg, 
                         only he's pretty deaf, and that accounts 
                         for all the noises.

                         And he says it's a shame how little 
                         we know about our neighbors, and then 
                         he got an idea, and he said, "How's 
                         about inviting everybody some place 
                         where we can all get together and know 
                         each other a little better?" Well, I'm 
                         feeling so good by this time, I'm ripe 
                         for anything.

                         inviting everybody to a meeting at the

                         is here, too.

                         He is as described, except when he smiles, 
                         his whole face warms up. Those around 
                         him push him forward. At first he looks 
                         bewildered, then, understanding, he 
                         starts toward BERT, grinning sheepishly.

                         This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, 
                         Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.

                         Th혰that's all right. If you didn't call 
                         me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.

                         Well, anyway, I혰I guess nearly everybody 
                         in the neighborhood came, except the 
                         DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big 
                         house with an iron fence around it and 
                         they always keep their blinds drawn, 
                         and we always figured that he was just 
                         an old miser that sat back counting 
                         his money, so why bother about inviting 
                         him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke 
                         up and he said, "Say, you've got the 
                         Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells

                         us about how they cancelled their milk 
                         last week, and how, when he found a 
                         note in the bottle he got kinda curious 
                         like and he sorta peeked in under the 
                         blinds and found the house empty. "If 
                         you ask me," he says, "they're starving."

                         Old man Delaney has been bringing his 
                         furniture over to my place at night, 
                         one piece at a time, and selling it.

                         Yeah. And, well, sir, a half a dozen 
                         of us ran over there to fetch them and 
                         we got them to the meeting. What a reception 
                         they got. Why, everybody shook hands 
                         with them and made a fuss over them, 
                         and, well, finally, Mr. and Mrs. Delaney 
                         just sat right down and cried.
                                      
                         He smiles, embarrassed, and JOHN, as 
                         well as the others, clear their throats.

                         And then we started to find out about 
                         a lot of other people.

                         instance.

                         Grubbel's here. See?

                         Yeah. That's혰that's him. Of course, 
                         you don't know Grubbel, but he's the 
                         man that everybody figured was the worst 
                         no-account in the neighborhood because 
                         he was living like a hermit and nobody'd 
                         have anything to do with him. Er, that 
                         is until Murphy, the postman told us 
                         the truth. "Why, Grubbel," he says, 
                         "he lives out of garbage cans because 
                         he won't take charity. Because it'd 
                         ruin his self-respect," he says.

                         together and gave Grubbel a job watering 
                         their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And 
                         then we found jobs for six other people 
                         and they've all gone off relief!

                         follow suit. They all shuffle silently 
                         out.

                         them leave. The old lady takes the old

                         in his throat. He watches the old people 
                         until they have left, then with a quick 
                         glance at his hand혰and self-consciously 
                         in front of the others, stuffs his hand 
                         into his pocket.
                                      
                         Full shot: As they all watch him, without 
                         speaking. JOHN runs his hand through 
                         his hair, stealing a fleeting glance 
                         at the others, and grins awkwardly.

                         remained, to leave.

                         thoughtful.

                         Full shot: JOHN still paces, disturbed 
                         by clashing emotions. He stops, glances 
                         at the door, a soft, thoughtful expression 
                         in his eyes. Then, as his thought shifts, 
                         he runs his left hand over his pitching 
                         arm.

                         He looks toward the door.

                         have to be a mighty fine example himself 
                         to go around telling other people how 
                         to혰Say, look, what happened the other 
                         night was on account of Miss Mitchell,

                         ANN walks over to JOHN.

                         looking up into his face.

                         this can be?

                         at JOHN, sees him weakening, and grimaces 
                         disgustedly.

                         You're hooked! I can see that right 
                         now.
                                      
                         They all look up, startled.

                         They got you. Well, I'm through.

                         get you up to the Columbia River country. 
                         First, it was your glass arm. Then it 
                         was the radio. And now it's the John

                         minute.
                                      
                         He opens the door and when he sees the 
                         townspeople still gathered outside, 
                         he yells to them.
                                      
                         COLONEL

                         He pushes his way out.

                         Hey, Colonel! Wait a minute!
                                     
                         He starts after the COLONEL, but when 
                         he gets to the door, the townspeople 
                         surge toward him and block his way.

                         He tries to peer over the heads of the 
                         townspeople who go on chattering. There 
                         is a trapped look on JOHN's face.

                         over the map, indicating where the clubs

                         thing has been nothing short of a prairie 
                         fire. We've received so many applications 
                         for charters to the John Doe Clubs we 
                         haven't been able to take care of them.

                         Why, over twentyfour hundred John Doe 
                         clubs are sending delegates. Can you 
                         imagine that? You, Mr. Mayor, will be 
                         the official host. You will make the 
                         arrangements for decorating the city, 
                         parades and a reception for John Doe

                         ready to be taken out. She stands near 
                         a desk stuffing papers into a manuscript 
                         case. She seems lost in worried thought. 
                         The door opens as CHARLIE, high pressure 
                         exploitation man, enters.

                         an hour. Is that Johnny-boy's room? 
                         I'd better hustle him up!

                         Did you see his picture on the cover 
                         of Time ?

                         CHARLIE drops the magazine on the desk 
                         in front of her. ANN glances at it, 
                         unenthusiastically. CHARLIE goes to 
                         a table where there are several bottles 
                         of coca-cola and starts to pour himself 
                         a drink.

                         I gotta give you credit, Annie-girl. 
                         I've handled a good many big promotions 
                         in my time . . . everything from the 
                         world's fair to a channel swimmer, but 
                         this one has certainly got me spinning. 
                         And now a John Doe Convention! Wow! 
                         Say! If you could only get him to jump 
                         off the City Hall roof on Christmas 
                         Eve, I'd guarantee you half a million 
                         people there.

                         ANN nods.

                         one, he's got great yokel appeal; but 
                         he's a nice guy. Number two, he's beginning 
                         to believe he really wrote that original 
                         suicide letter that you made up. Number 
                         three, he thinks that you're Joan of 
                         Arc or something!

                         Close-up: Of ANN. She is conscious of 
                         his eyes on her and fumbles with her 
                         packing. Finally she turns.
                                      
                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He stares at her, 
                         a warm smile on his face.
                                      
                         Close-up: Of ANN. She becomes self-conscious 
                         and resumes her packing.

                         JOHN
                                     
                         Do you care if I sit down out here?
 
                                                              
                         ANN
                                     
                         No.
                                     
                         A broad smile appears on JOHN'S face.
 
                                                              
                         JOHN
                                     
                         (laughing)
                                     
                         You know, I had a crazy dream last night. 
                         It was about you.

                         About me?
                                     
                         JOHN
                                     
                         (laughing)
                                     
                         Sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your 
                         father.
                                      
                         Close-up: Of ANN. The fact that he has 
                         seen himself in the image of her father 
                         disturbs her. She turns slowly.
                                      
                         Two shot: JOHN clears his throat nervously.
 
                                                              
                         JOHN
                                     
                         There was, there was something I was 
                         trying to stop you from doing. So, er, 
                         so I got up out of bed and I walked 
                         right through the wall here, right straight 
                         into your room.
                                      
                         (laughing)
                                     
                         You know how dreams are.
                                     
                         ANN stares at him혰fearful of the trend 
                         his dream is taking.

                         JOHN
                                     
                         And there you were in bed.
                                     
                         (quickly apologizing)
                                     
                         But you혰you were a little girl. You 
                         know혰about ten.
                                      
                         He pauses and recalls the scene.
                                     
                         JOHN
                                     
                         And very pretty, too. So, I shook you, 
                         and the moment you opened your eyes, 
                         you hopped out of bed and started running 
                         like the devil, in your nightgown.
 
                                                              
                         You ran right out the window there. 
                         And you ran out over the tops of buildings 
                         and roofs and everything for miles, 
                         and I was chasing you.
                                      
                         (laughing)
                                     
                         And all the time you were running you 
                         kept growing bigger and bigger and bigger혰and 
                         pretty soon you were as big as you are 
                         now. You know혰 grown up. And all the 
                         time I kept asking myself, "What am 
                         I chasing her for?" And I didn't know.

                         Isn't that a hot one? Well, anyway, 
                         you ran into some place, and then Iran 
                         in after you and혰and when I got there, 
                         there you were getting married.
                                      
                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He suddenly becomes 
                         aware he is treading on sensitive grounds.
 
                                                              
                         JOHN
                                     
                         (awkwardly)
                                     
                         And the nightgown had changed into a 
                         beautiful wedding gown. You sure looked 
                         pretty, too.

                         And then I knew what it was I was trying 
                         to stop you from doing.

                         his name? Mr. Norton's nephew.

                         I was the fella up there doing the marrying. 
                         You know, the Justice of the Peace or

                         me?
                                      
                         JOHN
                                     
                         Well, yes, I was. But I was your father 
                         then, see? But the real me, John Doe, 
                         er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I 
                         was the fellow up there with the book. 
                         You know what I mean?

                         I guess so. Then what happened?

                         Well, I took you across my knee and 
                         I started spanking you.
                                      
                         ANN turns and stares at him, eyes widening.

                         That is, I didn't do it.
                                     
                         (correcting himself)
                                     
                         I mean, I did do it, but it wasn't me. 
                         You see, I was your father then. Well, 
                         I laid you across my knee and I said: 
                         "Annie, I won't allow you to marry a 
                         man that's, that's just rich, or that 
                         has his secretary send you flowers. 
                         The man you marry has got to swim rivers 
                         for you! He's got to climb high mountains 
                         for you! He's got to slay dragons for 
                         you! He's got to perform wonderful deeds 
                         for you! Yes, sir!"
                                      
                         BEANY enters and stands back of him, 
                         listening.
                                      
                         JOHN
                                     
                         And all the time, er, the guy up there, 
                         you know, with the book, me, just stood 
                         there nodding his head and he said, 
                         "Go to it, Pop, whack her one for me, 
                         because that's just the way I feel about 
                         it, too."
                                      
                         So he says, "Come on down here and whack 
                         her yourself." So I came down and I 
                         whacked you a good one, see? And then 
                         he whacked one혰and I whacked you another 
                         one, and we both started whacking you 
                         like . . .
                                      
                         ? 653 ?
                                     
                         He demonstrates by slapping his knees, 
                         first with one hand and then with the 
                         other. Suddenly he becomes aware of 
                         BEANY and stops, embarrassed.
                                      
                         BEANY
                                     
                         (interrupting)
                                     
                         Well, if you're through whacking her, 
                         come on, let's get going.
                                      
                         (to bell boys)
                                     
                         Okay, fellows, right in here.

                         You go out the side entrance. There's 
                         a bunch of autograph seekers out front. 
                         We'll be down with the bags in a minute. 
                         Come on!
                                      
                         (speaking to boys)
                                     
                         Don't make a government project out 
                         of this!
                                      
                         The bell boys have lifted her luggage 
                         and all exit.

                         airport lunchroom to end of counter 
                         at which CHARLIE is seated.

                         Camera moves down counter to pick up 
                         JOHN and ANN at table. They sit silently 
                         for a moment. We hear the strains of 
                         music from a "juke" box.
                                      
                         JOHN
                                     
                         (after a pause)
                                     
                         How many people do you think we've talked 
                         to already, outside the radio, I mean?
 
                                                              
                         ANN
                                     
                         I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
 
                                                              
                         JOHN
                                     
                         Three hundred thousand? What makes them 
                         do it, Ann? What makes them come and 
                         listen and, and get up their John Doe 
                         Clubs the way they do? I've been trying 
                         to figure it out.

                         (in an effort to disillusion him)
                                     
                         Look, John혰what we're handing them are 
                         platitudes. Things they've heard a million 
                         times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds 
                         have silver linings," "Turn the other 
                         cheek." It's just a혰

                         Yeah, I've heard them a million times, 
                         too, but혰there you are. Maybe they're 
                         like me. Just beginning to get an idea 
                         what those things mean.
                                      
                         ANN is deeply concerned. She watches 
                         him, helplessly.
                                      
                         JOHN
                                     
                         (continuing)
                                     
                         You know, I never thought much about 
                         people before. They were always just 
                         somebody to fill up the bleachers. The 
                         only time I worried about them was if 
                         they혰is when they didn't come in to 
                         see me pitch. You know, lately I've 
                         been watching them while I talked to 
                         them. I could see something in their 
                         faces. I could feel that they were hungry 
                         for something. Do you know what I mean?
 
                                                              
                         ANN nods.
                                     
                         JOHN
                                     
                         Maybe that's why they came. Maybe they 
                         were just lonely and wanted somebody 
                         to say hello to. I know how they feel. 
                         I've been lonely and hungry for something 
                         practically all my life.
                                      
                         ANN forces a smile. The moment threatens 
                         to become awkward혰until they are saved 
                         by the pilot's voice.

                         They suddenly snap out of their mood혰and 
                         as they rise:
                                      
                         Fade out.

                         over the back of the chair.

                         Camera pans back to ANN. She glances

                         Say, he's a nice man, isn't he? Mr. 
                         Norton, I mean. He's, er, he's done

                         Say, my coat's pretty wet. I'm afraid 
                         I might have wet the couch a little.
 
                                                              
                         Wider shot: JOHN is still struggling 
                         to find conversation.

                         Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention 
                         later.

                         Yes, of course. I'll see that she gets 
                         the flowers.
                                      
                         He rises and looks around for hat on 
                         the floor and back of the chair.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He starts away and 
                         suddenly stops, speculatively. He glances 
                         out of the corner of his eye toward 
                         MRS. MITCHELL.

                         Say, Mrs. Mitchell, I, er, I'm kinda 
                         glad Ann isn't here. You see, I was, 
                         I came over here hoping to see her alone 
                         and kinda hoping I wouldn't, too. You 
                         know what I mean? There was something 
                         I wanted to talk to her about. But, 
                         well, I혰It'll wait, I guess. Good night.

                         to sense what is on his mind, and her 
                         face becomes serious.

                         Say, look, Mrs. Mitchell, have you ever 
                         been married?

                         Oh, sure you have.

                         Gosh! That's pretty silly! I guess you 
                         must think I'm kinda batty!
                                      
                         JOHN shakes his head at his own stupidity.

                         Well, I guess I'd better be going at

                         He bows again, and starts for the door. 
                         When he gets there, he is stopped by

                         JOHN comes right back to her.

                         Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It 
                         was easy as all that, huh?

                         Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, 
                         you know I love Ann and it's gonna be 
                         awfully hard for me to say it because, 
                         well, you know, she's so wonderful, 
                         and, well, the best I ever was was a 
                         bush-league pitcher.

                         And you know, I think she's in love 
                         with another man, the one she made up. 
                         You know, the real John Doe. Well, that's 
                         pretty tough competition.

                         sympathetic.
                                      
                         JOHN
                                     
                         I bet you he'd know how to say it all 
                         right. And me, I get up to it and around 
                         it and in back of it, but, but I never 
                         get right to it. Do you know what I 
                         mean? So the only chance I've got is, 
                         well, if somebody could kinda give her 
                         a warning sort of, sorta prepare her 
                         for the shock!

                         voice from off-scene stops him.

                         has just driven in. CONNELL hands the 
                         driver a bill and walks, rather unsteadily 
                         toward JOHN.

                         John, I want to have a little talk with 
                         you.

                         CONNELL
                                     
                         Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.

                         Say, tell me something did you read 
                         that speech you're gonna make tonight?
 
                                                              
                         JOHN
                                     
                         No, I never read the speeches before 
                         I make them. I get more of a kick out 
                         of it that way.
                                      
                         CONNELL

                         Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. 
                         Beany, go on down to the office, tell 
                         Pop to give you the speech. There's 
                         a copy on my desk.
                                      
                         BEANY

                         Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton 
                         told me not to leave him, not even for 
                         a minute.

                         Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at

                         He points in the general direction and 
                         again takes JOHN's arm. JOHN watches 
                         him, rather amused to see CONNELL off 
                         his milk diet, and allows himself to 
                         be led away.

                         In a corner booth, JOHN and CONNELL 
                         sit, close together, drinks in front 
                         of them. JOHN's drink has remained untouched. 
                         CONNELL is just taking a long swig. 
                         From off-scene we hear the strains of 
                         an old-fashioned torch ballad, coming 
                         from an automatic piano.

                         (after a pause)
                                     
                         You're a nice guy, John. I like you. 
                         You're gentle. I like gentle people. 
                         Me? I'm hard혰hard and tough.

                         I got no use for hard people. Gotta 
                         be gentle to suit me. Like you, for 
                         instance.

                         JOHN smiles, amused at him. CONNELL 
                         starts to light his cigarette, which 
                         is bent. He hold the match up, but it 
                         never reaches the tip of the bent cigarette. 
                         He puffs, satisfied.
                                      
                         CONNELL
                                     
                         Yep, I'm hard. But you want to know 
                         something? I've got a weakness. You'd 
                         never guess that, would you? Well, I 
                         have. Want to know what it is?
                                      
                         JOHN nods.

                         Well, maybe it is. But play the "Star

                         JOHN smiles at him. CONNELL tries lighting

                         JOHN starts to answer, but CONNELL goes 
                         right on.

                         He pours JOHN's drink into his own glass.

                         That's a kick for you. We were in the 
                         same outfit. Funny, huh?

                         to his lips, and without drinking, lowers 
                         it.

                         Close-up: Of JOHN. His face enveloped 
                         in an expression of sympathy.
                                      
                         Two shot: CONNELL stares down at the 
                         glass which he revolves between his 
                         palms.

                         I saw him get it. I was right there 
                         and saw it with my own eyes.
                                      
                         Without glancing at JOHN, he lifts the 
                         glass and drains it.

                         As he holds up his glass, he realizes 
                         it is empty.

                         It's a beautiful miracle. A miracle 
                         that could only happen right here in 
                         the good old U.S.A. And I think it's 
                         terrific! What do you think of that! 
                         Me! Hard-boiled Connell! I think it's 
                         plenty terrific!

                         All right! Now, supposing a certain 
                         unmentionable worm, whose initials are 
                         D. B., was trying to use that to shove 
                         his way into the White House. So he 
                         could put the screws on, so he could 
                         turn out the lights in those lighthouses. 
                         What would you say about that? Huh?

                         Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. 
                         They can't use the John Doe Clubs for 
                         politics. That's the main idea.

                         Is that so? Then what's a big political 
                         boss like Hammett doing in town? And 
                         a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot 
                         of other big shots who are up at D. 
                         B.'s house right now? Wolves, John,

                         JOHN strides toward the dining room. 
                         Camera pans with JOHN, who is dripping 
                         wet, as he crosses the foyer until he 
                         comes within sight of the open door 
                         of the dining room. JOHN stops.

                         Well, gentlemen, I think we're about

                         Even a conservative estimate shows that 
                         we can count on anywhere between ten 
                         and twenty million John Doe votes. Now, 
                         add to that the labor vote that Mr. 
                         Bennett will throw in . . .

                         D. B.
                                     
                         Is there anything wrong?
                                     
                         JOHN

                         Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's 
                         fine! So there's gonna be a new order 
                         of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut 
                         himself a nice, fat slice of the John 
                         Does, eh?
                                      
                         (turns toward D. B.)
                                     
                         You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shot혰you 
                         forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. 
                         Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's 
                         gonna use the John Doe clubs for his 
                         own rotten purpose, he's gonna have 
                         to do it over my dead body!

                         Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold 
                         on! That's rather big talk! I started 
                         the John Doe clubs with my money and 
                         I'll decide whether or not they're being 
                         properly used!

                         No you won't! You're through deciding 
                         anything!
                                      
                         D. B. cannot believe his ears.

                         to cook up for them!

                         He flings the torn paper toward ANN혰and 
                         starts out.

                         D. B. walks up to JOHN.

                         Listen to me, my son! Before you lose 
                         your head completely, may I remind you 
                         that I picked you up out of the gutter 
                         and I can throw you right back there 
                         again! You've got a nerve accusing people 
                         of things! These gentlemen and I know 
                         what's the best for the John Does of 
                         America, regardless of what tramps like 
                         you think!
                                      
                         Get off that righteous horse of yours 
                         and come to your senses. You're the 
                         fake! We believe in what we're doing! 
                         You're the one that was paid the thirty 
                         pieces of silver! Have you forgotten 
                         that? Well, I haven't!
                                      
                         You're a fake, John Doe, and I can prove 
                         it! You're the big hero that's supposed 
                         to jump off tall buildings and things! 
                         Do you remember? What do you suppose 
                         your precious John Does will say when 
                         they find out that you never had any 
                         intention of doing it? That you were 
                         being paid to say so? You're lucky if 
                         they don't run you out of the country!
 
                                                              
                         Why, with the newspapers and the radio 
                         stations that these gentlemen control, 
                         we can kill the John Doe movement deader 
                         than a doornail, and we'll do it, too, 
                         the moment you step out of line! Now, 
                         if you still want to go to that convention 
                         and shoot your trap off, you go ahead 
                         and do it!

                         Do you mean to tell me you'd try to 
                         kill the John Doe movement if you can't 
                         use it to get what you want?

                         idea that's made millions of people 
                         a little bit happier! An idea that's 
                         brought thousands of them here from 
                         all over the country, by bus and by 
                         freight, in jallopies and on foot혰so 
                         they could pass on to each other their 
                         own simple little experiences.

                         it. But I'm beginning to understand 
                         a lot of things. Why, your type's old 
                         as history. If you can't lay your dirty 
                         fingers on a decent idea and twist it 
                         and squeeze it and stuff it into your 
                         own pocket, you slap it down! Like dogs, 
                         if you can't eat something, you bury 
                         it!

                         Why, this is the one worthwhile thing 
                         that's come along. People are finally 
                         finding out that the guy next door isn't 
                         a bad egg. That's simple, isn't it? 
                         And yet a thing like that's got a chance 
                         of spreading till it touches every last 
                         doggone human being in the world혰and 
                         you talk about killing it!

                         Why, when this fire dies down, what's 
                         going to be left? More misery, more 
                         hunger and more hate. And what's to 
                         prevent that from starting all over 
                         again? Nobody knows the answer to that 
                         one, and certainly not you, with those 
                         slimy, bolloxed-up theories you've got! 
                         The John Doe idea may be the answer, 
                         though! It may be the one thing capable 
                         of saving this cockeyed world! Yet you 
                         sit back there on your fat hulks and 
                         tell me you'll kill it if you can't 
                         use it!

                         with a suddenness that startles TED, 
                         he steps aside and clips TED on the 
                         jaw. TED's knees buckle and he goes 
                         down. JOHN exits.

                         Ladies and gentlemen! This is exactly 
                         what I came down here to tell you about 
                         tonight. Please, if you'll all just 
                         be quiet for a few minutes I can explain 
                         this whole thing to you. As you all 
                         know, this paper is published by a man 
                         by the name of D. B. Norton . . .

                         Down an aisle stalks D. B., his hand 
                         waving in the air.

                         toward him.

                         runs up the few steps and proceeds to 
                         the microphone, troopers clearing the 
                         way for him.

                         My name is D. B. Norton . . . you all 
                         know me! I accuse this man of being 
                         a faker! We've been taken for a lot 
                         of suckers! And I'm the biggest of the 
                         lot!

                         I spent a fortune backing this man in 
                         what I believed to be a sincere and 
                         worthy cause, just as you all did! And 
                         now I find out it's nothing but a cheap 
                         racket! Cooked up by him and two of 
                         my employees for the sole purpose of 
                         collecting dues from John Does all over 
                         the country!
                                      
                         JOHN breaks away from the troopers and 
                         gets to the mike.

                         stuff into their own pockets! You can 
                         read all about it in the newspapers 
                         there!

                         he says . . .

                         Let go of me! This man had no intention 
                         of jumping off of the top of a building! 
                         He was paid to say so!
                                      
                         (turning to John)
                                     
                         Do you deny that?
                                     
                         JOHN
                                     
                         That's got nothing to do with it!
                                     
                         D. B.

                         And what about the suicide note? You 
                         didn't write that, either!
                                      
                         JOHN
                                     
                         What difference does that make?
                                     
                         D. B.

                         Ah, you bet your life you didn't! You 
                         look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, 
                         and you'll find Miss Mitchell's signed 
                         confession that she was the one that 
                         wrote it!

                         Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't 
                         write the letter, but this whole thing

                         a fake, John Doe! And for what you've 
                         done to all these good people혰they ought 
                         to run you out of the country혰and I

                         at JOHN, silent and stunned, waiting 
                         for him to speak.
                                      
                         Full shot: The whole park full of people 
                         wait in breathless anticipation. From 
                         somewhere in the distance we hear a 
                         single voice of a man.

                         several of D. B.'s troopers pulling 
                         at the cables of the public address 
                         system.

                         Please listen, folks! Now that he's 
                         through shooting off his face, I've 
                         got a couple of things to tell you about혰

                         of the troopers disconnects the public 
                         address system by cutting the cable.

                         speaker is dead, and looks around helplessly.

                         the tomato flies in and strikes him 
                         on the forehead. It seems to stun him. 
                         He remains motionless, staring before 
                         him with sightless eyes. The red smear 
                         of the tomato trickles down his face.

                         violently aside, trying to reach JOHN.

                         up at his face, starts to lead him off 
                         the platform. A squadron of policemen 
                         also rush to his rescue and precede

                         figure of D. B., as he stands near a 
                         window staring out, meditatively. The 
                         voices of the children singing Christmas 
                         carols are faintly heard.

                         and glances at it. Then, as if annoyed 
                         by his own apprehension, he shoves it 
                         violently back into his pocket.

                         takes a cigar and shoves it into his 
                         mouth. Just as he is about to light 
                         it, he becomes aware of the signing, 
                         and cocks his head, listening.

                         I've taken care of that. I've already 
                         mailed a copy of this letter to Mr. 
                         Connell.

                         He steps forward as he speaks.

                         me.

                         I'm glad you gentlemen are here. You've 
                         killed the John Doe movement, all right, 
                         but you're going to see it born all 
                         over again. Now, take a good look, Mr.

                         She rushes and throws her arms around

                         down at her, blankly. ANN clutches him, 
                         her head buried in his shoulder.

                         Close shot: JOHN and ANN. She emits 
                         wracking sobs, then lifts her eyes up 
                         to him.

                         John. Please, John, listen to me. We'll 
                         start all over again, just you and I. 
                         It isn't too late. The John Doe movement 
                         isn't dead yet.
                                      
                         Suddenly she becomes conscious of the 
                         others present, and she turns her head.
 
                                                              
                         Camera pans over to what she sees. The 
                         group of men watching, silently.
                                      
                         Camera pans back to ANN. Her eyes widen 
                         slowly. She looks from them to JOHN 
                         and back again, and her face takes on 
                         an excited, breathless look, as the 
                         reason for their being there becomes 
                         comprehensible to her.

                         See, John! It isn't dead, or they wouldn't 
                         be here! It's alive in them . They kept 
                         it alive. By being afraid of it. That's 
                         why they came up here.

                         to stand with his hands at his sides, 
                         looking at her, while she clings to 
                         him desperately. While she speaks, he 
                         turns his face from her and stares at 
                         the men.

                         Oh, darling. Sure, it should have been 
                         killed before. It was dishonest.
                                      
                         Close-up: Of JOHN. He is staring strangely 
                         at the group of men혰as slowly, gradually, 
                         the curtain is being lifted from his 
                         clouded brain.

                         But we can start clean now. Just you 
                         and I. It'll grow again, John. It'll 
                         grow big. And it'll be strong, because 
                         it'll be honest!
                                      
                         Close-up: Of ANN. Her strength is fast 
                         ebbing away. She clings to JOHN more 
                         tenaciously.

                         Oh, darling, if it's worth dying for, 
                         it's worth living for. Oh, please, John

                         She looks up at his face, seeking some

                         none.

                         to her. Her eyes light up with a wide,

                         begins to soften.
