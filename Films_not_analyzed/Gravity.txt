          Like all images of Earth seen from space, this image of our
          planet is mythical and majestic.
                         
          The globe seems almost tangible, slowly spinning, floating in
          the endless void of space. It is a blue planet, and bright white
          clouds twirl and stretch in capricious patterns across the deep
          blue of the oceans and the jigsaw of continents: green, yellow
          and brown.

          The sphere is almost a perfect orb except for the darkened
          sliver on its Eastern edge.
          It is beautiful! And so full of life.
                         
          But not here.
                         
          Here it is completely silent.

          IN THE DISTANCE-
                         
          A small metal object crosses the empty space surrounding Earth.
          If it appears to be a small satellite that is only because it is
          far away from us. It is the size of one football field. It is-
                         
          The INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS).
                         
          It resembles a dragonfly. Its solar panels stretch out, like
          wings, from the long body made of connected pressurized modules.
                         
          It floats with a sense of proud achievement.
                         
          It orbits at an altitude of 500 km above sea level. It moves at
          an average of 27,700 kilometers per hour, completing 15.7 laps
          around the Earth per day.
                         
          It is cruising over Zimbabwe. To the East, the island of
          Madagascar. Up to the North, the expansive dry lands of Somalia
          and Ethiopia.
                         
          Soon, the ISS curves around the spherical planet, and it becomes
          smaller, almost indistinguishable, no more than a small bright
          spec grazing over the blue atmosphere.

          Ryan is paralyzed, holding onto Matt tightly and looking at him
          in fright. He stares back.

          He runs the other end of the tether to the harness on Ryan's
          suit and attaches it.

          Matt ignites the thrusters, tugging Ryan behind him. But this
          proves a difficult endeavor as her momentum drags him, changing
          his direction.

          Matt ignites a new thrust to re-direct his position. As he does
          so Ryan's change of momentum makes him swing again.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           Better. Let's get out of here.
          Using his thrusters, Matt negotiates a new position and,
          igniting a long thrust, he jets away.
                         
          Ryan cannot repress the anger boiling up, and SHE SCREAMS-

          bodies pulls him in all directions.

          Tentatively Ryan extends her right hand to grab onto Shariff's
          body harness. And she sees-
                         
          Shariff's broken helmet. A hole the size of a soft ball pierces
          through it and has left a tunnel of frozen dried bloody mess.
          Ryan's face is inscrutable. Finally she looks away, but this
          time something arrests her gaze:
                         
          A LAMINATED PHOTOGRAPH floats next to Shariff, tethered to his
          suit via a small chain. In it, a YOUNG BOY LAUGHS with abandon,
          happy in the embrace of a man unseen save for his TWO STRONG
          ARMS. Transfixed, Ryan is unable to look away, something
          complicated confusing her eyes.

          At the mercy of Matt's momentum, Ryan hits hard against the nose

          At the end of the cabin, among the floating objects, a lifeless

          Explorer but is suddenly stopped by the safety tether.
                         
          Matt ignites his propellers and, giving a couple of small

          Matt gives Ryan a gentle push, waiting until the tether goes
          taut, and-
                         
          He gives a SMALL THRUST to position himself in the right
          direction.
                         
          He holds this SINGLE THRUST for longer than all of the previous

          THE SPACE STATION-

           evacuated because first Soyuz is

           Earth is impossible.
                         
          The surface of a module is badly scratched and some solar panels
          have been ripped.
                         
          THE SECOND SOYUZ becomes visible, attached to the Station's
          Docking Module. A piece of red and white fabric floats around
          the spherical capsule.

           Sip, Ryan. Sip. Drifting is good. We
           want to drift. I wasn't kidding about
           those fumes. This can has one or two
           good thrusts left. If we're lucky....
                         
          They approach the Space Station, which is just ahead of them and
          a hundred meters below.

           ...fire.
                         
          Matt triggers his THRUSTER, turning sharply. Ryan's trajectory
          carries her in a straight line, until the tether tenses,
          breaking Matt's direction.
          He fires again to counter her momentum.
                         
          A VERY LONG THRUST sends both of them in the right direction,
          straight down toward the Station, but at great speed.
                         
          The Station is getting very close, and they're going very fast.
                         
          Matt ignites the FRONTAL THRUSTER, which begins to slow him
          down, but the thrust stops.
                         
          Ryan, following her own momentum, begins to pass Matt.

           onto anything you can and hold tight!
                         
          Just then Ryan CRASHES against the SOLAR PANEL, but is unable to
          grab hold. As she tumbles past, the body of the Station looms.
                         
          Matt misses the solar panels, and COLLIDES against the Station.
          As he begins to drift past, he reaches out and snares a railing.
                         
          Ryan passes flying above him. The tether tenses, pulling Matt.
          The momentum is to great and he LETS GO of the railing.
                         
          Ryan floats over the roof of the Space Station, trying to grab
          hold of the handles and rods that stick out of the modules, but
          she's floating too high.
                         
          She's quickly reaching the end of the Station, there is only one
          handle left ahead, her last chance before floating away into the
          black void.
                         
          She extends her arm and GRABS the handle tightly for dear life

          Matt is floating straight toward her and-
          He COLLIDES against her. For a moment they are face to face,
          only the glass of their headgear separates their faces.
                         
          But she loses her grip on the handle and the impact projects her
          into the emptiness.
                         
          Her drifting is intercepted by a Solar Panel. She crashes
          against it, shattering it, as Matt rolls above it.
                         
          Ryan bounces down towards the Earth, tensing the tether, pulling
          Matt, making him descend over the other side of the panel.
                         
          The sharp edges of the broken panels cut the tether in two.

          alarm ringing out across the Station.

          relieved and exhausted. The hum of the Space Station surrounds
          her.
                         
          Then, slowly, she pulls her knees to her chest and enfolds them

          For a moment, Ryan simply hangs in suspension, a fly in amber,
          surrendering to the poetry of the planets, rotating slowly in
          the cabin's womb.

          The Station looks frail and secluded, lost somewhere between the

          She places the tool once more against the bolt and pulls the
          trigger. The drill rotates, SLOWER this time.

          Ryan begins to HOWL, giving in to the mad joy of it all.
          Moments later, through the RADIO, she is joined by a CHORUS of
          CANINES--Aningang's DOGS--TUNING INTO HER VOICE in a mad, crazy
          harmonic cacophony. Ryan smiles, blissfully happy, howling with
          abandon.
                         
          Each howling reaches deeper and is more cathartic, unlocking

          TEARS ROLL FROM HER EYES, clear as crystals, spilling from her

          They float away, like tiny satellites orbiting her face.
                         
          Aningang can be heard intermittently, YELLING, as if trying to
          silence the dogs. Then the dogs, one by one, cease their wailing
          and Ryan is left with nothing but her own voice.
                         
          She stops, gazing at her tears suspended in the gloomy blue
          light.

           Well landing is launching it's the
           same thing, didn't you learn about
           that in training?
                         
                          RYAN
           I never got to land the simulator, I
           told you.
                         
                          MATT

                          RYAN
           And I crashed it every time.
                         
          Ryan is falling asleep. Matt studies her as she dozes off.
                         
                          MATT
           Listen you want to go back or do you
           want to stay here? I get it, it's nice
           up here, you can just shut down all
           the systems turn out all the lights,
           and just close your eyes and tune out
           everybody.
                         
          Matt starts flipping through buttons on the console, turning the
          cabin lights off.
                         
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           There's nobody up here who can hurt
           you, it's safe. Then what's the point
           in going on, what's the point of
           living?
                         
          When the cabin is in darkness, he turns and looks at Ryan.
                          MATT (CONT'D)
           Your kid died, doesn't get any rougher
           than that, but still it's a
           matter of what you do now. If you
           decide to go that you've gotta just
           get on with it, sit back enjoy the
           ride. You have to start living life,
           Ryan.
                         
          Ryan is having trouble keeping her eyes open.
                         
                          RYAN

                          MATT
           Ryan, you have to learn to let go ...
           Hey?
                         
          Ryan is almost sound asleep.

           What?
                         
          Ryan is asleep.
                         
                          MATT
           It's time to go home.
                         
          Her eyes snap open.
                         
          Her gaze shifts. The flask is floating in front of her. But no
          Matt. She turns. THE CABIN IS EMPTY. She turns back.
                         
          CLICK CLICK CLICK.
                         
          Ryan notices that the gate of the ventilation duct is shaking,
          making a percussive sound.
                         
          A SOFT COOL LIGHT shines in through the condensation that has
          frozen on the glass. It is-
                         
          THE MOONLIGHT caressing Ryan's face.

           Landing, landing. Landing is
           launching.
                         
          With a new surge of determination she TURNS ON THE CABIN LIGHT.
                         
          She pulls the HELMET floating above her and puts it on.
                         
          She connects the umbilical to her suit, opens the Oxygen Valve,
          and begins to breath.
          As the Oxygen flows back into her brain a new surge of
          determination brightens her face.
                         
          She opens the valves of the other two umbilicals, allowing
          Oxygen to flow, pressurizing the cabin.
                         
          She grabs the MANUAL.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Okay, landing, landing, landing is
           green.
                         
          She opens the green binder and browses through its index.
                         
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           Okay, okay landing, alright.
                         
          She stops, turns some pages and stares closely at the manual.
                         
          Ryan notices the Energy Bar floating by her. She grabs it and as
          she opens the wrapper, she stares intently at one page of the
          MANUAL, where there is-
                         
                         A DIAGRAM-
                         
          An ILLUSTRATION of the Soyuz Capsule two meters before landing

           rid of the BO and Engine module, okay?
                         
          She puts on the communication headset.

           Listen to me Matt. You're going to see
           a girl with brown hair. She's Sarah,
           her hair is probably a mess. That's
           okay, she doesn't like to brush it.
                         
          She looks out of the porthole, down at Earth.

           tell her it was right under the bed.
                         
          She turns back to the console and places her finger over one of
          the buttons.
                          RYAN (CONT'D)
           You give her a big hug and a kiss for

           makes me so proud, so so so proud, and
           that I promise I'll try and make her
           proud too. You tell her that I'm not
           quitting, that I'm going to keep

          Using the manual as a reference, Ryan uses the cursors to select
          the ALTITUDE DISPLAY on the computer screen.
                         
          The current ALTITUDE is- 2600 M.

          A PARACHUTE RELEASES.
                         
          The long fabric comes out and EXPANDS as the air fills the red
          and white canopy. When it's fully open it SLOWS DOWN the cabin's
          descent and lets it glide in a diagonal path over the Earth.

          A SECOND PARACHUTE expands.
                         
          It slows the fall even further, shifting the cabin into a more
          vertical descent toward the ground that is so close it now seems
          tangible.

          thirty kilometers per hour.

          But she cannot celebrate because she can't stop coughing. She is
          asphyxiating in the thick cloud of smoke.
                         
          She UNSTRAPS herself and-

          ON THE LAKE.
                         
          With a small controlled explosion, the hatch cover is launched
          away from the cabin.

          WATER POURS IN through the open hatch.
                         
          She tries to make her way out, fighting against the strong
          current that is gushing in, but the flow is too strong and-
                         
          IT PUSHES HER BACK IN.
                         
          She struggles to force her way through the cascade rapidly
          filling the cabin, but it is too strong.
                         
          THE CABIN IS OVERFLOWING.

          small bubbles float up.
                         
          Ryan fights her way to the hatch, and pulling with her good arm,

          Ryan struggles to SWIM UP to the surface, but she can only use
          one arm and the wet suit is DRAGGING HER DOWN.
                         
          She strokes rapidly, but she isn't moving up. Instead-
                         
          SHE'S GOING DOWN, and
                         
          HER FEET SINK INTO THE LAKE BED.

          The rays of sunlight breaking through the lake's surface are
          eclipsed by the parachute, which floats down toward her like a
          huge jellyfish about to engulf its pray.
                         
          THE FROG crosses in front of her, effortlessly swimming on its
          way to the surface.
                         
          Small bubbles of air come out of Ryan's nose as she struggles to
          open her suit.
                         
          She takes off the BOTTOM PART of the suit.

          from under it-
                         
          She frees herself from the heavy garments and SWIMS UP as-

          of breath, only the tiniest bubbles rise from her nose.
                         
          She is about to lose consciousness, when she sees-

          She only has enough strength to keep her face above water. She
          FLOATS, catching her breath and taking long gulps of air.
