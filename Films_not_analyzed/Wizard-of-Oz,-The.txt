                       UNCLE HENRY
             Don't bother us now, honey -- this old
             incubator's gone bad, and we're likely to
             lose a lot of our chicks.

                       DOROTHY
             Oh -- oh, the poor little things. Oh,
             but Aunt Em, Miss Gulch hit Toto right
             over the back with a rake just because
             she says he gets in her garden and chases
             her nasty old cat every day.

                          AUNT EM
             Seventy --     Dorothy, please!

                       DOROTHY
             Oh, but he doesn't do it every day --
             just once or twice a week. And he can't
             catch her old cat, anyway. And now she
             says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --

                          AUNT EM
             Dorothy!     Dorothy!   We're busy!

                       DOROTHY
             Oh -- all right.

MCS - Aunt Em and Uncle Henry taking chicks out of incubator -

                       UNCLE HENRY
             Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch
             troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know,
             she ought to have somebody to play with.

                       AUNT EM
             I know, but we all got to work out our
             own problems, Henry.

                          UNCLE HENRY
             Yes.

                       AUNT EM
             Oh, I hope we got them in time.

          Okay.

                    HICKORY
          There you are.

                    HUNK
          Right on my finger!

                    ZEKE
          It's a lucky thing it wasn't your head.

                    DOROTHY
          Zeke, what am I going to do about Miss
          Gulch? Just because Toto chases her old
          cat --

                    ZEKE
          Listen, honey, I got them hogs to get in.

                    HUNK
          Now lookit, Dorothy, you ain't using your
          head about Miss Gulch. Think you didn't
          have any brains at all.

                    DOROTHY
          I have so got brains.

                    HUNK
          Well, why don't you use them? When you
          come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's
          place. Then Toto won't get in her
          garden, and you won't get in no trouble.
          See?

                    DOROTHY
          Oh, Hunk, you just won't listen, that's
          all.

                    HUNK
          Well, your head ain't made of straw, you
          know.

          Oh! Oh, it feels like my joints are
          rusted. Listen, Dorothy, don't let Hunk
          kid you about Miss Gulch. She's just a
          poor sour-faced old maid that -- she
          ain't got no heart left. You know, you
          should have a little more heart yourself,
          and have pity on her.

                    DOROTHY
          Well, gee, I try and have a heart.

                    HICKORY
          Now look, here's something that really
          has a heart. This is the best invention I
          ever invented.

                    DOROTHY
          This?

                    HICKORY
          Sure. It's to break up winds, so we don't
          have no more dust storms. Can you imagine
          what it'll mean to this section of the
          country? I'll show you. It works
          perfectly now. Here's the principle. You
          see that fan -- that sends up air
          currents into the sky. These air currents
          -- Oh, stop it!

                    DOROTHY
          Oh!

          Hickory!

                    HICKORY

          going to let that old Gulch heifer try
          and buffalo you?

MCS -- Zeke poring feed into trough -- speaks --

                    ZEKE (CONT'D)

MLS -- Dorothy walking along railing between pig pens --

trough --

                    ZEKE
          Then the next time she squawks, walk
          right up to her and spit in her eye.
          That's what I'd do!

pig pen --

          Please, Aunt Em, Toto didn't mean to. He
          didn't know he was doing anything wrong.
          I'm the one that ought to be punished. I
          let him go in her garden. You can send
          me to bed without supper --

                    MISS GULCH
          If you don't hand over that dog, I'll
          bring a damage suit that'll take your
          whole farm! There's a law protecting
          folks against dogs that bite!

                    AUNT EM
          How would it be if she keeps him tied up?
          He's really gentle -- with gentle people,
          that is.

                    MISS GULCH
          Well, that's for the Sheriff to decide.
          Here's his order allowing me to take him.
          Unless you want to go against the law.

          Now, we can't go against the law,
          Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have
          to go.

                    MISS GULCH
          Now you're seeing reason.

          No --

          can't attack me again.

                    DOROTHY
          Oh, no, no! I won't let you take him!

          the Wicked Witch of the West. The sooner
          you get out of Oz altogether, the safer

                    TIN MAN
          My mouth -- my mouth!

                    SCARECROW

          Oh -- well, about a year ago -- I was
          chopping that tree -- minding my own
          business -- when suddenly it started to
          rain....

MCS -- Scarecrow and Dorothy listen to the Tin Man -- he
grows weak -- they work his arms back and forth -- Scarecrow
oils his neck for him -- Dorothy raps on the Tin Man's chest -
- they react -- Tin Man explains, then steps backward toward
tree --

                    TIN MAN
          ...and right in the middle of a chop,
          I...I rusted solid. And I've been that
          way ever since.

                    DOROTHY
          Well, you're perfect now.

          me a heart.

                (sings)
            When a man's an empty kettle, He should
            be on his mettle. And yet I'm torn apart.
            Just because I'm presumin' That I could
            be kind-a human, If I only had a heart.

MCU -- Tin Man leans over toward Dorothy and sings as CAMERA
PANS left slightly -- then leans back --

                      TIN MAN
                (sings)
            I'd be tender -- I'd be gentle And awful
            sentimental Regarding Love and Art I'd be
            friends with sparrows...

CS -- Dorothy and Scarecrow listening to the Tin Man -- he
comes forward slightly -- reacts as he hears Snow White's
Voice o.s. -- then continues with song --

                      TIN MAN
                (sings)
            ...And the boy who shoots the arrows If I
            only had a heart. Picture me....a
            balcony....Above a voice sings low.

SNOW WHITE'S VOICE

Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

                      TIN MAN
            I hear a beat....how sweet! Just to
            register emotion Jealousy -- Devotion --
            And really feel the part, I could stay
            young and chipper, And I'd lock it with a
            zipper, If I only had a heart...!

          Please, sir. We've done what you told
          us. We've brought you the broomstick of
          the Wicked Witch of the West. We melted
          her.

             Why, anybody can have a brain. That's a
             very mediocre commodity. Every

             earth -- or slinks through slimy seas has
             a brain!

             that as it may. Back where I come from we
             have universities, seats of great
             learning -- where men go to become great
             thinkers. And when they come out, they
             think deep thoughts -- and with no more
             brains than you have.... But! They have
             one thing you haven't got! A diploma!

          Well, you can't. As for you, my fine
          friend -- you're a victim of disorganized
          thinking. You are under the unfortunate
          delusion that simply because you run away
          from danger, you have no courage. You're
          confusing courage with wisdom. Back
          where I come from, we have men who are
          called heroes. Once a year, they take
          their fortitude out of mothballs and
          parade it down the main street of the
          city. And they have no more courage than
          you have. But! They have one thing that

          everybody was, I want to go home. And
          they sent me home.
