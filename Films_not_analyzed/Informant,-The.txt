          shaken like paint cans-- it's too loud to speak. Each flask
          is connected to a feed tube-- the cultures are administered
          to by a HALF DOZEN BIO TECH WORKERS. Whitacre watches. He
          focuses on one worker-- she's ASIAN. She adds some nutrients

          At 6:30 the next morning Whitacre walks across the ADM
          trading floor and straight into Mick Andreas' office looking
          flustered.

                         WHITACRE
          Mick you're not going to believe
          what the hell's happened. I think
          I know the reason why we've been
          having all these problems at the
          plant.

                         ANDREAS
          Well, I've only been asking you to
          come up with one for the past eight
          weeks. I'm all ears.
          Whitacre paces. His story comes out in a rush of words.
          Andreas listens silently.

                         WHITACRE
          It's not start-up problems like we
          thought. It's the Japanese. This
          guy Fujiwara from Ajinomoto, he's
          been calling me-- sometimes at
          work, sometimes at home cuz of the
          time difference-- you met him, he
          was here a couple of weeks ago.

                          WHITACRE (CONT'D)
           Well last night he calls me at home
          just after 8, and Mick, he knew
           everything. He says to me, `You
          remember the total nightmare you
          had during May, June and July?'
          And before I can ask him what he
          means he says, `Those months when
          ADM was losing about seven million
          dollars a month in the lysine
          business?'
          Whitacre stares at Andreas in shock-- no one outside the
          company should know that. Andreas is still stone faced.

                         WHITACRE
          I couldn't believe it. But, Mick
          before I can even ask him how he
          got those numbers, he starts making
          little comments about us having
          microbe problems. Jokes, like he's
          toying with me.
          Whitacre is fuming now-- his voice unnaturally high.

                         WHITACRE
          And then he tells me that one of
          our highest paid employees is
          actually an employee of Ajinomoto
          and is sabotaging the plant.
          They're injecting some kind of
          virus into the dextrose and
          contaminating the whole deal.
          That's the problem. I'll tell you
          Mick, it's like Rising Sun, that
          Crichton book, it's just like it.
          Fujiwara even said that his boss,
          Ikeda, would have him killed if he
          knew he was calling. So I asked
          him why he was talking to me and he
          said-- he said-- he wants 10
          million dollars. 10 million and
          he'll tell us who the saboteur is
          and give us a new lysine bug that's
          immune to the virus. We could be
          up and running in three days...
          Andreas pauses, takes it all in, and then...

                         ANDREAS
          How well do you know this guy?

                         WHITACRE
          Uh, um, well I met him a few weeks
          ago when he came over. And then,
          he called a couple of times...

          Andreas ponders the situation.

                         ANDREAS
          Okay, if you hear from him again--
          talk him down on the price. I want
          you to find out the least amount of
          money he'd settle for. If we can
          get a bug that's resistant to the
          virus, it might be worth it...But,
          I want you to keep this quiet, if
          there is a mole, we don't want him
          to know we're onto him.

          suit and tie from the day Jay Edgar Hoover set a dress code.
          He has been stationed in Decatur where the odd dead body in a
          river and a convenience store robbery that traversed state
          lines have made up the last fifteen years of his life.
          Whitacre shifts restlessly in his seat. Cheviron on the other
          hand is an old hand at this. He watches Whitacre and says
          nothing. Shepard writes down everything.

          I can't provide you with immunity,
          but any information you tell me
          about your involvement in criminal
          activity would be discussed with
          the US attorney's office in a
          favorable light.

          notebook.

          Everything I told you yesterday
          about Fujiwara was true-- except
          one thing. I never received a call
          from him on the office line.
          Shepard looks at Whitacre-- he's confused.

                         SHEPARD
          Why did you tell me that you did?

                         WHITACRE
          Before I spoke with you, Mick
          Andreas and Mark Cheviron coached
          me on what to say. They told me to
          tell you that the calls came in on
          my business line, instead of my
          home line.

                         SHEPARD
          Why?
          Whitacre pauses again. It's too late to turn back.

                         WHITACRE
          What I'm about to tell you involves
          something very large. This
          extortion attempt by Fujiwara is
          nothing compared to it.
          Shepard says nothing.

                         WHITACRE (CONT'D)
          It involves price fixing in the
          lysine business. I've been in
          several meetings with our Japanese
          and Korean competitors in the past
          few months where the sole purpose
          has been to fix prices. ADM made me
          go to these meetings.
          Shepard writes furiously, struggling to see in the dark.

          That's why they wanted me to lie.
          Fujiwara's calling on my home line.
          But, so are the people we fix
          prices with. They didn't want you
          to hear those conversations so they
          told me to say the Fujiwara calls
          came in on the ADM line. But, I
          knew if you guys ever started
          looking at the records you'd see
          all these calls I have to Japan.
          And that's what scared me. Nobody
          has more calls than me. If you ever
          figured out about the price fixing,
          I'd be the fall guy.
          Shepard considers the explanation.

                         SHEPARD
          Who told you to participate in

          Dwayne Andreas got the government
          to subsidize corn farmers-- it all
          changed. Corn syrup got to be
          cheaper than sugar-- so they went
          with the high fructose corn syrup
          from ADM.. .They said you couldn't
          tell the difference, but that's
          just a lie-Like when they

          restaurant than anything that might have once involved
          agriculture. Outside, RUSTY the gardener, fishes leaves from

          That's a good way to put it. You

          died in an automobile accident. I
          was maybe six at the time and this
          wealthy man in Ohio adopted me. He

          When you hear this-- you call me.
          Then Shepard pulls a tape recorder out of his jacket-- a
          simple little Radio Shack Dictaphone model. He gives it to
          Whitacre.

          Shepard and Herndon step out of the room. Herndon speaks to
          Whitacre over his shoulder.

          Whitacre buttons his shirt and puts his tie back on. He looks
          out the hotel room window at the snow. In the parking lot a
          high school kid drinks a beer while trying to write his name
          in urine in the snowbank.

          They're all different. Every flake
          is it's own one-of-a-kind version
          of itself. And some people still
          don't believe in God. I mean what
          more proof do you need than that--
          Herndon and Shepard re-enter.

          I know it's tough keeping it all
          bottled up inside, keeping it a
          secret. But, there's only one good
          choice for you. That's all there's
          ever been. There's something
          you're hiding, something you're
          keeping from us. But, the only way

          Okay.
          Shepard gets another form out of his brief-case. Not a basic
          302 this time-- it's A CONFESSION.

                         SHEPARD

          used against you in a court of law.

          Dwayne Andreas, hey, how ya doin'?
          Sorry about the FBI arresting your
          son and investigating your
          company... Maybe you all should've
          listened to me.

          Daniel.

          Pleasure meeting you. I'm
          representing ADM in this matter.
          And this is a colleague of mine
          John Dowd. Dwayne's told me about
          your responsibilities here...

          their legal fees.

          after a while. A balloon looking
          for a pin to bump into and relieve

          from keeping it inside and get a
          tumor or something..I didn't ask

          happened.

          141 INTERIOR ADM- MICK ANDREAS OFFICE- EVENING 141
          Mick, Dwayne, Roberts and Aubrey Daniel stand before the

          The two signatures eclipse each other perfectly.

          Aubrey Daniel picks up the phone barely able to contain his
          glee.

          Whitacre races the Ferrari down a two-lane in the middle of
          the farm fields of South Central Illinois. The phone rings
          and he answers cheerfully.

          Hello, Mark? It's Aubrey Daniel.
          I think you forgot something?
          Whitacre pulls over onto the shoulder. He looks at the cell
          phone in dismay and stares at a Polaroid of himself from the
          Fortune Magazine photo shoot-- he's smiling in the picture.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          One of the things I've learned in
          business is that you should always
          use a person's name in conversation
          if you want them to feel
          important... Sid Hulse and Marty
          Allison think that and they're very
          successful salesman...

          143 EXTERIOR CHINESE RESTAURANT, TAYLORVILLE- DAY 143
          Whitacre gets out of an FBI cruiser with Herndon and Shepard
          and the three men walk toward the restaurant in rural
          Illinois.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          It makes people feel like they're
          definitely being told something
          they can use...
          They enter and the HOSTESS gives them a table up front.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          Just by putting their name in there

          The men sit at a table in the back.

          Brian, Bob, my attorney's telling
          me not to say anything, but there's
          something I've wanted to talk about
          for awhile.

                         HERNDON
          Don't tell us anything. You have an
          attorney now. This isn't like
          before. Let's just talk.

          They want to talk to me at ADM.

                         HERNDON
          Mark, you understand your lawyer
          has advised you not to discuss this
          matter?

                         SHEPARD
          We're not asking you.

                         WHITACRE
          Let me throw out some
          "hypotheticals." I'll talk about
          some financial situations and you
          tell me if they're wrong or how
          serious they might be, OK? For
          instance, suppose a company gave an
          executive a car, you know, a
          corporate car. But instead of
          driving it to work he drove his
          personal car and gave the company
          car to his daughter. Would that be
          a problem?

                         HERNDON
          That's it? That's the hypothetical?
          The agents try not to laugh. After what Whitacre has given
          the government-- a little undeclared perk is nothing.

                         SHEPARD
          That shouldn't be a problem.

                         WHITACRE
          What about if an executive used a
          corporate plane for personal use?

                         HERNDON
          Basically, it's the same thing.

                         SHEPARD
          There may be some IRS issues but...

                         WHITACRE
          What if, hypothetically, the
          activity involved kickbacks by
          corporate executives?

          There are plenty of ways companies
          try and attract business. Dinners
          for clients, tickets for sporting
          events...

          It's not ethical but it's done.
          A beat. Then Whitacre goes on.

                         WHITACRE
          Uh, is this conversation on or off
          the record?

          Whitacre exhales.

                         WHITACRE
          What if the company regularly
          accepted kickbacks to executives in
          the form of cash?
          Shepard drops his fork. Hold on Shepard.

                         SHEPARD
          How much money are we talking about
          Mark?
          Whitacre pauses, clears his throat.

                         WHITACRE
          Five hundred thousand.

                         HERNDON
          How much???
          Whitacre shrinks from the admission like a puppy who just
          crapped on the rug.

                         WHITACRE
          It's how things were done there.

          December of 1991.

          10,000 dollars.

                         SHEPARD
          And did any of these checks come in
          after we met?
          Whitacre pauses.

                         WHITACRE
          Maybe a couple.
          The agents try and control their anger.

          Nobody.
          Herndon loses it.

                         HERNDON
          Come on, Mark-- you just said it's
          how things were done at ADM. Now,
          is there anything else you're
          involved in? Anything else you need
          to tell us?

                         WHITACRE
          Just what I told you.

                         HERNDON
          I'm asking you one more time.

                         WHITACRE
          The 500 and that's it. Definitely.
          Whitacre nods. He asks hopefully...

                         WHITACRE
          This isn't going to affect the
          price-fixing case, is it?
          The three men get up to leave.

          WHITACRE (V.0.)
          I feel good about that. Hey, I
          don't see what the big deal is.

          If we're going in there we got to
          go in with the whole story. Because

          In early 1992. I learned how
          things were done there from Mick
          Andreas. He's the one who taught
          me how to use embezzlement and
          kickbacks to make money tax free.

          Primarily by check. I deposited

          was my job outside. One got in one
          time, I don't know how, and he was
          found dead by my Mother. This had
          nothing to do with anything I had
          done-- he just had died and it was
          up to me to bring him back to life.

          wear the white hat and that's why I
          tried to make it all right so he

          To observe that Mr. Whitacre is the
          usual felon is a gross
          understatement. He is well
          educated, has a loving wife and
          family, is respected in the

          opportunity to apologize to Special
          Agent Brian Shepard on behalf of
          myself and my wife Ginger, he never
          hit me with a brief case or told me
          to destroy tapes. The idea to sue
          him wasn't mine-- it came from
          someone at ADM and I shouldn't have
          listened. I can't remember who.
          when I was at ADM, I lived so many
          lives, I wasn't sure who I was.
          Today, I know more who I am and
          what I really want out of life.
          I've completed three post-graduate
          degrees while in detention. A J.D.
          which is, of course, a law degree
          and another advanced degree in the
          psychology of jury selection. I
          sleep better in prison than I have
          in years. My wife has forgiven me
          and believes that the ordeal with
          ADM has brought us closer together
          in a marriage of over 20 years. I
          hope you will allow me to leave
          here, so that I can re-join my life
          with my family and three kids. . .Two
          of whom are adopted... Especially
          when you consider that thanks in
          large part to my testimony the US

          over a billion dollars in price-
