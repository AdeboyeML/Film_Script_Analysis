      script itself was adapted from Lawton's first script called «Three

          PHILIP'S RESIDENCE - PATIO - EXTERIOR DAY

          We are in Philip Stuckey's residence on the Hollywood Hills.
          Apparently, a party is in progress.

                         
          Close Up on the Magician's hands and the hands of two ladies. The
          magician is doing tricks with coins in the ladies' hands.

                         
                          MAGICIAN (voice over)
           So let's imagine, ladies, that you're a Savings and Loan
           officer. Watch. One, two, three. See ?

                         
          On lady has got three coin in her hand, and the other one only
          one. The magician takes the three coins from the first lady's
          hand, and closes it. Then he takes the only coin from the other
          lady's hand, but leaves it open. He puts the four coins in his
          hand and closes it.

                         
          Credits appears in white capital letters on the screen.

                         
                          MAGICIAN (voice over)
           You've got it all, and we've got nothing. And you have all
           four. Just take a look.

          He opens his hand, which is empty. Then he opens the first lady's
          hand, which contains the four coins.

                         
                          WOMAN (voice over)
           Oh !

                         
                          MAGICIAN (voice over)
           But I wouldn't trust you with real gold. That's why this
           one's only worth about a penny.

                         
          He takes one of the coins from the first lady's hand, hides it in
          his hand, and makes it appears again changed into a huge penny
          coin.

                         
          End of the first set of credits.

                         
                          MAN (voice over)
           Hmm.

                         
                          MAGICIAN (voice over)
           And if you wonder where the other one went, watch.

                         
          His left hand moves to the first lady's' ear, and gets the missing
          penny out of it.

                         

                          PHILIP
           A penny from the ear. How much for the rest ?

                         
          Philip Stuckey, the host, walks behind the magician. Philip is a
          short man in his forties, with receding hair. He looks, at the
          same time, obsequious and domineering. His guests laugh at his
          joke. Philip moves toward a young man.

                         
          The camera follows Philip.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Have you seen Edward ?

           THE YOUNG MAN
           No, I haven't. Great party, Philip.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Well, my wife went to a lot of trouble : she called a
           caterer.

                         
          He walks to a group of guest gathered around a large buffet table.
          Behind the table, the balustrade of the patio, and in the
          background, Hollywood Hills.

                         

                          PHILIP

                          HOWARD

                          PHILIP
           Yeah. Call me.

          He turns to another guest and shake hands with him.

                          PHILIP
           Well, if I know this fellow, he's probably off in a corner
           somewhere charming a very pretty lady.

                         
          He turns to a charming lady talking with a man.

           Yes, she did. I speak to your secretary more than I speak

           JESSICA (voice over on the telephone)
           But you never give me any notice. You just think I'm at

           JESSICA (voice over on the telephone)
           Well, that's the way you always make me feel. Maybe I
           should just move out.

          Elizabeth, Philip's wife, walks rapidly toward Philip's armchair
          and taps him on the shoulder. Elizabeth is a red-hair woman in her
          forties. She is still nice-looking, and very elegantly dressed,
          but she doesn't have anymore the attraction that a younger woman
          can have on Philip.

          Darryl, Edward's chauffeur, is reading a newspaper, next to
          another chauffeur. Darryl is a very tall and very strong-looking
          Afro-American man. He raises his hand to show his helplessness
          about the situation.

           All right, look. I don't think you should drive. You're a
           little excited. Don't drive my car. Let me work something
           out here.

           cars out of here ?

                         
          Meanwhile, Edward has seated himself in the driver seat of the
          Lotus Esprit. Philip comes back to him as Edward closes the door
          of the car.

          Tires squeal as the car rushes forward.

                         
          The Japanese valets look up at the noise.

          The Lotus is driving through a crossroad. The tires screech, and

          problems with his gear shift.
          The camera follows the car for a couple of seconds.

          With the street lights, we get a better view of Vivian. She is a
          young woman in her early twenties. She is very tall and slim. She
          is a beautiful woman, even though her prostitute outfit and heavy
          make-up makes her a little less beautiful than she actually is.
          She is wearing a red jacket and a man's very large cap on her
          blonde wig. Underneath the jacket she is wearing her very short
          sleeveless white top, which is attached to her also very short
          blue skirt with a big metal ring. She is carrying a big bag
          strapped on her shoulder.

           Neither do I. Hundred dollars an hour. Pretty stiff.

                         
          She puts her right hand on Edward's zipper.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, no. But it's got potential.

                         
          Edward doesn't react, but he looks at her in such a way that she
          feels she has better take her hand off his zipper.

          The tires of the car squeal as it makes a last fast turn to stop
          in front of the hotel.

                         
          Full shot. The Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel is a very luxurious
          hotel, certainly one of the most expensive hotel of the Los
          Angeles area.

          Medium full shot on the Lotus parked in front of the hotel. The

                          HOTEL ATTENDANT
           Good evening, Mr. Lewis. Will you be needing the car
           anymore tonight ?

                         

                          EDWARD (LAUGHING)
           I... I hope not !

                         
          He gets out of the car. The attendant closes the door and then
          moves away, while Vivian joins Edward on the sidewalk.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Ah. You're here.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Yeah.
          He looks at her for a couple of second, before talking again.

                         

                          EDWARD
           So you'll be all right ?

                          EDWARD
           Go back to your office.

                         
          She laughs.

                         

                          VIVIAN

           Good-bye.

                         
          Edward starts turning around to go inside the hotel, but doesn't
          do it, and instead looks back in Vivian's direction.

                         
          Medium shot on Vivian seated on the backrest of a public bench,
          with her feet resting on the bench itself. She puts her cap back
          on.

                         
           EDWARD (voice over)

          Edward walks to the bench on which Vivian is sitting.

                         
          Quick medium shot on the uniformed attendant watching the scene

                          EDWARD
           I was thinking... Did you really say a hundred dollars an
           hour ?

                         

                          VIVIAN

                          EDWARD
           Yeah... Well, if you don't have any prior engagements, I'd
           be very pleased if you would accompany me into the hotel.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You got it.
          She gets off the bench and laughs.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           What is your name ?

                         
          They start walking toward the entrance of the hotel

                         

                          EDWARD

                          VIVIAN
           Edward. That's my favorite name in the whole world !

                         
          He smiles.

                         

                          EDWARD
           No ?!

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I tell you what, this is fate, Edward. That's what this is.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Why don't you put this on ?

                         
          He puts his coat, which he was carrying on his arm, on Vivian's
          shoulders, and then wraps it around Vivian's body, in order to
          cover as much as he can of Vivian's very conspicuous outfit.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Why ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Well, this hotel is not the kind of establishment that
           rents rooms by the hour.

                         

                          VIVIAN

          Medium shot on Edward and Vivian crossing the hotel lobby. While
          walking, Vivian puts her arms into the sleeves of the coat. Then
          she raises her eyes to look at the luxury around her.

                         

                          VIVIAN

          Medium full shot on the guests seated in comfortable armchairs
          near the front desk. All these guests are very elegantly dressed,
          and mostly middle-aged. They all look with curiosity at the
          strange couple that just walked in.

                         
           VIVIAN (voice over)
           Holy shit.

           You're gonna be fine. Come with me. And stop fidgeting.
          Another medium shots on seated guests staring at the couple.

                         
          Edward walks to the reception desk, with Vivian following him. A
          very neatly dressed female receptionist is behind the counter.

                         

                          FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
           Good evening, Mr. Lewis.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Hello. You have messages ?

           Thank you.

                         
          While Edward is looking through his messages, Vivian is leaning on
          the wall near the reception desk and looks around her. She takes
          her cap off, but one still can see her strange outfit underneath
          the slightly open coat. She stares at a passing female guest who
          stares back at her.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Could you send up some champagne and strawberries, please ?

                         

                          FEMALE RECEPTIONIST
           Of course.

                         
          She picks up the phone.

                         

                          FEMALE RECEPTIONIST

          Edward slowly walks away from the desk, taking Vivian along with
          him.
          Medium shot on the elevator doors. Edward and Vivian reach the
          elevator, and Edward presses the call button. A middle-aged couple
          is already waiting for it. They both look at Vivian. Vivian turns
          around and notice their disapproving look. She raises her leg and
          puts the tip of her boot on the high ash-tray set near the door of
          the elevator, showing her thigh to the couple, and especially to
          the man.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Oh, honey. You know what's happened ? I've got a runner in
           my pantyhose.

                         
          She laughs and turns to the middle-aged couple.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I'm not wearing pantyhose.

                         
          We hear the ding of the elevator bell. Vivian puts her leg down.
          The elevator door opens on Dennis, the young elevator attendant.
          Vivian is the first one to walk in.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, color me happy ! There's a sofa in here for two.

                         
          Edward wants to let the middle-aged couple enter the elevator
          first. The man starts to move, but his wife holds him back.

          cabin. The middle-aged couple remains outside.

                         

                          EDWARD

          very broad smile. Vivian stands up from the sofa.

                         

                          VIVIAN

          The elevator moves up. Dennis tries to look casual, but doesn't
          really succeed.

          Edward gets out of the elevator. Dennis can't keep his eyes off
          Vivian, and watches her walking in the hallway. Edward turns
          around and looks at him a bit severely. Dennis wipes the smile off
          his face, goes back into the cabin of the elevator and closes the
          doors. The camera follows Edward walking away to the door of the
          penthouse, where Vivian is waiting for him. He gets his magnetic
          card out of his pocket.

          table near the front door. He crosses the room and and drops the
          newspaper on the desk. He sits down behind the desk, and starts
          looking through his mail, while Vivian walks out on the terrace.

                         
           VIVIAN (voice over from the terrace)
           Wow, great view ! I bet you can see all the way to the
           ocean from out here.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I'll take your word for it, because I don't go out there.

                         
          Vivian walks in the room through another French window-door on the
          other side of the desk. She puts her bag on an armchair.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Why don't you go out there ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           I'm afraid of heights.

                          VIVIAN
           You are ?

                         
          Edward nods his head.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           So how come you rented the penthouse ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           It's the best. I looked all around for penthouses on the
           first floor, but I can't find one.

                         
          Vivian takes off Edward's coat and puts in on a sofa.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, now that you have me here, what are you going to do
           with me ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Want to know something ? I don't have a clue.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           No ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           I hadn't exactly planned this.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, do you plan everything ?

                         
          She takes her red jacket off.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Always.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah. Me too.
          She sits down on an armchair.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I'm actually... No, I'm not a planner. I wouldn't say I was
           a planner. I would say I was, hum, a kind of «fly by the
           seat of my pants» girl. You know, moment to moment. That's
           me. That's... Yeah.

                         
          Edward, still seated behind his desk, watches her with a strange
          look in his eyes. He suddenly realizes that perhaps he hasn't done
          something very wise in bringing Vivian with him.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Mm-hmm. You know, you could pay me. That's one way to maybe
           break the ice.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Uh, I assume cash is acceptable.

                         
          He takes his wallet out of this jacket.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Cash works for me, yeah.

                         
          She stands up and walks to the desk. Edward puts the money on the
          desk. She takes the money and sits on the desk. She puts the money
          in one of her high boots.

                         

                          EDWARD
           You're on my fax.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well, that's one I haven't been on before.

                         
          She doesn't stand up but moves slightly in a very suggestive way.
          Edward takes his fax, but doesn't seem to react at Vivian's
          suggestive movements.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Cute. Very cute. Thank you.

                         
          She laughs, and zips one of her boots down. Out of the boot, she
          takes several condoms wrapped in cellophane paper.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           All right. Here we go. Pick one. I got red, I got green, I
           got yellow. I'm out of purple, but I do have one gold
           circle coin left. The condom of champions. The one and
           only. Nothing is getting through this sucker. What d'you
           say ? Hmm ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           A buffet of safety.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I'm a safety girl.

                         
          Edward stands up from his desk. Immediately Vivian reaches for his
          zipper.

                          VIVIAN
           All right, let's get one of these on you.

                         

                          EDWARD
           No, no. I...

                         
          He laughs awkwardly.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Why don't we just talk for a little bit, okay ?

                         
          He takes his jacket off, and puts it on the back of the desk
          chair.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Talk. Yeah... uh... okay. Edward, are you in town on, uh,
           business or pleasure ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Business, I think.

                         
          He walks away from the desk across the room.

                          VIVIAN
           Business, you think.

                         
          She zips her boot back up, stands up and follows him across the
          room.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Well... let me guess.

                         
          Edward, now in his shirtsleeves, but still with his necktie and
          his vest on, has seated himself in an armchair.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           That would make you... a lawyer.

                         
          She sits downs on a low pouf in front of his armchair.

                         

                          EDWARD
           A lawyer ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Mm-hmm.

                         

                          EDWARD
           What makes you think I'm a lawyer ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You've got that, um... sharp, useless look about you.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I bet you've known a lot of lawyers.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I've known a lot of everybody.

                         
          The doorbell chimes. They both stand up.

                          VIVIAN
           What is that ?

                         
          He turns around and find his face very close to Vivian's face, and
          seems a little disturbed by it.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Champagne.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Oh ! Well. Might as well make myself useful. Take a load
           off.

                         
          The doorbell chimes again.

                         
          Vivian runs across the room to the front door and opens it. A room
          service male attendant comes in carrying a loaded tray. Vivian
          closes the door behind him.

                         

           ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT
           Good evening.

                          VIVIAN
           Hi.

                         

           ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT
           Uh, where would you like it ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Where would we like it ?

                         
          Edward has seated himself back in the armchair.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Uh, over by the bar.

                         
          The attendant seems a little surprised by Vivian's outfit, but,
          being a good luxury hotel attendant, he pretends not to notice,
          and carries the tray onto the bar. After he has put the tray down,
          he turns around and almost bumps into Vivian, who was standing
          behind him.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Excuse me !

                         
          She giggles.

                         

           ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT
           It'll be on your bill, Mr. Lewis.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Thank you.

                         
          The attendant doesn't move away and remains close to Vivian,
          staring at her.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           What are you looking at ?

                         
          The attendant clears his throat.

                          VIVIAN
           What is he looking at ?

                         
          Edward walks toward the attendant, and gives him some tip money.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Ah, yes. Here you go. Thank you very much.

                         

           ROOM SERVICE ATTENDANT
           Thank you very much, sir. Have a nice night.

                         
          The attendant walks out of the room. Edward walks to the bar.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           A tip. Wow. I missed that one. Oh.
           (in a much softer voice)
           Stupid.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Don't worry about it.
          Edward sets the champagne glasses on the bar.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You mind if I take my boots off ?

                         
          She sits down on the steps that run across the room, separating it
          in two slightly different levels.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Not at all.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           So, do you have a wife ? Girlfriend ?

                         
          She zips one of her boots down.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I have both.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Where are they ? Shopping together ?

                         
          She takes her knee-length sock off. We hear the champagne bottle
          cork popping off.

                         

                          EDWARD
           My ex-wife... is now in Long Island... in my ex-home...
           with my ex-dog.

                         
          He brings her a glass of Champagne, which he sets down on the
          floor besides her. Vivian is taking her other boot off.

                         

                          EDWARD
           There you go.

                         
          He walks back to the bar to take his own glass.

                         

                          EDWARD
           My ex-girlfriend, Jessica, is in New York... moving out of
           my apartment even as we speak.

                         
          He looks at her, a bit surprised.

                         
          Vivian is draining her glass empty. Edward comes near her, with a
          silver bowl in his hands. In the bowl are some fresh strawberries.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Why don't you try a strawberry ?

                         
          He takes the lid off the bowl and shows it to her.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Why ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           It brings out the flavor in the champagne.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Oh, groovy.
          She takes a strawberry and eats it. Edward closes the bowl and

           Listen, I... I appreciate this whole seduction scene you've
           got going, but let me give you a tip : I'm a sure thing,
           okay ? So, I'm on an hourly rate. Could we just move it
           along ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Somehow I'm sensing that this time problem is a major issue
           with you.

                         
          He stands up.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Why don't we just get through that right now ?

                          EDWARD
           Done. Thank you. Now we can relax.

                         
          He takes the glass off her hand. She stands up.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Are you sure you want me to stay for the entire night ? I
           mean, I could just pop you good and be on my way.

                         
          She walks to the bar, where Edward is filling the glass with
          Champagne.

                         

                          EDWARD
           To tell you the truth, I don't feel like being alone
           tonight.

                         
          He gives her the glass, and she immediately drinks it. He sits
          down on the stool.

                          VIVIAN
           Why ? Is it your birthday or something ?

           So what do you want me to do ?

                         
          He doesn't answer immediately, remains pensive for a couple of
          seconds, and then looks at her. He laughs.

          Close Up on the sink, and Vivian's hands been washed. She turns
          the faucet off and takes an white towel to dry her hands.

                         
          The camera tilts up to Vivian's face, who walks to the door.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I'll be out in just a minute. That champagne kind of got to
           me.

                         
          She closes the door, and goes back to the sink. Edward re-opens
          the door and enters the bathroom.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I didn't hear you. What did you say ?
          Vivian hides something behind her back, but her hand in her back
          can be seen in one of the bathroom mirror.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Uh... I said I'd be out in just a minute.

                         
          Edward looks worried. He points to her

                         

                          EDWARD

                          VIVIAN
           Nothing.

                         
          He walks toward her and sighs. He grabs her by the arm and moves
          her toward the door. He takes her hand bag

                         

                          EDWARD
           All right, look. I do not want any drugs here. I don't want
           any of this. Get your things and your money and please
           leave.
          She gets rid of his hand.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I don't do drugs, all right ? I... I stopped doing drugs
           when I was fourteen.

          Close Up on Vivian's hand, which Edward is opening by force. She
          was hiding a little box of dental floss. Edward has put Vivian's
          bag under his arm.

                         

                          EDWARD
           This is dental floss.

          She walks to the sink. He start walking across the room, but stops
          in his tracks, and looks at her. She turns around from the sink
          and looks at him.

           Yeah, well, you're lucky. Most of them shock the hell out
           of me.

                         
          He nods his head. She goes back to the sink and brings a piece of
          dental floss to her mouth, stops, and brings it down. She turns
          around.

          Close Up shot on the TV screen, where an old black and white
          episode of «I love Lucy» is being played. It is episode 23 from
          Season 5, called «Lucy's Italian Movie». Lucy is standing close to
          a huge bucket full of grapes, and seems a bit reluctant to climb
          into it. Behind her, a fat Italian lady is speaking Italian to
          her.

                         
          We hear recorded laughs coming from the TV set.

                         
          The camera moves away from the TV set.

                         
          We hear Edward's voice speaking on the telephone.

                         
           EDWARD (voice over)
           Yes, that may be true, Vance.

                         
          We hear Vivian laughing.

                         
           EDWARD (voice over)
           Yes, I know, but I still need the numbers on Morse
           Industries.

                         
          On the TV screen, the Italian fat lady is climbing into the bucket
          full of grapes.

                         
          The camera keeps on moving away from the TV set, and we discover
          Vivian sitting on the floor and drinking Champagne. And, behind
          her, we see Edward sitting on an armchair near a small table on
          which the telephone set is resting. Edward is writing on a
          document resting on his laps.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Uh-huh. I've got them from London. I need them now from
           Tokyo. I'll call down and get them when I want them. Thank
           you very much.

                         
          He puts the phone down back on its hook.

          Back on Edward, still writing on the document on his laps. He
          snorts.

          Quick shot on Vivian laughing.
          Medium shot on the TV screen, where Lucy is putting a reluctant
          foot in the bucket. Close Up on her foot reaching into the grapes.
          She screams with a wide open mouth.

                         
          Back on Vivian changing position and lying on her stomach to be
          more comfortable to watch TV. She laughs.

                         
          Edward watches her without moving from his armchair.

                         
           VIVIAN (voice over)
           You know, I never saw this episode.

                         
          Edward chuckles. And then he stands up.

                         
          Vivian is still lying on the floor, laughing. Edward sits down on
          the sofa next to her.

                         
          Shot on the TV screen, where Lucy is stomping the grapes, with a
          disgusted face. We hear Vivian laughing very loudly.

                         
          Close Up on Vivian's face laughing and holding the glass of
          Champagne. She looks up at Edward, still seated on the sofa.

          Back to Vivian. We hear the recorded laughs coming from the TV
          set. Vivian stands up on her arms and knees and walks on all four
          toward the sofa.

                         
          Quick shot on the TV screen, where Lucy and the other woman are

          High angle shot on Vivian on her knees near the sofa. She puts a
          hand up inside Edward's pants leg. Edward snorts.

                         
          On the TV screen, Lucy now seems to be enjoying her grapes
          stomping.

                         
          Still resting on her knees, Vivian is taking her white top off her
          shoulders. She slips it down, and because the top is attached to
          the skirt, the skirt comes down with it. Vivian is now wearing
          only her black lace underwear and bra. Vivian puts the top and the
          skirt away from her on the floor, and bends down on the seated
          Edward. Suddenly, she stands up and walks away. Edward seems
          surprised. But she comes back with a cushion that she drops on the
          floor, and then kneels on it. She takes the TV remote control from
          the table by the sofa, and presses a button on it.

                         
          On the TV screen, Lucy and the Italian lady are still stomping the
          grapes, but the sound shuts off.

                         
          Back to the sofa. Closer shot. Vivian puts the remote control back
          on the table. Then she leans on Edward, and starts taking his
          necktie off. Edward puts his hand on her hair, and seems
          surprised : he hadn't realized it was a wig.
          Quick shot on the TV screen, where Lucy and her Italian friend are
          now dancing on the grapes.

                         
          Back to the sofa, where Vivian is taking Edward's pants off. She
          opens his shirt on his chest, and bends on it.

                         
          Close Up on their two faces, very close to each other.

           Neither do I.

                         
          She bends on his chest and starts kissing him on the chest, going
          down. She stops to look at the TV.

                         
          On the TV screen, the Italian lady is throwing grapes in Lucy's
          face.

          Edward is in the shower, hot water pouring on his head. He opens
          his eyes and seems to think about what just happened. He turns
          around to turn the water off.

          Edward is just out of the bathroom, wearing a white bathrobe. He
          puts his towel around his neck. He bends on the armchair, and
          picks up one of Vivian's bracelet. The camera pans away from the
          armchair, showing Vivian's clothes and stuff scattered around,
          including her blonde wig.

                         
          Edward looks at Vivian's things, then turns his head around toward
          the bed. He looks at the bed for a couple of seconds without
          moving, then starts walking toward the bed.

          attendants talking together.

           Well, I... don't sell the whole company. I break it up into
           pieces... and then I sell that off. It's worth more than
           the whole.

          across her shoulder and her red jacket is tied around her waist.
          Barney gives her a quick look, but goes back to his conversation
          with the Italian guest. He takes the card the Italian is holding.

           Mm-hmmm.

                         
          Dennis comes out of the elevator. Vivian points at him.

                         

                          VIVIAN

          Barney turns toward Dennis.

           Dennis.

                         
          Dennis walks toward his boss.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Dennis, did you just come off the night shift ? Hmm ?

                         

                          DENNIS
           Yes, sir.

                         
          Barney buttons the collar of Dennis' uniform.

                         

                          BARNEY

                          DENNIS
           She's with Mr. Lewis.

                         
          Dennis speaks with a croaky voice, because Barney is slightly
          strangling him while buttoning his uniform.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Mr. Lewis ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           That's it. Edward Lewis ! Thanks, Dennis.

                         
          She slaps Dennis' shoulder, and moves into the elevator.

                         

                          DENNIS
           Evidently she joined him last night.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Thank you.

                         
          Barney moves away from Dennis and joins Vivian into the elevator.
          Dennis puts his hands on his collar to open it and be able to
          breathe properly.

                         
           VIVIAN (voice over from the elevator)
           Oh, God ! What now ? What ? What ?

                         
          She comes out of the elevator, with Barney holding her elbow.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           What is with everybody today ?

                         
          They walk along the lobby, away from the elevator. Dennis looks at
          them and smiles. Two business men, going into the elevator, also
          look at them, surprised.

                         

                          BARNEY
           No, no. It's all right. Just come with me. We'll have a
           little chat. Thank you. Dennis, thank you.

          Close Up shot on a green plant, with, next to the plant, a metal
          pot that looks a bit like a coffee pot. Barney's hand takes the
          pot and starts watering the plant.

                         
           BARNEY (voice over)
           Uh, what is your name, miss ?

                         
           VIVIAN (voice over)
           What do you want it to be ?

                         
          Full shot of the office. Vivian is seated on a leather armchair in
          front of an expensive-looking wooden desk, on which several
          documents are scattered. On the left-hand side of the desk, the
          total upper half of the wall is a large bay window protected from
          the outside by vertical Venetian blinds. Under the bay window, a
          small table on which is the plant Barney is watering.

                         

                          BARNEY

           Thank you. Vivian.

                         
          Barney puts the pot down on the table and sits down on the desk
          itself just in front of Vivian.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Well, Miss Vivian. Things that go on in other hotels don't
           happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire. Now, Mr. Lewis,
           however, is a very special customer, and we like to think
           of our special customers as friends. Now, as a customer, we
           would expect Mr. Lewis to sign in any additional guests,
           but as a friend, we're willing to overlook it. Now, I'm
           assuming that you're a...

                         
          Barney bends his head down, and Vivian also bends her head down
          before answering.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Relative ?

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yes.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Mm-hmmm. I thought so. Then you must be his...

                         
          Same game of bending heads down.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Niece ?

                         

                          BARNEY
           Of course. Naturally, when Mr. Lewis leaves, I won't see
           you in this hotel again. I assume you have no other uncles
           here.

                         
          Vivian shakes her head. She suddenly seems a bit tired by the
          situation.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Good ! Then we understand each other. I would also
           encourage you... to dress a little more appropriately.
           that'll be all.
          Vivian raises her hands and her voice.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           No, that's not all. That's what I was trying to do. I tried
           to go... get a dress on Rodeo Drive today, and the women
           wouldn't help me. And I have all this money now and no
           dress !

                         
          Vivian takes the loose jumbled banknotes from her bag and shows
          them to Barney.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Not that I expect you to help me, but I have all of this,
           okay ? I have to buy a dress for dinner tonight. And nobody
           will help me.

                         
          Barney takes the money out of Vivian's hands, then takes a white
          handkerchief out of the breast pocket of his jacket and gives it
          to Vivian. Then he gives her her money back.

                         
          He walks around his desk, and picks up his telephone.

                          VIVIAN
           Oh, man, if you're calling the cops. Yeah, call the cops.
           That's great. Tell 'em I said hi.

           Women's clothing.

                         
          Vivian looks up, a bit surprised.

          Vivian looks at him, and then takes the handkerchief and loudly
          blows her nose.

                         

                          BARNEY

          Full view of a screen, on which a film is being projected. This

           Now, this is the jewel in Morse's crown : prime industrial
           properties straddling the port of Long Beach and Los
           Angeles.
          Full shot of the meeting room, with the screen in the background.
          Because of the dark in the room, people around the table are only
          shadows. Edward is standing up near the screen.

           The real estate possibilities are endless, but most of the
           yard we'll just level.

                         
          A young man, one of Philip's assistants, walks into the room and
          to the place where Philip is seated. He bends down to whisper to
          Philip.

                         

           THE YOUNG ASSISTANT

           projection, please ?

                         
          The projection stops. Philip stands up and switches the lights on.
          He sighs and turns toward the young man.

           hours in on this ! Nobody's walking away from anything !

           Forget it, Mark.

                         
          The two men start arguing, and since they are talking loudly
          together, we don't understand what they say.

                         
          Edward, with a glass of water in his hand, comes to the table and
          raises his voice.

          plate with a smaller plate inside, and on either sides of the
          plates, a full set of silver cutlery (three forks of various sizes
          on the left-hand side of the plate, and a knife and three spoons
          on the other side). In front of the plate, a napkin folded in a
          glass.

           All right, Miss Vivian, one more time. Dinner napkin.

                         
          We see Vivian's hand taking the napkin.

           ...laid gently in the lap.

                         
          The camera pans away and we discover Vivian seated at the table in
          front of the plate. She puts the napkin on her laps and then her
          elbows on the table

                         
           BARNEY (voice over)
           Good. Elbows off the table.

                         
          She takes her elbows off the table.

                         
           BARNEY (voice over)
           Don't slouch.

                         
          The camera moves away from the table and we get a larger shot of
          the dining room. Uniformed waiters are setting tables behind
          Vivian and Barney, who is standing up behind Vivian. He points to
          the different forks on the table.

                         

                          BARNEY

                          VIVIAN
           I definitely have the salad fork. The rest of the
           silverware is a little confusing.

                         
          The camera moves back again giving a full view of the dining room,
          with Barney and Vivian's table in the forefront. A black case is
          open on the table : inside a impressive collection of silver
          cutlery.

                         
          Barney picks up the different forks and shows them to Vivian.

                         

                          BARNEY
           All right, if you get nervous, just count the tines. Four
           tines : dinner fork. And sometimes there are three tines in
           the salad fork. And sometimes...

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - EXTERIOR LATE AFTERNOON

                         
          A large grey limousine is driving slowly on Rodeo Drive, and comes
          to park in front of the hotel.

                         

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOBBY - INTERIOR LATE AFTERNOON

                         
          Edward crosses the lobby, carrying his briefcase. He stops to look
          around, expecting to see Vivian waiting for him. He starts walking
          again, still looking around him. Barney catches up with him.
          Edward doesn't stop walking, and Barney has to talk while walking.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Pardon me, Mr. Lewis. I'm Mr. Thompson. I'm the manager of
           the hotel.

                         
          Edward stops at a marble shelf with a row of courtesy telephones
          on it. He hardly listens to what Barney is telling him.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Uh-huh. Excuse me, I just want to make one call.

                         
          He picks up a telephone but keeps looking around him. He seems a
          bit worried.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Yes, um, sir. I have a message for you, sir.

                         

                          EDWARD
           From who ?

                         

                          BARNEY
           From your niece, sir.

                         
          Edward, for the first time, looks at Barney. His finger is on the
          dial of the phone, but he doesn't dial.

                         

                          EDWARD
           My what ?

                         

                          BARNEY
           The young lady who's staying with you in your room, sir.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Oh. Hmm.

                         
          Edward smiles and puts down the telephone receiver which he had
          already put to his ear.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I think we both know that she's not my niece.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Of course.

                         

                          EDWARD
           The reason I know that is that I am an only child.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Yes, sir.

                          EDWARD
           What's the message ?

                         

                          BARNEY
           She's waiting for you in the lounge. Intriguing young lady,
           Miss Vivian.

                         
          Edward remains pensive for a couple of seconds before answering.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Intriguing.

                         
          Edward picks up his briefcase which he had put on the telephone
          shelf.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Have a good evening, sir.

           Thank you, Mr... ?

                         
          He walks away.

                         

                          BARNEY
           Thompson. I'm the manager...

                         
          He takes his business card out of the pocket of his vest to give
          it to Edward, but Edward is already gone.

                         

                          BARNEY

          REGENT BEVERLY WILSHIRE HOTEL - LOUNGE - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          The lounge of the hotel is a cosy place with potted green plants,
          comfortable armchair and soft piano music.
          Medium shot of Edward entering the lounge. The camera then follows
          Edward crossing the lounge toward the bar.

                         
          Larger shot of the lounge, with the bar in the background. There
          are not many people at this early time of the evening.

                         
          Medium shot of the bar. Only one person is seated on a stool at
          the bar. Even if we see only her back, we guess she is Vivian. But
          Edward doesn't seem to recognize her, because he keeps looking
          around for her.

                         
          As Edward is looking the other way from the bar, Vivian turns
          around and looks at him. Edward walks a couple of steps toward the
          door, and then turns around and eventually notices Vivian.

                         
          Medium shot on Edward. There is a look of surprise in Edward's
          eyes when he recognizes Vivian.

                         
          Back to Vivian still seated at the bar. She doesn't look like the
          Vivian we were used to see. She is wearing a very elegant dark-
          colored cocktail dress. Her hair also has been very elegantly
          styled.
          Edward looks at her without moving for a few seconds.

                         
          She stands up from the bar and walks toward him.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You're late.

                         

                          EDWARD
           You're stunning.

                         
          She laughs.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You're forgiven.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Shall we go to dinner ?

                         
          He gives her his arm. She puts her arm inside his arm and they
          walk across the lounge toward the exit.

                         

          RESTAURANT «LE VOLTAIRE» - INTERIOR NIGHT

                         
          High angle shot of the whole restaurant. It looks like a very
          expensive place. Tables are scattered around the room and on the
          gallery, but not too close to one another. In the middle of the
          room, a larger table used only by the waiters.

                         
          We see Edward and Vivian crossing the room, with a maitre d'hotel
          walking in front of them.

                         

                          MAITRE D'HOTEL
           This way, Mr. Lewis. Your party is waiting.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Stop fidgeting.
          Closer high angle shot of Vivian and Edward walking toward a table
          where two men, an old one and a younger one, are already seated.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Mr. Morse.

                         
          The two men stand up. The older one is James «Jim» Morse and the
          younger one is his grandson, David Morse.

                         

                          JAMES MORSE
           Yes, Mr. Lewis. I'm Jim Morse.

                         
          They shake hands.

                         

                          JAMES MORSE
           This fireball is my grandson, David.

                         

                          DAVID MORSE
           Well, I don't know about the fireball part, but grandson is
           true enough.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I'm pleased to meet you both. This is a friend of mine,
           Vivian Ward.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Hi. I'm really glad to meet you.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Mr. Morse. David.

                         
          She shakes hands with both men.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Please, sit.

                         
          The maitre d'hotel pulls the chair for Vivian. The men wait for
          Vivian to be seated to sit down. Vivian has James Morse on her
          right, Edward on her left, and David in front of her.

                         

                          VIVIAN (SOFTLY)
           Excuse me.

                         
          She stands up. Immediately, the maitre d'hotel pulls her chair,
          and the three men stand up, to Vivian's surprise.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Where are you going ?

                         
          She smiles to the two other men.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I'm going to the ladies' room.

                         
          The two Morse men smile back to her.

                         

                          EDWARD

           Okay. Excuse me.

                         
          She starts walking away.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Shall I order for you ?

                         
          She turns around.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Yeah.

                         
          She stops, exhales, and says, in a more polite tone :

                         

                          VIVIAN

           I'll do that.

                         
          She walks away. The three men sit down.

          The camera moves up from the plate to the guest's face. The guest
          is Vivian, and she looks a bit worried by what has been brought to
          her.

                         
           DAVID MORSE (voice over)

           That's the fork I knew.

                         
          David smiles.

                         
          Vivian takes one of her forks and looks at it, then she puts it
          back.

                         
           DAVID MORSE (voice over)
           Let me, uh, put it another way. Between your public
           statements and the rumors flying around on this thing, we
           find it very hard to figure out what your real intentions
           are.

                         
          Sensing Vivian's embarrassment, James Morse smiles to her.

                         

                          JAMES MORSE
           I don't know about you, but I've never been able to figure
           which goes with what !

                         
          He points to the different forks around his plate. Vivian laughs.

                         
          David seems a bit annoyed by the fact that the conversation keeps
          on deviating on menial subjects.

                         
          James Morse takes one of the canapés with his fingers and eats it.
          Vivian smiles, and also takes the canapé with her fingers. She
          wipes something out of it before eating it.

                         
          Edward smiles. He is happy that Vivian and James are getting along
          so well.

                         
          Close Up on the table in front of Vivian. We see the waiter's hand
          putting down a plate of snails in their shells.
           DAVID MORSE (voice over)
           You know, there was a time when we built ships the size of
           cities. Men like my grandfather made this country.

                         
          Vivian looks at the snails and then at the waiter.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Who ordered this ?

                         
          David seems more and more annoyed by the situation with Vivian.

                         
           THE WAITER (voice over)
           The gentleman did, ma'am. Bon appétit.

                          EDWARD
           These are escargot. It's French for snails. It's a
           delicacy. Try it. David ?

                         
          David bends down on the table. His grandfather looks at him.

                         

                          DAVID MORSE
           Mr. Lewis, if you were to get control... and I don't think
           you will... but if you did, what do you plan to do with the
           company ?

                         
          Vivian is trying to figure out how to work the snail pincers.

                         
          Edward looks at David

                         

                          EDWARD
           Break it up and sell off the pieces.

                         
          Edward is trying to mime to Vivian how to use the snail pincers.

                         
          Closer shot on James Morse.

                          JAMES MORSE
           I'm sure you'll understand I'm not thrilled at the idea...
           of your turning forty years of my work into your garage
           sale.

                         
          Vivian is still fighting with her snail pincers.

                         
          Close Up on Vivian's plate and her hands trying to use the snail
          pincers.

                         
           EDWARD (voice over)
           At the price I'm paying for this stock, Mr. Morse, you are
           going to be a very rich man.

                         
          James Morse looks at Edward.

                         

                          JAMES MORSE
           I'm rich enough. I just want to head my shipyard.

                         
          Eventually, Vivian had succeeded in fitting one snail into the
          snail pincers, but it flies away from the pincers.
          The waiter, a white-hair man with a gentle face, catches it.

                         
          Edward looks at the waiter and then at Vivian.

           There will be no contract. The contract is now buried in

          hands. Vivian is still wearing her blue very short skirt, but the
          upper half of her body is covered by a white shirt, knotted at the
          waist and with the sleeves rolled back on her arms. She is also
          wearing regular woman's shoes, so she doesn't look like a
          prostitute any more.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           People are looking at me.

                         
          They now walk on the sidewalk.

                         

                          EDWARD
           They're not looking at you. They're looking at me.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           The stores are not nice to people. I don't like it.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Stores are never nice to people. They're nice to credit
           cards.

                         
          He stops walking and Vivian also stops.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Okay, stop fidgeting.

                          VIVIAN
           All right.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Get rid of your gum.

                         
          She spits her gum, almost hitting two female pedestrians. One of
          them jumps up.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I don't believe you did that.

                         
          Edward pulls her by the hand and they enter an expensive clothing
          store.

          Medium shot of Vivian and Edward standing near a hanging rail full
          of dresses. Edward is holding Vivian's hand, who seems a little
          embarrassed. A young well-dressed man approaches them : he is Mr.
          Hollister, the manager of the store.

                          EDWARD
           Yes ?

          Vivian joins the two men with a broad smile.

                         

                          HOLLISTER

                          EDWARD
           Do you have anything in this shop as beautiful as she is ?

                         
          Vivian puts her head on Edward's shoulder.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Oh, yes.

                         
          Hollister understand he has made a blunder.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Oh, no ! No, no, no, I'm saying we have many things as
           beautiful as she would want them to be. That's the point I
           was getting at, and I think we can all agree with that.
           That's why when you came in...
          Edward takes Hollister's elbow and walks slightly away.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Excuse me. You know what we're gonna need here ?

                         

                          HOLLISTER

                          EDWARD
           We're gonna need a few more people helping us. I'll tell
           you why. We're going to be spending an obscene amount of
           money in here. So we're going to need a lot more help
           sucking up to us. That's what we really like. You
           understand that.

                         
          Vivian smiles behind Edward.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Sir, if I may say so, you're in the right store and the
           right city for that matter.

                         
          Later.

          catalogue on her laps and Hollister kneeling at her side.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Anything you see here, we can do, by the way. Get ready to
           have some fun. Okay ?

                         
          Vivian smiles.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Okay.

                         
          Hollister makes a sign with his hand.

                         
          Full shot of the store. In the forefront, Edward is standing
          behind a counter with a cordless telephone in his hand. He dials
          on the telephone.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Mary Pat, Mary Kate, Mary Francis, Tovah, let's see it !

                         
          He stands up. A saleswoman is running toward Vivian with a dress
          in her hands. She puts it on Vivian's laps, who puts the catalogue
          away.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Come on. Bring it out, girls.

                         

                          THE SALESWOMAN
           Oh, this is absolutely divine.

                         
          Another saleswoman, also with a dress in her hand, is coming from
          the other side.

                          HOLLISTER

           Yeah ?

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Exactly how obscene an amount of money were you talking
           about ? Just profane or really offensive ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           Really offensive.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           I like him so much !

                         
          Edward takes the phone to his ear, and Hollister walks away.

                         
          We hear the orchestral music from the title song : «Pretty Woman»
          Vivian is still seated on her armchair, looking at all the clothes
          that the saleswomen are bringing to her.

                         
          She has a very bright red dress in her hand and she looks at
          Edward.

                         
          Edward makes a face and nods «No».

                         
          A saleswoman put a black hat on Vivian's head.

                         
          Edward smiles and nods «Yes».

                         
          Hollister sits down near Vivian and a saleswoman brings a grey
          dress. Vivian points to the dress and looks at Edward.

                         
          Edward makes a face and a «So-So» sign with his hand.

                         
          Slightly later.

                         
          Edward is standing near the counter, drinking coffee. In the
          background, we see Vivian surrounded by saleswomen. Hollister
          walks toward Edward.

                         
          The music stops.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Mr. Lewis, sir. Mr. Lewis, how's it going so far ? Pretty
           well, I think.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I think we need some major sucking up.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           Very well, sir. You're not only handsome, but a powerful
           man. I could see the second you walked in here, you were
           someone to reckon with...

                         
          Edward has put the coffee cup down and has taken the telephone
          again. He turns toward Hollister.

                         

                          EDWARD

                          EDWARD
           Not me. Her.

                         
          He points toward the group of saleswomen surrounding Vivian.

                         

                          HOLLISTER
           I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry.

                         
          He walks away from Edward and toward the group of saleswomen.

          Another department of the store : the shoe department. Vivian,
          wearing a white suit with thin vertical stripes, is surrounded by
          shoes. Hollister is kneeling beside her, and a salesman is helping
          her try a new pair of shoes. Vivian smiles and looks at the
          necktie worn by the salesman.

          Edward walks toward Senator Adams, who is calling him. Philip
          keeps on laughing.

           safe with me. Listen, maybe, uh, you and I could get

          We sense that Vivian feels like crying, but she masters her
          emotions and looks at Philip.

                          PHILIP
           We'll just have to do that, hmm ?

          followed by Vivian.
          Vivian closes the door, and Edward looks at his mail lying on a
          small table. Vivian throws her hat and gloves on another table
          with a nervous movement. Edward turns around to look at her.

          She gets out of the bathroom with her arms full of clothes. She
          picks up a small handbag and puts it on her shoulder. Then she
          tries to pick up a larger handbag.

          Vivian is bare feet.

                         
          Vivian finally succeeds in picking up the bag and put the straps
          over her shoulder, on top of the smaller bag. Edward walks out of
          the bathroom and joins her.

          She crosses her arms on her bunch of clothes. She has a very
          sullen, sad face. Edward doesn't move for a couple of seconds,
          then walks to the bed, to pick up his jacket. He gets his wallet
          from the inside pocket of his jacket. He opens the wallet, and
          gets a large wad of banknotes out of it.

          The elevator bell dings. The elevator door opens, and a smiling
          Dennis appears.

          Dennis feels some tension between Edward and Vivian and stops
          smiling. He goes back into the elevator, presses a button and the
          door closes.

                         

                          VIVIAN

          They look at each other for a couple of seconds, then slowly,
          Vivian walks back to the penthouse. Edward follows her and takes
          one of her handbags from her shoulder. They both enters the
          penthouse and he closes the door behind him.

          High angle shot above the bed. Edward and Vivian are lying in the
          bed, presumably naked, but covered by a sheet from their waist
          down. They are facing each other and talking.

           First guy I ever loved was a total nothing. Second was
           worse. My mom called me a bum magnet. If there was a bum
           within a fifty-mile radius, I was completely attracted to
           him. That's how I ended up here. I followed bum number
           three.
          Slowly, the camera moves closer to them.

                          EDWARD

           I worked at a couple fast food places, parked cars at
           wrestling. And I couldn't make the rent. I was too ashamed
           to go home. That's when I met Kit. She was a hooker and
           made it sound so great. So one day I did it.

                         
          The camera stops moving forward, having reached a medium close
          shot, showing Vivian and Edward's heads and shoulders.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I cried the whole time. But then I got some regulars and,
           you know... It's not like anybody plans this. It's not your
           childhood dream.

          Edward stops walking. He doesn't seem very happy by what Philip
          just said. He slowly turns around, facing Philip.

          leans on the bar.

                         
          The door opens and Vivian appears. She is very elegantly dressed
          in a long red evening dress. She is also wearing long white
          gloves. She walks into the room. She stops in front of Edward and
          faces him. Edward moves around her.

                          VIVIAN
           Well, nothing else is gonna fit into this dress. I'll tell
           you that.

                         
          Edward picks up a mauve-colored box on the bar.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Well, maybe something in this box. I don't want you to get
           too excited. This is only on loan.

                         
          He opens the box : it's a jewel box. Vivian comes closer to the
          box and looks into it. What she sees looks like a very beautiful
          and expensive necklace. She moves her hand to touch delicately the
          necklace, but Edward snaps the lid of the box shut, almost
          squeezing her finger into it.

                          VIVIAN
           Oh !

           People's reactions to opera the first time they see it is
           very dramatic. They either love it or they hate it. If they
           love it, they will always love it. If they don't, they may
           learn to appreciate it, but it will never become part of
           their soul.

          around Edward, then she starts walking again. She stops when she
          gets near Edward. Among the tough-looking guys around Edward, we
          recognize Carlos, still wearing his eternal hat, and another guy,
          one of Carlos' lieutenants, wearing a leather jacket, and holding
          a long stick in his hands.

          releases her hair, which were tied in a bun, and walks out of the

          him on the cheek, hesitates a second, then kisses him on the lips.
          He slowly wakes up, and blinks his eyes. He answers to Vivian's
          kisses. He raises up from the bed, kissing Vivian passionately.

          head, is drying his hands on a white towel.

           got him !

                         
          He slams his towel on the counter.

           PHILIP (voice over on the phone)
           Look, if he's really caving in, I want to get him to commit
           his stocks to us this afternoon. Hmm ?

                         

                          EDWARD
           No, it's no good. If he's really caving in, I don't want to
           wait until this afternoon. Have Morse meet me downtown this
           morning. Good-bye.

                         
          He puts the phone down and grabs his jacket from a chair. He puts
          his jacket on while walking toward Vivian.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I have to go now, but I want you to understand... I heard
           everything you said. This is all I'm capable of right now.
           It's a very big step for me.

                         
          She absently straightened his tie.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           I know. It's a really good offer for a girl like me.

                         

                          EDWARD
           I've never treated you like a prostitute.
          He looks at her, then walks away toward the front door. Out of his
          hearing, Vivian whispers :

                         

                          VIVIAN

          Medium shot on the front desk. Miss Wilson, the receptionist, is
          standing behind the counter. She doesn't wear her large glasses,
          but she looks a bit worried.

                         
          The camera slowly pans across the counter, and we discover Barney,
          the manager, talking on the phone.

                         

                          BARNEY
           It's Barnard Thompson here, Miss Vivian.

                         
          The camera keeps on panning and we discover Kit, chewing gum, and
          looking in a bad mood. On the top half of her body, she is only
          wearing a bra made into a fabric with a panther-skin motif

           De Luca...

                         
          Kit extends her hand to take the phone.

                          KIT
           Yo, Viv, babe. Would you come down here ? The sphincter
           police won't let me through. Okay.

                         
          She gives the phone back to Barney.

          Barney turns toward him and Kit replaces the phone receiver on its
          hook.

          Kit bends down on the counter polished surface and blows on it.

                         
          Miss Wilson looks at her with a perplexed eye.

                         
          Kit stands up and smiles to Miss Wilson. Further along the
          counter, a couple of middle-aged customers stare at her. She turns
          her face toward them.

          The couple walks away.

                         
          Miss Wilson looks at the leaving couple, then looks at Kit with a
          suppressed smile.

                         
          Kit smiles back at her.

          Long shot on the swimming pool, seen from the terrace above the
          pool. A woman in bathing suit is coming up the stairs to the
          terrace, drying her daughter with a pink towel.

                         
          Reverse medium shot on the stairs. Vivian and Kit are coming down
          the stairs. The mother and her daughter are coming up. Vivian is
          wearing a very elegant dark pink suit with a white shirt. Kit has
          put a grey denim jacket over her panther-decorated bra, but she is
          also wearing a very short and tight black skirt. Vivian has put
          her arm in the crook of Kit's elbow.

                         
          The camera follows Kit and Vivian.

                          KIT
           Yeah, I know. They told me at the Banana you were looking
           for me.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           You were supposed to come by Tuesday. I left the money at

           Well, if you picked up the money, you wouldn't have to
           hide.

                         

                          KIT
           Hey, I was busy. I had a life, you know. Nino got beat up.
           We had to visit him in the hospital. Rachel got arrested.
           It was a mess. Anyway, I got the money.

                         
          Kit waves the envelope with the money inside.

                         

                          KIT
           Thank you very much for saving my ass. Now Carlos can get
           off of it.

                         
          Now the two girls have reached the bottom of the stair, and they
          are walking between the dinner tables surrounding the pool.

                         

                          KIT
           You know, he was talking about you last night. He would
           bust something if he saw you in this outfit.

                         
          Reverse shot. The camera is a couple of yards in front of Vivian
          and Kit, and we see the two girls coming toward us.

          Vivian points to a table.

                         

                          KIT
           No, something with shade.

                         
          Vivian points to another table.

                         

                          KIT
           You clean up real nice. You sure don't fit in down on the
           Boulevard looking like you do, not that you ever did.

                         
          Kit sits down. Then Vivian also sits down.

           Yeah. Edward asked me if I wanted to see him again. But I
           think... I think definitely no. I mean, it's just another
           week, right ?

                         
          Kit has put her chewing gum into a teaspoon and she puts the spoon
          on the table.

          briefcase. He climbs the stairs that reaches to the upper level of
          the sidewalk and the entrance of the building. He slows down when
          he hears a father talking to his son

          Reverse shot on the father and his son. The father is wearing a
          dark-blue tracksuit with advertisements printed on it. The son,
          about ten year-old, is wearing a white shirt and beige slacks. The
          father is carrying a cheap briefcase. They are running around a
          lamp-post.

          He bends down for his son to climb on his back. The son jumps on
          his back. The father sighs.

                         
          Back on Edward, standing in the middle of the stairway, and

           on one condition. I'm not so concerned about me, but the
           people who are working for me.

          Philip seems surprised by what Edward just said. A bit
          reluctantly, he says :

          and chuckles nervously.

          to leave the room.

                         
          Edward and Philip are standing, facing each other.

           Well, I no longer wish to buy your company and take it
           apart. But I don't want anyone else to, either. And it is
           still extremely vulnerable. So I find myself... in
           unfamiliar territory. I want to help you.

           I find this hard to say without sounding condescending,
           but... I'm proud of you.

          walks to the front door. The camera tilts up and we see her full
          body. She is wearing the same dark pink suit she was wearing when
          she was with Kit by the swimming-pool. She opens the door to
          Philip.

                         
          Close up shot on Vivian's face : she doesn't seem very happy to
          see Philip.

                         
          Reverse shot on Philip, a strange sneer on his face.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Well, well. Hello again. I'm looking for Edward.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Edward's not here. I thought he was with you.

                         

                          PHILIP
           No. Uh, Edward is definitely not with me.

                         
          He walks in without waiting for Vivian to invite him in.

                         
          He chuckles. Vivian closes the front door.

                         

                          PHILIP
           No, if Edward were with me...

                         
          He puts his briefcase down on the floor and walks into the room.

                         

                          PHILIP
           When. Actually, when... Edward was with me, he didn't blow
           off billion dollar deals !

                         
          He walks to the bar and helps himself for a drink.

                         

                          PHILIP
           I think that, uh, Edward's with you. That's what I think.
           Mind if I have a drink ?

                         
          He pours whisky in a glass without waiting for Vivian's answer.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           No.

                         
          He holds the glass toward her.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           No, thank you.

                         
          She walks away from him.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Well, I'll just wait.

                         
          She sits down on the sofa, crosses her legs on the couch and
          starts writing in a notebook. Behind him, Philip sits down on a
          stool near the bar.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Uh, Edward will be back soon. Any minute, he'll be home.

                         
          Medium shot on Philip at the bar. He stands up and slowly walks
          toward her. The camera follows him.

                         

                          PHILIP

                          (HE CHUCKLES)
           ...this is not home. This is, uh, a hotel room. And, uh,
           you are not... the little woman.

                         
          He sits down on the sofa, next to Vivian. She uncrosses her legs
          and lets them down on the floor. He puts his glass on the low
          table, crosses his fingers and snickers.

                         

                          PHILIP
           You're a hooker. Maybe you're a very good hooker, you
           know ?
          She puts her notebook on the low table.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Maybe if I do you, then I wouldn't care about losing
           millions of dollars. Because I have to be very honest with
           you right now, Vivian.

                         
          He moves slightly closer to her. She seems very tense by the
          situation.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Right now I really do care. I really do. And right now I am
           really pissed, you know ?

                         
          He moves his hand toward her bare leg. She glares at him.

                         

                          PHILIP
           Right now I am just freaking out. So maybe if I screw you,
           huh...

                         
          He puts his hand between her legs. She moves it away.

                         

                          PHILIP
           ...and take you to the opera, then I could be a happy guy,
           just like Edward.

                         
          He keeps on trying to fondle her, and Vivian keeps on trying to
          get rid of him.

                         

                          VIVIAN
           Hey, get off me !

                         
          They start fighting. He stands up.

           Ow !

                         
          He slaps her face very hard. She falls down on the floor.

                         

                          VIVIAN

          He kneels down beside her and grabs her.

          Edward, who has come silently into the room, grabs him from
          behind, and forces him to stand up.

           Edward !

                         
          Edward pushes him toward the front door, which is still open.

                         

                          PHILIP

          Philip falls down on the floor. He slowly stands back up

          Edward very violently punches him in the face. Philip falls down
          on the floor.

                         
          Quick shot on Vivian, seated on the sofa. She starts when she sees
          Edward punching Philip.

                         
          Philip slowly stands up, his hand on his face. Edward looks at his
          hand, who seems to hurt him after the violent punch he gave to
          Philip.

                         

                          EDWARD
           Aah ! Damn. Shit. Goddamn !

                         
          He picks up Philip's briefcase and throws it through the open
          door. It falls on the floor of the hallway.

          taking the cubes out of the box. The other hand, the one which hit
          Philip, is wrapped in a white napkin. He puts the cubes in another
          white napkin and wraps the napkin around the cubes.

          We see Edward's hand holding the napkin with the ice inside. He
          puts it on Vivian's cheek.

          Even the light touch of the napkin seems to hurt her.

                         
          The camera moves slowly away, widening the shot, and showing
          Edward in shirtsleeves bending over Vivian, without her jacket,
          and lying on the sofa.

           You know, Darryl also drove Miss Vivian home yesterday.

                         
          Edward doesn't answer, but his face indicates he has taken the
          information in.
          Back to Barney.

          Edward gives Darryl a quick look, then look absently through the
          window. He must think about something that makes him smile a
          little.

          Medium shot on a fast food stand on the street. Kit is standing in
          front of the stand, talking to Angel, another prostitute whom we
          have already briefly seen early in the film in the Blue Banana
          Club. She is drinking Coca-Cola from a paper tumbler.

                         

                          KIT
           I'm gonna have to charge you a little more rent than
           Vivian... because I've got this beauty course I'm looking
           into. I'm not gonna be there that much, you know ?

                         
          Full shot showing the whole sidewalk with the food stand in the
          middle. On the right of the food stand, a very small temporary
          flower stand in front of a closed shop. While Kit keeps on talking
          to her prospective roommate, Edward walks behind them.

                         

                          KIT
           'Cause you can't... You just can't turn tricks forever. You

          Closer shot on the flower stand and the florist, a middle-aged
          woman. Edward has just reached the stand.

                         
           ANGEL (voice over)
           Well, I always wanted to be in the Ice Capades.

                         
          Edward is looking at the flowers.

                         

                          THE FLORIST
           Help you, love ?
          Edward points to a bunch of flowers. The florist gives it to him.

                         

                          EDWARD
           There you go. Thank you very much.

                         
          He gives her money, takes the flowers and puts his wallet back
          into his jacket inside pocket. He walks away.

                         
          Back to Kit and Angel at the food stand.

          Medium full shot. Vivian is putting her handbag on her shoulder,
          getting ready to move out of the room. She has already reached the
          front door, when she hears a car honking repeatedly. She stops and
          slowly turns around.

                         
          We hear music from La Traviata, a soprano solo.

                         
          Vivian drops the bag and walks toward the window. The music gets
          louder and Vivian has a broad smile. She walks to the window.

          The limousine is slowly driving toward the hotel. The roof of the
          limousine is open, and the upper half of Edward's body is showing
          through the open roof. He has the flowers in one hand and a black
          umbrella in the other hand. The car is honking and moves closer to
          the curb.
          The car stops in front of the hotel. Edward raises one arm, the
          one with the umbrella.

          Back on the sidewalk level of the emergency exit. Edward grabs the
          emergency ladder with the hook of his umbrella, and brings it
          down.

           Pretty woman, Walking down the street. Pretty woman, The
           kind I like to meet. Pretty woman, I don't believe you.
           You're not the truth. No one could look as good as you.
           Mercy. Pretty woman won't you pardon me. Pretty woman I
           couldn't help but see, Pretty woman, That you look lovely
           as can be. Are you lonely just like me. Oh, pretty woman.

                          LYRICS
           You really took me by surprise. You're someone I've needed
           for a lifetime. Your heart was cleverly disguised, And it
           didn't look that way in my mind. Tell me how could it be. I
           was the last to know. Darling, I couldn't read what was in
           your mind, To turn around and love me, With no Explanation.
           I gave you everything I have. I didn't know that you would
           take it With sweet consideration. And after all that we've
           been through, I can't believe it's true Until I hear you
           say. Ooh ! I know now, now, now. Ah ! No explanation. I
           gave you everything I have. I didn't know that you would
           take it.

                         
          The music slowly fades out

                         
          End of credits.
