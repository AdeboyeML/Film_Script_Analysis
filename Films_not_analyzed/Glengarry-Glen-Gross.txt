SCENE ONE

A booth at a Chinese restaurant, Williamson and Levene are
seated at the booth.

                         LEVENE
            John...John...John.  Okay.  John.
            John.  Look:
                   (pause)
            The Glengarry Highland's leads,
            you're sending Roma out.  Fine.
            He's a good man.  We know what he
            is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying,
            you look at the board, he's
            throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's
            throwing them away, he's throwing
            the leads away.  All that I'm
            saying, that you're wasting leads.
            I don't want to tell you your job.
            All that I'm saying, things get
            set, I know they do, you get a
            certain mindset... A guy gets a
            reputation.  We know how this...all
            I'm saying, put a closer on the job.
            There's more than one man for the...
            Put a...wait a second, put a proven
            man out...and you watch, now wait a
            second--and you watch your dollar
            volumes...You start closing them
            for fifty 'stead of twenty-
            five...you put a closer on the...

                         WILLIAMSON
            Shelly, you blew the last...

                         LEVENE
            No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's
            back up here, I did...will you
            please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I
            didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't
            "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out,
            one I closed...

                         WILLIAMSON
            ...you didn't close...

                         LEVENE
            ...I, if you'd listen to me.
            Please.  I closed the cocksucker.
            His ex, John, his ex, I didn't know
            he was married...he, the judge
            invalidated the...

                                                            2.


                         WILLIAMSON
            Shelly...

                         LEVENE
            ...and what is that, John?  What?
            Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I
            pray in your life you will never
            find it runs in streaks.  That's
            what it does, that's all it's doing.
            Streaks.  I pray it misses you.
            That's all I want to say.

                         WILLIAMSON
                   (pause)
            What about the other two?

                         LEVENE
            What two?

                         WILLIAMSON
            Four.  You had four leads.  One
            kicked out, one the judge, you say...

                         LEVENE
            ...you want to see the court
            records?  John?  Eh?  You want to
            go down...

                         WILLIAMSON
            ...no...

                         LEVENE
            ...do you want to go downtown...?

                         WILLIAMSON
            ...no...

                         LEVENE
            ...then...

                         WILLIAMSON
            ...I only...

                         LEVENE
            ...then what is this "you say"
            shit, what is that?
                   (pause)
            What is that...?

                         WILLIAMSON
            All that I'm saying...

                                                            3.


                         LEVENE
            What is this "you say"?  A deal
            kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit,
            Williamson, shit.  You...Moss...
            Roma...look at the sheets...look at
            the sheets.  Nineteen eighty,
            eighty-one...eighty-two...six
            months of eighty-two...who's there?
            Who's up there?

                         WILLIAMSON
            Roma.

                         LEVENE
            Under him?

                         WILLIAMSON
            Moss.

                         LEVENE
            Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April,
            September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't
            fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an
            order taker, John.  He talks, he
            talks a good game, look at the
            board, and it's me, John, it's me...

                         WILLIAMSON
            Not lately it isn't.

                         LEVENE
            Lately kiss my ass lately.  That
            isn't how you build an org...talk,
            talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch.
            When we were on Peterson, who paid
            for his fucking car?  You talk to
            him.  The Seville...?  He came in,
            "You bought that for me Shelly."
            Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing.
            Sixty-five, when we were there,
            with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em
            downtown.  What was that?  Luck?
            That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John.
            You're burning my ass, I can't get
            a fucking lead...you think that was
            luck.  My stats for those years?
            Bullshit...over that period of
            time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck.
            It was skill.  You want to throw
            that away, John...?  You want to
            throw that away?

                         WILLIAMSON
            It isn't me...

                                                            4.


                         LEVENE
            ...it isn't you...?  Who is it?
            Who is this I'm talking to?  I need
            the leads...

                         WILLIAMSON
            ...after the thirtieth...

                         LEVENE
            Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get
            on the board the thirtieth, they're
            going to can my ass.  I need the
            leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm
            gone, and you're going to miss me,
            John, I swear to you.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Murray...

                         LEVENE
            ...you talk to Murray...

                         WILLIAMSON
            I have.  And my job is to marshal
            those leads...

                         LEVENE
            Marshal the leads...marshal the
            leads?  What the fuck, what bus did
            you get off of, we're here to
            fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the
            leads.  What the fuck talk is that?
            What the fuck talk is that?  Where
            did you learn that?  In school?
                   (pause)
            That's "talk," my friend, that's
            "talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm
            the man to sell.  I'm getting
            garbage.
                   (pause)
            You're giving it to me, and what
            I'm saying is it's fucked.

                         WILLIAMSON
            You're saying that I'm fucked.

                         LEVENE
            Yes.
                   (pause)
            I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Let me...

                                                            5.


                         LEVENE
            ...and I'm going to get bounced and
            you're...

                         WILLIAMSON
            ...let me...are you listening to
            me...?

                         LEVENE
            Yes.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Let me tell you something, Shelly.
            I do what I'm hired to do.
            I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to
            watch the leads.  I'm given...hold
            on, I'm given a policy.  My job is
            to do that.  What I'm told.  That's
            it.  You, wait a second, anybody
            falls below a certain mark I'm not
            permitted to give them the premium
            leads.

                         LEVENE
            Then how do they come up above that
            mark?  With dreck...?  That's
            nonsense.  Explain this to me.
            'Cause it's a waste, and it's a
            stupid waste.  I want to tell you
            something...

                         WILLIAMSON
            You know what those leads cost?

                         LEVENE
            The premium leads.  Yes.  I know
            what they cost.  John.  Because I,
            I generated the dollar revenue
            sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen
            senny-nine, you know what I made?
            Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand
            dollars.  John?  For Murray... For
            Mitch...look at the sheets...

                         WILLIAMSON
            Murray said...

                         LEVENE
            Fuck him.  Fuck Murray.  John?  You
            know?  You tell him I said so.
            What does he fucking know?  He's
            going to have a "sales"
            contest...you know what our sales
            contest used to be?
                         (MORE)

                                                            6.


                         LEVENE (CONT'D)
            Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on
            the ground.  Murray?  When was the
            last time he went out on a sit?
            Sales contest?  It's laughable.
            It's cold out there now, John.
            It's tight.  Money is tight.  This
            ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It
            just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a
            good man--but I need a...

            Murray said...

                         LEVENE
            John.  John...

                         WILLIAMSON
            Will you please wait a second.
            Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me:
            the hot leads...

                         LEVENE
            ...ah, fuck this...

                         WILLIAMSON
            The...Shelly?
                   (pause)
            The hot leads are assigned according
            to the board.  During the contest.
            Period.  Anyone who beats fifty
            per...

                         LEVENE
            That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You
            don't look at the fucking percentage.
            You look at the gross.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Either way.  You're out.

                         LEVENE
            I'm out.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Yes.

                         LEVENE
            I'll tell you why I'm out.  I'm
            out, you're giving me toilet paper.
            John.

                         LEVENE (CONT'D)
            I've seen those leads.  I saw them
            when I was at Homestead, we pitched
            those cocksuckers Rio Rancho
            nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't
            buy.  They couldn't buy a fucking
            toaster.  They're broke, John.
            They're cold.  They're deadbeats,
            you can't judge on that.  Even so.
            Even so.  Alright.  Fine.  Fine.
            Even so.  I go in, FOUR FUCKING
            LEADS they got their money in a
            sock.  They're fucking Polacks,
            John.  Four leads.  I close two.
            Two.  Fifty per...

                         WILLIAMSON
            ...they kicked out.

                         LEVENE
            They all kick out.  You run in
            streaks, pal.  Streaks.  I'm...
            I'm...don't look at the board, look
            at me.  Shelly Levene.  Anyone.
            Ask them on Western.  Ask Getz at
            Homestead.  Go ask Jerry Graff.
            You know who I am...I NEED A SHOT.
            I got to get on the fucking board.
            Ask them.  Ask them.  Ask them who
            ever picked up a check I was flush.
            Moss, Jerry Graff, Mitch
            himself...Those guys lived on the
            business I brought in.  They lived
            on it...and so did Murray, John.
            You were here you'd of benefited
            from it too.  And now I'm saying
            this.  Do I want charity?  Do I
            want pity?  I want sits.  I want
            leads that don't come right out of
            a phone book.  Give me a lead
            hotter than that, I'll go in and
            close it.  Give me a chance.
            That's all I want.  I'm going to
            get up on that fucking board and
            all I want is a chance.  It's a
            streak and I'm going to turn it
            around.
                   (pause)
            I need your help.

Pause.

                         WILLIAMSON
            I can't do it, Shelly.

                                                            8.


Pause.

                         LEVENE
            Why?

                         WILLIAMSON
            The leads are assigned randomly...

                         LEVENE
            Bullshit, bullshit, you assign
            them... What are you telling me?

                         WILLIAMSON
            ...apart from the top men on the
            contest board.

                         LEVENE
            Then put me on the board.

                         WILLIAMSON
            You start closing again, you'll be
            on the board.

                         LEVENE
            I can't close these leads, John.
            No one can.  It's a joke.  John,
            look, just give me a hot lead.
            Just give me two of the premium
            leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a
            "test" and I promise you...

                         WILLIAMSON
            I can't do it, Shel.

Pause.

                         LEVENE
            I'll give you ten percent.

Pause.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Of what?

                         LEVENE
            And what if you don't close.

                         LEVENE
            I will close.

                         WILLIAMSON
            What if you don't close...?

                                                            9.


                         LEVENE
            I will close.

                         WILLIAMSON
            What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked.
            You see...?  Then it's my job.
            That's what I'm telling you.

                         LEVENE
            I will close.  John, John, ten
            percent.  I can get hot.  You know
            that...

                         WILLIAMSON
            Not lately you can't...

                         LEVENE
            Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck
            that.  Fuck it...Get on my side.
            Go with me.  Let's do something.
            You want to run this office, run it.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Twenty percent.

Pause.

                         LEVENE
            Alright.

                         WILLIAMSON
            And fifty bucks a lead.

                         LEVENE
            John.
                   (pause)
            Listen.  I want to talk to you.
            Permit me to do this a second.  I'm
            older than you.  A man acquires a
            reputation.  On the street.  What
            he does when he's up, what he does
            otherwise...I said "ten," you said
            "no." You said "twenty." I said
            "fine," I'm not going to fuck with
            you, how can I beat that, you tell
            me?...Okay.  Okay.  We'll...Okay.
            Fine.  We'll...Alright, twenty
            percent, and fifty bucks a lead.
            That's fine.  For now.  That's fine.
            A month or two we'll talk.  A month
            from now.  Next month.  After the
            thirtieth.
                   (pause)
            We'll talk.

                                                           10.


                         WILLIAMSON
            What are we going to say?

                         LEVENE
            No.  You're right.  That's for
            later.  We'll talk in a month.
            What have you got?  I want two sits.
            Tonight.

                         WILLIAMSON
            I'm not sure I have two.

                         LEVENE
            I saw the board.  You've got four...

                         WILLIAMSON
                   (snaps)
            I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...

                         LEVENE
            Bullshit.  They ain't been in the
            office yet.  Give 'em some stiff.
            We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two
            sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of
            'em, six and ten, you can do
            it...six and ten...eight and
            eleven, I don't give a shit, you
            set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits
            in Des Plaines.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Alright.

                         LEVENE
            Good.  Now we're talking.

Pause.

                         WILLIAMSON
            A hundred bucks.

Pause.

                         LEVENE
            Now?
                   (pause)
            Now?

                         WILLIAMSON
            Now.
                   (pause)
            Yes...When?

                                                           11.


                         LEVENE
            Ah, shit, John.

Pause.

                         WILLIAMSON
            I wish I could.

                         LEVENE
            You fucking asshole.
                   (pause)
            I haven't got it.
                   (pause)
            I haven't got it, John.
                   (pause)
            I'll pay you tomorrow.
                   (pause)
            I'm coming in here with the sales,
            I'll pay you tomorrow.
                   (pause)
            I haven't got it, when I pay, the
            gas...I get back the hotel, I'll
            bring it in tomorrow.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Can't do it.

                         LEVENE
            I'll give you thirty on them now,
            I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've
            got it at the hotel.
                   (pause)
            John?
                   (pause)
            We do that, for chrissake?

                         WILLIAMSON
            No.

                         LEVENE
            I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?
                   (pause)
            John.
                   (long pause)
            John: my daughter...

                         WILLIAMSON
            I can't do it, Shelly...

                                                           12.


                         LEVENE
            Well, I want to tell you something,
            fella, wasn't long I could pick up
            the phone, call Murray and I'd have
            your job.  You know that?  Not too
            long ago.  For what?  For nothing.
            "Mur, this new kid burns my ass."
            "Shelly, he's out." You're gone
            before I'm back from lunch.  I
            bought him a trip to Bermuda once...

                         WILLIAMSON
            I have to go...
                   (gets up)


                         LEVENE
            Wait.  Alright.  Fine.
                   (starts going in
                   pocket for money)
            The one.  Give me the lead.  Give
            me the one lead.  The best one you
            have.

                         WILLIAMSON
            I can't split them.

Pause.

                         LEVENE
            Why?

                         WILLIAMSON
            Because I say so.

                         LEVENE
                   (pause)
            Is that it?  Is that it?  You want
            to do business that way...?

Williamson gets up, leaves money on the table.

                         LEVENE
            You want to do business that way...?
            Alright.  Alright.  Alright.
            Alright.  What is there on the
            other list...?

                         WILLIAMSON
            You want something off the B list?

                         LEVENE
            Yeah.  Yeah.

                                                           13.


                         WILLIAMSON
            Is that what you're saying?

                         LEVENE
            That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.
                   (pause)
            I'd like something off the other
            list.  Which, very least, that I'm
            entitled to.  If I'm still working
            here, which for the moment I guess
            that I am.
                   (pause)
            What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to
            you.

                         WILLIAMSON
            That's alright.

                         LEVENE
            The deal still stands, our other
            thing.

Williamson shrugs.  Starts out of the booth.

                         LEVENE
            Good.  Mmm.  I, you know, I left my
            wallet back at the hotel.

SCENE TWO

A booth at the restaurant.  Moss and Aaronow seated.  After
the meal.

                         MOSS
            Polacks and deadbeats.

                         AARONOW
            ...Polacks...

                         MOSS
            Deadbeats all.

                         AARONOW
            ...they hold on to their money...

                         MOSS
            All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens
            to us all.

                         AARONOW
            Where am I going to work?

                                                           14.


                         MOSS
            You have to cheer up, George, you
            aren't out yet.

                         AARONOW
            I'm not?

                         MOSS
            You missed a fucking sale.  Big
            deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal.
            How you going to sell 'em in the
            first place...?  Your mistake, you
            shoun'a took the lead.

                         AARONOW
            I had to.

                         MOSS
            You had to, yeah.  Why?

                         AARONOW
            To get on the...

                         MOSS
            To get on the board.  Yeah.  How
            you goan'a get on the board sell'n
            a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll
            tell you what else.  You listening?
            I'll tell you what else: don't ever
            try to sell an Indian.

                         AARONOW
            I'd never try to sell an Indian.

                         MOSS
            You get those names come up, you
            ever get 'em, "Patel?"

                         AARONOW
            Mmm...

                         MOSS
            You ever get 'em?

                         AARONOW
            Well, I think I had one once.

                         MOSS
            You did?

                         AARONOW
            I...I don't know.

                                                           15.


                         MOSS
            You had one you'd know it.  Patel.
            They keep coming up.  I don't know.
            They like to talk to salesmen.
                   (pause)
            They're lonely, something.
                   (pause)
            They like to feel superior, I don't
            know.  Never bought a fucking thing.
            You're sitting down "The Rio Rancho
            this, the blah blah blah," "The
            Mountain View--" "Oh yes.  My
            brother told me that..." They got a
            grapevine.  Fuckin' Indians, George.
            Not my cup of tea.  Speaking of
            which I want to tell you something:
                   (pause)
            I never got a cup of tea with them.
            You see them in the restaurants.  A
            supercilious race.  What is this
            look on their face all the time?  I
            don't know.
                   (pause)
            I don't know.  Their broads all
            look like they just got fucked with
            a dead cat, I don't know.
                   (pause)
            I don't know.  I don't like it.
            Christ...

                         AARONOW
            What?

                         MOSS
            The whole fuckin' thing...The
            pressure's just too great.  You're
            ab...you're absolu...they're too
            important.  All of them.  You go in
            the door.  I..."I got to close this
            fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or
            I don't win the Cadillac..." We
            fuckin' work too hard.  You work
            too hard.  We all, I remember when
            we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross
            Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of
            that..."

                         AARONOW
            They came in and they, you know...

                         MOSS
            Well, they fucked it up.

                                                           16.


                         AARONOW
            They did.

                         MOSS
            They killed the goose.

                         AARONOW
            They did.

                         MOSS
            And now...

                         AARONOW
            We're stuck with this...

                         MOSS
            We're stuck with this fucking shit...

                         AARONOW
            ...this shit...

                         MOSS
            It's too...

                         AARONOW
            It is.

                         MOSS
            Eh?

                         AARONOW
            It's too...

                         MOSS
            You get a bad month, all of a...

                         AARONOW
            You're on this...

            Some contest board...

            I...

                         MOSS
            It's not right.

                                                           17.


                         AARONOW
            It's not.

                         MOSS
            No.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            And it's not right to the customers.

                         MOSS
            I know it's not.  I'll tell you,
            you got, you know, you got...what
            did I learn as a kid on Western?
            Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him
            five cars over fifteen years.

                         AARONOW
            That's right?

                         MOSS
            Eh...?

                         AARONOW
            That's right?

                         MOSS
            Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys
            come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I
            know what I'll do: I'll go in and
            rob everyone blind and go to
            Argentina cause nobody ever thought
            of this before."

                         AARONOW
            ...that's right...

                         MOSS
            Eh?

                         AARONOW
            No.  That's absolutely right.

                         MOSS
            And so they kill the goose.  I, I,
            I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked

                         AARONOW

            Shoes, boots, yes...

                         MOSS
            For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand

                         AARONOW
            For some sales pro...

            ...sales promotion, "You lose, then
            we fire your..." No.  It's

                         AARONOW
            Yes.

                         MOSS
            Yes, it is.  And you know who's
            responsible?

                         AARONOW
            Who?

                         MOSS
            You know who it is.  It's Mitch.
            And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have
            to be this way.

                         AARONOW
            No.

                         MOSS
            Look at Jerry Graff.  He's clean,
            he's doing business for himself,
            he's got his, that list of his with
            the nurses...see?  You see?  That's
            thinking.  Why take ten percent?  A
            ten percent comm...why are we
            giving the rest away?  What are we
            giving ninety per...for nothing.
            For some jerk sit in the office
            tell you "Get out there and close."
            "Go win the Cadillac." Graff.  He
            goes out and buys.  He pays top
            dollar for the... you see?

                         AARONOW
            Yes.

                                                           19.


                         MOSS
            That's thinking.  Now, he's got the
            leads, he goes in business for
            himself.  He's...that's what I...
            that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a
            steady job, a couple bucks nobody's
            touched, who?"

                         AARONOW
            Nurses.

                         MOSS
            So Graff buys a fucking list of
            nurses, one grand--if he paid two
            I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand
            nurses, and he's going wild...

                         AARONOW
            He is?

                         MOSS
            He's doing very well.

                         AARONOW
            I heard that they were running cold.

                         MOSS
            The nurses?

                         AARONOW
            Yes.

                         MOSS
            You hear a lot of things...He's
            doing very well.  He's doing very
            well.

                         AARONOW
            With River Oaks?

                         MOSS
            River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of
            that shit.  Somebody told me, you
            know what he's clearing himself?
            Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.

                         AARONOW
            Himself?

                                                           20.


                         MOSS
            That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The
            leads.  He's got the good leads...
            what are we, we're sitting in the
            shit here.  Why?  We have to go to
            them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety
            percent our sale, we're paying to
            the office for the leads.

                         AARONOW
            The leads, the overhead, the
            telephones, there's lots of things.

                         MOSS
            What do you need? A telephone, some
            broad to say "Good morning,"
            nothing...nothing...

                         AARONOW
            No, it's not that simple, Dave...

                         MOSS
            Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you
            know what the hard part is?

                         AARONOW
            What?

                         MOSS
            Starting up.

                         AARONOW
            What hard part?

                         MOSS
            Of doing the thing.  The dif...the
            difference.  Between me and Jerry
            Graff.  Going to business for
            yourself.  The hard part is...you
            know what it is?

                         AARONOW
            What?

                         MOSS
            Just the act.

                         AARONOW
            What act?

                                                           21.


                         MOSS
            To say "I'm going on my own."
            'Cause what you do, George, let me
            tell you what you do: you find
            yourself in thrall to someone else.
            And we enslave ourselves.  To
            please.  To win some fucking
            toaster...to...to... and the guy
            who got there first made up those...

                         AARONOW
            That's right...

                         MOSS
            He made up those rules, and we're
            working for him.

                         AARONOW
            That's the truth...

                         MOSS
            That's the God's truth.  And it
            gets me depressed.  I swear that it
            does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn:
            "Somebody wins the Cadillac this
            month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."

                         AARONOW
            Huh.

                         MOSS
            You don't ax your sales force.

                         AARONOW
            No.

                         MOSS
            You...

                         AARONOW
            You...

                         MOSS
            You build it!

                         AARONOW
            That's what I...

                         MOSS
            You fucking build it!  Men come...

                         MOSS
            ...you're absolutely right.

                         AARONOW
            They...

            They have...

            Look look look look, when they

            fucking turn around, enslave them,
            treat them like children, fuck them
            up the ass, leave them to fend for

            You're absolutely right, and I want

                         AARONOW
            What?

            I want to tell you what somebody
            should do.

                         AARONOW
            What?

                         MOSS
            Someone should stand up and strike
            back.

                         AARONOW
            What do you mean?

            Somebody...

            Yes...?

                         MOSS
            Should do something to them.

                         AARONOW
            What?

                                                           23.


                         MOSS
            Something.  To pay them back.

            Someone, someone should hurt them.
            Murray and Mitch.

            Someone should hurt them.

                         MOSS
            Yes.

                         AARONOW
                   (pause)
            How?

                         MOSS
            How?  Do something to hurt them.
            Where they live.

                         AARONOW
            What?
                   (pause)


                         MOSS
            Someone should rob the office.

                         AARONOW
            Huh.

                         MOSS
            That's what I'm saying.  We were,
            if we were that kind of guys, to
            knock it off, and trash the joint,
            it looks like robbery, and take the
            fuckin' leads out of the files...go
            to Jerry Graff.

Long pause.

                         AARONOW
            What could somebody get for them?

                         MOSS
            What could we get for them?  I

            half a throw...I don't know...Hey,
            who knows what they're worth, what
            do they pay for them?  All

            How many leads have we got?

                         MOSS
            The Glengarry...the premium leads...?
            I'd say we got five thousand.  Five.
            Five thousand leads.

                         AARONOW
            And you're saying a fella could
            take and sell these leads to Jerry
            Graff.

                         MOSS
            Yes.

                         AARONOW
            How do you know he'd buy them?

                         MOSS
            Graff?  Because I worked for him.

                         AARONOW
            You haven't talked to him.

                         MOSS
            No.  What do you mean?  Have I
            talked to him about this?

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            Yes.  I mean are you actually
            talking about this, or are we just...

                         MOSS
            No, we're just...

                         AARONOW
            We're just "talking" about it.

                         MOSS
            We're just speaking about it.

            As an idea.

                         AARONOW
            As an idea.

                         MOSS
            Yes.

            We're not actually talking about it.

            No.

            Talking about it as a...

            As a robbery.

                         MOSS
            As a "robbery"?!  No.

                         AARONOW
            Well.  Well...

                         MOSS
            Hey.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            So all this, um, you didn't,
            actually, you didn't go talk to
            Graff.

                         MOSS
            Not actually, no.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            You didn't?

                         MOSS
            No.  Not actually.

                         AARONOW
            Did you?

                         MOSS
            What did you say?

                         MOSS
            Yes.
                   (pause)
            I said, "Not actually." The fuck
            you care, George?  We're just
            talking...

                         AARONOW
            We are?

                                                           26.


                         MOSS
            Yes.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            Because, because, you know, it's a
            crime.

                         MOSS
            That's right.  It's a crime.  It is
            a crime.  It's also very safe.

                         AARONOW
            You're actually talking about this?

                         MOSS
            That's right.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            You're going to steal the leads?

                         MOSS
            Have I said that?

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            Are you?

Pause.

                         MOSS
            Did I say that?

                         AARONOW
            Did you talk to Graff?

                         MOSS
            Is that what I said?

                         AARONOW
            What did he say?

                         MOSS
            What did he say?  He'd buy them.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            You're going to steal the leads and
            sell the leads to him?

                                                           27.


Pause.

                         MOSS
            Yes.

                         AARONOW
            What will he pay?

                         MOSS
            A buck a shot.

                         AARONOW
            For five thousand?

                         MOSS
            However they are, that's the deal.
            A buck a throw.  Five thousand
            dollars.  Split it half and half.

                         AARONOW
            You're saying "me."

                         MOSS
            Yes.
                   (pause)
            Twenty-five hundred apiece.  One
            night's work, and the job with
            Graff.  Working the premium leads.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            A job with Graff.

                         MOSS
            Is that what I said?

                         AARONOW
            He'd give me a job.

                         MOSS
            He would take you on.  Yes.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            Is that the truth?

                                                           28.


                         MOSS
            Yes.  It is, George.
                   (pause)
            Yes.  It's a big decision.
                   (pause)
            And it's a big reward.
                   (pause)
            It's a big reward.  For one night's
            work.
                   (pause)
            But it's got to be tonight.

                         AARONOW
            What?

                         MOSS
            What?  What?  The leads.

                         AARONOW
            You have to steal the leads tonight?

                         MOSS
            That's right, the guys are moving
            them downtown.  After the thirtieth.
            Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.

                         AARONOW
            You're, you're saying so you have
            to go in there tonight and...

                         MOSS
            You...

                         AARONOW
            I'm sorry?

                         MOSS
            You.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            Me?

                         MOSS
            You have to go in.
                   (pause)
            You have to get the leads.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            I do?

                                                           29.


                         MOSS
            Yes.

                         AARONOW
            I...

                         MOSS
            It's not something for nothing,
            George, I took you in on this, you
            have to go.  That's your thing.
            I've made the deal with Graff.  I
            can't go.  I can't go in, I've
            spoken on this too much.  I've got
            a big mouth.
                   (pause)
            "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah
            blah blah "...the fucking tight ass
            company..."

                         AARONOW
            They'll know when you go over to
            Graff...

                         MOSS
            What will they know?  That I stole
            the leads?  I didn't steal the
            leads, I'm going to the movies
            tonight with a friend, and then I'm
            going to the Como Inn.  Why did I
            go to Graff?  I got a better deal.
            Period.  Let 'em prove something.
            They can't prove anything that's
            not the case.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            Dave.

                         MOSS
            Yes.

                         AARONOW
            You want me to break into the
            office tonight and steal the leads?

                         MOSS
            Yes.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            No.

                                                           30.


                         MOSS
            Oh, yes, George.

                         AARONOW
            What does that mean?

                         MOSS
            Listen to this.  I have an alibi,
            I'm going to the Como Inn, why?
            Why?  The place gets robbed,
            they're going to come looking for
            me.  Why?  Because I probably did
            it.  Are you going to turn me in?
                   (pause)
            George?  Are you going to turn me in?

                         AARONOW
            What if you don't get caught?

                         MOSS
            They come to you, you going to turn
            me in?

                         AARONOW
            Why would they come to me?

                         MOSS
            They're going to come to everyone.

                         AARONOW
            Why would I do it?

                         MOSS
            You wouldn't, George, that's why
            I'm talking to you.  Answer me.
            They come to you.  You going to
            turn me in?

                         AARONOW
            No.

                         MOSS
            Are you sure?

                         AARONOW
            Yes.  I'm sure.

                         MOSS
            Then listen to this: I have to get
            those leads tonight.  That's
            something I have to do.  If I'm not
            at the movies...if I'm not eating
            over at the inn...If you don't do
            this, then I have to come in here...

                                                           31.


                         AARONOW
            ...you don't have to come in...

                         MOSS
            ...and rob the place...

                         AARONOW
            ...I thought that we were only
            talking...

                         MOSS
            ...they take me, then.  They're
            going to ask me who were my
            accomplices.

                         AARONOW
            Me?

                         MOSS
            Absolutely.

                         AARONOW
            That's ridiculous.

                         MOSS
            Well, to the law, you're an
            accessory.  Before the fact.

                         AARONOW
            I didn't ask to be.

                         MOSS
            Then tough luck, George, because
            you are.

                         AARONOW
            Why?  Why, because you only told me
            about it?

                         MOSS
            That's right.

                         AARONOW
            Why are you doing this to me, Dave.
            Why are you talking this way to me?
            I don't understand.  Why are you
            doing this at all...?

                         MOSS
            That's none of your fucking
            business...

                                                           32.


                         AARONOW
            Well, well, well, talk to me, we
            sat down to eat dinner, and here
            I'm a criminal...

                         MOSS
            You went for it.

                         AARONOW
            In the abstract...

                         MOSS
            So I'm making it concrete.

                         AARONOW
            Why?

                         MOSS
            Why?  Why you going to give me five
            grand?

                         AARONOW
            Do you need five grand?

                         MOSS
            Is that what I just said?

                         AARONOW
            You need money?  Is that the...

                         MOSS
            Hey, hey, let's just keep it
            simple, what I need is not
            the...what do you need...?

                         AARONOW
            What is the five grand?
                   (pause)
            What is the, you said that we were
            going to split five...

                         MOSS
            I lied.
                   (pause)
            Alright?  My end is my business.
            Your end's twenty-five.  In or out.
            You tell me, you're out you take
            the consequences.

                         AARONOW
            I do?

                         MOSS
            Yes.

                                                           33.


Pause.

                         AARONOW
            And why is that?

                         MOSS
            Because you listened.

SCENE THREE

The restaurant.  Roma is seated alone at the booth.  Lingk
is at the booth next to him.  Roma is talking to him.

                         ROMA
            ...all train compartments smell
            vaguely of shit.  It gets so you
            don't mind it.  That's the worst
            thing that I can confess.  You know
            how long it took me to get there?
            A long time.  When you die you're
            going to regret the things you
            don't do.  You think you're queer...?
            I'm going to tell you something:
            we're all queer.  You think that
            you're a thief?  So what?  You get
            befuddled by a middle-class
            morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut
            it out.  You cheated on your
            wife...?  You did it, live with it.
                   (pause)
            You fuck little girls, so be it.
            There's an absolute morality?  May
            be.  And then what?  If you think
            there is, then be that thing.  Bad
            people go to hell?  I don't think
            so.  If you think that, act that
            way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes.
            I won't live in it.  That's me.
            You ever take a dump made you feel
            you'd just slept for twelve hours...?

                         LINGK
            Did I...?

                         ROMA
            Yes.

            Or a piss...?  A great meal fades
            in reflection.  Everything else
            gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's
            only food.  This shit we eat, it
            keeps us going.  But it's only food.
            The great fucks that you may have

            what is is, it's probably not the
            orgasm.  Some broads, forearms on
            your neck, something her eyes did.
            There was a sound she made...or,
            me, lying, in the, I'll tell you:
            me lying in bed; the next day she
            brought me café au lait.  She gives
            me a cigarette, my balls feel like
            concrete.  Eh?  What I'm saying,
            what is our life?

            It's looking forward or it's

            The bank closes.  We get sick, my

            down...what of these happen...?
            None on 'em.  We worry anyway.

            That's a trap.  There is no measure.
            Only greed.  How can we act?

            The right way, we would say, to
            deal with this: "There is a one-in-
            a-million chance that so and so
            will happen...Fuck it, it won't
            happen to me..." No.  We know
            that's not the right way I think.
                   (pause)
            We say the correct way to deal with
            this is "There is a one-in-so-and-
            so chance this will happen...God
            protect me.  I am powerless, let it
            not happen to me..." But no to that.
            I say.  There's something else.
            What is it? "If it happens, AS IT
            MAY for that is not within our
            powers, I will deal with it, just
            as I do today with what draws my
            concern today." I say this is how
            we must act.  I do those things
            which seem correct to me today.  I
            trust myself.  And if security
            concerns me, I do that which today
            I think will make me secure.  And
            every day I do that, when that day
            arrives that I need a reserve, [a]
            odds are that I have it, and [b]
            the true reserve that I have is the
            strength that I have of acting each
            day without fear.

            An opportunity.  To what?  To make

            Perhaps.  To "indulge" and to
            "learn" about ourselves?  Perhaps.
            So fucking what?  What isn't?
            They're an opportunity.  That's all.
            They're an event.  A guy comes up

                         LEVENE
            What Roma's trying to tell you.
            What I told you yesterday.  Why you
            don't belong in this business.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Why I don't...

                         LEVENE
            You listen to me, someday you might
            say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you
            just listen what I'm going to say:
            your partner depends on you.  Your
            partner...a man who's your "partner"
            depends on you...you have to go
            with him and for him...or you're
            shit, you're shit, you can't exist
            alone...

                         WILLIAMSON
                   (brushing past him)
            Excuse me...

                         LEVENE
            ...excuse me, nothing, you be as
            cold as you want, but you just
            fucked a good man out of six
            thousand dollars and his goddamn
            bonus 'cause you didn't know the
            shot, if you can do that and you
            aren't man enough that it gets you,
            then I don't know what, if you
            can't take some thing from that...
                   (blocking his way)
            you're scum, you're fucking white-
            bread.  You be as cold as you want.
            A child would know it, he's right.
                   (pause)
            You're going to make something up,
            be sure it will help or keep your
            mouth closed.

Pause.

                                                           84.


                         WILLIAMSON
            Mmm.

Levene lifts up his arm.

                         LEVENE
            Now I'm done with you.

Pause.

                         WILLIAMSON
            How do you know I made it up?

                         LEVENE
                   (pause)
            What?

                         WILLIAMSON
            How do you know I made it up?

                         LEVENE
            What are you talking about?

                         WILLIAMSON
            You said, "You don't make something
            up unless it's sure to help."
                   (pause)
            How did you know that I made it up?

                         LEVENE
            What are you talking about?

                         WILLIAMSON
            I told the customer that his
            contracts had gone to the bank.

                         LEVENE
            Well, hadn't it?

                         WILLIAMSON
            No.
                   (pause)
            It hadn't.

                         LEVENE
            Don't fuck with me, John, don't
            fuck with me...what are you saying?

                                                           85.


                         WILLIAMSON
            Well, I'm saying this, Shel:
            usually I take the contracts to the
            bank.  Last night I didn't.  How
            did you know that?  One night in a
            year I left a contract on my desk.
            Nobody knew that but you.  Now how
            did you know that?
                   (pause)
            You want to talk to me, you want to
            talk to someone else...because this
            is my job.  This is my job on the
            line, and you are going to talk to
            me.  Now how did you know that
            contract was on my desk?

                         LEVENE
            You're so full of shit.

                         WILLIAMSON
            You robbed the office.

                         LEVENE
                   (laughs)
            Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.

                         WILLIAMSON
            What'd you do with the leads?
                   (pause, points to the
                   Detective's room)
            You want to go in there?  I tell
            him what I know, he's going to dig
            up something...You got an alibi
            last night?  You better have one.
            What did you do with the leads?  If
            you tell me what you did with the
            leads, we can talk.

                         LEVENE
            I don't know what you are saying.

                         WILLIAMSON
            If you tell me where the leads are,
            I won't turn you in.  If you don't,
            I am going to tell the cop you
            stole them, Mitch and Murray will
            see that you go to jail.  Believe
            me they will.  Now, what did you do
            with the leads?  I'm walking in
            that door--you have five seconds to
            tell me: or you are going to jail.

                         LEVENE
            I...

                                                           86.


                         WILLIAMSON
            I don't care.  You understand?
            Where are the leads?
                   (pause)
            Alright.

Williamson goes to open the office door.

                         LEVENE
            I sold them to Jerry Graff.

                         WILLIAMSON
            How much did you get for them?
                   (pause)
            How much did you get for them?

                         LEVENE
            Five thousand.  I kept half.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Who kept the other half?

Pause.

                         LEVENE
            Do I have to tell you?
                   (pause, Williamson
                   starts to open the door)
            Moss.

                         WILLIAMSON
            That was easy, wasn't it?

Pause.

                         LEVENE
            It was his idea.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Was it?

                         LEVENE
            I...I'm sure he got more than the
            five, actually.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Uh-huh?

                         LEVENE
            He told me my share was twenty-five.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Mmm.

                                                           87.


                         LEVENE
            Okay: I...look: I'm going to make
            it worth your while.  I am.  I
            turned this thing around.  I closed
            the old stuff, I can do it again.
            I'm the one's going to close 'em.
            I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this
            thing a...I can do that, I can do
            anyth...last night.  I'm going to
            tell you, I was ready to Do the
            Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this,
            we'll get well..." Why not.  Big
            fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping
            to get caught.  To put me out of
            my...
                   (pause)
            But it taught me something.  What
            it taught me, that you've got to
            get out there.  Big deal.  So I
            wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I
            was cut out to be a salesman.  And
            now I'm back, and I got my balls
            back...and, you know, John, you
            have the advantage on me now:
            Whatever it takes to make it right,
            we'll make it right.  We're going
            to make it right.

                         WILLIAMSON
            I want to tell you something,
            Shelly.  You have a big mouth.

Pause.

                         LEVENE
            What?

                         WILLIAMSON
            You've got a big mouth, and now I'm
            going to show you an even bigger
            one.
                   (starts toward the
                   Detective's door)


                         LEVENE
            Where are you going, John?...you
            can't do that, you don't want to do
            that...hold, hold on...hold on...

            No, I don't think so, Shel.

                         LEVENE
            I...

                         WILLIAMSON
            No, I think I don't want your money.
            I think you fucked up my office.
            And I think you're going away.

            I'm going to give you twenty
            percent of my sales...
                   (pause)
            Twenty percent.
                   (pause)
            For as long as I am with the firm.

            Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.

                         WILLIAMSON
            What sales?

                                                           89.

            they used to call in every week.
            When I was with Webb.  And we were
            selling Arizona...they're nuts...did
            you see how they were living?  How

                   (pause)
            The people are insane.  They just
            like talking to salesmen.

Williamson starts for door.

                         LEVENE
            Don't.

                         WILLIAMSON
            I'm sorry.

                         LEVENE
            Why?

                         WILLIAMSON
            Because I don't like you.

                         LEVENE

            were slinging on my guy today was
            so good...it...it was, and, excuse
            me, 'cause it isn't even my place
            to say it.  It was admirable...it
            was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been
            on a hot streak, so what?  There's
            things that I could learn from you.
            You eat today?

                         LEVENE
            Me.

                         ROMA
            Yeah.

                         LEVENE
            Mm.

                         ROMA
            Well, you want to swing by the
            Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?

                         LEVENE
            I think I'd better stay here for a
            while.

Baylen sticks his head out of the room:

                         BAYLEN
            Mr. Levene...?

                         ROMA
            You're done, come down, and let's...

                         BAYLEN
            Would you come in here, please?

                         ROMA
            And let's put this together.  Okay?
            Shel?  Say okay.

Pause.

                         LEVENE
                   (softly to himself)
            Huh.

                                                           92.


                         BAYLEN
            Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.

                         ROMA
            I'm going to the Chinks.  You're
            done, come down, we're going to
            smoke a cigarette.

                         LEVENE
            I...

                         BAYLEN
                   (comes over)
            ...Get in the room.

                         ROMA
            Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's
            the "Machine." That is Shelly "The
            Machine" Lev...

                         BAYLEN
            Get in the goddamn room.

Baylen starts manhandling Shelly into the room.

                         LEVENE
            Ricky, I...

                         ROMA
            Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...

                         LEVENE
            Ricky...

                         BAYLEN
            "Ricky" can't help you, pal.

                         LEVENE
            ...I only want to...

                         BAYLEN
            Yeah.  What do you want?  You want
            to what?

He pushes Levene into the room, closes the door behind him.
Pause.

                         ROMA
            Williamson: listen to me: when the
            leads come in...listen to me: when
            the leads come in I want my top two
            off the list.  For me.  My usual
            two.  Anything you give Levene...

                                                           93.


                         WILLIAMSON
            ...I wouldn't worry about it.

                         ROMA
            Well I'm going to worry about it,
            and so are you, so shut up and
            listen.
                   (pause)
            I GET HIS ACTION.  My stuff is
            mine, whatever he gets for himself,
            I'm talking half.  You put me in
            with him.

Aaronow enters.

                         AARONOW
            Did they...?

                         ROMA
            You understand?

                         AARONOW
            Did they catch...?

                         ROMA
            Do you understand?  My stuff is
            mine, his stuff is ours.  I'm
            taking half of his commissions--
            now, you work it out.

                         WILLIAMSON
            Mmm.

                         AARONOW
            Did they find the guy who broke
            into the office yet?

                         ROMA
            No.  I don't know.

Pause.

                         AARONOW
            Did the leads come in yet?

                         ROMA
            No.

                         AARONOW
                   (settling into a desk chair)
            Oh, God, I hate this job.

                         ROMA
                   (simultaneous with
                   "job," exiting the office)
            I'll be at the restaurant.
