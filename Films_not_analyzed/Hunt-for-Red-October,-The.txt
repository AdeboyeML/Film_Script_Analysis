          I've been working on a sound I heard
          when the typhoon disappeared. I washed
          it through the tape machine several times
          and managed to isolate it. But when I
          asked the computer to identify it, the
          answer I got. was magma displacement.

          Yes sir. See, the system we are

          Aye, aye, sir. Anyway,; I got curious,
          and. started tracking. the sound on our
          lateral array. I located it four
          different times. The fifth time it
          was gone and I couldn't find it. But

          Then at zero-nine-thirty hours it was
          bearing two-six-zero. And at zero-nine-
          forty-eight is was two-ive-zero.

                         (ANOTHER LINE)
          I came back to it at about ten-hundred
          and the bearing was two-four-two. The
          last signal was real faint and I didn't
          have a very good lock on it.

          So?

          Well, I figure it couldn't be very far
          away from us, right? Let's say it was
          halfway between us and Iceland. That
          would put it on a course like this.
          Jones makes more calculations on the. status board. Mancuso
          recognizes a pattern:

          Headed directly into Red Route One.

          Exactly. Sir, I believe the sound I
          heard is the acoustical signature of some
          kind of super-quiet Russian submarine and
          he's taking the inshore track off the
          Iceland coast.
