          Cut to "The Hippodrome Theater," one-time downtown movie
          palace, now abandoned and boarded up with broken and
          blank marquee. The credits to our movie continue by
          fading in on marquee.

          Cut to thriving "Harbor Court" theaters, downtown
          chain. All six marquees list the same two
          mega-budget Hollywood hits. Hollywood titles fade
          out and "Cecil B. DeMented" title logo fades into
          marquee in all its terrorist glory.

          on marquee of this one-time neighborhood theater.
          "FOR RENT" sign fades out and our credits fade in

          Cut to "Towson Commons," a modern cineplex down the
          street. All the titles listed on marquee are
          sequels. Sequel titles fade out and our credits
          fade in on marquee.

          Cut to "5 West Theater," one-time art house. The
          marquee now announces "Sunday Church Service" which
          fades out and our credits continue, fading in.
          Cut to "Westview Mall," suburban multiplex, all
          the titles listed on marquee are recent Hollywood
          comedy bombs. The Hollywood titles fade out and our
          credits fade in.

          Cut to "New Theater," once a popular downtown premiere
          spot. The marquee reads C-L-O-S-E-D in badly spaced

          20-year-old theater manager as he adjusts the final
          letter of the film's title on the marquee, perched atop
          a ladder. SINCLAIR is dressed in an obviously rented
          tuxedo and for a moment seems like any other middle
          class suburban kid.

          sourpussed but unconventionally striking cashier;
          CHARDONNAY, the African-American ticket-taker with a
          huge 90's hairdo so popular with the black girls in
          Baltimore; RAVEN, the happy and always smiling pretty
          usherette, and FIDGET, the dweebish but somehow sexy
          janitor. All have made an attempt to dress up their
          usual uniforms for the premiere.

          HONEY WHITLOCK turns from beautiful Inner Harbor view
          outside hotel window and we see she is about forty
          years old and a complete knockout.

          Ah, what a town!
          HONEY is dressed for the premiere in an elegant evening
          gown and her black hair is cut perfectly in the Louise
          Brooks style that has become her signature. She
          continues her press conference under the watchful eyes
          of her press agent CHARLES and her long-time assistant
          LIBBY, both of whom are also dressed for the premiere.
          ROOM SERVICE employees stand by, ready to serve.

          Baltimore, you don't need to

          MR. STILLINGS lectures his other staff members as
          CATERERS and BARTENDERS set up behind him. SINCLAIR
          STEVENS is paying close attention as is LYLE, the
          projectionist, a handsome but surprisingly gaunt young
          man. CHERISH, a sexy and slightly nasty candy-counter
          girl leers at SINCLAIR who flirts back as she feigns
          interest in MR. STILLINGS' pep talk. PAM the popcorn
          girl, a masculine but beautiful nineteen year old with a
          seemingly bad attitude and LEWIS, the young cool
          African-American usher with a chip on his shoulder join
          FIDGET, RAVEN and DINAH.

          FAMILIES' eyes light up in rage as they charge
          CECIL, HONEY and SPROCKET HOLES, pelting them with
          their concession candies.
          Completely outnumbered, and out of ammunition, CECIL
          realizes they had better run for their lives.

          CECIL and his SPROCKET HOLES round the corner and
          stop in happiness at seeing the theater. CECIL
          smiles in relief and beckons his gang to follow as
          FAMILIES gain on them in fury.

          AUDIENCE of inner city ACTION FANS watch on the edge of their
          seats, cheering their hero Jackie Chan.
          Suddenly CECIL runs into front of theater through
          fire door with HONEY and SPROCKET HOLES.

          FAMILIES rush into theater and freeze in horror at
          the sight of ACTION FANS.
          As karate mayhem rages on screen, ACTION FANS attack
          FAMILIES with karate chops and FAMILIES turn in their
          tracks and run for their lives.
          HONEY is mobbed by ACTION FANS who beg for
          autographs. HONEY signs, confused but willing.

          vodka bottle from their filthy dirty freezer and goes
          about the ritual of making the perfect martini.
          LEWIS, proudly displaying his brand, DJ's the music as

          and spots her being hustled away by SATANIST-TYPE FANS
          outside concession stand moments before the plate glass
          windows are shattered by police gunfire.

          PETIE is jumped and arrested by special SWAT TEAM
          wearing rubber gloves and surgical masks. PETIE laughs
          and moans in S & M pleasure as he tries to grope an
          especially macho MEMBER OF SWAT TEAM.

          FIDGET struggles to climb up marquee to search for his
          PARENTS but he doesn't see them. He angrily starts
          throwing down letters as weapons at fleeing cars,
          smashing the window of bleeding, injured JOCKS A, B &

          With only a few letters left on the marquee, FIDGET
          re-arranges them to read T-H-E- E-N-O before a SWAT TEA,
          bullet tears into him. FIDGET falls and lands on the
          hood of his PARENTS' car as they exit the drive-in.

          HONEY, bald, bleeding, and burned, sees RAVEN and their
          eyes lock in friendship as RAVEN escapes into SATANIST
          FAN's car. RAVEN happily gives HONEY the extended index
          and little finger satanic sign and then turns it into a
          thumbs-up gesture of the future.

          HONEY blows RAVEN a kiss and then looks back at the
          CROWD in confusion and begins her long mad walk to
          paddy-wagon through FANS, ENEMIES, MOVIE AGENTS,
          LAWYERS, NEWS TEAMS, and dumbfounded LAW ENFORCEMENT
          OFFICERS who all want something from HONEY. As the
          soundtrack swells triumphantly over the din of jeers,
          applause, career advice, legal strategies and requests
          for autographs and interviews, HONEY begins to smile in
          full movie star insanity and waves and blows kisses to
          the CROWD as if she just won the Oscar.
