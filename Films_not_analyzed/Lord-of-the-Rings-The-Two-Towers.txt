                           [TITLE:  THE LORD OF THE RINGS]



                         [Camera pans over the Misty Mountains 
                         as voices drift in from the background.]
 
                         
                                     GANDALF
                         You cannot pass!

                                     FRODO
                         Gandalf!

                                     GANDALF
                         I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder 
                         of the Flame of Anor!
 
                         [Camera pans closer to the mountain 
                         side.]
 
                                     GANDALF
                         Argh! Go back to the shadow. The Dark 
                         Fire will not avail you, Flame of Udûn! 
                         [Camera zooms in through the mountain 
                         and focuses on Gandalf and the Balrog 
                         on the bridge of Khazad-dûm. The Balrog 
                         strikes down on Gandalf with its flaming 
                         sword. Gandalf parries the blow with 
                         Glamdring, shattering the Balrogs sword.] 
                         YOU SHALL NOT... PASS!!!
 
                         [Gandalf strikes his staff onto the 
                         bridge. As the Balrog steps forward, 
                         the bridge collapses from under it and 
                         the demon plunges backward into the 
                         chasm. Gandalf, exhausted, leans on 
                         his staff and watches the Balrog fall 
                         then turns to follow the others. At 
                         the last minute, the flaming whip lashes 
                         up from the depths of the abyss and 
                         winds around Gandalfs ankle, dragging 
                         him over the edge. He clings onto the 
                         bridge but is straining to keep his 
                         grip.]
 
                                     GANDALF
                         Argh!

                         [Frodo rushes forward but Boromir restrains 
                         him.]
 
                                     BOROMIR
                         No! No!

                                     FRODO
                         Gandalf!

                                     GANDALF
                         Fly, you fools!

                         [Gandalf loses his grip and falls into 
                         the chasm]
 
                                     FRODO
                         Noooooooooooooooo!!!!

                         [Gandalf loses his grip and falls into 
                         the chasm]
 
                                     FRODO
                         [Calls after Gandalf as he falls into 
                         the abyss] Gaaandaaaaalf!!
 
                         [Gandalf falls after the Balrog and 
                         grabs hold of his sword Glamdring on 
                         his way down. As they continue to plunge 
                         into the depths, Gandalf hacks away 
                         at the Balrog even as it thrashes and 
                         bounces off the walls. They continue 
                         to plunge at great speed, sometimes 
                         with Gandalf clinging to the horn of 
                         the demon. The battling pair then falls 
                         into an enormous cavern and plunges 
                         into the water. Just then Frodo awakens 
                         as if from a nightmare.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         Gandalf!

                                     SAM
                         What is it, Mr. Frodo?

                                     FRODO
                         Nothing. Just a dream. [Lies back down.]
 
                         
                         [Frodo and Sam climbs over the rocky 
                         terrain Emyn Muil. They look into the 
                         distance at the Mountain of Fire.]
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth 
                         we dont want to see any closer, and 
                         the one place were trying to get to. 
                         Its just where we cant get. Lets 
                         face it, Mr. Frodo, were lost. I dont 
                         think Gandalf meant for us to come this 
                         way.
 
                                     FRODO
                         He didnt mean for a lot of things to 
                         happen, Sam... but they did.
 
                         [Suddenly Frodo feels and sees the Eye 
                         zooming in on him. He gasps and pants 
                         as he backs away.]
 
                                     SAM
                         Mr. Frodo? Its the Ring, isnt it?
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         Its getting heavier. [Clutches the 
                         Ring by his chest and sits down, still 
                         panting. He then fumbles for his water 
                         bottle and takes a sip.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         What food have we got left?

                                     SAM
                         Well, let me see. [He takes out a package 
                         of lembas bread from his pack] Oh yes, 
                         lovely  Lembas bread. And look! [He 
                         digs deeper into his pack] More lembas 
                         bread.
 
                         [Sam shows another package. He then 
                         breaks off a piece and tosses it to 
                         Frodo, and munches on a piece himself.]
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         I don't usually hold with foreign food, 
                         but this Elvish stuff, its not bad.
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         [smiles] Nothing ever dampens your spirits, 
                         does it Sam?
 
                         [Sam smiles back, and then looks ominously 
                         towards Mordor.]
 
                                     SAM
                         Those rain clouds might.

                         [They continue trekking through difficult 
                         terrain, often huddling underneath their 
                         cloaks.]
 
                                     SAM
                         [Looks around] This looks strangely 
                         familiar.
 
                                     FRODO
                         [Exasperated] Its because weve been 
                         here before! Were going in circles.
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Ah! What's that 'orrid stink? I'll warrant 
                         there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you 
                         smell it?
 
                                     FRODO
                         Yes. I can smell it. [Drops to a whisper] 
                         Were not alone.
 
                                     [NIGHTTIME
                         Frodo and Sam are sleeping. A dark shape 
                         appears on top of the cliff. The creature 
                         Gollum has appeared and is making his 
                         way down to the hobbits.]
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         The thieves! The thieves! The filthy 
                         little thieves! Where is it? Where isss 
                         it? They stole it from us. My preciousss. 
                         [Gollum creeps closer and closer.] Curse 
                         them! We hates them! Its ours, it is... 
                         and we wantssss it!
 
                         [Gollum reaches out his hand towards 
                         the hobbits. Suddenly the hobbits spring 
                         up, grab hold of Gollums arms and pull 
                         him down. Amidst the struggle, Gollum 
                         wriggles loose and leaps onto Frodo. 
                         As Frodo falls back, the chain and Ring 
                         around his neck is revealed and Gollum 
                         jumps straight for the Ring. Sam tries 
                         to grab at him but is knocked away. 
                         Gollum now jumps on top of Frodo and 
                         tries to reach for the Ring even as 
                         Frodo grabs his hands and tries to push 
                         him away. Gollums cheeks puff with 
                         exertion as he struggles with Frodo, 
                         his enormous eyes fixed on the Ring. 
                         Sam grabs hold of Gollum again and tears 
                         him away from Frodo. Gollum then turns 
                         around and bites Sam on the shoulder, 
                         wriggles around and clasps his arms 
                         around Sams neck and legs around his 
                         waist in a death grip. Frodo unsheathes 
                         Sting and holds it to Gollum's throat.]
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         [menacingly] This is Sting. Youve seen 
                         it before, havent you... Gollum! Release 
                         him or Ill cut your throat!
 
                         [Slowly, Gollum loosens his grip on 
                         Sam and as the latter disentangles himself, 
                         Gollum wails. In the next scene, Gollum 
                         is being dragged with Sam's Elvish rope 
                         around his neck, wailing and writhing 
                         in pain.]
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty 
                         Elves twisted it. Take it off us!
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Quiet you!

                         [Sam tugs fiercely at the rope. Gollum 
                         cries some more and collapses onto his 
                         back. Sam turns to Frodo in dismay.]
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Its hopeless! Every Orc in Mordors 
                         going to hear this racket! Lets just 
                         tie him up and leave him.
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         No! That would kill us! Kill us!

                                     SAM
                         Its no more than you deserve!

                                     FRODO
                         Maybe he does deserve to die, but now

                         against the might of Sauron and Saruman

                         A new order will rise. We will drive

                         nods to Éowyn in the direction of Théodreds 
                         torso. Éowyn draws back the covers and

                         her lips tighten and eyes close. She

                         Saruman has poisoned the mind of the

                         lands. My company are those loyal to 
                         Rohan. And for that, we are banished. 
                         The White Wizard is cunning. He walks 
                         here and there, they say, as an old 
                         man, hooded and cloaked. And everywhere 
                         his spies slip past our nets.

                         Uruk-hai westward across the plain.

                         a wide berth between him and Sam.]

                         the mist. Come, hobbits, come. We go 
                         quickly.

                         know it. They go round for miles and 
                         miles. Come quickly. Swift and quick

                         specks. As the three pick their way 
                         gingerly though the marshes, they see 
                         faces floating in the water, still, 
                         rotting and pale, and flickering flames

                         falls face-down into the water.]

                         robes and hair flowing about their gruesome 
                         faces. Their hands are reaching for 
                         him. Suddenly he is grabbed from behind.

                         bushes. The Nazgûl appears, tightening 
                         his hold on the reins. Camera then shows

                         Théoden, holding his hand in hers.]
 
                         
                                     ÉOWYN
                         My lord, your son, he is dead. My lord? 
                         Uncle?
 
                         [Théoden just sits and stares ahead, 
                         his eyes clouded and unseeing.]
 
                                     ÉOWYN
                         Will you not go to him? [She weeps.] 
                         Will you do nothing?
 
                         [Scene returns to Gandalf and company.]
 
                         
                                     GANDALF
                         Be careful what you say. Do not look 
                         for welcome here.
 
                         [They ride on towards Edoras.]



                         [At Edoras, Éowyn is weeping at the 
                         dead Théodred's bed. She kisses his 
                         hand. Gríma appears at the door.]
 
                         
                                     GRÍMA
                         Oh, he he must have died sometime in 
                         the night. What a tragedy for the king 
                         to lose his only son and heir.
 
                         [He sits on the bed and puts a hand 
                         on Éowyns shoulder.]
 
                                     GRÍMA
                         I understand his passing is hard to 
                         accept, especially now that your brother 
                         has deserted you.
 
                                     ÉOWYN
                         [jumps back and throws off Grímas hand] 
                         Leave me alone, snake!
 
                                     GRÍMA
                         [Rises from the bed and moves ever closer 
                         to Éowyn] Oh, but you are alone! Who 
                         knows what you have spoken to the darkness. 
                         In bitter watches of the night, when 
                         all your life seems to shrink, the walls 
                         of your bower closing in about you, 
                         like a hutch to trammel some wild thing 
                         in.
 
                         [He puts a hand on her cheek and moves 
                         down to her throat.]
 
                                     GRÍMA
                         So fair, so cold, like a morning of 
                         pale spring still clinging to winter's 
                         chill.
 
                         [Éowyn and Gríma stare at each other 
                         intently.]
 
                                     ÉOWYN
                         Your words are poison!

                         [Éowyn runs out of the hall. Weeping, 
                         she looks away into the distance. A 
                         flag comes off its pole and is carried 
                         by the breeze. Éowyn sees riders coming 
                         towards Edoras. As Aragorn passes the 
                         entrance to Edoras, the flag floats 
                         down to land near him. Edoras is silent 
                         and somber. Everyone is dressed in black 
                         and staring at the newcomers in wary 
                         silence. Aragorn looks up at the hall 
                         and sees a lady in white standing on 
                         the steps. He looks around at more somber 
                         people.]
 
                                     GIMLI
                         Youll find more cheer in a graveyard.
 
                         
                         [Aragorn looks up to the hall again 
                         but the lady has disappeared. The company 
                         climbs up the stairs to the hall and 
                         is met by guards.]

                         [sees Háma] Ah.

                                     HÁMA
                         I cannot allow you before Théoden-King 
                         so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order 
                         of Gríma Wormtongue.
 
                         [Gandalf nods in understanding and signals 
                         for the others to surrender their weapons. 
                         Aragon hands over his sword and knives. 
                         Legolas gives a little twirl to his 
                         knives before handing them over to the 
                         guards. Gimli hands over his axes reluctantly.]
 
                         
                                     HÁMA
                         [gestures to Gandalf] Your staff.

                                     GANDALF
                         Hmm? [Glances at his staff.] Oh. You 
                         would not part an old man from his walking 
                         stick? [Looks at Háma innocently.]
 
                         
                         [Háma hesitates for a second and then 
                         gestures that they follow him into the 
                         hall. Gandalf gives Aragorn a tiny wink 
                         and enters the hall, leaning on Legolas 
                         arm.]
 
                                     GRÍMA
                         [Leaning down and whispering to Théoden.] 
                         My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming. 
                         Hes a herald of woe.
 
                                     GANDALF
                         The courtesy of your hall is somewhat 
                         lessened of late, Théoden King.
 
                         [As Gandalf approaches Théoden, Aragorn, 
                         Legolas and Gimli pull back and survey 
                         the hall and its hostile occupants. 
                         A group of men starts to follow their 
                         steps with hostility.]

                         [Whispering to Théoden.] Hes not welcome.
 
                         
                                     THÉODEN
                         Why should I welcome you, Gandalf 
                         Stormcrow? [Looks to Gríma for affirmation.]
 
                         
                                     GRÍMA
                         A just question, my liege. [He walks 
                         towards Gandalf.] Late is the hour in 
                         which this conjurer chooses to appear. 
                         Lathspell spell I name him. Ill news 
                         is an ill guest.

                         Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind 
                         you teeth. I have not passed through 
                         fire and death to bandy crooked words 
                         with a witless worm! [Raises his staff 
                         against Gríma.]

                         His staff! [Backing away from Gandalf 
                         while addressing the guards] I told 
                         you to take the wizards staff!
 
                         [The hostile guards attack. Aragorn, 
                         Legolas and Gimli engage them in a fist-fight 
                         as Gandalf continues to approach Théoden. 
                         Gamling tries to go forward but Háma 
                         holds him back.]

                         Théoden, son of Thengel, too long have 
                         you sat in the shadows.
 
                         [Gríma tries to crawl away unnoticed, 
                         but Gimli catches him and pins him to 
                         the floor.]

                         [Growls] I would stay still, if I were 
                         you.

                         Hearken to me! I release you from the 
                         spell. [Gestures with his hand]
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         [Menacingly] Hahahhhahahahah! [Gandalf 
                         opens his eyes in surprise.] You have 
                         no power here, Gandalf the Grey!
 
                         [Gandalf throws back his grey cloak, 
                         exuding blinding white light. Théoden 
                         is thrown back against his seat.]

                         [Points his staff towards Théoden.] 
                         I will draw you, Saruman, as poison 
                         is drawn from a wound.
 
                         [Éowyn rushes in. Seeing her uncle threatened, 
                         she tries to go to him but is held back 
                         by Aragorn.]

                         [In Sarumans voice.] If I go. . . Théoden 
                         dies.
 
                         [Gandalf moves his staff sharply and 
                         Théoden flies back against the chair 
                         again.]

                         at him. Théoden is thrown back into 
                         the chair and the shot changes to Saruman 
                         flying backwards from the Palantír which 
                         he used to manipulate Théoden. He lands 
                         landing hard on the floor of Orthanc, 
                         bleeding from a gash in his forehead. 
                         In the hall, Théoden lets out a moan 
                         and slumps forward in the chair. Éowyn 
                         runs to her uncles side as he falls. 
                         Théodens head rises again and his face 
                         begins to change gradually into that 
                         of a much younger-looking man. Clarity 
                         and recognition returns to his eyes.]

                         strength better... if they grasped your 
                         sword.

                         reaches for it with trembling hands. 
                         He wraps his fingers around it slowly 
                         and then draws it, gazing upon the shiny 
                         steel. In a corner, Gríma trembles and 
                         tries to escape but is pulled back by

                         [Glaring at Sam] You have no idea what 
                         it did to him. What its still doing 
                         to him. [He walks past Sam and stops.] 
                         I want to help him, Sam...
 
                                     SAM
                         Why?

                                     FRODO
                         Because I have to believe he can come 
                         back.
 
                                     SAM
                         You cant save him, Mr. Frodo.

                                     FRODO
                         [Snapping at Sam]What do you know about 
                         it? Nothing!
 
                         [Sam walks away slowly.]

                                     FRODO
                         [With remorse] I'm sorry, Sam. I don't 
                         know why I said that.
 
                                     SAM
                         [Looks back at Frodo with tears in his 
                         eyes.] I do. It's the Ring. You can't 
                         take your eyes off it. I've seen you. 
                         You're not eating. You barely sleep. 
                         It's taken a hold of you, Mr Frodo. 
                         You have to fight it!
 
                                     FRODO
                         [Grows angry again] I know what I have 
                         to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to 
                         me! It's my task! Mine! My own! [He 
                         walks away]
 
                                     SAM
                         Cant you hear yourself? Dont you know 
                         who you sound like?
 
                         [Frodo continues to walk away without 
                         looking back.]

                         he goes, preciousss. [He hops around 
                         in joy and does a little dance.] Gone, 
                         gone, gone! Sméagol is free!

                         at Sam. Sméagol raises a fist in self-congratulation 
                         and dances around. He then picks up 
                         one of the rabbits and snaps the rabbit's

                         like that! [Holding up the two rabbits] 
                         Theres only one way to eat a brace

                         em in a stew. Lovely big golden chips

                         at the soldiers and Oliphaunts from 
                         behind bushes. One of the Oliphaunts

                         and tusks. Faramir takes aim and shoots 
                         a soldier. He falls from the Oliphaunt

                         and fells a warg rider. He draws another 
                         arrow and kills another. Just as he 
                         reaches for a third arrow, he sees Théoden 
                         and company approaching. He quickly 
                         runs and mounts Arod with a smooth leap 
                         and joins in the fray with Gimli behind 
                         him on horseback.]

                         and company hack away at the warg riders. 
                         In the midst of fighting, Gimli falls 
                         off Arod. He turns to find a warg growling 
                         at him.]

                         warg, it dies and falls onto Gimli, 
                         pinning him under.]

                         an Orc leans over them both. Gimli kills 
                         him quickly, twisting his neck, and 
                         it lands on him also. Gimli sniffs at 
                         the Orc and makes a face. He tries to 
                         lift both the warg and Orc off him. 
                         Just then, another warg comes upon him

                         on horseback and throws it at the warg. 
                         It dies, landing on Gimli and adding 
                         to the pile on top of him.]

                         is knocked off Hasufel and attacked 
                         by Sharku. Aragorn tries to kill the 
                         warg rider but Sharku blocks his attempt 
                         and grabs Aragorn by the neck, while 
                         the latter is half-dragged by the warg. 
                         In the struggle, Sharku is thrown off 
                         and he rips the Evenstar pendant from 
                         Aragorns neck as he falls. Aragorn 
                         tries to let go of the warg but finds 
                         his wrist tangled with the saddle straps. 
                         He tries unsuccessfully to disentangle 
                         himself and is dragged closer and closer 
                         to the edge of a cliff at great speed. 
                         The warg runs right off the cliff and 
                         they both disappear over the edge. The 
                         battle is winding down as the Rohirrim

                         to the edge of the cliff and looks down 
                         to see the great drop and rushing waters 
                         below, with no sign of Aragorn. Gimli 
                         comes to stand beside him.]

                         Helms Deep has one weakness. Its outer 
                         wall is solid rock but for a small culvert 
                         at its base which is little more than 
                         a drain.

                         Orthanc. Saruman is pouring some dark 
                         dry substances into a vessel. Gríma

                         of device could bring down the wall?

                         army below. A horn is sounded, announcing 
                         the appearance of Saruman. A loud cheer 
                         is heard from the army. Saruman raises 
                         a hand.]

                         and banners and yet more Uruk-hai. The 
                         camera focuses back on Saruman who then

                                     FARAMIR
                         Speak.

                                     FRODO
                         We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins 
                         is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.
 
                         
                                     FARAMIR
                         Your bodyguard?

                                     SAM
                         His gardener.

                                     FARAMIR
                         And where is your skulking friend? That 
                         gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured 
                         look.
 
                                     FRODO
                         [The merest hesitation.] There was no 
                         other.
 
                         [Sam looks shifty-eyed and uncomfortable.]
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         We set out from Rivendell with seven 
                         companions. One we lost in Mória. Two 
                         were my kin. A Dwarf there was also, 
                         and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son 
                         of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.
 
                         
                                     FARAMIR
                         [Intently] Youre a friend of Boromir?
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         Yes... for my part.

                                     FARAMIR
                         It will grieve you then to learn that 
                         he is dead.
 
                                     FRODO
                         [Shocked] Dead? How? When?

                                     FARAMIR
                         As one of his companions, Id hoped 
                         you would tell me. [Pause] He was my 
                         brother.
 


                         [Faramir is sitting alone, deep in thought. 
                         Suddenly someone comes up to him.]
 
                         
                                     GONDORIAN RANGER
                         Captain Faramir. [whispers] We found 
                         the third one.
 
                         [Frodo and Sam are sleeping. Frodo awakens 
                         as Faramir stands before him.]
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         You must come with me. Now.

                         [Frodo gets up and follow. They come 
                         to the edge of the waterfall, overlooking 
                         the Forbidden Pool.]
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         [Pointing down] Down there.

                         [Frodo looks down and sees Gollum diving 
                         into the water.]
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         To enter the forbidden pool bears the 
                         penalty of death. [He gestures to archers 
                         hidden in the bushes.] They wait for 
                         my command.
 
                         [The Rangers notch their arrows]

                                     FARAMIR
                         Shall I shoot?

                         [Frodo looks stricken. Gollum emerges 
                         from the pool onto a rock. He holds 
                         a fish in his hand and starts singing, 
                         slapping the fish on the rock as he 
                         goes.]
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         [singing] The rock and pool is nice 
                         and cool, so juicy sweet! I only wish 
                         [Whacks the fish on the rock] to catch 
                         a fish [whacks], so juicy sweet! [The 
                         fish almost wriggles out of his grasp 
                         and he whacks it some more.]
 
                         [Faramir has his hand raised to order 
                         his men to shoot. At the last moment, 
                         Frodo calls out.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         Wait! [Faramir stops] This creature 
                         is bound to me. And I to him. He is 
                         our guide. Please, let me go down to 
                         him.
 
                         [Faramir nods. Frodo descends to the 
                         Forbidden Pool and approaches Gollum 
                         who is gorging on the raw fish.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         Sméagol. [Gollum turns round at Frodos 
                         voice.] Master is here. Come, Sméagol. 
                         Trust master. Come!
 
                         [Frodo gestures for Gollum to follow 
                         him.]
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         We must go now?

                                     FRODO
                         Sméagol, you must trust master. Follow 
                         me, come on. Come. Come, Sméagol. Nice 
                         Sméagol. Thats it. Come on.
 
                         [With the fish between his teeth, Gollum 
                         follows Frodo warily. Suddenly he looks 
                         up in alarm and is caught by Rangers.]
 
                         
                                     FRODO
                         Dont hurt him! Sméagol dont struggle! 
                         Sméagol listen to me!
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         [wails] Master!!

                         [A black cloth is brought over Gollum's 
                         head. Frodo stares after them with a 
                         stricken expression as Faramir leads 
                         Gollum and his men away. Back in the 
                         cave, Gollum is thrown down to the ground. 
                         Crying, he crawls into a corner and 
                         curls up into ball.]
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         No! No!

                                     FARAMIR
                         Where are you leading them? Answer me!
 
                         
                                     GOLLUM
                         [Cooing, his hand stroking his shoulder] 
                         Sméagol... Why does it cry, Sméagol?
 
                         
                                     SMÉAGOL
                         [Sobbing] Cruel men hurts us. Master 
                         trickst us.
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         Of course he did. I told you he was 
                         tricksy. I told you he was false.
 
                         
                                     SMÉAGOL
                         [Sobbing] Master is our friend... our 
                         friend.
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         Master betrayed us.

                                     SMÉAGOL
                         No, not its business. Leave us alone!
 
                         
                                     GOLLUM
                         [Hits his fist against the wall] Filthy 
                         little hobbitses. They stole it from 
                         us.
 
                                     SMÉAGOL
                         [Whimpers] No... No!

                                     FARAMIR
                         What did they steal?

                                     GOLLUM
                         [Turns to Faramir with a ferocious expression] 
                         Myyy PRECIOUSSS!! [He bares his teeth 
                         and growls] Aaaarrrggghhh!!!
 


                         [Back in their holding area, Sam and 
                         Frodo are alone.]
 
                                     SAM
                         We have to get out of here. You go. 
                         Go, now! You can do it. Use the Ring, 
                         Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on. 
                         Disappear.
 
                                     FRODO
                         I cant. You were right, Sam. You tried 
                         to tell me, but Im sorry. The Rings 
                         taking me Sam. If I put it on, hell 
                         find me. Hell see.
 
                                     SAM
                         Mr. Frodo...

                         [They both stand as Faramir enters.]
 
                         
                                     FARAMIR
                         [Unsheathes his sword] So... this is 
                         the answer to all the riddles. Here 
                         in the wild I have you. Two halflings 
                         and a host of men at my call. The Ring 
                         of power within my grasp.
 
                         [Faramir lifts the Ring from Frodo's 
                         neck with the tip of his sword.]
 
                                     FARAMIR
                         A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, 
                         to show his quality.
 
                         [Frodo is backed up fearfully against 
                         the wall. The Ring whispers and Frodo 
                         falls into a trance. Suddenly, he grabs 
                         the Ring in his hand and jerks himself 
                         away.]
 
                                     FRODO
                         No!! [He runs away from Faramir]

                                     SAM
                         Stop it! Leave him alone! Dont you 
                         understand? Hes got to destroy it. 
                         Thats where were going. Into Mordor. 
                         To the mountain of fire.
 
                         [Faramir stares at Frodo. Just then 
                         Damrod enters.]

                         Osgiliath is under attack. They call 
                         for reinforcements.
 
                                     SAM
                         Please. Its such a burden. Will you 
                         not help him?
 
                                     DAMROD
                         Captain?

                                     FARAMIR
                         Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to 
                         Gondor. [He turns to leave.]
 
                         [Sam looks after Faramir sadly.]



                         [Aragorn is riding towards Helms Deep. 
                         On the way, he sees an enormous Uruk-hai 
                         army marching with great speed. He quickly 
                         makes haste towards Helms Deep and 
                         soon sees the refuge.]

                         the way. Im gonna kill him! [He sees 
                         Aragorn.] You are the luckiest, the 
                         canniest and the most reckless man I 
                         ever knew! [He hugs Aragorn.] Bless 
                         you, laddie!
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         Gimli, where is the king?

                         [Gimli gestures to the hall. As Aragorn 
                         makes his way in, he runs into Legolas 
                         who stands waiting.]
 
                                     LEGOLAS
                         Le ab-dollen. (Youre late.) [They smile. 
                         Legolas pauses and looks at Aragorns 
                         wounds.] You look terrible.
 
                         [To the side, Éowyn sees Aragorn and 
                         smiles joyously and with relief. Legolas 
                         takes Aragorns hand and gives the Evenstar 
                         pendant. Aragorn looks at the Evenstar 
                         and claps Legolas on the shoulder.]
 
                         
                                     ARAGORN
                         Hannon le. (Thank you.)

                         [Éowyn looks on and smiles even as tears 
                         fill her eyes.]
 
                         [Aragorn is in the keep, conferring 
                         with Théoden]

                         A great host, you say?

                                     ARAGORN
                         All Isengard is emptied

                                     THÉODEN
                         How many?

                                     ARAGORN
                         Ten thousand strong at least.

                                     THÉODEN
                         Ten thousand?!

                                     ARAGORN
                         It is an army bred for a single purpose: 
                         to destroy the world of men. They will 
                         be here by nightfall.
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         Let them come! [Walks away resolutely]
 
                         
                         [Along the passage behind the Deeping 
                         Wall.]
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         [to Gamling] I want every man and strong 
                         lad able to bear arms to be ready for 
                         battle by nightfall.
 
                         [Gamling nods and goes off. Théoden 
                         stands at the gate of Helms Deep, speaking 
                         to Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli.]
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         We will cover the causeway and the gate 
                         from above. No army has ever breached 
                         the Deeping Wall or set foot inside 
                         the Hornburg.
 
                                     GIMLI
                         This is no rabble of mindless Orcs. 
                         These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick 
                         and their shields broad.
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf. 
                         I know how to defend my own keep.
 
                         
                         [Gimli seems miffed. Legolas claps a 
                         hand on Gimlis shoulder as he follows 
                         Aragorn and Théoden back in.]
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         They will break upon this fortress like 
                         water on rock. Sarumans hordes will 
                         pillage and burn, weve seen it before. 
                         Crops can be resown; homes rebuilt. 
                         Within these walls, we will outlast 
                         them.
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         They do not come to destroy Rohans 
                         crops or villages. They come to destroy 
                         its people. Down to the last child.

                         [Draws close to Aragorn] What would 
                         you have me do? Look at my men. Their 
                         courage hangs by a thread. If this is 
                         to be our end, then I would have them 
                         make such an end as to be worthy of 
                         remembrance.
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         Send out riders, my lord. You must call 
                         for aid.
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We 
                         are not so lucky in our friends as you. 
                         The old alliances are dead.
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         Gondor will answer.

                                     THÉODEN
                         Gondor? Where was Gondor when the Westfold 
                         fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies 
                         closed in around us? Where was Gon 
                          No, my lord Aragorn, we are alone. 
                         [He walks away, calling out orders]

                         caves.

                         We need more time to lay provisions 
                         for a siege, lord 

                         [Cutting him off] There is no time. 
                         War is upon us!

                         of carrion crows circle overhead.]
 
                         


                         [Treebeard walks through the forest 
                         carrying Merry and Pippin. He comes 
                         to a clearing and stops.]

                         wars of men and wizards for a very long 
                         time. But now something is about to 
                         happen that has not happened for an 
                         age... Ent Moot.

                         A gathering of what?

                         [Merry and Pippin turns round as they 
                         hear movement from the forest around 
                         them. They see many more Ents like Treebeard 
                         gathering.]

                         good. Many have come. Now we must decide 
                         if the Ents will go to war.

                                     HALETH
                         Haleth, son of Háma, my lord. The men 
                         are saying that we will not live out 
                         the night. They say that it is hopeless..
 
                         
                         [Aragorn gives the battered sword a 
                         few swings.]
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         This is a good sword, Haleth, son of 
                         Háma.
 
                         [He hands the sword back to Haleth and 
                         leans close to him, putting a hand on 
                         his shoulder.]
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         There is always hope.



                         [Back at the armoury, Aragorn dons his 
                         battle gear. His sword is handed to 
                         him as he reaches for it. He nods and 
                         accepts the sword from Legolas.]
 
                                     LEGOLAS
                         We have trusted you this far. You have 
                         not led us astray. Forgive me. I was 
                         wrong to despair.
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         Ú-moe edhored, Legolas. (There is nothing 
                         to forgive, Legolas.)
 
                         [They smile and clap one another on 
                         the shoulders. They look at Gimli as 
                         he walks up to them, struggling with 
                         his chain mail.]
 
                                     GIMLI
                         If we had more time Id get this adjusted. 
                         [He drops the bundle and the chain mail 
                         lands with its length right to the floor.] 
                         Its a little tight across the chest.
 
                         
                         [Aragorn and Legolas bite back smiles. 
                         Just then, a horn sounds in the background]
 
                         
                                     LEGOLAS
                         That is no Orc horn. [They run out to 
                         the battlements.]
 
                         [The guards look down in wonderment.]
 
                         
                                     BEREG
                         [to another guard] Send for the king. 
                         Open the gate!
 
                                     SOLDIER
                         Open the gate!

                         [An army of Lothlórien Elves march up 
                         the Causeway into the Hornburg. They 
                         are led by Haldir. The Rohirrim soldiers 
                         look upon them in wonderment and delight 
                         as they pass.]
 
                                     THÉODEN
                         How is this possible?

                                     HALDIR
                         I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell. 
                         An alliance once existed between Elves 
                         and men. Long ago we fought and died 
                         together. [He looks up to see Aragorn, 
                         Legolas and Gimli running down the steps, 
                         and smiles] We come to honor that allegiance.
 
                         
                                     ARAGORN
                         [He bows] Mae govannen, Haldir. (Welcome, 
                         Haldir) [He grabs Haldir in a huge embrace. 
                         Initially stunned, Haldir hugs him back 
                         lightly.]
 
                                     ARAGORN
                         You are most welcome!

                         [Legolas and Haldir clasp each other 
                         on the shoulder.]
 
                                     HALDIR
                         [Turning to Théoden] We are proud to 
                         fight alongside men, once more.
 
                         [Men and Elves are in their positions 
                         on the battlements of Helms Deep. The 
                         sounds of a marching army move closer 
                         and closer. The women and children in 
                         the caves hear the sounds overhead and 
                         are frightened. Mothers draw their children 
                         close and try to sooth crying babies. 
                         The men and Elves look out into the 
                         darkness, lit by the thousands of torches 
                         carried by the huge advancing Uruk-hai 
                         army and the light bouncing off their 
                         armour. With a row of Elf archers, Gimli 
                         is standing beside Legolas behind a 
                         wall, only the top of his helmet visible.]

                         [Grumbling and straining to look above 
                         the wall.] You could have picked a better 
                         spot.
 
                         [Legolas smirks. Aragorn approaches 
                         and stands beside them]
 
                                     GIMLI
                         Well lad, whatever luck you live by, 
                         lets hope it lasts the night.
 
                         [Thunder sounds and lightning flashes, 
                         revealing the sea of approaching Uruk-hai.]
 
                         
                                     LEGOLAS

                         [The marching and thumping grows louder 
                         and louder. Lightning flashes and it 
                         begins to rain. While the Uruk-hai army 
                         continues to march at the fortress, 
                         an Uruk-hai leader steps on a rock outcrop.]

                         and commands his army to stop with a 
                         terrifying animalic cry. The Uruks stop 
                         and growl in anticipation of the upcoming 
                         battle and slaughter]

                         [The Uruk Leader cries out once, encouraging 
                         the Uruk-hai to start roaring and thumping 
                         their spears furiously.The women and 
                         children in the caves huddle together 
                         in fear. Suddenly, Aldor, the old man 
                         next to Haleth, loses his grip and releases 
                         his arrow prematurely, shooting an Uruk-hai 
                         in the neck.]

                         Uruk that was shot collapsed to the 
                         ground. The other Uruk-hai bare their 
                         teeth and roar with anger. With a cry, 
                         the Uruk-hai leader thrusts his weapon 
                         in the air and the Uruk-hai army starts

                         I have told your names to the Ent moot 
                         and we have agreed  you are not Orcs.

                         [impatiently] And what about Saruman? 
                         Have you come to a decision about HIM?

                         need our help! They cannot fight this 
                         war on their own.

                         War, yes It affects us all. But you 
                         must understand, young hobbit. It takes 
                         a loong time to say anything in ooold 
                         Entish. [Merry and Pippin roll their 
                         eyes in disgruntlement.] And we never 
                         say anything unless it is worth taking 
                         a looong time to say.

                         is set off, blowing away a large part

                         always done.

                         here, Merry. It's too big for us. What 
                         can we do in the end? We've got the 
                         Shire. Maybe we should go home.

                         slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer 
                         we are to danger, the farther we are

                         on, little Shirelings. I always like 
                         going south. Somehow it feels like going 
                         down hill.

                         There is one passage. It leads into 
                         the mountains. But they will not get 
                         far. The Uruk-hai are too many.

                         emerges in front of him. Frodo stares 
                         at the Nazgûl, fixated. Feeling the 
                         call of the Ring, he holds it up. Faramir

                         in a death grip, yells and points Sting 
                         at his throat, his eyes livid with madness 
                         and anger that someone would try to 
                         take the Ring away.]

                         [Sam shakes the rangers hand from his 
                         shoulder. Frodo looks up at Faramir 
                         with gladness. Over in the realm of 
                         Rohan, Gandalf, Théoden and company 
                         ride to the top of a slope, looking 
                         towards the Mountain of Fire in the 
                         distance.]
 
                                     GANDALF
                         Saurons wrath will be terrible, his 
                         retribution swift. The battle for Helms 
                         Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth 
                         is about to begin. All our hopes now 
                         lie with two little hobbits. Somewhere 
                         in the wilderness.
 
                         [Frodo and Sam are walking through the 
                         woods, away from Osgiliath.]
 
                                     SAM
                         I wonder if well ever be put into songs 
                         or tales.
 
                                     FRODO
                         What?

                                     SAM
                         I wonder if people will ever say, lets 
                         hear about Frodo and the Ring. And 
                         theyll say yes, thats one of my favorite 
                         stories. Frodo was really courageous, 
                         wasnt he, dad. Yes, my boy, the most 
                         famousest of hobbits. And thats saying 
                         alot.
 
                                     FRODO
                         Huh, you left out one of the chief characters 
                          Samwise the Brave. I want to hear 
                         more about Sam.
 
                         [Frodo turns to look at Sam.]

                                     FRODO
                         Frodo wouldnt have got far without 
                         Sam.
 
                                     SAM
                         Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldnt make fun. 
                         I was being serious.
 
                                     FRODO
                         [smiling] So was I. [He turns to walk 
                         on]
 
                                     SAM
                         [Dreamily] Samwise the Brave. [He gives 
                         his backpack a heave and follows Frodo]
 
                         
                         [Gollum is crouching a short distance 
                         away]
 
                                     FRODO
                         Sméagol!

                                     SAM
                         Were not gonna wait for you. Come on!
 
                         
                                     SMÉAGOL
                         Master... Master looks after us. Master 
                         wouldnt hurt us.
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         Master broke his promise.

                                     SMÉAGOL
                         Dont ask Sméagol. Poor, poor Sméagol.
 
                         
                                     GOLLUM
                         Master betrayed us! Wicked, tricksy, 
                         false. We ought to wring his filthy 
                         little neck. [Twists the branch of a 
                         tree] Kill him! Kill him! Kill them 
                         both. And then we take the precious 
                         and we be the master.
 
                                     SMÉAGOL
                         [Scuttles and hides behind a tree] The 
                         fat hobbit, he knows. Eyes always watching.
 
                         
                                     GOLLUM
                         Then we stabs them out. Put out his 
                         eyeses. And make HIM crawl.
 
                                     SMÉAGOL
                         [Bites on his finger and nods eagerly] 
                         Yes! Yes! Yes!
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         Kill them both.

                                     SMÉAGOL
                         Yes! No no! [Backs away against a tree] 
                         Its too risky, its too risky.
 
                         [He looks in the direction of the hobbits]
 
                         
                                     SAM
                         Wheres he gone? Hey Gollum, where are 
                         you?
 
                                     FRODO
                         Sméagol?

                                     GOLLUM
                         [Softly and sinisterly] We could let 
                         HER do it.
 
                                     SMÉAGOL
                         Yes. She could do it.

                                     GOLLUM
                         Yes, precious she could. And then we 
                         takes it once theyre dead.
 
                                     SMÉAGOL
                         Once theyre dead

                                     GOLLUM
                         Shh [He pops out from hiding in front 
                         of the hobbits.]
 
                                     SMÉAGOL
                         Come on, hobbits. Long ways to go yet. 
                         Sméagol will show you the way.
 
                         [He turns to walk on, with Frodo and 
                         Sam following behind.]
 
                                     GOLLUM
                         Follow me.

                         [ Camera pans up over the forest and 
                         Ephel Dúath to reveal the desolation 
                         of Mordor. To the left of the frame 
                         is the glowing Eye of Sauron atop Barad-dûr, 
                         and to the right of the frame is the 
                         fiery Mount Doom. Three Fell Beasts 
                         circle the dark skies. Lightning flashes 
                         as the scene fades to black.]
