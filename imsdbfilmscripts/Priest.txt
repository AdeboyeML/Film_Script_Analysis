          THE MOON. So fat and full in the night sky you can reach out
          and touch it.

          HICKS W. 0.
          This is what's known: There has always
          been man...and there have always been
          vampires.
          BLACK SHAPES swoop past the moonscape, vicious looking things.
          Much shrieking and wailing.
          Atop a STONE ZIGGURAT -- We see a GROUP OF MEN -- AZTEC
          WARRIORS readying themselves with PRIMITIVE WEAPONS --
          SLINGS, BOWS, SPEARS. Tonight they know they will die.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          Since the beginning -- the two have been
          locked forever in combat... The vampires
          were quicker, stronger and had the gift
          of flight.
          Quick glimpses of a bloody, brutal battle. Men screaming.
          Talons ripping. FIERY ARROWS launched against an unseen enemy.

          WHOOSH!
          With a HOWL, we see A MAN plucked off the ground, his body
          disappearing in the night. THE IMAGE DISSOLVES as -- the sky
          turns bright, the moon becoming a familiar ball of yellow gas.

                         HICKS (CONT'D)
          But man had the sun.
          THE CAMERA TILTS DOWN to find another GROUP OF MEN -- more
          sophisticated than the first. Makeshift weapons made of metal
          and steel slung across their backs glinting in the sunlight.
          They stand before AN EARTHEN STRUCTURE, looks like a GIANT WASP
          NEST. Unsheathing their weapons, they step grimly inside.
          We HEAR a HISSING WAIL and the wielding of steel.

          HXCKS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          And so it went like this over many years.
          As man and vampire both evolved -- the
          wars became bloodier.
          From afar, we see GIANT STACKS OF CORPSES as hydraulic
          machines stack the black bodies into pyres as big as
          buildings, smoke rising to the sky in twisting columns.

          Then came THE PRIESTS --
          The Man turns and we see his face is shadowed by a large
          CROSS TATTOO, cutting across his eyes and down the center.

          -- Specially trained warriors in the art
          of vampire combat. They single-handedly
          turned the tide for the humans.
          Quick glimpses of a GROUP OF PRIESTS battling a FURY OF
          VAMPIRES (we still do not get a good look at them). Their
          technique is otherworldy -- combining the brutality of a
          Maori Warrior. with the grace of a Samurai.
           The--combat-is intense. Glorious. An explosion of blood and

           HICKS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Over time the vampire threat faded. The
          once fierce race now fatally diminished.
          A shadow of what they once. were.
          Through heavy smoke, we see a pile of VAMPIRE CORPSES, a
          ragged collection of fangs and claws.

          HICKS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          The remaining vampires were put Into
          camps and -- by decree of the High
          Clergy the Priests disbanded. The
          former warriors to be integrated as
          members of regular society.
          We see a WAX SEAL pressed onto an ancient parchment. The
          document carefully rolled and stored in an ORNATE CHAMBER.

          HICKS (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          The human race thrived in relative
          quiet. The vampire menace quickly
          forgotten for other, more modern
          threats.

                         (BEAT)
          And the few surviving Priests faded Into

          Dust swirls in nasty tangles.
          A LONE MALE FIGURE moves across the plain, long and lean in
          overalls. AARON PACE. Shadows flicker across his sunburned
          face, the windmill looming above him.
          in his hands is an ELECTRONIC DEVICE, he plunges it into the
          earth. It makes a series of CLICKING SOUNDS, reading the soil.
          Aaron looks up to see the silhouette of a WOMAN standing in
          the doorway of his CABIN.
          He smiles, waving to her. His wife.

          it...you'll die.

          awkwardly between the chickens.
          A MALE FAMILIAR stands with a butcher knife over a basin.
          His gaze is slack -- More dead than alive. He picks up a

          Our group moving deeper into the dark cavern, a moan of wind
          echoing off the gorge wail behind them, massive black
          stalactites hanging overhead. Very creepy.
          They move quickly, Priest ahead of the other two. Hicks
          gazes at the Priestess, admiring her body. Any man would.
          He works up his courage and approaches her. Quietly.

                         HICKS
          Are Priests allowed to, you know...have
          relations?

          We take a vow of celibacy at inception.
          Hicks can't be sure -- did she just look at Priest when she
          said that?

                         HUGE CHAMBER
          Not like the cave, this is more earthen. Like the inside of a
          wasp nest, curved walls made of dirt and spit, Priest covering
          his nose and mouth as he's hit with a massive stench.

          A GIANT SHADOW
          Looms before him, we_don't see what it is.
          As the Priestess and Hicks enter the chamber, Hicks coughs,
          reeling from the smell, the Priestess wrapping a cloth around
          her mouth -- the CAMERA focusing only on theirexpressions as
          they take in the horrible spectacle before them.

          Lucy's covers her mouth, her nails an ugly bloody mass.
          She's come this far, time to go the rest.
          She manages to carefully crawl from joist to joist, moving

          cycle identical to Priest's.
          In the distance we can make out a cluster of structures as
          they arrive at Jericho.

          if the jail was a disaster zone, this place is just plain
          creepy. Red sofas, red curtains, hell, even red wine.

          wooden toys messily strewn across the floor.

          make out their faces but it's obvious the poor souls are
          already dead.

                         (BEAT)
          Nothing is greater than God. Nothing is
          more evil than the devil. The poor have
          nothing, the rich need nothing. And if
          you eat nothing... you'll die.
          It's said that warriors can become close friends only when they
          see each other's hearts -- Priest now knows this to be true.

          She smiles.
          And then Priest does the most amazing thing. . .he smiles back.
          Things happen fast -- He finds himself planting his mouth on
          hers... the years of conditioning, all the ritual and
          tradition falling away in a flash.
          And it is here, together in this place, where they feel like
          they finally truly belong.

          A blanket of mist covers everything in a grey haze. Morning
          has come.

          A QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS
          As our trio forges onward and upward, the trail more
          treacherous with every twisty ridge, the overhangs looming
          ominously as they head deeper into the mountain.

          The final climb.
          Yawning crevices, the wind moaning as it whistles between the
          canyon walls.
          Carefully they ride across DEVIL'S BRIDGE, a finger of stone,
          just wide enough for the cycles, on either side a straight
          drop to, oblivion. The peak of the mountain Just ahead.

          The Priestess is in front leading the charge, closely

          past the bridge, looks around.
          Something's wrong.

          lining its path; The Night Train.
          They're ahead of it. Barely.
          In his excitement, Hicks thunders ahead, starting the descent
          down the other side. The Priestess turns to shout back to
          Priest.
          But he's gone.

          Tall rock walls flank Priest on. either side, the surrounding
          mist hanging in the air in cloudlike wisps. Slowly he walks

          A slight sound, the mist whipping into a pool as if something

          nothing there.

          nowhere. Priest JUMPS and it CHOMPS into the ground where he
          was standing. He lands on top of the chain, backflipping as
          it retracts back. Gearing up for another attack.

          snapping a ribt
          Yelling, Priest GRABS the chain, PULLING with everything he's
          got. Rune flies from the mist, dragged by Priest, crashing
          at his feet. The chain SNAPS and Priest BREAKS from the
          coils, grabbing Rune by the jacket, picking him up.
          Rune flashes his fangs and scissors his legs across Priest's
          stomach, the razor sharp roweled SPURS slicing his flesh,

          the only thing keeping him alive as Rune flies back across
          the canyon, landing against the rock wall like.a spider.
