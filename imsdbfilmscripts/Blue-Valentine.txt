           The small shower presses them close. Dean's smile infects
           her. He leans over, they kiss. Brushing lips at first. Dean
           presses closer. Cindy pulls back and pivots him around until
           the stream of water catches his body. He leans his head back,
           the water pours over his hair and face. He places his hands
           on Cindy's hips and pulls her close to him. Cindy hands him a
           bar of soap. He builds a gentle lather. Cindy inches back,
           turns around. Dean lathers her back, slow and languid.

           He digs through text books, pens, a wallet, asthma inhaler.
           Then he comes to a bottle of lotion. Opens the cap, sniffs.

           Dean nods, applies a little lotion to his fingertips, rubs it
           in circles on his hands, applies it to his forearms, neck,
           face. He enjoys the feeling of it, offers her some. She say's
           no. He digs through her purse and finds lip balm, smells it.

           Dean is tentative, but goes along with her. He starts slow,
           but she eggs him to go faster. He runs in circles picking up
           speed until he is in a breathless, circular sprint. He can't
           keep up with the centrifugal force.

           Dean does as he's told. They both hold on for dear life. The
           world spins in a frenzy. The dread on Dean's face builds to
           insane laughter. It is super fun. Cindy screams. Her hair
           snaps in her face. Then, a look of sickness steals her smile
           away. She wants it to stop, which, slowly, it does. She gets
           off first, tries to walk, but is too dizzy. She just keeps
           falling to the ground. Dean crawls off the merry-go round on
           all fours, laughing.

           No I want to make you laugh.
                         
           Tears well up in her eyes. Dean rolls on top of her. He cups
           her face in his hands and stares long into her watery eyes.

           After a moment, their lips meet in an awkward rejuvenation.
           She moves her head away and pats Dean on the shoulder in a
           gesture of friendship. Dean kisses her neck.

           She removes his hand and places it on her hip. Dean continues
           to kiss her neck. He slides his hand up to her breasts. Cindy
           turns her head in the other direction. She pushes his hand
           away. He brings it back aggressive. Again. Cindy squirms 
           underneath him. He grabs her wrists and holds her arms over
           her head. His tongue licks Cindy from her breasts to her
           face. She worms her arms away and grabs onto his hair. She
           arches her back, looks at him through slit eyes. His pelvis
           pulses and he moans. He looks up at her over his brow into
           her desperate eyes. He springs up. Sweat beads on his
           forehead.

           Cindy raises her hips and slips off her panties. She lifts
           the shirt up over her head, positions her feet on the door
           jam. Her arm falls over her eyes. Breathless, Dean awkwardly
           moves one hand up and down her bodice.

           He unbuckles his belt, pushes his pants and underwear down to
           his knees, holds himself in his hand. He lowers onto her.
           Cindy adjusts her legs higher. He rotates his hips, looks
           away in concentration. Cindy's arms move around him, grabbing
           the small of his arching back. His pelvis humps in a feeble
           performance. A small moan. Cindy's eyes press closed harder.
           The erratic motion slows... stops. Dean's raspy breathing.
           His weight covers Cindy. She opens her eyes to the ceiling.

           underneath and stands. She wraps her dress around her and
           slips into the bedroom.

           Back against the closed door, Cindy turns the lock. Her eyes
           shift from despair to relief. Her gaze grows more wild. The
           doorknob jiggles. A secret, crazy laugh builds in Cindy that
           she suppresses. Dean presses his face into the bedroom door. 
           He talks to her. 
                         
           On the other side of the door, Cindy listens. Dean's voice
           cracks. A wave of confusion backs Cindy away from the door.
           She searches the room for an escape. There are no windows,
           the only way out is through the locked door. Trembling, she
           wraps her arms around herself. She tries to make herself as
           small as possible. The spaceship bed is the only place where
           she can disappear. She crawls underneath the covers, curls
           into a tight ball. Sadness lets loose. Cindy's body pulses
           with faint, painful tears. The black walls of the room
           twinkle with stars suspended in space. The cries get lost.

           Drunk, Dean and Cindy make out on the street corner. It is
           cold enough to see their breath. Their hands caress each
           other, feel what is underneath the layers of clothes. Cindy
           makes a move. She unbuttons Dean's Pea-Coat, feels the shape
           of his chest, his abdomen, his back.
