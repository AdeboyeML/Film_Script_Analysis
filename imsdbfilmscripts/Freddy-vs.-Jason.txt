		NIGHTMARE 13 -- FREDDY MEETS JASON

				by Lewis Abernathy


	FADE IN:

	EXT. ELM STREET - DAY

	MEAGAN is coming down the sidewalk in slow motion.
	Her dress and long hair blow slightly in the breeze.
	The SOUND of CHILDREN CHANTING increases.

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(in chorus)
		One... two... Freddy's coming for
		you.

	On "you" there is a RUMBLE and a flash -- like quick
	lightning only evil.  (Choice flashes from Nightmare on
	Elm Street 1 & 2).

	Meagan turns at 1665.  A beautiful white, two-story
	house, thick with lush green foliage.  Several beautiful
	children, all dressed in bright white, play hopscotch
	and jumprope on the front walk.

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(continuing; chanting)
		Three... four... better lock your
		door.

	Close on a little girl's foot coming down on the number
	"4" drawn on concrete.

	Another RUMBLE and flash -- longer, LOUDER.  (Flashes
	from Nightmare 3 & 4).

	Meagan continues up the walk, the wind is blowing a
	little harder now.  The trees are brown, the leaves
	peeling away.

	Moving up the walk, closer to the house... only now
	it's a little darker, needs some paint.  On the front
	porch, a LITTLE GIRL rides a tricycle.

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(continuing; chanting)
		Five... six...

	RUMBLE.  Flash.  (Nightmare 5 and Freddy's Dead).

				DREAM CHILDREN
			(continuing; chanting)
		...grab your crucifix.. ix.. ix..

	The "ix" echoes away, becoming the faint "Ka ka ka"
	we all recognize as Jason's theme.  Meagan turns to
	find that the children in the yard have vanished. It's
	nighttime.

	The trees are dead, the grass is gone, and the horizon
	stretches off into utter nothingness.  Meagan turns
	back to the little girl.

	But the little girl has gone.  Only the tricycle
	remains.  It circles once, the front door CREAKS open,
	and the empty tricycle peddles inside.  Meagan follows
	it into the...


	INT. HOUSE ON ELM STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan enters the house slowly, watching as the tri-
	cycle rides off down a creepy hallway and disappears.
	Then the front door blows shut behind Meagan.  She
	tries to open it -- locked.

	Then faint VOICES cause Meagan to pause.  She listens,
	trying to make out the low murmur.  Then a little girl's
	GIGGLE.  Meagan recognizes it as her sister's.

				MEAGAN
		Lizzy?

	Meagan moves up the stairs, going down the hall...
	following the voices (we recognize the other voice as
	belonging to Freddy).  Meagan enters a door at the
	end of the hallway, moving into...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINOUS ACTION

	On the floor, near her bed, is Meagan's thirteen year
	old sister -- LIZZY.  Slow for her age, Lizzy sits and
	draws with crayons.

				MEAGAN
		Lizzy. What are you doing here?

				LIZZY
		Playing with my friend.

	Meagan looks at the drawings -- childlike renderings
	of Freddy.

				MEAGAN
		Your friend?

				LIZZY
		He lives under the bed.

	Meagan slowly gets to her knees and takes a peek under
	Lizzy's bed.

	Suddenly, a doll-sized Freddy scurries out from under
	the bed, flashing past Meagan's face and running out
	the door.  Meagan yelps and touches her face -- five
	tiny slash marks on her cheek.  Lizzy clucks.

				LIZZY
			(continuing)
		You scared him...

	Meagan looks out the door, incredulous.

				MEAGAN
		I scared him?

	But when Meagan looks back, Lizzy is gone.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Lizzy?

	Lizzy echoes away as Meagan finds herself standing
	in the...


	INT. NIGHTMARE CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The tiny Freddy dashes from the pews and jumps into
	a casket at the altar, slamming the lid shut.  Meagan
	goes to the casket and carefully opens the lid.  Inside
	-- a rotting corpse with worms and maggots crawling
	all over it.  Meagan screams and slams the lid back
	down.

	The casket starts to move -- THUMP! THUMP! THUMP!
	Then it stops.  Tentatively, Meagan opens the lid again.

	Inside -- FREDDY KRUEGER.  He grabs her arm.

				FREDDY
		Where ya been all my death, baby?

	Meagan screams.  Freddy leaps out of the casket in a
	tuxedo, crooning:

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		I've been waitin' at the altar for
		a long, long time!

	Meagan looks down -- she's wearing a wedding dress,
	spattered with blood.  Behind her, the chapel has
	filled with dozens of DEAD PEOPLE in various stages
	of decay.  A SATANIC PRIEST appears in the pulpit and
	asks:

				SATANIC PRIEST
		Are the bridesmaids in attendance?

	Meagan looks to her left -- four girls hold bouquets,
	dressed in body bags.

				SATANIC PRIEST
			(continuing)
		And the groomsmen...?

	Freddy opens his tuxedo jacket to reveal several
	trapped souls struggling to get out of his chest.

				SATANIC PRIEST
			(continuing)
		If anyone here believes that these
		two should not be joined in unholy
		matrimony, let him speak now or
		forever rot in hell...

	>From the back of the chapel, a voice:

				JESSE
		Meagan!

	Meagan turns.  It's her boyfriend -- JESSE.  He stands
	in the chapel doorway, backlit by bright light, arms
	outstretched.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse!

	Meagan runs to Jesse and grabs him, their arms
	encircling one another.  She looks up into Jesse's
	eyes... only it isn't Jesse.

	It's Jason.

	Meagan screams as Jason raises his machete, bringing
	it down between her eyes...

						TRANSITION CUT TO:

	INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - MORNING

	Meagan opens an eye as her alarm clock BUZZES... she
	was dreaming.  She gets up quickly and crosses to her
	dresser.  She looks into the mirror, at the tiny cuts
	on her cheek, and clucks.  Then she exits, going into...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan opens the door to her sister's room, breathing
	a sigh of relief when she sees Lizzy curled up in bed
	with a doll.  Meagan smiles and starts to exit when
	she notices something not quite right about the doll.
	She moves closer and pulls Lizzy's arm away to reveal
	a hideous little Freddy doll.  Meagan gasps.

				MEAGAN
		Freddy...

	Suddenly, the doll opens it's eyes and sneers:

				FREDDY DOLL
		Well it ain't Raggedy Ann, bitch!

	The Freddy doll flashes it's tiny glove of knives,
	thrusting them deep into Meagan's chest.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - MORNING (for real)

	Meagan sits up suddenly in bed, clutching her chest.
	She looks down and sees that there is nothing there.
	Meagan sighs and falls back in her bed -- just a bad
	dream.

	ZZZZZZT! -- her alarm clock BUZZES.  Meagan sits up
	with a start again.  Her fright turns to rage as she
	pounds the alarm clock into submission.  Meagan climbs
	out of bed...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - MORNING

	Meagan enters and finds Lizzy still asleep, clutching
	her Raggedy Ann doll.  She gently pries the doll away,
	tossing it disdainfully away.  Meagan picks up a small
	glass unicorn and playfully prances it around on Lizzy's
	head.

				MEAGAN
		Wake up, sleepy head. Time to wake
		up.

	Lizzy's eyes flutter open.  She smiles at her sister,
	then frowns.

				LIZZY
		I had a bad dream.

				MEAGAN
		Me, too.

				LIZZY
		I was scared.

				MEAGAN
		Don't worry... they can't hurt you.

				LIZZY
		Promise?

				MEAGAN
		Promise.

	Lizzy hugs Meagan.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		I'll never let anyone hurt you.


	INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

	CLOSE ON a small television set on the kitchen table.
	A flashy graphic flashes across the screen: AM NEWS
	SPECIAL REPORT -- COPS V.S. THE CULT -- DAY 13.  A
	NEWS REPORTER stands in front a police blockade. In
	the background, dozens of POLICE and S.W.A.T. MEN
	surround a small run-down, two-story house... Freddy's
	house.

				NEWS REPORTER
			(filtered)
		As the sun rises on yet another
		morning, still no end in sight for
		the standoff between police and the
		mysterious group known only as the
		"Freddy" cult who seized the abandoned
		house behind me just thirteen days
		ago.  These cultists -- mostly run-
		away teenagers -- have managed to
		keep police at bay for almost two
		weeks while inside they take mind-
		altering narcotics in order to
		communicate with their god --
		Freddy.

	The reporter babbles on as Meagan enters the kitchen
	where MEAGAN'S MOM is sitting watching the TV, gulping
	down orange juice.  Across from mom is MEAGAN'S DAD,
	who is having coffee, reading the paper.  Meagan pours
	herself a cup and sits.

				MEAGAN
		Morning.

	Meagan's mom grunts, transfixed on the news.  Dad
	looks over his paper long enough to smile and say,
	just a little too cheerfully:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Morning, Meagan.

	Meagan looks over at her mother, then back at her
	father, mouthing the words "How's mom?", when suddenly
	Meagan's mom bellows:

				MEAGAN'S MOM
			(calls upstairs)
		Lizzy! Get down here! Breakfast
		is almost ready!

	Meagan turns back to her dad but he has ducked back
	into his paper.  Meagan sighs and sips her coffee.

	ANGLE ON TV -- a police booking photo of FRED KRUEGER.

				NEWS REPORTER
		Alleged child murderer Fred Krueger
		was released on a legal technicality
		but later burned to death at the
		hands of a vigilante mob of grieving
		parents.  Some years later, a rash
		of bizarre and unexplainable teen-
		age deaths began leaving many in
		the area to wonder... is Freddy
		really dead?

	Meagan's younger sister -- LIZZY -- comes down to
	breakfast.  The microwave DINGS and Meagan's mom
	pulls out three Pop Tarts, dealing them out to her
	family like playing cards.  Lizzy picks up her Pop
	Tart, whining.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Hurry up and eat. You don't want
		to be late for special school.

				MEAGAN
		Mom! Don't call it that!

				LIZZY
		I hate that school. The other kids
		are mean... and they're all re-
		tard-ed!

	Meagan snickers.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		We don't use that word. They're
		"special" children just like you're
		"special".

	Dad looks over at mom, who shoots him an angry look.
	Dad takes a bite of his Pop Tart, sinking back behind
	the paper.

	ANGLE ON TV --

				NEWS REPORTER
		The cult members have declined to
		an on-camera interview but did send
		out a note with a message. The note
		-- which, by the way, appears to
		have been written in blood -- reads...
			(reads the note)
		To the parents of Springwood --
		Freddy lives! Soon he will come and
		take one of your children as his
		virgin bride. Then Freddy will -BEEP-
		and his -BEEP- upon her -BEEP- and
		-BEEP- and behold, a soulless child
		shall be born. The vessel for Freddy
		to rise and rule the darkness forever
		and ever.

	A horn TOOTS outside.

				MEAGAN
		That's Jesse. Let's go, Lizzy.

	Meagan collects her books and her sister. This is
	dad's cue to look at his watch and say:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Oh, look at the time! I've got to
		be going... anyone need me to bring
		anything home tonight?

				MEAGAN
		I need an alarm clock.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		What's wrong with your old one?

				MEAGAN
		Broke.

	Meagan kisses her dad as she and Lizzy hurry out the
	door.  Meagan's dad looks over at his wife, who says:

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		We're almost out of vodka.


	EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MORNING - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan and Lizzy climb into JESSE's car.

				JESSE
		Good morning! Hey, what's the matter?

				MEAGAN
		My mom...

				JESSE
		And...?

				MEAGAN
		I had another dream last night...

				JESSE
		Was I naked?

				MEAGAN
		No. You were Jason.

				JESSE
		Jason? Oh, yeech...
			(then)
		Was I any good?

	Meagan playfully smacks him as Jesse's car ROARS off.


	INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

	Meagan's dad hesitates at the front door, clutching
	his keys and briefcase as he musters the courage to
	say something.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Do you have to watch that crap all
		the time? Months and months of the
		O.J. Simpson trial, and now this...

	Mom reaches over and switches off the TV. Dad smiles
	slightly and exits. Mom waits until the door closes,
	then takes a bottle of vodka and pours a goodly bit
	into her orange juice.  She takes a deep drink and
	switches the set back on.

	CLOSE ON TV as the news reporter interviews CAPTAIN
	RENTON MURDOCH -- State Trooper.

				NEWS REPORTER
		I'm standing here with State Trooper
		Captain Renton Murdoch, the man the
		Governor has called in to deal with
		the cultists because of his past
		experience with occult-style
		murderers. In fact, Trooper Murdoch
		is the only law enforcement officer
		ever to survive a one-on-one encounter
		with notorious Camp Crystal Lake
		killer -- Jason Voorhees.
			(to Murdoch)
		You received some pretty nasty
		injuries in your battle with Jason,
		didn't you, Captain?

				MURDOCH
		Nothing serious... just a few
		stitches.

				NEWS REPORTER
		What about these so called "Freddy"
		cultists? They seem like pretty
		tough customers. Think you'll have
		any trouble getting them out of
		there?

				MURDOCH
		No. Now that the Governor has given
		me complete authority to deal with
		these punks I should be putting an
		end to their situation pretty quick.
		Unless of course their attorney is
		able to get them to come out peace-
		fully... but I don't hold out much
		hope for that.

				NEWS REPORTER
			(to camera)
		Captain Renton Murdoch, ladies and
		gentlemen. A tough cop... for tough
		criminals.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. "FREDDY" CULT COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

	Murdoch gets into the command car, sitting down next
	to the S.W.A.T. COMMANDER sitting behind the wheel.

				MURDOCH
		Damn media... oughtta be a law.
			(gestures to house)
		Is that shyster still in there
		trying to talk them out?

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Yeah... he's making them some kind
		of deal.

				MURDOCH
		Damn lawyers... what a bunch of
		assholes. Shakespeare was right --
		kill all the lawyers. Then we could
		kill all the punks with no hassles
		and the world would be a safer place.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Smaller anyway.

				MURDOCH
		Ahhhhh... what did Shakespeare know?
		Long-haired, English freak. He was
		probably a punk.


	INT. CULT COMPOUND - SAME TIME

	Meanwhile, inside the house... the cult's sleazy LAWYER
	is sitting on a crate in the middle of a dark room.
	He is surrounded by CULTISTS -- heavily-armed teenage
	punks in red and olive sweaters and Fedoras ala Freddy.
	They stare out at him through sunglasses with red
	flashing diodes that barely hide their burned and
	disfigured faces.

	The lawyer shifts uncomfortably on the crate as he
	takes a deep snort from inside his briefcase held
	neatly on his lap.  Then he lifts his head, wiping
	his nose nervously as he speaks:

				SLEAZY LAWYER
		So, as I explained to you before,
		the revenues between the TV movie
		deal and the book sale should be
		adequate to fund your joint-defense.
		And I think with my mass media
		hypnosis argument I could get each
		of you a reduced sentence on appeal
		-- say... twenty years each. Out
		in fifteen with good behavior?
		Hmmmmm?

					HARD CUT TO:

	EXT. CULT COMPOUND - MOMENTS LATER

	The lawyer's disembodied head comes sailing out of
	an upstairs window, smacking into the command car's
	windshield with a loud SPLAT!

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Jesus Christ!

	Murdoch curses and leaps out of the car, charging
	the house as he BLASTS away with two nickel-plated
	.45s.  Suddenly GUNFIRE erupts from every window in
	the house, BULLET HITS RIDDLING the cops cars,
	SMASHING windows and emergency lights.

	The S.W.A.T. TEAM follows Murdoch through the hail
	of GUNFIRE as he kicks open the front door.


	INT. CULT COMPOUND - NEXT INSTANT

	WHACK! -- the door flies open and Murdoch and the
	S.W.A.T. team move in.  The windows have been covered
	with foil, the walls have been painted black with
	cult slogans written in red, making the whole house
	black as pitch.  The S.W.A.T. team puts on their
	night vision goggles and starts moving through the
	house.

	P.O.V. THROUGH NIGHT VISION GOGGLES as the S.W.A.T.
	team goes through the house SHOOTING cultists (ala
	the computer game DOOM).  Then a blinding flash of
	light and a S.W.A.T. guy goes down -- shot in the
	face.

	Several of the cultists lead the attacking S.W.A.T.
	team deeper into the house.  As one of the S.W.A.T.
	guys follows his foot trips a wire.  A trap door
	opens in the floor and the S.W.A.T. guy falls into
	a pit, waist deep in water.  Suddenly, the water
	starts churning and the guy starts screaming -- it's
	a tank of piranhas!  Two other S.W.A.T. guys grab
	his arms and pull him out.  Too late -- his legs
	have been shredded to the bone.

	Another S.W.A.T. guy kicks in a door to a room and
	steps in, FIRING his machine gun.  A large scythe
	swings down and severs both his arms at the elbows.
	His arms fall to the floor, still FIRING the machine
	gun.

	The cultists race into a room, grabbing handrailing
	bolted over head.  They swing like monkeys across
	the ceiling just as a S.W.A.T. guy charges into the
	room behind them.

	CLOSE ON S.W.A.T. GUY'S BOOTS as he steps onto a floor
	covered with upturned nails.  Several nails puncture
	both boots, the points coming up through the laces.
	The S.W.A.T. guy screams and another S.W.A.T. guy
	barrels into the room to see what is wrong.  He knocks
	the first guy face-first into the floor o' nails.

	Meanwhile, Murdoch is having a blast -- literally.
	He kicks open the door to a room and guns down three
	cultists as they try to escape out a window.  As
	the last body pitches to the floor, Murdoch yells:

				MURDOCH
		Freeze!

	Murdoch exits, laughing to himself.

	The running GUNBATTLE continues as the cultists
	retreat to the back of the house, throwing molotov
	cocktails.  Soon the first floor is ablaze. A S.W.A.T.
	guy screams as he is consumed by FIRE.  The cultists
	thunder down a back staircase to the...


	INT. THE BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The cultists uncover a secret passageway under the
	house and most escape through the underground tunnel
	just before the S.W.A.T. team comes BLASTING into
	the basement.  As the last of the remaining cultists
	is capped off, a faint voice cries for help.  The
	S.W.A.T. commander raises up his hand.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Hold your fire!

	He pulls off his night vision goggles and shines his
	flashlight into the basement.  Through the dense
	smoke he sees a little girl in a white dress is tied
	to a chair sitting on a crate.  Underneath the chair
	-- several sticks of dynamite wired to a timer. CLOSE
	ON THE TIMER: 30... 29... 28...

				LITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE
		Help me, mister... please.

	The S.W.A.T. commander rushes to the girl, kneeling
	down to look at the bomb.  Then he takes a Leatherman
	tool from his vest and starts to work on the bomb's
	timer.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Hang on, honey... I'll have you
		out of there in a second.

	Murdoch comes down the stairs.  He goes to the secret
	passageway and says:

				MURDOCH
		Looks like we'll have to hunt the
		rest of them down. Let's go before
		they get too far.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		We can't leave! Can't you see
		we've got a situation here?

	Murdoch looks at the little girl and shrugs.

				MURDOCH
		Leave her.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		You're crazy! I can't just leave
		her!

				MURDOCH
		Forget it. I've seen this before.
		There's nothing you can do.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		I've got to try...

	The S.W.A.T. commander wipes his brow and leans in
	to work on the bomb again.  CLOSE ON TIMER: 24...
	23... 22...

	The basement ceiling is now fully ABLAZE and chunks
	of BURNING DEBRIS fall around the skittish S.W.A.T.
	team.  Murdoch looks at his watch in a bored fashion.

				MURDOCH
		You're wasting your time.

	The S.W.A.T. commander studies the wires for another
	second, then glances back at the timer... 15... 14...
	13...

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Fuck it!

	The S.W.A.T. commander whips out his Spyderco knife
	and cuts the little girl loose.  He carries her out
	in his arms as he shouts to his men:

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
			(continuing; yelling)
		CLEAR OUT! SHE'S GOIN' BLOW!!!

	The S.W.A.T. team exits the basement with Murdoch
	bringing up the rear.


	EXT. CULT COMPOUND - NEXT INSTANT

	The S.W.A.T. commander staggers out with the little
	girl, followed closely with the remainder of his men
	and finally Murdoch.  The commander throws himself to
	the ground, covering the little girl with his body as
	-- BA-BOOM!!! -- the Elm Street house EXPLODES!

	Murdoch stands as debris rains down around him.  He
	mutters:

				MURDOCH
		Punks.

	As the dust settles, the S.W.A.T. commander rolls off
	the little girl and starts checking her for injury.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Are you okay, honey?

	Suddenly, the little girl jumps onto the S.W.A.T.
	commander, flashing a glove of knives.  She hisses:

				LITTLE GIRL HOSTAGE
		Freddy lives!

	With a quick swing, the little girl slashes the
	commander's face.  She dives back for a plunge to
	his throat when Murdoch walks up and kicks her off.
	He puts his boot on her, holding her down as he
	takes aim on her head with his pistol -- execution
	style.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		NO!

	The S.W.A.T. commander grabs Murdoch's arm just in
	time.  Several cops rush in and grab the girl,
	dragging her off, kicking and screaming.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
			(continuing)
		Jesus... you were going to kill
		that kid, weren't you?

				MURDOCH
		I told you you were wasting your
		time. Once these kids go rabid,
		best thing to do is put 'em down.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		You can't be serious...

				MURDOCH
		Dead serious. See... the world is
		made up of rules. Kids don't like
		rules. They rebel for a while, but
		ultimately they start to fall in
		line and become ordinary Joe's like
		you and me. But some kids... dope
		smokers mainly, watching their MTV...
		Satanic lyrics melting what's left
		of their brains... these kids grow
		up to be punks. And when these punks
		step as far over the line as these
		"Freddy" punks have -- then we as
		peace officers have no choice but
		to kill them.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		I didn't become a peace officer to
		kill kids.

				MURDOCH
		Punks. There's a difference...
			(under his breath)
		...barely.

					   CUT TO:

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

	CLOSE ON GRAFFITI written across lockers -- FREDDY
	LIVES!

	We move from this to a small classroom window. Through
	it we see Meagan sitting in economics class.  The
	instructor -- MISS KREPPS -- is lecturing.

				MISS KREPPS
		(Blah-blah. Blah-blah-blah.)

	It's hot.  Several of the kids fan themselves,
	struggling to stay awake while others have already
	passed out on their desks.  Meagan's eyes are heavy.
	She looks over at Jesse, pretending to follow along
	in his book, fast asleep.  The antique oscillating
	fan on Miss Krepps' desk CLICKS loudly as she drones
	on:

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		(Blah-blah-blah. Blah-blah.)

	Meagan starts to drift off, when...

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing; loud)
		Meagan!?

				MEAGAN
		Yes, ma'am?

				MISS KREPPS
		I asked if you were ready to give
		your oral report?

				MEAGAN
		Yes... I'm ready.

				MISS KREPPS
		Please come up here to the podium.

	Meagan gets up and goes to the podium amidst the
	snickers of some of her classmates.  Miss Krepps
	snaps her fingers for quiet.

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		You won't think it's funny when
		you haven't learned the fundamentals
		of a free market economy... oh,
		why do I waste my breath? You're
		all going to grow up to be gas
		station attendants and waitresses
		anyway. Go ahead, Meagan.

				MEAGAN
		My report is on Global Economic
		Trends.
			(clears throat;
				 begins reading)
		Try and think of a world where there
		is no poverty... no sickness... no
		crime. A world where everyone is
		happy to be alive and everyone lives
		together in peace. This is my dream.

	The fan on Miss Krepps' desk starts to CLICK louder,
	BLOWING harder.  Meagan raises an eyebrow but continues
	with her report.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		This dream is becoming a reality
		with ever-growing international
		business...

	CLOSE ON THE FAN as it changes... getting creepier...
	turning into a Freddy-fan.  BLOWING harder... CLICKING
	louder.

				MISS KREPPS
		Louder, Meagan. We can't hear you.

	Meagan repeats the last few sentences, raising her
	voice to be heard over the fan.  Then pages of her
	report start to blow away.  She grabs at them as the
	WIND increases.

	A bottle of glue stowed in the podium overturns and
	spills to the floor at Meagan's feet.  She bends over
	to pick it up, when her skirt blows up.  She presses
	it down but the WIND is too great and the skirt
	billows up, revealing her underwear.  The class roars
	with laughter.

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		Louder, Meagan... we still can't
		hear you.

	But Meagan isn't reading her report anymore, she's
	busy trying to push down her skirt when -- RIP! --
	the WIND blows her skirt off.  Her classmates fall
	over themselves, laughing.  RIP! -- Meagan's blouse
	blows away.  She tries to hide behind the podium when
	that too is swept off.

	Meagan clutches at her bra and panties as they start
	to drift away -- thread by thread.  She is almost
	naked.  Meagan looks up at her classmates, red in the
	face.

	Her classmates point and laugh -- only now they are
	all a bunch of old rotten skeletons.  And up front,
	in the center where Miss Krepps sat... is Freddy! He
	wears a beanie with a propeller, points and laughs:

				FREDDY
		Aww... all dressed up and nowhere
		to blow!

	Meagan screams, clutching at the last few tiny strands
	of cloth that cover her body.  She calls to Jesse,
	pleading:

				MEAGAN
		Jesse... please, help me.

	But Jesse just sits at his desk -- dead.  He reaches
	up and slowly lowers a hockey mask over his pale,
	expressionless face.

				FREDDY
		Looks like a photo opportunity to
		me!

	Freddy pulls out an over-sized camera with a gargantuan
	flashgun attached.  The flash bulb is the size of a
	beach ball and has a nuclear warning etched in the
	front.  Freddy sizes Meagan up in the viewfinder and
	sneers:

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Say... cheesecake!

	PHOOMPH!!! -- the flash bulb goes off with an atomic
	light.  Meagan screams as her skeleton is blown back
	against the blackboard -- vaporized!

					HARD CUT TO:

	Meagan waking up in her seat suddenly.  The classroom
	as normal.  Miss Krepps is standing over her, asking:

				MISS KREPPS
		Meagan? Meagan?!

	Meagan looks around, bewildered and confused.

				MISS KREPPS
			(continuing)
		I asked if you were ready to give
		your report?

	Meagan realizes that she was dreaming and pulls
	herself together.

				MEAGAN
		Sure...

	Meagan stands up and faints.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. SCHOOL NURSE'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

	MEAGAN'S P.O.V as the SCHOOL NURSE comes into FOCUS,
	standing over her.

				SCHOOL NURSE
		Meagan? Can you hear me? Do you
		know where you are?

	Meagan is laying on a couch, a cloth over her head.

				MEAGAN
		I was day dreaming and then I woke
		up but then it was like I was still
		dreaming and then I woke up and
		then I guess I fainted and now I'm
		awake again...

				SCHOOL NURSE
		Are you sure?

	Meagan stares at the nurse for a moment.

				SCHOOL NURSE
			(continuing)
		Meagan?

				MEAGAN
		I'm waiting to see if you're going
		to turn into Freddy.

				SCHOOL NURSE
		Freddy... I see. You've been watching
		too much CNN. That crazy "Freddy"
		cult thing -- it's all over the TV
		day and night -- you can't get away
		from it. No wonder you kids are all
		having nightmares.

				MEAGAN
		But this one was different... it
		felt real.

				SCHOOL NURSE
		But that's just it, Meagan... dreams
		aren't real. They're just broken
		fragments of the subconscious mind.

				MEAGAN
		Fear is real though, isn't it? And
		if nightmares are fear, then doesn't
		that make them real?!
			(gets excited)
		And if the nightmares are real then
		is reality like a dream?!

				SCHOOL NURSE
			(cutting her off)
		Meagan! You've got heat prostration...
		that's all.

	The nurse slaps a wet towel over her face.


	INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

	Jesse is waiting for Meagan as she emerges from the
	nurse's office, muttering under her breath:

				MEAGAN
		Old witch... what does she know?
		She isn't even qualified to give a
		shot and she's telling me that my
		dreams aren't anything to worry
		about.

				JESSE
		So she said you were okay?

				MEAGAN
		Oh, sure... Madame Curie in there
		says it's just a case of heat pro-
		stration and an overdose of TV news.
		Ruined my makeup, too.

				JESSE
		So you're going back to class?

				MEAGAN
		No. She gave me last period off.

				JESSE
		Well, what are you bitching about?
		I could have a compound fracture of
		the skull and she wouldn't excuse me
		from P.E.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse! I've been having nightmares
		for almost two weeks now and they
		keep getting worse! Now I'm having
		daymares! I want to know why!

				JESSE
		Okay... well, didn't the nurse say
		it was heat probation?

	Meagan rolls her eyes in frustration.

				MEAGAN
		You don't understand... I want to
		know more about dreams. What they
		mean... why we have them.

				JESSE
		Okay, Meg, go look it up. You've
		got the rest of the day off, that's
		all I'm saying.

				MEAGAN
		That's a good idea. Why don't you
		cut last period and come with me?

				JESSE
		Sure. Where are we going?

				MEAGAN
		The library.

				JESSE
		You want me to cut school so we can
		go to the library?

					   CUT TO:

	INT. LIBRARY - AFTERNOON

	Meagan pours through a big psychology book.  Across
	the table, Jesse peers into another psychology book.

				MEAGAN
		Find anything?

	Jesse looks up suddenly.

				JESSE
		What? Oh, no... nothing yet.

	Over Jesse's shoulder we see he has a copy of ROAD &
	TRACK tucked inside his psychology book.

				MEAGAN
		Did you know that our sub-conscious
		retains everything that ever happened
		to us? Everything. From the time
		we're born until we die.

				JESSE
		Really?

				MEAGAN
		That's how Freddy gets at us...
		by using our sub-conscious fears.
		Fears our conscious minds have
		repressed or forgotten.

				JESSE
		I've got a news flash for you...
		Freddy's dead.

				MEAGAN
		I'm not so sure... if Freddy exists
		in our sub-conscious then he can
		never be fully erased. Like a bad
		memory... you may blot it out of
		your mind but it will alway be
		hiding someplace in your dreams.
			(off Jesse's
				 disbelieving stare)
		Weren't you scared as a child by
		something so stupid that you're
		ashamed to admit it?

				JESSE
		No.

				MEAGAN
		No?

				JESSE
		Well, yeah.

				MEAGAN
		Well, what? What is it?

				JESSE
		Well... when I was kid, my brother
		took me to the carnival. And in the
		penny arcade there was this robot
		gunslinger...

				MEAGAN
		Black Bart.

				JESSE
		You know about Black Bart?

				MEAGAN
		Duh. You put your quarter in and he
		says, "Go ahead and draw, tenderfoot."
		And then you pull your gun out and
		shoot him.

				JESSE
		That's just it -- I never could!
		I'd point the gun right at him and
		shoot, and I could never hit the guy.
		So I always got killed.

				MEAGAN
		No one can hit him -- it's a gyp.

				JESSE
		Scared the shit out of me.

	Meagan tries to hide her smile.

				JESSE
			(continuing;
				 flustered)
		Isn't that scary? I mean... for a
		kid?

	Meagan laughs.  Somebody shushes her.

				JESSE
			(continuing;
				 mad)
		Okay, smartass... what about you?
		What scared you the most as a kid?

	A dark mood falls over Meagan as her mind winds back.

				MEAGAN
		I remember... Lizzy wandered off
		one day and we couldn't find her.
		The police came and everything. I
		wasn't really worried until I saw
		her picture on TV... then I got
		really scared.
			(then)
		Jesse, I can't explain it... but I
		think something bad's going to
		happen.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. SPECIAL SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

	Lizzy sits on the steps of her school, clutching
	her books and Raggedy Ann doll... waiting. Behind
	her, wearing a protective helmet, another learning
	disabled kid - LEONARD - taunts her.

				LEONARD
		You're stupid!

				LIZZY
		No, you are!

				LEONARD
		They forgot you again!

				LIZZY
		No, they didn't!

				LEONARD
		Yes, they forgot and you're goin'
		to wait out here until it's dark
		and then the monsters are goin'
		come and get you!

				LIZZY
		No they won't, because I'm walkin'
		home!

	Lizzy gets to her feet and starts walking.  Leonard
	calls after her:

				LEONARD
		Come back, Lizzy! You can wait with
		me! I got forgot too, you know!

	Lizzy keeps going, marching across the deserted school
	yard.  Leonard turns to go inside the school when he
	bumps into a passing CULTIST.  The cultist pushes him
	down as he follows after Lizzy.

				LEONARD
			(continuing)
		Okay... I'm going to have to report
		this!

	Lizzy walks briskly along when she gets the feeling
	she's being followed.  She turns and sees a cultist
	standing behind a tree several dozen yards behind her.
	Lizzy turns away and quickens her pace but when she
	glances back, the figure is still standing... but
	closer.

	Scared, Lizzy turns and runs, dropping her books as
	she flees down the sidewalk.  As she comes to the
	street, a big black hearse suddenly pulls up in front
	of her, the door swinging open wide.  Burned arms
	reach out to grab Lizzy.  She screams.

	The cultists grab Lizzy, pulling her into the car as
	it roars off down the street.

	CLOSE ON RAGGEDY ANN -- laying in the gutter.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

	Jesse's car pulls up to a sea of police cars parked
	in front of Meagan's house.  Meagan gets out of the
	car and rushes inside.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	COPS are everywhere as Meagan bursts into the house,
	calling for her family.  Jesse enters behind her when
	Meagan's dad comes up, asking:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Didn't you get my message?

				MEAGAN
		What message?

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		I called the school after lunch...
		I had to stay late after work...
		I...

	Meagan's mother bellows from the living room where
	she is talking to a policeman taking notes.  She is
	drunk and has been crying.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Don't you dare blame this on her,
		you sorry bastard! It's all your
		fault!
			(to Meagan)
		Where have you been anyway?

				MEAGAN
		The library.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		A likely Goddamn story!

	Meagan's mom breaks down sobbing.

				MEAGAN
		Dad... what's wrong? What's happened?
		Where's Lizzy?

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		She didn't come home from school
		today. The police got a report that
		a girl fitting Lizzy's description
		was forced into a car by some
		crazies. They're pretty sure it was
		this "Freddy" cult.

				MEAGAN
			(shocked)
		Oh, my God...

	Meagan's dad puts his arm around Meagan and tries to
	comfort her.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Now don't worry. The police are
		doing everything they can.

	Meagan looks over and sees Murdoch talking to his
	men when a voice from upstairs calls down:

				TROOPER
			(O.S.)
		Hey, Cap'n... better have a look
		up here!


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - NEXT SECOND

	As Murdoch enters, he spots Lizzy's night table and
	the small glass menagerie there.  Murdoch picks up
	the unicorn and admires it when a TROOPER draws his
	attention to the floor next to the bed.

	Laying there are several childlike drawings of Freddy,
	including one that has "Freddy Lives" scrawled across
	the top.

	Meagan enters and sees the drawings.  She gasps.

				TROOPER
		Looks like she was in the cult all
		along.

				MEAGAN
		No... no, she wouldn't do that!
		Lizzy wouldn't join Freddy's cult!

				TROOPER
		I know it's hard to believe, miss.
		But a lot of good kids get caught
		up in this kind of trouble.

	Murdoch stares at the drawings, his jaw muscles
	tightening.  He clenches his fist, pulverizing the
	little unicorn.

				MURDOCH
		Punks...

	Murdoch drops the broken pieces of the unicorn on
	the table as he exits the room, brushing past Meagan.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	Meagan's dad follows Murdoch to the door, asking:

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Captain Murdoch... is there any-
		thing we can do?

				MURDOCH
		You can pray, sir. Pray we find your
		daughter before... well, before it's
		too late. But rest assured, if I
		can't persuade her to come back to
		her loving home, then I'll do what's
		best for her. I know you and your
		wife wouldn't want her to suffer.
			(to his men)
		Come on... I want to go talk to
		Erwin.

	Murdoch and his men say "good-bye" and quickly exit.


	EXT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

	As the last of the cops drive away, Meagan pulls
	Jesse out of the house.

				JESSE
		Where are we going?

				MEAGAN
		Over to Stormie's.

				JESSE
		Stormie? I thought you and her weren't
		friends anymore since she stole that
		twenty dollars from you.

				MEAGAN
		That was her "klepto" phase... when
		she was dating that gang member.
		She dumped him a long time ago.

				JESSE
		I still don't understand. What has
		she got to do with Lizzy missing?

				MEAGAN
		She used to be in the Freddy cult.
		Maybe she knows where they took
		Lizzy.

	They exit to Jesse's car.

					   CUT TO:

	INT. STORMIE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON

	Meagan's high-strung best friend -- STORMIE -- is
	blurting out at a mile-a-minute:

				STORMIE
		If I did know I would call the
		police, you know that. I love Lizzy.
		No telling what those freaks will
		do to her. Those Freddy cult guys
		are hard core.

				JESSE
		I thought you were in the cult?

				STORMIE
		I was in the cult for a week cause
		my boyfriend at the time... Slasher,
		he was. But I just liked the music
		and the clothes... when they were
		clean, but not like the violence
		and stuff. But that was just my
		"cult" phase... but I got past that.
		You know, just like my "gang" phase
		when I was dating Ramon and then
		before that was my "death rock"
		phase when I was dating Stuart...

				JESSE
		Uh, excuse me... but what phase
		are we in now?

				STORMIE
		Militant feminist, man-hating phase,
		what's it fuckin' to ya?!

				JESSE
			(to Meagan)
		Why don't you just let the cops find
		her? That guy Renton Murdoch -- he
		knows how to deal with these cultist
		psychos. He was the man who got Jason
		Voorhees.

				MEAGAN
		That guy in my dreams...

				STORMIE
		Jason kicked his ass.

						   QUICK CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - SOME YEARS AGO - NIGHT

	Jesse narrates a short, fuzzy, silent flashback as
	younger-looking Renton Murdoch is BLASTING away at
	Jason in panic.

				JESSE
			(V.O.)
		Well... yeah. But Murdoch put
		thirteen bullets in Jason before
		he hacked his head open.

	Jason cleaves Murdoch's head with a machete.  Murdoch
	staggers back, raising his pistol.

				JESSE
			(V.O.,
				 continuing)
		But even with his head hacked open
		and his brains leaking out, Murdoch
		still managed to put his last bullet
		in Jason's eye.

	Murdoch FIRES, the bullet SMACKING Jason in the eye.
	Thick blood runs down the hockey mask as Murdoch's
	body hits the ground.


	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM-

	Murdoch lays in a bed, his head covered in bandages.
	Tubes and hoses running everywhere to all sorts of
	medical contraptions.

				STORMIE
			(V.O.)
		Well, one of my mom's boyfriends
		worked at the hospital where they
		took him. He said that Murdoch lost
		more than half his brain and what
		little that was left was all twisted
		up inside. And they had to replace
		his skull with a metal plate to
		keep that from leaking out.

	In a series of quick cuts we move in close on Murdoch's
	eyes -- dark and menacing -- staring out at us.

				STORMIE
			(V.O.,
				 continuing)
		They say he hasn't been the same
		since.

					CUT BACK TO:

	INT. STORMIE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

				JESSE
		So what's different about him?

				STORMIE
		One thing... he used to be a
		Democrat. Now he votes straight
		Republican.

				MEAGAN
		I think he thinks Lizzy joined the
		cult or something.

				STORMIE
		Oh, my God... he'll kill her.

				MEAGAN
		I've got to find Lizzy myself. I've
		got to find her and save her from
		Freddy before that crazy cop kills
		her.

				JESSE
		Just where are you going to look?
		I mean, these cult guys could be
		holding her anywhere.

				MEAGAN
		Murdoch said something about going
		to talk to somebody named Erwin.

				STORMIE
		Erwin Kelper! He used to be in the
		Freddy cult! I bet he knows where
		they took Lizzy!

				JESSE
		Not Squirmin' Erwin -- that freak
		that used to eat bugs?

				STORMIE
			(annoyed)
		Who else?
			(to Meagan; bright)
		Erwin is scary smart -- always brought
		home "A"s -- but he was kinda fucked
		up, too... I mean, who isn't really?
		Anyway, he quit the cult a few months
		back and the cops put him away for
		his own safety. They say Freddy's
		put a death hex on Erwin.

				JESSE
		A death hex?

				STORMIE
		Yes, a death hex. You know... where
		someone wants you dead!

				MEAGAN
		Where is he?

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - AFTERNOON

	Jesse, Meagan, and Stormie pull past the large sign
	and into the parking lot.  As Jesse puts the car in
	park, Meagan turns to him and says:

				MEAGAN
		I want you to stay here.

				JESSE
		Why?

				MEAGAN
		Don't be mad... it's just that you
		might scare him.

				JESSE
		Scare him?

				STORMIE
		What she's subtly trying to tell
		you is that this needs a woman's
		gentle touch... butthead.

				MEAGAN
		Just stay here... okay?

	Jesse grudgingly agrees.  Meagan kisses Jesse on the
	cheek.  Stormie sticks her tongue out at him, then
	turns as she and Meagan walk toward the main entrance.


	INT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

	The CRIES of the insane echo through the building as
	the SECURITY GUARD escorts Meagan and Stormie down a
	row of cell doors.  He stops at one, tapping lightly
	on the glass.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Yo, Erwin... you've got a couple
		of visitors. Now be a good boy...
			(to Meagan & Stormie)
		You've got five minutes. I'll be
		right down the hall if you need me.

	The guard exits.  Meagan and Stormie peer through the
	thick window -- Erwin's padded cell appears vacant.
	They exchange anxious looks, then Meagan presses a
	little closer to the glass.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin...?

	SPLAT! -- ERWIN suddenly presses his horribly burned
	face to the glass as he screams:

				ERWIN
		SHOW ME YOUR ARMS! YOUR ARMS!

	Meagan and Stormie jump back, startled.  Then they
	quickly bare their arms, turning them over for Erwin's
	inspection.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Where do you shoot?

				MEAGAN
		Shoot?

				STORMIE
		He's talking about dream dope --
		the stuff the cultists shoot up
		with so they can talk to Freddy.

				MEAGAN
		I don't do drugs.

				ERWIN
		You're not in the cult?

				MEAGAN
		No.

				ERWIN
		Didn't Freddy send you to kill me?

				MEAGAN/STORMIE
		No.

				ERWIN
		I don't trust you... better take off
		your clothes so I can check you for
		tracks.

				STORMIE
		Chill, Erwin. We're here for some
		hard data -- not a floppy disk.

	Erwin flops the arms of his straight jacket, gesturing
	to the inside of his cell -- empty except for a small
	mattress.

				ERWIN
		Well, what do you want? Can't you
		see I'm busy?

				MEAGAN
		Freddy's cult kidnapped my sister.

				STORMIE
		I told her you might know where
		they took her.

				ERWIN
		I already told the cops everything
		I know.

				MEAGAN
		Tell me... please.

				ERWIN
		Look... I'm sorry about your sister,
		but I've got my own problems with
		Freddy. I'm a marked man, you know.

				MEAGAN
		Then tell me why they took her...

				ERWIN
		To bear his child. Freddy wants to
		be human again. In order to do that
		he has to be "reborn".

				MEAGAN
		How can he do that?

				ERWIN
		He has to marry a virgin on holy
		ground. Then the cult consumate
		the marriage by impregnating her.

				STORMIE
		The whole cult? Yeech!

				ERWIN
		Freddy's the son of a hundred maniacs.
		It's sort of a tradition with him.

				MEAGAN
		So the cult gets Lizzy pregnant?

				ERWIN
		And Freddy enters the soul of the
		fetus through a dream state. Voila!
		Rebirth.

	There is a moment as the girls take this in, then:

				STORMIE
		That's the stupidest shit I ever
		heard.

				ERWIN
		Hey, they're not my rules... some-
		body else wrote 'em.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin... you've got to help me find
		Lizzy. You're my only hope.

	Erwin thinks about this for a second, then:

				ERWIN
		I'll help you find your sister, but
		you've got to help me.

				MEAGAN
		Anything. Just name it.

				ERWIN
		You have to help me kill Freddy.

	Meagan and Stormie exchange looks.

				STORMIE
		But Freddy's dead.

				ERWIN
		Freddy lives...
			(looks at Meagan)
		If only in our dreams.

	Stormie grabs Meagan by the arm and starts to pull
	her away.

				STORMIE
		Come on, Meagan... our five minutes
		is up. He's giving me the creeps.

	But Meagan stays put and asks Erwin:

				MEAGAN
		How can you kill a dream?

				ERWIN
		When it's not a dream.
			(then)
		Do we have a deal?

	Erwin presses his palm against the glass.  Meagan
	thinks a moment, then puts her hand against the glass
	over his.

				MEAGAN
		Deal.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. STREET CORNER - AFTERNOON - A SHORT TIME LATER

	Meagan, Jesse, and Stormie are standing in front of
	a pay phone, arguing.

				JESSE
		No! I won't do it!

				MEAGAN
		Come on, Jesse! Please...?

				JESSE
		It's illegal! I could go to jail!

				STORMIE
		How will they ever know? Don't be
		such a pussy!

				JESSE
		Oh, yeah? Why don't you call then?

				STORMIE
		Okay, I will!

				MEAGAN
		No! They'll never believe her!

				STORMIE
		I can disguise my voice...
			(lowers voice)
		Hello, how do you do? My name is
		Jesse. I think I'm a man but I'm
		actually a wimp.

				MEAGAN
		They'll never believe that. Come
		on, Jesse... for me?

				JESSE
		Okay... okay... I'll do it.
			(to Stormie)
		And I'm not a wimp!

	Jesse sighs and steps into the phone booth.  After a
	moment's hesitation, Jesse steps out and immediately
	both girls blurt out ten reasons why he should make
	the call.  Jesse calls for quiet and as soon as both
	girls shut up, he says:

				JESSE
			(continuing)
		I need a quarter for the phone.

	Meagan fishes out a quarter and hands it to him.  Jesse
	re-enters the booth.

	ANGLE IN PHONE BOOTH as Jesse dials a number.


	INT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - NEXT INSTANT

	The security guard picks up his phone as it RINGS.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Springwood Mental Center... how
		can I help you?

				JESSE
			(filtered; disguising
				 his voice)
		There's a bomb planted in your
		building.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Who is this?

				JESSE
		If I were you -- I'd get my ass
		out of there.

	In the background, we hear Meagan and Stormie whisper
	something to Jesse.

				JESSE
			(continuing; adding)
		Oh, yeah... Freddy Lives.

	CLICK! -- The guard's eyes grow wide.


	EXT. SPRINGWOOD MENTAL CENTER - AFTERNOON -SECONDS LATER

	The peaceful quiet of the asylum is shattered by a
	fire ALARM.  Soon all the INMATES start filing out
	into the yard, loosely herded by the GUARDS.  Erwin
	files out with the others, still wearing his straight
	jacket.

	Erwin looks over at the parking lot -- Jesse's car
	flashes it's lights.  Erwin starts to casually wander
	off towards the fence between himself and freedom
	when the SECURITY GUARD spots him and says:

				SECURITY GUARD
		Hey, Erwin... where do you think
		you're going?

	Erwin ignores him, still moving towards the fence.

				SECURITY GUARD
			(continuing)
		I'm talking to you, asshole!

	Erwin breaks into a run.  The guard takes off after
	him.

	In the car, Jesse, Meagan, and Stormie watch as the
	guard closes the distance.

				JESSE
		He's not going to make it.

				MEAGAN
		We've got to do something!

	With grim determination, Jesse starts his car.

	Jesse's car tears out of the parking lot, racing for
	the fence.  With a loud, metallic CHING, Jesse's car
	drives into the fence, knocking that section down.
	Erwin dances over the downed chain-link, diving into
	an open window.  Then, with a SQUEAL of tires and the
	RENDING of metal, Jesse's car backs out of the fence,
	does a 180, and PEELS off.

	ANGLE INSIDE CAR as Stormie and Meagan help Erwin out
	of his straight jacket.  Once freed, Erwin extends his
	hand to Jesse.

				ERWIN
		Hi, my name's Erwin. Thanks for
		busting me out of there!

	Jesse looks at Erwin's outstretched hand -- the
	fingertips are all heavily bandaged.

				JESSE
		Yeah, right... Look, Erwin, just do
		me one favor -- don't eat nothing
		disgusting. My stomach is tight
		enough as it is.

	The security guard runs up to the fence, huffing and
	puffing, watching as Jesse's car disappears down the
	street.  Then he spots something in the fence and
	plucks it out...

	Jesse's front license plate.

					   CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - DUSK

	CLOSE ON LIZZY, screaming and crying as the cultists
	close in around her.  They rip her sleeve off and
	inject her with a syringe.  After a moment, Lizzy
	starts to settle down... falling asleep...

	The cultists lift Lizzy up over their heads and carry
	her towards the big boiler.  Inside -- a raging INFERNO.

	LIZZY'S DREAM STATE P.O.V. -- as the cultists reach
	the boiler, it splits open in the middle like a giant
	gate.  The two halves swing open wide to reveal...


	INT. HELL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	A narrow rocky ledge extends out to a mausoleum atop
	a tall, narrow mountain.  On either side of the ledge
	is a sheer drop to the bleak landscape below -- rivers
	of hot molten lava stretching out for miles, filled
	with LOST SOULS DROWNING and BURNING.  Hundreds upon
	hundreds of voices are SCREAMING and MOANING -- a
	terrible chorus of the damned.

	The cultists carry Lizzy across the rocky ledge to
	the mausoleum.  The outside of this ancient structure
	is engraved with weird murals depicting the evils of
	mankind.  In the center -- a large iron gate that
	swings open as the cultists near.

	The cultists roll Lizzy over in their arms, holding
	her tight as they push her face forward into the
	mirror.  The glass gives way like mercury, Lizzy's
	face disappearing into the mirror.

	ANGLE ON THE OTHER SIDE (UNDERWATER) -- Lizzy's
	face stares out into utter blackness.  Then, some-
	thing large and evil looking swims up out of the
	darkness.  Clawed hands reach out and grab Lizzy by
	the sides of the face as the huge, monstrous head
	moves forward -- evil lips parting -- tongue slithering
	out.

	The evil thing gives Lizzy a big, wet French kiss,
	locking it's lips over hers.  Several slippery some-
	things slither into her mouth.  Lizzy struggles, but
	the big evil thing is way too strong.  Finally, it
	releases her and the cultists pull her back out.

	The cultists carry Lizzy out of Hell and back into
	the...


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Horribly burned hands slap Lizzy back from her semi-
	conscious state.  Her eyes grow wide with fear again
	as she opens her mouth to scream.  Suddenly, she
	doubles over and vomits up into a tupperware a
	cultist thrusts under her.

	Three evil-looking eels slither forth from Lizzy's
	mouth -- the Dream Demons.


	EXT. OLD POWER PLANT - DUSK

	Several shadows flee into the night as Jesse's car
	pulls up next to a run-down building.


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

	Erwin leads Meagan, Jesse and Stormie down into the
	old, burnt out boiler room.  They work their way
	towards the back, to a large table and a collection
	of sofas and easy chair scattered about.  Erwin
	starts sniffing around, pointing out several used
	syringes laying scattered about the floor.

				ERWIN
		Damn! We must have just missed them!

	Meagan spots Lizzy's shirt sleeve on the floor.

				MEAGAN
		Oh, my God -- she was here! This
		is part of Lizzy's shirt! It's all
		torn!
			(grabs Erwin)
		Erwin... we've got to find her!

				ERWIN
		We're too late! There's no way...
		except...

				MEAGAN
		Except what?!

				ERWIN
		We could go after Freddy.

				MEAGAN
		How?

	Erwin goes to a boiler, bends down and reaches way
	up underneath.  After fishing around for a moment,
	he draws out a well-worn Mutant Ninja Turtles lunch
	box.  Inside -- a vile of liquid, several syringes,
	and several pairs of cult shades.

				ERWIN
		We'll inject ourselves with Dream
		Dope.  It's a mild narcotic that
		brings on a dreamlike state.

	Meagan thinks about this for a moment, then nods her
	approval.

				MEAGAN
		Okay... let's do it!

				JESSE
		Meagan... we don't do drugs! I mean,
		what if one of us gets hooked or
		something?
			(whispers)
		We could turn out like him!

	Jesse jerks a thumb toward Erwin.

				ERWIN
		Don't worry about it. We need you
		wide awake anyway.

				JESSE
		What for?

				ERWIN
		We're going to go under and try to
		find Freddy. When we do, we'll grab
		him and bring him here. Then you
		kill him with this...

	Erwin hands Jesse an old rusty revolver.

				JESSE
		This rusty chunk of shit? What
		good is this?

				ERWIN
		It's not the gun, it's what's in
		it -- silver bullets blessed by a
		priest.

				JESSE
		Will that work?

				ERWIN
			(shrugs)
		Should. But then...

				JESSE
			(finishes for him)
		You don't make the rules... yeah,
		yeah.

				MEAGAN
		What should we do?

				ERWIN
		Have a seat over there and make
		yourselves comfortable. Roll up
		your sleeves and put these on...

	Erwin hands Meagan and Stormie each a pair of the
	sunglasses with flashing red diodes in each lens.
	Stormie puts hers on immediately and says:

				STORMIE
		Oh, cool!

				MEAGAN
		What are they for?

				ERWIN
		It's how the cult keeps in constant
		contact with Freddy. The little
		lights flashing are a sustained
		occular input that causes your brain
		to resonate at approximately the
		same frequency at which the dream
		state is most likely to occur.

	All of this went over Meagan's head.  Stormie shrugs:

				STORMIE
		Whatever...
			(to Meagan; excited)
		Put 'em on -- they're really cool!

	Meagan and Stormie sit down in easy chairs, rolling
	up their sleeves.  Erwin comes over and reclines the
	chairs, giving each girl an injection.  Then Erwin
	takes a seat next to Meagan and injects himself.  He
	lets the syringe drop to the floor as he lowers his
	glasses.

				ERWIN
		It helps to hold hands if you want
		to go together...

	Meagan clasps hands with Erwin and Stormie.  Jesse
	watches with skepticism and concern.  Erwin ushers
	a final warning:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		And remember... Freddy knows what
		scares you.

	Then all three FALL THROUGH their chairs into...

	INT. DREAMSPACE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin falling through dreamspace
	(fantastic digital effect tunnel), still holding hands.
	The girls scream as Erwin smiles and yells:

				ERWIN
		WHAT A RUSH, HUH?!!


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

	Jesse watches over Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin -- all
	asleep in their chairs.


	INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - NEXT MOMENT

	Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin fall into a crazy night-
	mare boiler room (visually reminiscent of the Freddy
	pictures) with rusty catwalks, huge out-of-proportion
	fixtures above and a sea of boiling water below.  As
	they get to their feet, Meagan hears Lizzy's voice:

				LIZZY
			(distant)
		Meagan... help me... please...

	Meagan enters a shaft, following the sound when
	suddenly, the shaft closes up behind her.  Stormie
	and Erwin try to find the opening again but can't.

				ERWIN
		Freddy's trying to split us up...


	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

	Jesse is standing in front of an old, full length
	mirror, practicing drawing the pistol.  He pulls it
	and pretends to fire, blowing imaginary smoke from
	the muzzle as he says:

				JESSE
		Okay, Freddy... there's a new sheriff
		in Dreamland now.


	INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - NEXT MOMENT

	Stormie and Erwin make their way through the creepy
	boiler room, calling for Meagan.  A strange shadow
	stalks them -- it's Freddy.  He drops down in front
	of Erwin and Stormie.

				FREDDY
		Looking for some-body?

	Freddy opens up his shirt to reveal a chest full of
	lost souls.  In the center -- Meagan.  Stormie charges
	Freddy, throwing her arms around him as she screams
	to Erwin:

				STORMIE
		I've got him! Wake us up! Wake
		us up!

	But Erwin is paralyzed with fear.

				STORMIE
			(continuing)
		Don't just stand there! Wake us up!

				FREDDY
		Hmmmmm... I feel like seafood tonight.

	Suddenly, Stormie's arms have become huge lobster
	claws.  She jerks away from Freddy, but too late --
	Stormie starts to change into a giant lobster-woman!
	Freddy smiles -- now he's wearing a chef's hat and
	apron.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Stew on this, bitch!

	Freddy knocks the lobster-woman over the side.  She
	falls into the boiling water far below -- KER-SPLASH!

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

	Stormie wakes with a start, yelling:

				STORMIE
		Shoot him! Shoot him!

	Jesse spins, aiming the pistol.  But nothing is there.


	INT. NIGHTMARE BOILER ROOM - SAME TIME

	Freddy turns toward Erwin.

				FREDDY
		Well, well, well... if it isn't
		my ol' pal, Erwin.

	Erwin stares wide-eyed, frozen to the spot.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		I've got something special in mind
		for you...

	Suddenly, Erwin reaches into his sleeve and pulls
	out a pin.  Freddy gawks -- surprised.  Erwin pricks
	his finger.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

	Erwin wakes with a start.  Stormie smacks him.

				STORMIE
		You didn't help me, you pussy!
		I could've had him!
			(smacks him some more)
		You gutless... spinless... jelly
		fish!

	Jesse looks over to where Meagan is still sleeping.


	INT. ELM STREET - DAY (DREAM)

	Meagan comes down the sidewalk, still following
	Lizzy's voice...

				LIZZY
			(V.O.)
		Meagan... help me... Meagan...

	It leads her to her house.  Meagan enters the front
	door.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan sees her father is sitting at the kitchen
	table, reading his paper.  The headline reads:
	FREDDY LIVES!

				MEAGAN
		Daddy?

	He looks up and quietly shushes her.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Shuuuuu! I'm trying to be invisible...

	And with that, Meagan's dad disappears.  Only the
	newspaper remains.  Then Meagan hears Lizzy's VOICE
	again... upstairs.

	As she comes down the upstairs hallway, Meagan passes
	her mother's room.  The door is open a crack.  Meagan
	looks in and sees her mother putting an empty bottle
	to her lips.  The bottle sucks the life out of Meagan's
	mom, who shrivels up into an ugly ol' prune face.

	Meagan starts to help her mother when Lizzy's cry
	for help draws her to...


	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan enters.  She sees Lizzy on her bed, under the
	covers.

				LIZZY
		Help me...

	Meagan pulls back the covers to reveal that Lizzy is
	pregnant, her naked, swollen stomach protruding from
	her night gown.  Something inside is trying to push
	it's way out.

				LIZZY
			(continuing)
		Meagan...

	Lizzy screams.  Meagan moves to help her sister when
	Freddy's glove BURSTS OUT of Lizzy's stomach, stabbing
	Meagan in the chest.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. ABANDONED BOILER ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan wakes up suddenly.  She looks up at Stormie,
	Erwin, and Jesse standing over her.

				STORMIE
		Are you okay?

	They help Meagan to her feet.

				MEAGAN
			(shaky)
		He got away... I had him and he
		got away. Oh, God... Lizzy... I
		lost her...

				ERWIN
		Well, atleast you're not dead.

				MEAGAN
		No... I'm not dead...
			(realizes)
		No... I'm not. But Freddy killed me!

				STORMIE
		He killed me, too. But look...

	Stormie raises her shirt up to show Meagan she is
	unharmed.  Erwin sneaks a look and Stormie smacks him.
	Meagan gets to her feet, asking:

				MEAGAN
		Now that I think about it -- he's
		killed me in all my nightmares. But
		I'm not dead... what does it mean?

				ERWIN
		It means we've still got some time
		left. Until his remains are host to
		the Dream Demons -- Freddy can't
		hurt us.

				JESSE
		Hello. The Dream Demons...?

				ERWIN
		Freddy made a pact with Satan when
		he died... so Satan bestowed upon
		him the Dream Demons. They're the
		source of Freddy's power to manipulate
		our physical reality. Without them...
		he's powerless -- nothing more than
		a bad dream.
			(off Jesse's cynical
				 look)
		Hey, like I said... I don't make
		the rules.

				MEAGAN
		But we've still got a chance, right?
		A chance to kill Freddy before he
		gets back his power?

				ERWIN
		We already tried that. There's no
		way for us to kill Freddy. He's too
		clever. He knows how to get to us.

				MEAGAN
		Then let's get somebody else. Some-
		body strong.

				STORMIE
		Yeah! We could hire somebody to
		kill Freddy -- like a hit man!

				ERWIN
		You would have to hire a thousand
		of them... or one really big guy
		who isn't afraid of anything. No
		fear. Nada. Then you got a shot.

				JESSE
		Where are you going to find a hit
		man? The yellow pages? In your
		dreams...

	Jesse's last three words strike Meagan like a thunder-
	bolt and she stammers out a name:

				MEAGAN
		Jason...

				JESSE
		Jason?

				MEAGAN
		Jason Voorhees...

				ERWIN
			(brightens)
		Jason Voorhees... that's brilliant!
		The perfect dream warrior... no fear.

				STORMIE
		Sounds like our man!

				JESSE
		Uh... excuse me, Einstein... but
		isn't Jason Voorhees dead?

				ERWIN
		Seriously dead. Buried up by Crystal
		Lake somewhere. But don't worry, I
		know how to bring him back to life.

				JESSE
		Somehow I just knew you would.

				ERWIN
		But that's not the problem. The
		problem is control. Once we bring
		Jason back from the dead... I'm not
		one hundred percent sure he'll do
		what we tell him.

				STORMIE
		Well, that's okay... as long as he
		doesn't chop us all up.

	Erwin rolls his eyes around -- uncertain.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin... I'm trusting you on this,
		so tell me the truth. Do you think
		if we do this -- if we go and get
		Jason and bring him back to life,
		that he could kill Freddy?

				ERWIN
		No doubt about. Jason could wreck
		Freddy on this side of the Dreamline.
		But if Freddy has home court advan-
		tage... I don't know. Too close to
		call. The trick would be to get Jason
		to enter a dream state, grab Freddy,
		and drag him out to our reality.

				MEAGAN
		I haven't got a choice. I've got to
		try something...
			(turns to Stormie &
				 Jesse)
		I can't ask either of you to help
		me do this... it's illegal, immoral,
		disgusting...

				STORMIE
		Hey, we sisters have to stand
		together, right? Where you lead --
		I'll follow. Count me in.

	Meagan embraces Stormie, then all three turn to Jesse.
	He looks them over and sighs:

				JESSE
		Let me get this straight... we're
		going to go dig one dead maniac up
		to fight another dead maniac?

				ERWIN
		That's about the size of it... and
		I'd be doing you a disservice if I
		said there weren't a modicum of risk
		involved.

				JESSE
		Meagan... I don't want to do this...

				MEAGAN
		You don't have to, Jesse... it's not
		your fight. I understand.

				JESSE
		But I damn sure don't want you to
		do it without me. Count me in.

	Meagan hugs Jesse.  Erwin tries to hug Stormie but
	she pushes him away.

				ERWIN
		Look out Freddy... here we come.

					   CUT TO:

	EXT. SPRINGWOOD AUTO YARD - NIGHT

	In his shack, listening to a small portable radio,
	is the NIGHT WATCHMAN.  His small DOG suddenly perks
	up her ears and GROWLS low.  The watchman turns down
	the radio.

				NIGHT WATCHMAN
		What's matter, girl... you hear
		somethin'?

	Then the old man hears it, too... A low RUMBLE. Moving
	closer.

	The night watchman steps out of his shack and squints
	into the darkness when a line of several hearses
	approaches.  The lead hearse pulls up to the shack and
	the driver's window rolls down.

				NIGHT WATCHMAN
			(continuing)
		What's this? A funeral procession?

	A Freddy cultist sticks his face out of the window
	and says:

				CULTIST
		That's exactly what it is.

				NIGHT WATCHMAN
			(suspicious)
		Yeah? Whose?

				CULTIST
		Yours.

	BANG! -- the cultist SHOOTS the old man right through
	the head.  The night watchman falls to the ground with
	a lifeless THUD.  The little dog starts BARKING
	ferociously when another SHOT silences her as well.

	Another cultist leaps out of the hearse and runs to
	the gate, cutting the chain with a pair of bolt
	cutters.  He swings the gate open and the funeral
	procession proceeds inside.


	INT. SPRINGWOOD AUTO YARD - A SHORT TIME LATER

	The cultists are standing around a small pit that two
	cultists are carefully excavating in the center of the
	wrecking yard.  Inside the pit, the uncovered remains
	of Freddy Krueger -- nothing more than a pile of
	charred bones.

	Lizzy is brought forward, held by a couple cultists,
	and injected with dream dope as the needle is passed
	around.  She no longer struggles, accepting her fate
	with droopy eyes.

	LIZZY'S DREAM DOPE P.O.V. -- as she watches one of
	the cultists reach down and put a rusty funnel into
	Freddy's broken jawbone.  Her vision gets blurry...
	more surreal as another cult member steps forward
	with the tupperware.  He pours the dream demons into
	the funnel.

	CLOSE ON FREDDY'S REMAINS as the dream demons swim
	around inside his skull.  His bones start to bleed...
	blood becoming arteries and veins... vessels becoming
	muscle... muscle growing scarred flesh...

	There is a FLASH from the pit.  Then suddenly, Freddy
	Krueger -- as you've known him, as you've loved him --
	leaps out of the pit and cries:

				FREDDY
		Smokin'!

	Lizzy rolls her eyes up and faints.  The cultists
	FIRE their weapons into the air and cheer as the
	building-high stacks of wrecked cars surrounding
	them HONK their HORNS and FLASH their LIGHTS.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

	Headlights as Jesse's car zooms past a sign that
	reads: CRYSTAL LAKE - 13 MILES.

				JESSE
			(V.O.)
		We're almost there...

				MEAGAN
			(V.O.)
		We should pull over and ask
		directions.

				STORMIE
			(V.O.)
		If it doesn't offend the men...
		ooops, sorry! There aren't any.

				JESSE
			(V.O.)
		Very funny.


	EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

	Jesse pulls the car into an ol' run-down service
	station.

				STORMIE
		I don't think they're open.

				MEAGAN
		It says, open all night.

	Jesse HONKS the horn and yells:

				JESSE
		Hey! Can we get some service out
		here?!

				STORMIE
		I don't think there's anybody
		here...

	Suddenly, a CRAZY OL' COOT appears on the opposite
	side with a shotgun.  Everyone in the car jumps.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		What do you kids want?

				MEAGAN
		We're looking for the old cemetery
		that's supposed to be around here...
		somewhere.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		What do you want to know for?

				STORMIE
		We want to see it.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Ain't nothin' to see, girly...
		'cept a bunch of ol' graves.

				JESSE
		Look, mister... can you give us
		directions or not?

	The old man gives the occupants of the car a going
	over with his one good eye, hesitating a moment over
	Erwin, who scrunches down in the back seat, hiding
	under a baseball cap.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		You're not goin' up there to do
		somethin' stupid, are you?

				JESSE
			(laughs; nervous)
		Stupid? Like what?

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Like dig up Jason Voorhees --
		that's what!

	Everyone in the car takes a sharp breath -- cold
	busted!  Then they start saying "No! No!" and shaking
	their heads innocently in a big performance that
	wouldn't fool a stick.

				JESSE
			(looks at Meagan)
		Jesus... why would anyone do that?

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		I dunno... but people do.

				STORMIE
		Been dug up a few times already,
		has he?

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		More times than I care to remember.

				MEAGAN
		Well, we're just doing an article
		for our high school newspaper about
		the dangers of breaking into
		cemeteries at night. You know,
		stuff that can get you hurt...

	The ol' coot scans the foursome again closely as he
	acquiesces.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Well... okay... as long as you're
		not going up there to do something
		stupid.
			(pointing)
		Take this road up about a mile and
		make a left at the ol' saw mill.
		That road will take you right on
		in... Eternal Peace Cemetery --
		can't miss it.

	Jesse is already standing on the gas, leaving the
	ol' coot standing in a cloud of smoke and dust.


	EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - NIGHT

	Headlights skew across a rusty iron gateway -- ETERNAL
	PEACE CEMETERY -- illuminating a sign: TRESPASSERS
	WILL BE SHOT!

	Meagan, Jesse, Stormie, and Erwin enter the shadowy
	cemetery carrying lamps with shovels over their
	shoulders.  As they search through the cemetery,
	Meagan asks:

				MEAGAN
		What's the story on Jason Voorhees
		anyway?

				STORMIE
		Where have you been? Jason was that
		guy who ran around in a hockey mask,
		chopping up camp counselors, duh?

				MEAGAN
		I knew that. What I mean was why?

				ERWIN
		It started a long time ago, back in
		the fifties, when Jason drown at
		Camp Crystal Lake. His mother went
		berserk and started killing the
		counselors.

				STORMIE
		She got her head chopped off by one
		of the girls she was trying to kill!

				ERWIN
		Right. And then Jason came back from
		his watery grave to get revenge.

				JESSE
		He came back from the grave?

				ERWIN
		Yeah. Chopped up a number of people
		before they finally caught up to him.

				MEAGAN
		What happened to him then?

				ERWIN
		They killed him.

				JESSE
		How can you kill somebody who's
		back from the grave?

				ERWIN
		Not very well apparently. Jason
		keeps coming back to life and
		chopping people up. It's a never
		ending cycle of terror up here at
		Crystal Lake -- a real problem.

				MEAGAN
		Why does he keep coming back to
		life and killing people?

				ERWIN
		They say he's looking for revenge
		on the camp counselor who murdered
		him as a child. Jason just happens
		to go about it in the socially
		unacceptable way of hacking through
		every teenager he finds until he
		gets the right one.
			(spots grave)
		Here it is...

	Erwin shines his light on Jason's grave.

	ANGLE ON TOMBSTONE -- JASON VOORHEES. Born:1945.
	Died:1953.

	Beneath the death date, crudely scratched into the
	stone: 1981, 1982, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1988, etc.

	Jesse and Erwin start digging.

	ELLIPSIS -- cemetery statues watching them dig.
	Stormie and Meagan take their turn.  Then... Jesse
	hits something solid.

	Hands brush away the remaining dirt, exposing the
	coffin below.  Jesse takes a sharp breath and then
	jams a crowbar under the lid -- forcing it open.

	The casket lid cracks open a bit when -- SSSSSS! --
	noxious gas escapes.  Everyone covers their mouth
	and nose, suppressing the urge to hurl.

	Then roaches... hundreds of roaches.

	Meagan and Stormie run off, screaming, batting at
	their hair and clothing.  Jesse rolls around on
	the ground.  Erwin sighs, plucks a roach off his
	shirt, and calmly eats it.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - A SHORT TIME LATER

	Meagan and Stormie stand just outside the grave,
	holding the light and a can of bug spray.  Their
	hair is up, covered in plastic shower caps.  Duct
	tape around the cuffs of their pants.  They aren't
	taking anymore chances with bugs.

	Jesse and Erwin open the casket.  Everyone recoils
	at the stench.  Then they shine their lights inside
	-- nothing but rotting chunks and a broken hockey
	mask.

					CUT TO:

	The kids putting several plastic trash bags full of
	Jason into the trunk of Jesse's car and slamming
	the lid closed.

	Everyone piles into the car, exhausted.

	In the back, Erwin picks his nose, unaware that
	Stormie is watching him, her mouth gaping in horror.
	Erwin becomes aware of Stormie's sickened scrutiny
	and pulls out his finger, presenting it to Stormie.

				ERWIN
		Look... the boogerman!
			(laughs)
		Get it?!

	Stormie slaps his hand away.

				STORMIE
		Get back, you nasty-ass bastard!
		Ug! I thought I had seen the last
		of those when my brother graduated
		third grade!

				ERWIN
		We just dug up a rotting corpse and
		you're worried about a little snot.

	Jesse looks over at Meagan, curled up in a ball
	beside him.  She purrs:

				MEAGAN
		I'm exhausted... wake me when we
		get back home.

				ERWIN
		Uhhh... better not fall asleep --
		we've still got a lot of work to
		do and Freddy's out there... waiting.

	This news sobers everyone up immediately.

				STORMIE
		Well, that means we've all got to
		stay awake!

				JESSE
		Duh?!

				MEAGAN
		I know! We'll sing a song!
			(starts singing)
		Row! Row! Row your boat, gently down
		the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily,
		merrily... life is but a dream. Come
		on, everybody!

	Meagan leads the none-too-enthusiastic group in another
	chorus of "Row Your Boat" as Jesse's car roars off into
	the night.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. LONELY ROAD - NIGHT

	Meagan is leaning up against the door, murmuring softly
	to herself as she drifts off to sleep:

				MEAGAN
		...merrily, merrily, merrily,
		merrily... life is but a dream.

	In the back seat, Erwin is nuzzled between Stormie's
	breasts, sucking his thumb.  Both are fast asleep.

	Jesse stares at the road ahead, his own eyelids
	drooping.  The car starts to weave.

	ANGLE OUT WINDSHIELD -- we flash past Freddy holding
	a cardboard sign by the side of the road: WILL KILL
	FOR FOOD.

	Jesse shakes his head -- nah!  He tries to concentrate
	on the road, his eyelids falling once more.

	Jesse's car zooms past a billboard.  Behind the bill-
	board -- a highway patrol car, a radar gun sticking
	out of the driver's window.

	CLOSE ON RADAR GUN as Jesse's car passes in the back-
	ground, the red digits cascading up.

	Freddy, now dressed as a highway patrolman, sits behind
	the wheel.  The radar gun's display is reflected in
	his mirrored shades.  It reads: KILL THEM.

				FREDDY
		Shouldn't dream and drive.

	Freddy starts the car and pulls out, but what comes
	out from behind the billboard isn't a patrol car --
	it's Freddy's NIGHTMAREMOBILE -- big chrome pipes
	belching HELLFIRE.

	ANGLE IN JESSE'S REARVIEW MIRROR as Jesse's eyelids
	close and his head nods forward, revealing the night-
	maremobile closing from behind fast.

	The nightmaremobile runs up to the back of Jesse's
	car just an inch from the bumper.  Freddy moves one
	of the dozen of levers on the dash.

	CLOSE ON FREDDY'S HOOD ORNAMENT -- a small version
	of Freddy's glove.  It extends out towards the back
	of Jesse's car, one of the tiny knives inserting into
	the trunk lock and turning with a slight CLICK. The
	trunk lid opens.

	ANGLE INSIDE TRUNK -- the plastic bags with Jason's
	remains are moving!  Freddy works another level and
	the tiny glove slits each bag.  The various pieces
	of Jason (hands, boots, intestines, etc.) crawl out
	of the bag.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Looks like the cat's out of the
		bag now!

	Freddy laughs as the tiny hand closes the trunk.

	The nightmaremobile pulls out from behind Jesse's
	car, BANGING into the rear quarter panel. WHAM! --
	all four occupants of the car are jolted awake,
	startled.  Meagan looks out her window and sees the
	nightmaremobile as it closes in again.

				MEAGAN
		It's Freddy!

	WHAM!  SPARKS fly.  Everyone screams.  Freddy laughs
	as he falls back for another shot.  Meagan sees the
	dozens of lost souls trapped in the back of the night-
	maremobile, staring out at her through the back window.
	A small yellow sign reads:  LOST SOULS ON BOARD.

	Jesse fights to keep the car on the road when suddenly,
	the pieces of Jason ATTACK, BURSTING from behind the
	back seat.  One hand crawls up the back of the front
	seat, leaping onto Jesse's throat.  Jason's intestines
	EXPLODE out of the backseat, SLITHERING and SNAKING
	their way around Stormie and Erwin.  One of Jason's
	boots wiggles under the seat, making it's way towards
	the gas peddle.  The other boot is content to lay
	under the back window and kick Erwin in the head.

	As Meagan fights to pull Jason's hand of Jesse's face,
	she looks down and sees Jason's other hand between
	her legs.  Meagan screams.

	Jason's boot stomps on the gas and Jesse's car lurches
	forward with the acceleration. The nightmaremobile
	SLAMS into the side of Jesse's car again, causing it
	to swerve violently from side to side.

	Inside the nightmaremobile, Freddy pulls another lever.

	CLOSE ON THE NIGHTMAREMOBILE FENDER as a panel opens
	up and a circular sawblade arm extends out, CUTTING
	into Jesse's car with a flurry of SPARKS.  Inside,
	Meagan screams as the saw blade just misses her leg,
	CUTTING forward towards...

	CLOSE ON JESSE'S FRONT TIRE as the saw blade CUTS into
	it.  The tire BLOWS and Jesse's car lurches off the
	road, veering into a tree line.

	CRASH! -- Jesse's car plows fender-first into a tree,
	the HORN stuck on, BLARING.

	Freddy laughs and kicks the nightmaremobile into
	overdrive, ROARING OFF and disappearing with an
	EXPLOSION of FIRE that wisps away in an instant.

	In the distance -- an old farmhouse.  The lights go
	on inside.

	The passenger door opens and Meagan falls out onto the
	ground, bleeding from a slight scalp wound.  A rear
	door opens and Stormie and Erwin spill out, locked in
	embrace and not seriously hurt.  Meagan staggers
	around to the driver's side and opens the door.  Jesse
	is laying unconscious against the steering wheel.
	Meagan pulls him off the wheel and the HORN stops.
	Jesse is splattered with blood and his leg is a mess.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Jesse's hurt real bad... we've got
		to get him to a doctor.

	Through the farmhouse window, Erwin and Stormie see
	the farmer on the phone.

				ERWIN
		Don't worry... an ambulance is on
		the way.

	Meagan cradles Jesse's head in her hands, crying:

				MEAGAN
		Oh, God... Jesse...

	Erwin goes to the trunk and opens it.  Inside -- the
	garbage bags with Jason's remains still inside --
	untouched.  Erwin goes to Meagan and says:

				ERWIN
		Meagan... listen to me... The cops
		are on their way. If they find me
		and Jason Voorhees in the trunk
		there, we're finished.

				MEAGAN
		Go... get out of here. Take Jason
		and Stormie with you.

				STORMIE
		I'm staying with you.

	Erwin grabs the trash bags out of the trunk and says:

				ERWIN
		I'll call you at the hospital.

				STORMIE
		How?

				ERWIN
		Somehow!

	Erwin takes off, disappearing with Jason's remains
	into the night as SIRENS WAIL in the distance --
	growing close.

					CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Jesse is laying in a hospital bed, his leg in a
	special tent.  Meagan and Stormie watch from the
	doorway as a DOCTOR checks Jesse's vitals.  As he
	finishes, Meagan asks:

				MEAGAN
		Is he going to be okay?

				DOCTOR
		Yes. But he needs a lot of rest.
		His leg is broken in four places
		and he has four broken ribs and a
		concussion.

	Meagan sits down next to Jesse, taking his hand.
	Stormie turns to the doctor.

				STORMIE
		Hey doc, is there someplace I
		could get us something to eat?

				DOCTOR
		I'm afraid the cafeteria is closed.
		There are some vending machines in
		the lobby.
			(to Meagan)
		I'll be back to check on him in a
		couple of hours.

	The doctor exits.

				STORMIE
		I'll be right back... I'm goin' go
		score us some munchies.

	Meagan nods weakly.  Stormie exits.  Meagan lays her
	head on Jesse's hand.


	INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

	Stormie is getting several bags of munchies out of
	the vending machine when she turns and sees Murdoch
	at the information booth, flashing photos of Jesse
	and Erwin.

	Stormie dashes for the staircase.


	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - SAME TIME

	Jesse and Meagan have fallen asleep.  Jesse's heart
	monitor BEEPS...

	On the wall, an x-ray viewer flickers to life.  Freddy
	peeks out from behind the other side.  He snickers and
	ducks back down.

	Suddenly, Freddy's hand reaches up from inside the bed
	and grabs Jesse, pulling him down into the mattress.

	Meagan wakes and sees this, screaming as Jesse grabs
	onto the curtain.

	CLOSE ON CURTAIN ROD as the curtain pulls free of
	the rings.

	Jesse disappears into the bed, his screams echoing
	away.

	Meagan looks under the bed -- nothing.  She rises up
	again, watching as Jesse's iv and electrode wires
	are pulled down after him.  Meagan grabs a handful
	of tubes and wire and tries to pull Jesse back.  But
	the pull is too strong and Meagan goes into the
	mattress.


	INT. OLD WEST SALOON (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan falls to the floor of a dusty ol' saloon.  As
	she gets to her feet she sees Jesse's iv tubes running
	along the floor and out the door.  Meagan follows
	them to the saloon door, where she stops and looks
	out into...


	EXT. OLD WEST STREET (NIGHTMARE) - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Standing in the middle of the street is Jesse, dressed
	in a cowboy sheriff's outfit complete with hat, badge,
	and gunbelt.

	Meagan calls to him from the saloon door.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse!

	But Jesse can't hear her.  He's too busy shaking with
	fear... staring at something coming down the street.

	It's Freddy.  Dressed in a Black Bart cowboy outfit.

				FREDDY
			(ala John Wayne)
		Okay, Sheriff... This nightmare
		ain't big enough for the two of
		us... draw!

	Trembling with fear, Jesse fumbles for his pistol.
	He pulls it out and FIRES.  Freddy laughs.  Jesse
	FIRES again.  Freddy just laughs.  Jesse FIRES again
	and again and again and Freddy just laughs and laughs
	and laughs.  From the saloon, Meagan screams:

				MEAGAN
		Jesse! Wake up! Wake up!!

	Freddy looks over at her, annoyed.

				FREDDY
		Three's a crowd, bitch! Why don't
		you just go get [BEEP]


	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The SOUND of Jesse's heart monitor BEEPING erratically
	wakes Meagan with a start.  She tries to wake Jesse.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse, wake up! WAKE UP!!


	INT. OLD WEST STREET (NIGHTMARE) - SAME TIME

	Jesse keeps FIRING at Freddy... until his gun CLICKS
	empty.  Freddy smiles and pulls out the biggest Goddamn
	gun you ever saw and says:

				FREDDY
		Go ahead... make my dream!

	Freddy FIRES!

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. HOSPITAL - JESSE'S ROOM - NEXT INSTANT

	Jesse's stomach EXPLODES with BLOOD -- splattering
	Meagan.  Jesse's heart monitor BEEPS continuously --
	flat line.  Jesse is dead.

	A NURSE shows up to answer the alarm.  She sees
	Meagan standing over Jesse's body, covered in blood,
	and screams.

	Stormie enters the room a half-second later and
	gasps.

				MEAGAN
		Freddy killed Jesse...

	Stormie reaches in and grabs Meagan, pulling her out
	of the room.


	INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Stormie drags a shell-shocked Meagan down the hall,
	the screams of the nurse fading into the distance.

				STORMIE
		Jesus... get a grip, lady. You'd
		think a nurse in a hospital would
		have seen a dead body before.

				MEAGAN
		Jesse...

	Just then, Stormie spots Murdoch and his men getting
	off the elevator.  They hear the nurse's screams and
	come running towards Jesse's room.  Stormie pulls
	Meagan behind the nurse's station just as Murdoch
	and company go thundering past.

	Then a VOICE on the P.A. says:

				VOICE
			(filtered)
		Attention. Would Meagan or Stormie
		please pick up the white paging
		phone for a message?

	Stormie and Meagan exchange worrisome looks.  The
	announcement repeats itself again.  Then again.
	Stormie can't stand it anymore -- she stands up
	and picks up the white paging phone.

				STORMIE
			(into phone)
		This is Stormie...

	Murdoch and his men come running past the nurse's
	station again.  Stormie turns her back to them but
	Murdoch goes back to the nurse's station, asking:

				MURDOCH
		Did you see a couple of girls go
		by here a moment ago?

	Stormie gestures to the elevators.

				STORMIE
		Just missed 'em.

	Murdoch nods a quick thanks and takes off with his
	men right behind.  Stormie exhales a giant sigh of
	relief as the HOSPITAL OPERATOR says:

				HOSPITAL OPERATOR
			(filtered)
		The message is from Erwin... he
		says to meet him at the side
		entrance in two minutes.

	Stormie hangs up and grabs Meagan, running for the
	staircase.


	EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

	Stormie drags Meagan out of the hospital just as
	Erwin pulls up in an old battered pick-up truck.
	He throws open the door and Stormie pushes Meagan
	inside, climbing in after her and asking:

				STORMIE
		Where'd you get the truck?

				ERWIN
		Same place I've got Jason hid.

				STORMIE
		And where's that?

				ERWIN
		A place where no one ever goes.

	Stormie closes the door and the pick-up truck ROARS
	out of the parking lot.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	The pick-up truck's headlights skew across a weather-
	worn sign, peppered with bullet holes: CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Erwin drives the truck through the deserted camp,
	past the cabins, down towards the lake.  He stops a
	short distance away from the pier and the three of
	them climb out.

	Meagan is still in shock, letting Stormie guide her
	as Erwin leads them down the pier to a small diving
	platform tied up to the end.

				STORMIE
		What'd you do -- take him for a
		swim?

				ERWIN
		Almost.

	Erwin jumps down on the diving platform.  In the center,
	a large form is covered by a tarp.  Erwin helps Stormie
	down onto the platform, leaving Meagan standing on the
	pier.  She looks out over the lake -- eyes vacant.
	Erwin moves close to Stormie and, gesturing to Meagan,
	asks:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Is she going to be alright?

				STORMIE
		I don't know. She's pretty fucked
		up. God, I don't know why I'm not...

				ERWIN
		You're a strong woman.

				STORMIE
		What's that supposed to mean?

				ERWIN
		Uhhh... nothing. I didn't mean
		anything.

	Stormie gestures to the tarp.

				STORMIE
		Is this him?

				ERWIN
		Yeah...
			(whips back tarp)
		Meet the new and improved Jason.

	ANGLE ON JASON laying spread eagle on the diving
	platform, cocooned in chicken wire with dozens of
	coiled leads trailing off into the water.  Erwin has
	done a good job of sewing Jason back together with
	barbed wire and fishing line.  His arms and legs have
	been reinforced with steel braces and even Jason's
	mask has been repaired, stitched down the middle with
	bailing wire.  Jason looks nineties... and butch.

				STORMIE
		Why'd you put that stupid mask
		on him?

				ERWIN
		Take a look...

	Stormie bends down and takes a peek under the mask
	and quickly replaces it.

				STORMIE
		Good idea.

				ERWIN
		Not exactly a beauty queen entry,
		is he?

				STORMIE
		So what do we do now -- sing an Ozzy
		Osbourne song backwards or something?

				ERWIN
		I'm afraid it's not that simple...

				STORMIE
		I thought you said you knew how to
		bring him back to life?

				ERWIN
		I do! But when I was putting him
		back together, I noticed something
		was missing.

	Stormie thinks about this for a second, then:

				STORMIE
		Awwww, he won't be needing that...
		I mean, what girl would let him
		put his rotten ol'...

				ERWIN
			(cuts her off)
		No-no! Not that! It's his heart...
		it's missing.

				STORMIE
		Well... does it really matter?
		Can't you use an aquarium pump or
		something?

				ERWIN
		No... he has to have a heart. A
		human heart. A good one.

	Meagan speaks for the first time:

				MEAGAN
		I know where we can get a heart...
		A good one.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

	A sign reads: CITY MORGUE.  Through the front window
	a GUARD can be seen sitting at the reception desk.
	Erwin, Stormie, and Meagan watch him from the pick-up,
	parked a safe distance away.

				ERWIN
		That guard in there might pose a
		problem.

				MEAGAN
		Do you think you and Stormie could
		keep him occupied for a few minutes?

	Erwin and Stormie exchange looks, then shrug -- why
	not?

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Okay... let's do it.

	A few moments later, the guard looks up as the pick-
	up swerves wildly into the parking lot.  He gets up
	and goes to the glass door, peering out.

	ANGLE THROUGH GLASS DOOR as Stormie and Erwin start
	making out -- hot and heavy.


	INT. MORGUE - NIGHT

	Meagan BREAKS a small window near the ceiling. She
	crawls onto the top of the cabinet and then drops
	to the floor.  She shines her flashlight around the
	dark laboratory, illuminating anatomy charts, jars
	full of organs, etc.

	Crossing to the lockers, Meagan tentatively opens
	one of the drawers and shines her light inside --
	ug!  Wrong guy.  She opens the next drawer -- ick!
	Even worse.

	Meagan opens a third drawer -- Jesse.  Her lip starts
	to quiver as she caresses his face.


	EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

	At the glass door, the guard is watching the action
	in the parking lot, his breath fogging the window.
	He wipes the glass clean with his sleeve to get a
	better look.

	Inside the truck, Stormie and Erwin wrestle around.

				STORMIE
		Hey! Watch that!

				ERWIN
		I'm just trying to make it look real.

				STORMIE
		Just keep your hands above the bra,
		pizza face.

	The windows are starting to steam up.


	INT. MORGUE - SAME TIME

	Meagan pulls on a labcoat and puts on a pair of rubber
	gloves.  Then she opens a drawer full of shiny instru-
	ments (saws, rib cutters, etc.) and selects a large
	knife.

	Meagan stands over Jesse's body.  She pulls back the
	sheet, exposing his chest.  Meagan raises the knife
	far above her head.

				MEAGAN
		Forgive me, Jesse...

	Meagan plunges the knife into Jesse's chest with a
	sickening THWACK!


	EXT. MORGUE - PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

	The windows of the pick-up are now badly fogged,
	obscuring the guard's view.  He licks his lips,
	deciding to investigate closer.  The guard unlocks
	the front door and starts toward Stormie and Erwin.
	They spot him coming and break their embrace.  In
	another moment, the pick-up is PEELING out of the
	parking lot.  The guard watches the truck go, shakes
	his head, and goes back inside to start his rounds.

	Up the street, parked with the lights off in the night
	shade of a large tree, Stormie and Erwin watch as the
	guard starts down the glass enclosed hallway towards
	the morgue.

				STORMIE
		He's head right for her! Do some-
		thing!

	Erwin panics for a moment, then HONKS the HORN.


	INT. MORGUE - NEXT MOMENT

	Meagan is trying to pull Jesse's heart out of his
	chest but it just won't come, some vein or muscle
	fiber keeps pulling it back.  She jumps at the HORN,
	then starts pulling harder.

	In the hallway just outside, the guard hears the HORN
	and stops.  He starts back for the front, when suddenly
	the HORN stops.

	Meagan hacks at the last bits of stringy goo that cling
	to Jesse's heart.  As the last strand goes, Meagan
	tumbles backwards to the floor with a loud THUD.

	The guard hears that and turns back towards the morgue,
	drawing his gun.  He tip-toes to the door and carefully
	unlocks it, leaving his keys in the lock.  Taking a
	two-handed Weaver stance, the guard raises his foot
	and kicks the door.

	WHACK! -- the door flies open and the guard leaps
	inside like Marshall Dillon, snapping on the lights.
	He gasps, eyes going wide as he scans the room.  One
	of the drawers is open... the stiff's chest has got
	a huge hole in it... blood spattered everywhere...
	a bunch of bloody footprints leading over to the
	cabinet...

	Suddenly, the guard sees Meagan half out the window
	and cries:

				GUARD
		Stop right there!

	Meagan rolls out of the window just as the guard FIRES.
	The unbroken section of the window SHATTERS.  The guard
	curses and races for the...


	EXT. MORGUE - SECONDS LATER

	The guard comes running out just in time to see Meagan
	close the passenger door and the truck ROAR away.  He
	shrinks, dejected -- no way to catch them now.  The
	guard heads back inside to report this mess and finds
	that the door has closed and locked behind him.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. ETERNAL PEACE CEMETERY - NIGHT

	The crazy ol' coot is leading Murdoch through the
	cemetery.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		They said they were writin' for
		some newspaper...

				MURDOCH
		Teenagers are notorious liars.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Well, after I heard about the
		accident on my police scanner, I
		came up here to have a look. When
		I found it I figured you'd want to
		know right away.

				MURDOCH
		You did the right thing.

	The ol' coot shines his light down into Jason's empty
	grave.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Damn kids... I just knew they were
		comin' up here to do somethin'
		stupid.

	The S.W.A.T. commander comes up to Murdoch.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Just got a call on the radio --
		three juveniles just broke into the
		morgue -- one male, two female. The
		guard is pretty sure the male is in
		the Freddy cult -- burnt face.

				CRAZY OL' COOT
		Sounds like the same kids I saw.

				MURDOCH
		Did the guard say what they took?

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Yeah... that murdered kid, Jesse --
		they carved his heart out.
			(beat)
		They got away in a pick-up -- the
		guard didn't get the license. You
		want me to put out an A.P.B.?

				MURDOCH
		No... that won't be necessary. I
		know just where they're going, and
		just what they're up to. And this
		time... I'll be ready.

					CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	Meagan sits on the end of the pier, watching silently
	as Erwin sews Jesse's heart into Jason's chest using
	dental floss.  Stormie comes up behind her and puts
	her jacket around Meagan's shoulders, sits down beside
	her and says:

				STORMIE
		You've got to quit blaming your-
		self for what happened to Jesse...
		it wasn't your fault.

				MEAGAN
		He didn't want to come with us...
		but he did anyway. He did it for me.

				STORMIE
		I'm not sorry I came... I don't
		think Jesse would be, either.

				MEAGAN
		I just can't believe he's dead. I
		keep thinking he'll show up any
		minute...

				ERWIN
		Well, that just about does it...

	Erwin finishes sewing up Jason and climbs back onto
	the pier, cutting the diving platform free.  He kicks
	it off and it floats out into the lake, drifting free.
	Then Erwin herds the girls down the shore, leading
	them over to where a short trench has been dug leading
	from the water's edge.

	In the bottom of the trench -- an uncovered power
	cable.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		As you can see, I've excavated the
		power cable that runs across the
		bottom of Crystal Lake. I've cut
		away the insulation, exposing a
		patch of cable right near the water's
		edge.

	Erwin picks up a nearby bucket of water and sets it
	at the head of the trench.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Now when I kick this over, the water
		will wash down the trench and bridge
		an eletrical gap between the cable
		and the lake. There's plenty of
		voltage, so it should work.

				STORMIE
		So you kick the bucket and Jason
		lives.

				ERWIN
		Yeah, right...
			(then)
		Okay, keep your fingers crossed...

	Erwin kicks the bucket over.  The water washes down
	the trench, over the cable, and -- POW! Z-Z-Z-ZAP!
	A huge SPARK HITS EXPLODES.  Then the lake begins to
	glow and the water begins to churn.  Erwin and the
	girls jump back as ELECTRICITY ARCS from the lake,
	engulfing the diving platform.

	The ARCS of ELECTRICITY leap from the chicken wire
	onto Jason's body, his massive frame convulsing.

	CLOSE ON HOCKEY MASK as we PUSH IN -- the electricity
	spirals down into the eye hole like water running
	down a drain.

	CLOSE ON JASON'S EYE as it opens!  We dive into the
	eye and take a fantastic dream/time travel to...

					OPTICAL TRANSITION TO:

	EXT. VOORHEES CABIN - 1953 - DAY

	CLOSE ON MASK (1950's version of a hockey mask)
	reflected in the water.  A young hand reaches up and
	pulls off the mask, revealing the disfigured boy
	beneath.  This is JASON -- AGE 9.

	JASON'S FATHER comes to the doorway of their run-
	down cabin in dirty longjohns, holding a bottle of
	rye. He bellows:

				JASON'S FATHER
		Jason! Git your ass over here!

	Jason jumps at his father's voice, hesitates only
	slightly, then runs toward him, stopping abruptly
	several paces away.

				JASON'S FATHER
			(continuing)
		What did I teach you, boy? Don't
		ever take your mask off out in
		public. I don't want nobody to see
		that ugly mug of yours.

	Jason stands, looking at his bare feet. His father
	smacks him upside the head, shoving him towards the
	woodshed.

				JASON'S FATHER
			(continuing)
		Go git in the woodshed.

	Jason's pace slows as he enters the dark shed -- he
	knows what's coming next.

				JASON'S FATHER
			(continuing)
		Drop them overalls and lay over
		them logs...

	Jason slowly complies as his father loosens his belt.
	Suddenly, JASON'S MOTHER is just outside the doorway,
	calling:

				JASON'S MOTHER
		Jason! Come here!

	Jason gives his father a sideways glance, then scurries
	towards his mother.

				JASON'S FATHER
		What are you doing woman?

	Jason's mother gives him a mason jar stuffed with
	dollars and change.

				JASON'S MOTHER
		I saved up some money... I want
		you to take and go on up to that
		summer camp just up the road. Tell
		the man you want to stay there.

				JASON'S FATHER
		Just what the hell do you think
		you're doing, bitch?!

				JASON'S MOTHER
		I'm sending him away for a few weeks.

				JASON'S FATHER
		You ain't sending him nowhere.
			(to Jason)
		Bring me that money, boy!

	Jason holds his ground for a second, unsure whom to
	obey, when his mother shoos him away.

				JASON'S MOTHER
		Go on now... go!

	Jason takes off up the road.  His father sneers:

				JASON'S FATHER
		Goin' ag'in me? I'll take you to
		the shed, woman!

	Jason's mother pulls a knife from her apron.

				JASON'S MOTHER
		You ain't ever taking anyone to
		the shed ever again.

	Jason's mother charges at her husband, shoving him
	back into the shed with the knife.  Jason looks back.
	Through the open window he sees his mother's arm
	coming down repeatedly with the knife, his father's
	arms flailing helplessly.  Then both disappear from
	view.  After a moment his mother appears in the door-
	way, spattered with blood.  She smiles and waves to
	him, calling:

				JASON'S MOTHER
			(continuing)
		Go on, son... have a good time!
		Mommy will come and git you some
		day soon!

	Jason turns and runs to...


	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - 1953 - DAY

	Wearing his mask, Jason walks through the entrance
	to the camp with his jar of money.

	In the office, the HEAD COUNSELOR takes his money
	and shakes his hand.

				HEAD COUNSELOR
		Welcome aboard, son! I'm sure
		you'll have a great time!

					CUT TO:

	The other KIDS dance around Jason, taunting him...
	laughing at him... pointing and teasing... Jason
	breaks away, running towards the pier.

	Jason sits at the end of the pier, looking at his own
	reflection.  He removes the mask and watches as the
	distortions in the water make his face look normal.

	Someone comes up behind Jason slowly.  Jason isn't
	aware of their presence until a shadowy reflection
	appears behind his own.  Jason turns to see who when
	he is suddenly pushed into the lake.

	Jason splashes to the surface, sputtering, trying to
	stay afloat.  A hand pushes his head back under the
	water.

	JASON'S UNDERWATER P.O.V. -- a distorted image of
	whoever is holding him under.

	Jason thrusts out his arms, fighting to get back to
	the surface... fighting just to see who is killing
	him before he dies.

					HARD CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT

	Jason comes alive, thrashing around on the diving dock,
	the electricity all over him like a spider web. On
	shore, Erwin and the girls gasp.

				ERWIN
		Holy shit! It worked!

	Meagan and Stormie bounce, excitedly.  But something
	is wrong.  Jason thrashes around on the dock, unable
	to break the crisscross of high voltage chicken wire.

				MEAGAN
		It's kill him! Shut it off! Shut
		it off!

				ERWIN
		Shut it off... it suddenly occurs
		to me that I hadn't really planned
		for that contingency.

				STORMIE
		Just don't stand there! Do something!

	But all Erwin can do is scratch his head.  Meagan
	rushes to the shore line and screams out over the lake:

				MEAGAN
		Jason! JASON! You've got to get up!
		Do you hear me? Get up!

	Jason clenches his meaty fists and SLAMS them down
	against the diving dock. SMASHING it to bits.  Water
	rushes over him and -- ZZZZT! KA-POW!

	A power transformer on shore EXPLODES, causing Meagan
	and her friends to cringe.  When they look back, the
	electrical light show fades away, leaving nothing but
	smoke and floating debris.  Meagan and Stormie turn to
	Erwin, who shrugs shyly and says:

				ERWIN
		Well... it's off now.

	Meagan and Stormie begin a verbal barrage that would
	shrink any man to pus... much less Erwin.  He cowers
	between them, offering quick excuses and humble
	apologies.

	All three are so wrapped up in laying blame that they
	never notice Jason's shadowy figure as it rises from
	the lake.

	Then they do see him... scream and run.  Jason charges
	after the kids in his familiar "unstoppable killer"
	gait.

	Erwin ducks inside the tool shed as Meagan and Stormie
	dash past.  He closes the door behind him and squirms
	out a tiny window just as Jason kicks open the door
	and steps inside.  Erwin races around to the front
	and closes the door.  He fastens the latch and padlock,
	then calls to the girls:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Hey! Come back! I've got him locked
		up in the tool shed!

	Just then, the SOUND of a CHAINSAW as the blade RIPS
	through the tool shed door.  Erwin screams like a
	girl and runs away.


	INT. MAIN CABIN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan and Stormie run into the main room.  Stormie
	spots a phone and goes to it, dialing frantically.

				MEAGAN
		Who are you calling?!

				STORMIE
		The cops! Who else?!

				MEAGAN
		Are you kidding?! They'll lock us
		up and throw away the key!

				STORMIE
		Fine by me!
			(clicks the receiver)
		Damnit! It's dead!

	Just then, Erwin bursts into the cabin, slamming
	the door shut behind him.

				ERWIN
		He's right behind me!

	Stormie and Meagan look out the window -- sure enough,
	Jason is storming towards them, holding the chainsaw.

				STORMIE
			(to Erwin)
		You're the one who brought him
		back to life!

				ERWIN
		And?!

				STORMIE
		Well, do something!

	Erwin screams and runs for the closet, hiding inside.
	Stormie clucks:

				STORMIE
			(continuing)
		Oh, some hero!

	Just then, the chainsaw RIPS through the front door.
	Meagan and Stormie scream and follow Erwin into the
	closet, closing themselves inside.

	They cower in the closet, listening... for a long
	moment... nothing but the sound of their heavy
	breathing.

	Then, with the RIPPING of WOOD, Jason chainsaws the
	closet door -- knocking it to the floor.  Erwin draws
	out his pin and starts stabbing himself in the finger.

	Jason charges forward, when Meagan suddenly stands
	up in front of him and yells:

				MEAGAN
		STOP!

	To everyone's shock... Jason does.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Now... just stop! We're the ones
		that brought you back to life.
		And you have no right to kill us
		with that chainsaw! In fact... you
		owe us...

				STORMIE
		That's right! She gave you her
		boyfriend's heart, you know!

				MEAGAN
		That's right.

	Jason cocks his massive head like a perplexed pup.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Look! Here's his picture...

	Meagan takes off the necklace that Jesse gave her and
	opens the locket.  She shows Jason the photo of Jesse
	inside.  Jason drops the chainsaw and takes the locket
	in his humongous hands, gently touching the photo of
	Jesse with a meaty finger.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Now, I know that you've been through
		a lot. And I know that you're pissed
		off about being murdered and all.

				STORMIE
			(interjects)
		I know I would be!

				MEAGAN
		But if you help us kill Freddy
		Krueger... I promise to help you
		find the little bastard that
		killed you. What do you say? Have
		we got a deal?

	Meagan sticks out her hand to shake.  Jason stares at
	it, looks back at the locket, then to Meagan. Finally,
	he reaches out his huge hand for Meagan's when...

	Brilliant, blinding white light blazes through the
	windows, freezing everyone to the spot.  Anxious to
	get out of the closet with Jason, Erwin crawls across
	the floor and peeks out over the window sill.

	ANGLE OUT WINDOW -- a dozen police cars shine their
	lights towards the cabin, two dozen COPS aim their
	weapons.  In the middle of this impressive show of
	force is Murdoch.  He raises a bullhorn to his lips.

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		You in there! This is Captain Renton
		Murdoch -- State Trooper! I am
		ordering you to come out with your
		hands up! I'll give you until the
		count of three...
			(beat)
		Three!

	Meagan turns to Jason, shoving him back into the
	closet.

				MEAGAN
			(whispering)
		Jason, you have to hide! Stay in
		here and don't come out until we
		tell you. Stormie... help me!

	Stormie helps Meagan stuff Jason into the closet,
	closing the door.  Then they quickly smooth down
	their hair and clothes, moving towards the door.


	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - NEXT SECOND

	Meagan, Stormie, and Erwin come out with their hands
	raised high above their heads.  As they walk towards
	the police cars, several of the S.W.A.T. team moves
	in and arrests them.  As they are handcuffed and
	searched, Murdoch goes on the bullhorn again:

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		Alright... anybody else left in
		there had better say their prayers!

				ERWIN
		There's no one else inside.

				MURDOCH
		Is that a fact?
			(into bullhorn)
		Okay... you had your chance!

	Suddenly, one of the cops points towards the cabin
	and shouts:

				COP
		Hey, look!

	All heads turn towards the cabin, where Jason's
	massive frame is filling the doorway.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Holy Mary, mother of God... would
		you look at the size of that guy?

				MURDOCH
			(almost happy)
		I knew it!

	All the cops level their weapons at Jason when Murdoch
	suddenly steps forward, gesturing for everyone to get
	behind him.

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		Stand back! I'll handle this.

	Murdoch takes a few steps towards the cabin and sneers:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		You...

	Jason raises the chainsaw -- he remembers Murdoch too.
	Murdoch goes for his gun, but instead of bringing out
	a pistol, he holds a laser designator.  Murdoch fires.

	A big red dot appears on Jason's chest.  Jason looks
	down at it like it was a harmless bug.  He looks back
	up at Murdoch, who raises a radio to his lips and says:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing;
				 into radio)
		Let her go.


	EXT. 60,000 FEET ABOVE CRYSTAL LAKE - NEXT SECOND

	A military jet flying above drops it's payload -- a
	laser-guided napalm bomb.


	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - SAME TIME

	A slight WHISTLE sound grows in the skies above Camp
	Crystal Lake.  Jason looks up.

	SMART BOMB P.O.V. as it drops down on Jason -- homing
	in on the laser dot on his chest.

	BA-BOOM! -- Camp Crystal Lake EXPLODES in flames.
	All the cops take cover as FIRE RAINS DOWN on them.
	Only Murdoch stands his ground, his arms outstretched
	as he embraces the terrible sight.

				MURDOCH
		That'll teach you to fuck with the
		law, Voorhees!

	A cop behind him says:

				COP
		Uhh, sir... your hat's on fire.

	Murdoch looks up -- sure enough, his Smokey Bear hat
	is burning above the brim.

	Meagan watches as Camp Crystal Lake is consume in
	flames, her last hope of saving Lizzy -- gone.  Then
	a cop shoves her into a police car with Stormie.
	Erwin is put into another car and the three exchange
	worrisome looks through the windows just before the
	cars pull away.

	As the cops start to pull out, one of them notices
	something moving amidst the flames -- a large BURNING
	form, walking towards the lake.  As it stumbles out
	onto the pier, the cop turns to his partner and says:

				CURIOUS COP
		Hey... do you see that?

	But just then, the form falls through the BURNING
	pier, SPLASHING into the water below.  The partner
	looks, sees nothing, and shrugs.

				PARTNER
		See what?

				CURIOUS COP
		I thought I saw something...

	He shrugs it off and exits after his partner.

	Murdoch, his hat still smoking a little, surveys the
	sight one last time before climbing into his patrol
	car and driving away.

					CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - NIGHT

	A cell door SLAMS in front of Stormie's face. A cell
	door SLAMS in front of Meagan's face.  Both girls are
	behind bars, separated by a cement wall.  The hefty
	female DEPUTY in charge of the cellblock goes back to
	her desk.

	Both girls stand in their cells next to eachother,
	watching as the deputy goes back to her desk and
	begins to devour three combo-burritos.

				MEAGAN
		We've got to try and stay awake.

				STORMIE
		Getting something to eat might help.
			(calls to Deputy)
		Yo, Butch!

				DEPUTY MILLER
		It's Deputy Miller.

				STORMIE
		Excuse me, Deputy Miller but could
		we have something to eat?

				DEPUTY MILLER
		I thought you psychos only ate
		human hearts?

				STORMIE
		And I thought you pigs only ate
		donuts.

				DEPUTY MILLER
		Don't make me come back there.

				STORMIE
			(low; to Meagan)
		Cow! I hope she chokes on her three
		combo-burrito cud!

	Meagan leans up against the wall, sliding down to
	the floor in defeat.

				MEAGAN
		What am I going to do? I'll never
		be able to find Lizzy now.

				STORMIE
		You should be worrying about your-
		self... I know I am.

	Stormie plops down on her cot.

				MEAGAN
		I bet you're sorry you came with
		me now...

				STORMIE
		Nah... what are best friends for?
		Afterall, you stuck by me through
		all my crazy phases, I figure I
		owe you one big crazy phase, right?

				MEAGAN
		That's for being my best friend,
		Stormie.

	Just then, Deputy Miller steps in front of Meagan's
	cell, unlocking it.

				DEPUTY MILLER
		Come on, Meagan.

				MEAGAN
		Where are we going?

				DEPUTY MILLER
		Your parents are here.

					CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

	Deputy Miller brings Meagan out of the cellblock,
	where her mom and dad are waiting with Captain Murdoch.
	Meagan's mom rushes up and hugs Meagan.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Oh, Meagan... are you alright?
		Let me look at you...

				MEAGAN
		I'm okay, mom.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Your mother's been worried sick,
		Meagan. So have I.

	Meagan stands handcuffed, her hair mussed, her clothes
	bloody and soiled.

				MEAGAN
		Sorry. Today has been a bitch.


	INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	The deputy is so busy munching down on her burritos
	that she doesn't notice the strange shadow that
	passes behind her.

	The shadow moves down the cellblock, accompanied by
	a slight SCRAPING.  Freddy's glove materializes,
	raking the knives along the metal cross bars.  Freddy
	stops at Stormie's cell, looking inside.

	Stormie is fast asleep.

	Freddy walks into Stormie's cell, passing right through
	the bars.  Suddenly, Stormie wakes and, seeing Freddy,
	jumps to her feet and screams.

				STORMIE
		Help! Help! Freddy's here! He's here!

	But the deputy at the end of the cellblock doesn't
	respond, finishing off the rest of the burrito and
	licking her meaty fingers clean.  Freddy puts his
	forefinger knife to his lips and shushes Stormie,
	pointing to her cot.  Stormie looks over and sees her-
	self asleep.

				STORMIE
			(continuing)
		Oh, shit! I'm still asleep!

	She looks up at Freddy, who smiles and says:

				FREDDY
		You know what they say... when you
		sleep -- you die!

	Freddy flashes the glove of knives.


	INT. POLICE STATION - NEXT MOMENT


				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Meagan, Captain Murdoch here said
		you helped one of those cultists
		escape from a hospital?

				MEAGAN
		A mental hospital.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		And he said you desecrated a cemetery
		and some other really terrible things.
		Tell me you had nothing to do with
		it. Tell me there's some mistake...?

				MEAGAN
		There's no mistake.
			(to Murdoch)
		What did you do with Erwin?

				MURDOCH
		Your boyfriend is headed back to the
		looney bin where he belongs. But
		don't worry, you'll be seeing him
		soon enough... at the arraignment.


	INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	Freddy taunts Stormie as the circle around in the cell
	by slicing off his fingers, squirting green slime.
	Stormie winces a little but keeps her distance and cool.

				STORMIE
		You don't scare me, Freddy! Thanks
		to my various phases and many hours
		of watching violent televison, I
		have become immune to violence. Seen
		it all and done it all! Nothing you
		do can gross me out -- so why don't
		you give it your best shot, bitch!

				FREDDY
		Then maybe I'll just CUT to the chase!

	Freddy swings the glove but Stormie ducks, keeping her
	defensive stance.

				STORMIE
		I'm warning you, Freddy... my father
		is a drill sergeant in the Marine
		Corps and he taught me just how to
		defend myself against slimy bastards
		like you.

				FREDDY
		Oh I'm so scared, honey. Come on!
		Hit me! Punch me right in the nose!
		I dare you!

	Freddy juts out his chin, gesturing for Stormie to
	take a punch.  Stormie throws a right and pops Freddy
	right in the nose.

				FREDDY
			(continuing;
				 surprised)
		Owwwww!

	Stormie smiles but that soon fades as she realizes her
	fist is stuck in Freddy's nose.  Freddy takes in a
	breath and Stormie's arm is sucked up past the elbow.
	She screams.

	Freddy takes a deep breath and snorts Stormie right
	up his nose, her screams turning into a faint BUZZ.
	Freddy smiles.

				FREDDY
			(continuing)
		Now that's what I call getting a
		buzz.


	INT. FREDDY'S NOSTRIL CAVERN - NEXT SECOND

	Now the size of a flea, Stormie is clinging to one
	of hundreds of pointed tree trunks jutting out from
	the circular walls -- Freddy's nose hairs.  Stuck in
	those humongous hairs are clumps of icky gunk --
	boogers.

	Sitting next to Stormie, a particularly large and
	rotund booger clump opens its eyes and says (in the
	distorted voice of Harry Manfredini):

				BOOGERMAN
		Hi there! I'm the Boogerman! Heh-
		heh... get it?

	Stormie screams, backing up into the "trees", trying
	to put distance between herself and Boogerman.

				BOOGERMAN
			(continuing)
		Aww, don't go... we can play "Star
		Wars". You can be Princess Leia and
		I'll be Jabba the Hutt!

	Boogerman licks his fat, nasty lips with a slimy green
	tongue -- he does kinda look like Jabba.  Stormie
	screams again.


	INT. POLICE STATION - SAME TIME

	Meagan is getting more and more agitated.

				MEAGAN
		We're wasting time! We've got to
		close down all the churches --
		Freddy has to marry Lizzy on holy
		ground!

	Meagan's parents stare at their daughter with confused,
	frightened looks.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Don't you understand?! He has to
		come to our reality to do it! It's
		our last chance to kill him!

				MURDOCH
		Okay, I think we've heard enough of
		this crap. Take her back to the
		lockup.

	A couple of DEPUTIES grab Meagan.  She throws them off
	and they grab her again, roughly.  Meagan's parents
	watch in pain and horror as the deputies drag their
	daughter back to her cell, kicking and screaming.

				MEAGAN
		Dad! Mom! Don't let them lock me up!
		I have to save Lizzy!

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Oh, Meagan... you're sick. You don't
		even realize what you've done.

				MEAGAN
		I did what I had to do to try and
		save Lizzy!

				MURDOCH
		Yeah, including murdering your boy-
		friend and cutting his heart out.

				MEAGAN
		Liar! Freddy killed Jesse! He was
		already dead when I cut his heart
		out!

	Meagan's mom and dad gasp, recoiling with horror.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing; manic)
		Goddamnit, you don't understand!
		Freddy lives! FREDDY LIVES!!!

	Meagan's raving grows faint as she disappears into
	the cellblock.  Murdoch pulls Meagan's dad aside.

				MURDOCH
		I know how you must feel... I had
		a dog once. I loved that dog. I
		treated her like my own daughter.
		We went camping, picnics in the
		park... I even had a little stocking
		for her nailed up on the mantle for
		Christmas. Then one day, she bit
		me... so I had to blow her brains
		out.
			(sighs)
		God, I loved that dog.


	INT. STORMIE'S CELL & NOSTRIL CAVERN - SAME TIME

	Freddy starts to dig in his nose with his forefinger
	knife.

	A giant knife blade comes charging up the nostril
	cavern, sending Stormie into hysterics.

				BOOGERMAN
		Uh-oh, Freddy's picking his nose
		again -- gotta go!

	Boogerman starts lumbering up into the back of the
	nostril cavern.  Stormie watches the massive knife
	blade as it comes right for her, then at the last
	possible second she starts climbing after Boogerman.
	She pushes past the disgusting blob of goo, racing
	ahead.

				BOOGERMAN
			(continuing)
		Well, excuse me!

	INSERT -- Freddy pushes the knife way far back into
	his head.

	The giant knife spears Boogerman in the back, running
	him through and spilling his "Boogerman" guts out his
	front.  Stormie gives a little squeal as Boogerman is
	pulled out, kicking and screaming.

	Freddy withdraws the knife from his nose, peering
	closely at the tiny Boogerman impaled on the end. He
	twists his mouth in utter disdain and flicks Booger-
	man across the cell.

	Boogerman screams as he flies across vast space, smack-
	ing into the far wall with a giant SPLAT! Boogerman
	flattens outwards into a thin pancake of Boogerman goo,
	his nasty head still alive in the center.

	Freddy reaches through the bars of the cell, his arm
	extending out in a grotesque fashion all the way to
	the deputy's desk.  He feels around on the table until
	he touches the pepper shaker, drawing it back into
	Stormie's cell.

	Freddy sprinkles a small amount of pepper into his
	right palm and breathes it in deeply -- the specks
	of pepper becoming rocks that pelt Stormie as she
	clings to life deep inside the nostril.

	Freddy's face begins to distort, his nose wrinkling
	up -- the beginnings of a sneeze.

				FREDDY
		Ahhh... ahhh... ahhh--CHOO!

	Micro-Stormie comes blasting out of Freddy's nose
	with globules of snot.  She flies across the massive
	cell, headed directly for the splattered Boogerman,
	screaming her head off.

	Boogerman sees Stormie racing towards him and he
	screams too.

					HARD CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - NEXT INSTANT

	As the deputy brings Meagan back to her cell they
	hear a loud SPLAT!

				MEAGAN
		Stormie?!

	The deputy pushes Meagan back as she moves forward
	cautiously, glancing around the wall into Stormie's
	cell... then promptly puking combo burrito.  Meagan
	runs up and looks.  The wall to Stormie's cell is
	splattered with blood and bits.

	Meagan falls to her knees, sobbing as more DEPUTIES
	come running into the cellblock, answering the
	deputy's puke-choked scream.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Oh, God... what have I done? What
		have I done?!

	We BOOM OUT of this chaos and go to...


	EXT. LONELY ROAD - NIGHT

	An ambulance races along the road with it's emergency
	lights flashing.  In back Erwin lays strapped to a
	gurney.  Up front sit a DRIVER and an ATTENDANT.  They
	chat disparagingly about the freak in the back, when
	suddenly a large form appears in the road just ahead.
	The driver slams on the brakes and the wheels lock up
	with a terrible SQUEAL.

	WHUMP! -- the ambulance plows into the form, knocking
	it some fifty feet down the road.  The driver and the
	attendant stare out of the cracked windshield in shock.
	Finally, the driver turns to the attendant and says:

				AMBULANCE DRIVER
		I'll go check it out. You stay here.

	The driver gets out and goes to the form laying in the
	road.  He bends down to examine the charred, mammoth
	carcass when a fist flies up, smacking the driver in
	the face.  He falls to the ground, unconscious.

	The corpse sits up in the glare from the headlights --
	it's Jason!  Burnt and blackened but ready for action!
	He starts towards the ambulance.

	The attendant gets out and pulls his service revolver,
	emptying into Jason's chest.  Jason recoils only
	slightly as BULLET HITS BURST his coveralls, then he
	grabs the attendant by the head as he snaps the empty
	pistol in panic.  Jason slams the attendant's face
	into the side of the ambulance.

	In the back of the ambulance, a terror-stricken Erwin
	watches as a face shaped dent appears in the wall with
	a sickening WRENCHING of METAL and FLESH.  Then...
	silence.

	RIP! -- Jason pulls off the back door of the ambulance
	and climbs inside, the shocks bottoming out under his
	weight.  He reaches out for Erwin, who closes his
	eyes... waiting for the inevitable.

	Then... nothing.

	After a second, Erwin opens an eye.  Jason is standing
	over him, hand outstretched.  In his big, burnt palm
	-- Meagan's necklace.  Erwin looks from the necklace
	to Jason.  Jason thrusts out his hand impatiently.

				ERWIN
		You... want me to tell you where
		Meagan is?

	Again with the thrusting.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Well why didn't you say so?! Jesus,
		for a minute there I thought you
		were going to kill me.
			(then)
		You're not, are you?

	Jason shakes his palm at Erwin yet a third time.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Okay... okay! I'll take you right
		to her. Could you help me out of
		this?

	Jason reaches over and yanks out the gurney straps.

	Erwin exits out the back with Jason following close
	behind.  Erwin climbs in behind the wheel, saying:

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		I'll drive.

	Jason pushes Erwin aside so roughly that he slams into
	the passenger side door.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Okay... you drive.

	As Jason climbs into the driver's seat, a CHIME goes
	off as a female COMPUTER VOICE in a pleasant tone says:

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Fasten your safety belt, please.

	Erwin fastens his.  Jason watches him and pulls the
	safety belt across his massive chest -- it won't reach.
	Jason pulls harder, ripping the belt out of the bolts.
	The CHIME goes crazy.

				COMPUTER VOICE
			(continuing)
		Fasten your safety belt, please...
		Fasten your safety belt, please...

	Jason SMASHES the dashboard with his fist, silencing
	the voice and chime.  He turns suddenly to Erwin as if
	to say, "Yeah?! What about it?"  Erwin shrugs nervously:

				ERWIN
		Fuck the bitch. Let's roll!

	With tires SQUEALING, burning rubber and smoke, the
	ambulance roars away into the early morning.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - DAWN

	Meagan stares through the bars of her cell at the sun
	as it peeks out over the horizon.  The deputy gets up
	to leave for the six a.m. shift change.  As she goes,
	she switches on the cellblock TV.

	ANGLE ON TV -- An early morning religious program
	is on.

				RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER
			(filtered)
		This is Channel 12 -- Station W.G.O.D.
		-- where the "W" stands for "Worship"
		And now... "Daily Affirmation" with
		Reverend Lawrence Lovejoy...

	A shot of the REVEREND LOVEJOY at the podium in his
	studio, giving kind words of encouragement.

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		Good morning, friends... the Good
		Book says that each morning brings
		a new light into our lives...

	The good reverend goes on about it always being darkest
	before the dawn, have faith and your prayers will be
	answered, etc.  Meagan turns and watches the sunrise
	-- glorious.  Tears stream down her cheeks.  Then a
	commercial comes on:

				RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER
			(filtered)
		You can own a videotape of Reverend
		Lovejoy's Daily Affirmation for only
		$19.95...

					  CUT TO:

	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - MORNING

	In his booth at the main gate, the GATE GUARD watches
	as a procession of hearses approaches.  As the first
	hearse reaches the gate, the guard steps out and says:

				GATE GUARD
		Hello. What can I do for you?

	A cultist sticks his head out the window and says:

				CULTIST
		We're here to see the Reverend
		Lovejoy. We need him to perform a
		wedding.

				GATE GUARD
		Do you have an appointment?

				CULTIST
		No. I have a Beretta.

	The cultist produces a pistol -- BANG!


	INT. STUDIO - MOMENTS LATER

	The REVEREND LOVEJOY is at his podium, his WIFE at the
	organ, waiting for the commercial break to be over.
	The FLOOR MANAGER counts down -- three... two... one...

	BAM! -- the cultists burst into the studio.  The CAMERA
	OPERATOR and FLOOR MANAGER are killed.  The Reverend
	Lovejoy and his WIFE, at the organ, are taken hostage.


	INT. POLICE STATION - CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	ANGLE ON TV as the cultists take the reverend and his
	wife hostage.  Meagan watches, suddenly perplexed.


	INT. STUDIO - NEXT SECOND

	The cultists break into the control room, killing the
	DIRECTOR and STAFF.  One slips into the sound booth,
	garroting the RELIGIOUS ANNOUNCER with a piece of wire.
	Another SMASHES the control board, killing the signal.
	All the feed monitors go snowy.


	INT. CELLBLOCK - SAME TIME

	ANGLE ON TV as the picture goes to static.  Just then,
	the deputy appears in front of Meagan's cell.

				MEAGAN
		Something just happened at the TV
		station.

				DEPUTY
		Don't worry about it -- get undressed.

				MEAGAN
		What for?

				DEPUTY
		Time to get you cleaned up for court.

	Meagan looks back at the TV as she slowly starts to
	get undressed.


	INT. POLICE STATION - SHOWERS - MOMENTS LATER

	The deputy ushers Meagan into the showers.  Inside,
	a naked group of mean, nasty, ugly JAIL HOUSE BITCHES
	are showering, washing hairy pits, flabby tattooed
	skin, and greasy hair.  They eye Meagan like the
	dessert bar at Denny's as she crosses to the opposite
	side, sneaking into a corner.  Meagan turns on the
	shower and drops the towel -- the bitches whistle and
	catcall.

	Just then, the deputy gets called away, leaving Meagan
	to the mercy of the bitches.  The head bitch slides
	over to Meagan and says:

				HEAD BITCH
		What's the matter, honey... you
		don't like our company?

				MEAGAN
		I like you... sure. It's just that
		I usually shower alone, that's all.

				HEAD BITCH
		Oh! So you're shy? I like 'em when
		they're shy...

	The head bitch grabs at Meagan, who resists.  But this
	bitch is big and tough and holds Meagan by the wrists
	as she tries to kiss her.  The other bitches laugh.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		Don't fight it, baby! You know you
		want me...

	Meagan scratches the head bitch's face.  She backs
	off screaming, wiping blood from her face.  Then she
	spits, reaches down (below the frame line) and
	produces a shiv.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		If you won't give me a piece then
		I'll just cut one for myself...

	The head bitch moves in.  Meagan takes a cautious
	step back, bumping into tile -- nowhere to go.  She
	holds up her hands.

				MEAGAN
		Wait a second... I didn't mean to
		do that... I'm sorry. It's just that
		you come on a little strong, that's
		all. Just give me a little time to
		adjust to my new surroundings...

	The head bitch stops, curious.

				HEAD BITCH
		Are you saying you want me now?

				MEAGAN
		Yes... I want you.

				HEAD BITCH
		Prove it.

	Meagan comes up to the woman, raising her arms.  In a
	flash, the head bitch has the shiv to Meagan's jugular
	-- a warning.  Meagan carefully puts her arm around
	the bitch and kisses her full on the mouth.  After a
	long, uncomfortable moment, they break.  The head
	bitch smiles.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		Now that's more like it!
			(to the others)
		Hey, this bitch is alright!

	The other bitches smile as the head bitch slips her
	arm around Meagan's waist and pulls her tight.

				HEAD BITCH
			(continuing)
		You're okay, honey... what's your
		name?

				MEAGAN
		Meagan.

				HEAD BITCH
		So... what're you in for, Meagan?

				MEAGAN
			(sniffles a little)
		Oh, my friend...

				HEAD BITCH
		The bitch that died last night?

				MEAGAN
			(starts to cry)
		Yeah... they said she had some
		disease that made her... explode!
		Oh, God! Please hold me!

	The head bitch holds Meagan tight as she sobs,
	smoothing her hair.  The other bitches share a look
	of concern as one asks:

				BITCH #1
		What's this bullshit about some
		killer funk make you explode?

				HEAD BITCH
			(to Meagan)
		Easy... honey. It's goin' be
		alright. But what I asked you is
		why you're in here?

				MEAGAN
		Oh... well... the cops? Well, they
		think I gave it to her...

	The head bitch suddenly springs back as if Meagan
	were Satan himself.  She runs for the other bitches
	but they aren't having anything to do with her.  All
	the bitches race for the exit.

	The deputy comes to the shower room doorway and
	shouts:

				DEPUTY
		What the hell is all the screaming
		about?!

	WHAM! -- the bitches run her over, stripping the keys
	from her belt.  They unlock the cellblock door and go
	running into the police station, screaming butt-naked.
	After the bitches exit, Meagan's hand reaches out and
	drags the unconscious deputy into the shower.


	INT. POLICE STATION - NEXT SECOND

	The bitches come running butt-naked and screaming
	through the station.  Several deputies chase after
	them, tackle them and try to cuff them.  A brawl
	ensues.  Chaos.

	Murdoch sits on a desk, reading a report.  He looks
	up at the madness and mutters:

				MURDOCH
		Punks...


	INT. POLICE STATION - SHOWERS - MOMENTS LATER

	A DEPUTY enters the showers and sees a naked woman
	on top of a deputy, their arms locked in a struggle.
	The deputy cracks the naked woman in the back of the
	head with her baton and she falls to the side,
	revealing Meagan -- now dressed in the deputy's
	uniform -- laying on the shower floor.

	The deputy realizes her mistake too late -- Meagan
	sprays her in the face with mace and she sinks to
	her knees, screaming and clutching her face.  Meagan
	leaps to her feet, grabs a towel to hold over her
	face (as if she had a broken nose) and starts to exit.

	On her way out, Meagan is passed by several DEPUTIES
	charging into the showers to restore order.  She
	gestures them on, then slips into an emergency exit
	to freedom.


	EXT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Meagan exits the station just as a patrol car pulls
	up.  She reaches in and grabs the JUNIOR TROOPER,
	pulling him out.  Then she slips behind the wheel
	and ROARS off.  The junior trooper calls after her:

				JUNIOR TROOPER
		Hey, that's Captain Murdoch's car!

					 CUT TO:

	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	The cultists surround Reverend Lovejoy as he nervously
	shakes his head, saying:

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		I won't do it! It's a sin!
		Blasphemy!

	One of the cultists puts a gun to Mrs. Lovejoy's head.

				CULTIST
		Wedding or funeral... your choice.

	The reverend swallows and says:

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		And who would be the bride?

	Lizzy is brought forth.  The cultists take her arm
	and inject her with the dream dope.  Lizzy's head
	lulls around as she chants softly:

				LIZZY
		One... two... Freddy's coming for
		you.

	The rest of the cultists shoot up -- passing the
	needle from one to another.

				LIZZY
			(continuing)
		Three... four... Better lock your
		door.

	The good reverend watches this with a lump in his
	throat.  He shudders and asks:

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		And the groom.

				CULTIST
		He's coming...

	Lizzy is almost asleep.

				LIZZY
		Five... six... grab your crucifix...

	The neon cross behind the podium begins to flicker.
	Then with a sharp SNAP of electricity, the cross
	falls over, turning upside down.  It hangs there for
	an instant then -- POW! -- the cross EXPLODES, catching
	the curtains on FIRE.

	As the FLAMES consume the curtains, a hole in reality
	appears -- a Dreamgate.  Freddy comes springing out,
	leaping in front of the podium.  He laughs and turns
	to Lizzy, asleep on the bench.

				FREDDY
		That's for the lift sister!
			(to the cultists)
		Hiya, kids!

				CULTISTS
			(in unison)
		Hiya, Freddy!

				FREDDY
		Ready to get hitched?

				CULTISTS
		Ready, Freddy!

				FREDDY
		Then let's do it!

	Lizzy looks up and smiles.

				LIZZY
		I love you, Freddy...

					  CUT TO:

	INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON

	A DEPUTY comes up to Murdoch and says:

				DEPUTY
		We found your patrol car, Captain.
		It was abandoned near a local
		religious station.

				MURDOCH
		Religious station? Is there a
		padre there?

				DEPUTY
		Yes, sir. Reverend Lovejoy broad-
		casts out of that location.

				MURDOCH
		So that's where they're hiding.

					  CUT TO:

	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Lizzy and Freddy stand before Reverend Lovejoy.

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		...and if there be anyone among you
		who has any reason why these two
		should not be joined in holy...

	Freddy holds up a finger -- "Ah-ah".

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
			(continuing)
		...in matrimony. Let them speak
		now...
			(under his breath)
		...please God...
			(aloud)
		...or forever hold their peace.

	WHAM! -- Meagan bursts in.

				MEAGAN
		Stop!

	Everyone turns and looks as Meagan comes to the pulpit.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing;
				 to Freddy)
		Take me, Freddy. Take me instead.

				FREDDY
		You're a virgin?!

				MEAGAN
		Oh, that's right -- tell everybody!

	Freddy moves close to Meagan, running a blade over and
	around Meagan's neck as she struggles to remain calm.

				FREDDY
		Mmmmmmm! Yes, you are a bit juicier
		than your retard sister... okay,
		you've got the job.
			(to cultists)
		Get her ready.


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - NIGHT

	Outside, the cultists surrounding the outside of the
	station watch as dozens of police vehicles swarm to
	the fence.  Murdoch and the S.W.A.T. commander get
	out of the lead car.  Murdoch picks up his bullhorn
	and says:

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		This is Captain Renton Murdoch --
		State Trooper. I'm giving you until
		the count of three to come out with
		your hands up...

	A CULTIST SNIPER FIRES a shot at Murdoch, the bullet
	hit SMASHING the emergency lights atop his car.  The
	other cops duck down, but not Murdoch, he turns
	calmly to the S.W.A.T. commander and says:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		Hand me that flare pistol.

	The commander gives the flare gun to Murdoch, adding:

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Good idea. Throw a little light on
		them -- see if we can spot their
		firing positions...

	As the commander speaks, Murdoch aims the pistol
	carefully and FIRES.  PHOOMPH! -- the flare streaks
	to the roof of the TV station, SMACKING the sniper.
	He BURSTS into FLAMES and tumbles to the ground,
	screaming.  Murdoch hands the flare gun back to the
	commander, going back on the bullhorn and saying:

				MURDOCH
			(through bullhorn)
		Alright, now I'm through playing
		"nice guy" -- I want the rest of
		you punks to come out right now
		with your hands up.

	The cultists respond by filling the air with hot lead
	-- BULLET HITS RIDDLE the cop cars, SMASHING glass
	and PIERCING metal.  The cops FIRE back, BULLET HITS
	EXPLODING all along the sides of the TV station.


	INT. STUDIO - NEXT MOMENT

	The cultists bare Meagan's arm and inject her with
	dream dope.  She takes her place at the threshold
	beside Freddy.


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - SAME TIME

	As the battle outside between the cultists and the
	cops RAGES, Murdoch and the S.W.A.T. commander squat
	down behind a fender to reload.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Well, it doesn't look like they're
		going to surrender.

				MURDOCH
		What we're going to need then is
		somebody to charge their lines --
		make a hole for us to slip in.

				S.W.A.T. COMMANDER
		Where are you going to find anyone
		that crazy?

	Just then, an ambulance comes ROARING through the
	police lines, causing the cops to scurry like mice.

				MURDOCH
		Here comes one now...
			(yells)
		GO GIT 'EM, SON!

	Murdoch squints to see who's driving... it's Jason!
	Erwin smiles and waves to Murdoch through the passenger
	side window as the ambulance zooms past.

	Murdoch curses, drawing his pistol and SHOOTING after
	the ambulance.

	The other COPS join in a moment later, BULLET HITS
	SPARKING off the back of the ambulance as it CRASHES
	through the front gate.

	Inside the ambulance, Erwin hazards a glance back at
	the cops, then he turns to Jason and says:

				ERWIN
		That was easy enough...

	Erwin looks ahead and screams.

	ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD as three cultists stand
	directly in front of the speeding ambulance, FIRING
	machine guns.  The glass EXPLODES just as Erwin
	ducks down.

	Two cultists suddenly scatter as Jason rams the
	ambulance into the middle one just before plowing
	into the side of the station with a CRASH.

	Erwin pushes down his airbag just in time to see a
	cultist closing in with a gun.  He reaches through the
	smashed windshield and grabs the squashed cultist's
	machine gun laying on the hood.  Erwin turns, SHOOTS
	the cultist just in time.

	As Jason kicks open the driver's side door he is
	greeted by two cultists SHOOTING at him.  Jason RIPS
	OFF the driver's side door and hurls it at the two
	punks, knocking them down like bowling pins.  Then
	Jason reaches back into the ambulance, pulls out the
	Jaws of Life and, with Erwin covering his back, starts
	towards the front door.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	The wedding proceeds...

				REVEREND LOVEJOY
		Once again... if there be anyone
		among you who does not want these
		two people to be joined... let him
		speak now or forever hold his peace.

	Meagan looks around... no one says anything.  The
	reverend clears his throat to continue when...

	WHAM! -- the studio door flies open and Jason appears
	in the doorway holding the Jaws of Life.

				FREDDY
		Uh, oh...

	The cultists attack Jason.  Jason grabs the first
	one with the Jaws of Life -- folds him in half like
	a rag doll.  Another attacks with a machete... bad
	idea.  One more cultist down and now Jason owns the
	machete.  Jason finishes off the last two cultists
	as Erwin barricades the studio door.  The cultists
	on the other side start POUNDING.

	Jason starts swinging at Freddy with the machete,
	slicing through a camera cable.  CLOSE ON CABLE as
	it falls to the floor.

	Freddy jumps back through the Dreamgate, closing it
	behind him.

	Erwin runs over to Meagan and Lizzy.  He tries to
	wake them but can't.  As Jason lumbers over, Erwin
	looks up and says:

				ERWIN
		I can't wake them up. Freddy's
		got them trapped!

	Erwin thinks for a moment, then rushes over to a
	couple of dead cultists.  He takes their syringes.
	Erwin jabs Jason in the neck with two syringes full
	of dream dope.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		Go get him, boy!

	Jason staggers forward, falling into...


	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Jason falls into a boxing arena.  The ropes are
	entrails and atop each corner post is mounted a human
	head.  The spectators are all DEMONS, MONSTERS, and
	the LIVING DEAD.

	Jason looks over at his opponent -- dressed in boxing
	shorts, shoes, and gloves -- it's Freddy.

	Jason raises his arms and finds he too is wearing
	boxing gloves.

	TED BUNDY steps into the ring.

				TED BUNDY
			(into microphone)
		Ladies and gentlemen... welcome
		to the fight of the century! I'm
		your ring announcer... Ted Bundy!

	BANG! -- a bullet hole appears in Ted's forehead,
	BLOWING his brains out the back.  He falls over DEAD
	and the crowd cheers.  Ted sits up and pulls the wig
	back over his shaved head and electric burns as he
	calls into the balcony:

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		Verrrrrry funny, Oswald!

	ANGLE IN BALCONY -- OSWALD stands, his rifle still
	smoking.

				OSWALD
			(angry; defensive)
		It wasn't me!

	Ted Bundy gets to his feet and finishes the intro:

				TED BUNDY
		In my left corner, weighing in at
		only ninety seven pounds... the
		nightmare master himself! The one!
		The only... Freddddddddy
		Kruuuuuuugerrrrrr!!!

	Freddy holds up his arms and the crowd goes wild.

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		And on my right... weighing in at
		a whopping four hundred and thir-
		teen pounds... that killer of
		countless teenagers... the big
		guy...
			(gestures to Jason)
		Jason Voorhees!

	CHEERS and BOOS.

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		And the prize tonight... not one but
		TWO -- count 'em -- TWO virgins...
		ripe for the picking.

	Ted gestures to a large cage suspended over the arena.
	Inside -- Meagan and Lizzy clutch eachother.

				TED BUNDY
			(continuing)
		Hey, have one now and save the other
		for the ride home. That's what I did.

	LAUGHTER from the crowd.

				MEAGAN
		Kick his ass, Jason!

	DING! -- the bell sounds.  The first round begins...

	Freddy starts towards Jason, cocking his glove for a
	blow when -- CH-CHING! -- knife blades jut out of the
	glove.  He punches Jason in the stomach and starts
	RIPPING him open, rotten guts spilling out.

	Jason spots a cocktail waitress walking past with an
	axe in her head.  This is BLOODY MARY.  Jason reaches
	over the side of the ring and pulls the axe out of
	her head.  Bloody Mary whips around, yelling:

				BLOODY MARY
		HEY!

	Jason swings with the axe -- SH-WACK! -- Jason SLICES
	OFF Freddy's arm.  The crowd ROARS.  Freddy looks
	down at the open armpit, GUSHING with ROTTEN BLOOD,
	and shrugs:

				FREDDY
		Oh, well... I just axed for that!

	Freddy GROWS a new arm, complete with glove of knives.
	Jason throws the axe at Freddy, who ducks it.  The
	axe flies into the audience, SMACKING MUSSOLINI square
	between the eyes.  He falls back to the floor.  HITLER
	turns to EVA BRAUN and says disdainfully:

				HITLER
		Peasants...

	DING!  The bell sounds.  Freddy and Jason break, going
	into their respective corners.  As Jason sits down in
	his corner, the HUMAN HEAD mounted on his corner post
	starts in:

				HUMAN HEAD
		That's it, kiddo! You're really
		giving it to him out there! Use the
		left more -- jab! Make him hurt!
		That's the ticket to a knockout!

	Up in her cage, Meagan clutches a terrifed Lizzy.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Erwin watches Jason sleep as the cultists BANG down
	the studio door.


	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - NEXT MOMENT

	DING!  The bell sounds again and round two begins.
	Freddy and Jason get to their feet and close in on
	each other.  Jason swings wide.  Freddy ducks under
	Jason's massive fist just as the referee steps in for
	a close look.  WHUMP -- Jason knocks the ref's head
	OFF, it goes flying up into the balcony.  The crowd
	CHEERS.

	Jason chases Freddy around the ring, looking for an
	opening.  Freddy backpeddles, tripping over the ref's
	decapitated body as several HUNGRY ZOMBIES drag him out
	of the ring, RIPPING his body apart and DEVOURING it.

	Up in their cage, Meagan and Lizzy grimace with
	disgust.

	Jason reaches down and grabs Freddy, hoisting him
	high above his head.  Then Jason body slams Freddy
	to the mat.  The crowd CHEERS.

	Jason starts jumping up and down on Freddy's back.
	Freddy reaches into his shirt and brings out a rusty
	can of spinach.  In a grotesque parody of Popeye he
	opens the can -- full of nasty worms and maggots --
	and gulps it down.  Suddenly, Freddy throws Jason off
	his back and stands, huge muscles ballooning on his
	chest and arms.  At the end of his right hand -- a
	heavy metal boxing glove.

	Jason gets to his feet in time to see Freddy cock the
	massive glove for a blow.

	CHING! -- dozens of spikes spring out of the metal
	glove.  Freddy swings, knocking Jason into the ropes.
	He bounces off and falls to the mat.  The fans go nuts.

	As Jason tries to get up, Freddy swings his right arm
	around and around -- the metal boxing glove turning
	into a giant mallet.  Jason looks up just in time to
	see the mallet coming down.  WHAM! -- Freddy drives
	Jason into the mat.  The crowd goes wild.

	>From up in her cage, Meagan starts to scream:

				MEAGAN
		Jason! Get up! Get up!

	ANGLE UNDER THE MAT -- it's a dark, foreboding (under-
	water) abyss.  Jason's legs kick, trying to get back
	up.  Something slithers up from out of the deep...
	wisps of empty blackness clutching at Jason's boots.

	Freddy pushes down on Jason's mask, shoving him down.
	Jason struggles but keeps slipping.  This looks like
	the end of Jason.  Freddy laughs.

				MEAGAN
			(continuing)
		Jason! You've got to get up!

	JASON'S P.O.V. of Freddy looking down at him, pushing
	him down... drowning him...

						  FLASH CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE - 1953 - DAY

	YOUNG JASON P.O.V. as he is being drowned.  He fights
	to get to the surface... to see... who it is...

	Young Jason breaks the surface for an instant and
	his killer comes into sharp focus.

	It's FREDDY (AGE 13).  His Camp Crystal Lake nametag
	reads:  Hi! My name is Freddy!  He pushes the young
	Jason down again, laughing.

						  HARD CUT TO:

	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - NEXT INSTANT

	Freddy pushes Jason down into the abyss below the
	mat... laughing, when Jason snaps.  With a burst
	of strength he kicks upward, coming up out of the
	mat.  Jason grabs Freddy by the throat and seizes
	him up with him.

	Jason's momentum carries both of them up to the
	ceiling, where they CRASH through to...


	INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	Jason "wakes up", holding Freddy by the throat as
	he bangs his head into the lighting gridwork above
	the studio.  A light EXPLODES and Freddy cries in
	pain... then realizes, he's been brought into the
	real world.

				FREDDY
		Oh, shit!

	Jason throws Freddy to the ground, then raises up a
	boot and stomps Freddy's head, SQUASHING it like a
	tomato.  The Dream Demons squirt out.

	Just then, the cultists BREAK DOWN the studio door.
	They raise their weapons to fire, when their heads
	suddenly IMPLODE.  They fall screaming to the floor
	-- dead.


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - NIGHT - SAME INSTANT

	The remaining cultists SHOOTING it out with the
	police suddenly grab their heads, screaming.  Their
	heads IMPLODE and they fall to the ground.  Murdoch
	sees this and says to the S.W.A.T. commander:

				MURDOCH
		Now's my chance... give me sixty
		seconds to get in there then move
		in.

	Before the commander can reply, Murdoch is off and
	running into the station.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Meagan and Lizzy come out of their sleep-like trance
	and embrace.  Then Meagan looks up at Erwin.

				MEAGAN
		What took you so long?!

	Erwin gestures to Jason, trying to keep his voice low
	so as to not hurt the big guy's feelings.

				ERWIN
		What ever you do... don't let this
		guy drive.

	Meagan smiles at Jason.

				MEAGAN
		I knew you would come...

	Jason and Meagan look over to where Freddy's body is
	fast decaying... turning back into blackened bones,
	scraps of cloth, and a rusting glove of knives.

	The Dream Demons squirm around on the studio floor,
	then swim into the open end of the camera cable and
	disappear.

	In the control room, Freddy's face appears on every
	monitor, laughing.

				ERWIN
		Oh, no! Freddy's in the transmitter!

	Erwin watches as an electrical Freddy-impulse races
	from the control room via a long thick cable running
	overhead.

				ERWIN
			(continuing)
		He's going for the satellite dish!
		If he uplinks with a communications
		satellite he can beam himself any-
		where in the world! We'll never be
		rid of him!

	Meagan and Jason look up at the Freddy-impulse shoots
	past them, going through the ceiling to the...


	EXT. RELIGIOUS TV STATION - ROOF - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The satellite dish mounted on the roof.  It begins
	to pulsate with an olive and red glow -- getting
	ready to beam Freddy.


	INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME

	Meagan reaches up and grabs the cable, pulling it
	hard.


	EXT. ROOF - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	The roof gives way, tilting the big dish just as it
	BLASTS the laughing Freddy-beam into the night sky.


	EXT. EARTH'S UPPER ATMOSPHERE - NEXT INSTANT

	The Freddy-beam just misses the satellite, ricocheting
	off one of the solar panels and sending the satellite
	tumbling into deep space.

	The deflected Freddy-beam now zooms towards the sun.

	Inside the beam -- Freddy sees the sun zooming up
	and screams.  His face burns away, leaving a screaming
	skull.  That too burns away, leaving the Dream Demons.
	One by one they burn up as the beam reaches the sun.

	ANGLE ON THE SUN as the beam EXPLODES, causing a
	solar prominence.


	INT. TV STATION - STUDIO - SAME TIME

	The ceiling collapses in on Jason, burying him under
	a ton of rubble and the big antenna dish.  A ton of
	dust billows up.

	Just then, Murdoch bursts in.  He sees Lizzy and
	Meagan and takes aim with the shotgun.  Erwin sees
	this and jumps in-between them, yelling:

				ERWIN
		No! Wait!

	Murdoch FIRES.  The shotgun blast knocks Erwin across
	the room, where he lands in a heap.  Meagan and Lizzy
	run to his side.

	Erwin struggles to breathe -- a large hole in his
	chest.  With fading strength, Erwin pulls his pin
	out and pricks himself.  Erwin smiles and dies.

				MEAGAN
		Erwin? Erwin?!

				MURDOCH
		He's dead... and so are you if you
		don't put your hands up right now!

	Lizzy turns and attacks Murdoch.  He knocks her to
	the floor, taking aim on her head with the shotgun
	as he says:

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		It's time I taught you girls some
		respect for the law!

	In a panic, Meagan snatches up a pistol from a fallen
	cultist and FIRES it at Murdoch's head.

	PTT-TWANG! -- Murdoch's hat goes flying off with a
	SPARK HIT, revealing his bald, hideous head -- a
	large open wound with a metal plate underneath.  He
	turns towards Meagan with an evil grin on his face.

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		So... you wanna be a punk?

	Murdoch raises the shotgun, taking aim on Meagan.

				MURDOCH
			(continuing)
		Then die like a punk!

	Murdoch starts to squeeze the trigger when Jason's
	hand shoots out of the rubble pile behind him.  Jason
	jams his hand down the back of Murdoch's pants and
	pulls up his briefs, lifting him a foot off the floor
	with a Jason-wedgy as he rises from the rubble.  We
	see Murdoch's name written into his shorts.

	As Murdoch screams, Jason jerks the shotgun from his
	hand and jams it up his ass -- right through the seat
	of his pants.  Murdoch's cheeks bulge out as the
	muzzle slams into the roof of his mouth.  Jason cocks
	the shotgun and...

	BOOM! -- Murdoch's head and shoulders EXPLODE from
	his torso, leaving his broken spine sticking up out
	of shirt.  Bits of Murdoch splatter the floor as his
	metal plate comes PINGING down, rolling around and
	spinning to a stop like a hubcap.

	Jason drops Murdoch (what's left of him) to the
	floor just as the S.W.A.T. commander and his men
	come charging in.  They see Jason and raise their
	guns in panic.

				MEAGAN
		NO!

	Too late.  The cops let loose with a BARRAGE of GUN-
	FIRE.  BULLET HITS EXPLODE on Jason's chest.  Meagan
	grabs Lizzy and covers her up as the bullets WHIZZ
	past.

	More cops hear the SHOOTING and come running.  They
	start SHOOTING too.  Soon the doorway to the studio
	is crowded with muzzle flash.

	More and more BULLET HITS SMACK Jason.  A bullet
	hole outline appears on the wall behind him.

	The cops start running out of ammo and a cry goes
	up, "More ammo! More ammo!".

	VARIOUS INSERTS OF cops going for hideout pistols,
	opening their trunks and taking out ammo cans,
	passing the weapons and ammo up the staircase to the
	cops in the studio.

	Jason keeps getting SHOT.  Pieces of his are flying
	off.  Fingers shot off of a hand.  A knee shot away
	to reveal the bone.  Dozens of BULLET HITS going off
	of his chest and head.

	Finally, the cops start to run out of ammo.  The
	SHOOTING subsides and finally grinds to a stop, leaving
	the cops knee-high in brass and a thick layer of
	gunsmoke in the room.

	As it clears, Jason still stands.  He teeters a little,
	then falls backwards with a mighty THUD.

	Jason lays dying.  Meagan rushes to his side.  Jason
	reaches into one of the giant holes in his chest and
	pulls something out -- Jesse's heart.

	Jason hands the heart to Meagan.  Then Jason's head
	rolls back -- he's dead.

	Meagan begins weeping as we pull up out of the studio,
	revealing her surrounded by Jason, Freddy, and Murdoch.

					DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. LIZZY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Meagan tucks Lizzy into her bed.  She gives her the
	Raggedy Ann doll and kisses her goodnight.  As Meagan
	turns out the light, Lizzy asks:

				LIZZY
		You forgot to check under the bed.

	Meagan clucks and bends down, peering under the bed
	-- nada.

				MEAGAN
		No monsters here.

				LIZZY
		But what if they come back?

				MEAGAN
		Then we'll just have to kick their
		ass again.

	Lizzy giggles.

				LIZZY
		I love you, Meagan.

				MEAGAN
		I love you too. Go to sleep.


	INT. MEAGAN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

	As Meagan crosses to her room, her parents call up
	to her from the bottom of the staircase.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Meagan?

	Meagan looks down at her parents.

				MEAGAN
		Yes, dad?

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Your mom and I... well, we want to
		thank you for saving your sister's
		life... we know you went through
		a lot.

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		We're going to be there for you
		from now on... for both of you!
		And that nice lawyer we hired for
		you said he thinks he can get all
		the charges dropped... except maybe
		for the grave robbing and human
		desecration ones.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Everything is going to be fine.

				MEAGAN
		I know...

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		And I'm going to get sober...

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		We're going to be a normal, happy
		family again.

				MEAGAN
		I know...

				MEAGAN'S MOM
		Goodnight, sweetheart.

				MEAGAN
		Goodnight mom... goodnight dad.

				MEAGAN'S DAD
		Goodnight, Meagan.


	INT. MEAGAN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Meagan is ready for bed, drawing back the covers,
	when the phone RINGS.  She picks it up.

				MEAGAN
		Hello?

				FREDDY
			(filtered)
		I'll be seeing you in your dreams...

	Freddy's nasty tongue slithers out of the handset and
	licks Meagan in the face.  She yelps and slams the
	phone down.

				MEAGAN
			(sighs)
		I know...

	Meagan puts the phone in a drawer and closes it.  She
	climbs into bed and pulls back the pillow to reveal
	the pistol Erwin gave Jesse to kill Freddy.  She smiles
	and puts the pistol back under the pillow.

					 BLACKNESS:

	The phone RINGS.

	ROLL END CREDITS:

	Then... at the very end...

					 CUT TO:

	INT. NIGHTMARE ARENA - SAME TIME

	Ted Bundy and all the spectators are looking up at
	the hole in the ceiling that Jason and Freddy made
	when they went back to reality... waiting.

	Finally, somebody says:

				MONSTER
		I don't think they're coming back.

				TED BUNDY
		Okay, folks... show's over. Every-
		body can go home now.

	All the monsters get grumbling and start to exit.

					 CUT TO:

	BLACK... now it's over.

				THE END
