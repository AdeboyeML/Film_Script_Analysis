          CHARLES CAPPA JR. (CHARLIE) is 25 of Sicilain origin. He
          was educated in Roman Catholic Parochial schools with one
          year and a half at a Jesuit college. CHARLIE was raised
          sternly in the Roman Catholic tradition but now has rejected
          many of the religion's tenets. He is very intelligent and
          has a sharp sense of humor. He is always well dressed. His
          favorite authors are Ernest Hemingway, Thomas Hardy, and
          Theodore Dreiser. He likes reading but enjoys films more.
          He is very fond of the New Testament and often exchanges
          quotes from it with his friend TONY.

          that will later appear in the story: JOHNNY BOY, MICHAEL,
          TONY, TERESA, CHARLIE'S UNCLE GIOVANNI, and others. They
          are all Sicilian and are members of the same Italian-
          American neighborhood in New York City. (WE SENSE, from
          these HOME MOVIES, that the neighborhood forces its people
          to be strongly tied together in a way of life - Family,
          Church, Friendship.) These HOME MOVIES were taken during
          some formal and casual gatherings in which CHARLIE
          participated.

          A longhaired "freak" is about to shoot-up. Suddenly the
          door opens and TONY (ANTHONY DEVENZIANO) comes in. TONY is
          totally different in appearance and dress from the "freak."
          He is 25, and a part time student studying liberal arts.
          His father is a very powerful racketeer in a different part
          of the city and owns several night club type discotheques
          and strip houses on the west side of town. One of these is
          operated by TONY - "TONY'S PLACE." CHARLIE is one of his
          closest friends. TONY is well dressed, flippant and reckless.
          He is a big drinker, liquor, wine, and even cough medicine.

          side by side. Two men are tossing boxes from one truck to
          another and looking around furtively. MICHAEL stands nearby.
          MICHAEL LONGO is 26 years old. He lives in a different
          neighborhood but comes from the same type of background as
          CHARLIE and the others. He runs an illegitimate bar and
          dabbles in the yearly sale of firecrackers which he smuggles
          in from Maryland. He also deals in contraband cigarettes
          and runs a small-time "loan shark" business. He has a knack
          for business but he is otherwise unintelligent.

          JOHNNY BOY walks down the street toward camera. JOHN
          CIVELLO (JOHNNY BOY) is 23 years old. He is an only child
          and lives with his mother, a divorcee. He is clean cut
          looking, yet slightly radical in dress. He was expelled
          from high school for vandalism and consequently spent
          several months in reform school. He is reckless,
          unambitious, nihilistic, and was classified a psychiatric 4-
          F. He is first cousin of TERESA RONCHALI who lives next
          door to CHARLIE. He has adopted TERESA'S family as his own
          and spends more time with them than he does with his mother.
                         
          JOHNNY is carrying a package wrapped in plain brown paper
          under his arm, and he is smiling. He drops the package into
          the mailbox and keeps walking. But he is moving a little
          faster now and smiling a little more.
                         
          Suddenly the mailbox explodes. Dozens of red, white and
          blue fragments shower down on the street. The impact of the

          medicine cabinet, takes out a few items and gives them to
          CHARLIE. TONY then crosses to the other side of the room
          where he removes the blanket which has been covering a large
          cage. He reveals a live, young beautiful PANTHER stalking

          TERESA RONCHALI is 30 years, well built, attractive and
          intelligent. She is well read and quiet. The salary she
          makes as a secretary in a book publishing firm practically
          supports her family. She has epilepsy which has prevented
          her (in her own mind) from entering into any serious
          relationships with men. She has however, been having an
          affair with CHARLIE for the past year. It is a well kept
          secret from both families because the families regard each
          other as blood relations.
                         
          CHARLIE is startled by JOHNNY BOY who is now awake and has

          He hangs up roughly and returns to his position in bed.
          CHARLIE shakes his head with an exasperated smile as if this
          was a common occurance. CHARLIE turns back to look at
          TERESA but she is no longer in her room.

          nude. She is lying face down on the bed. He approached and
          ejaculates prematurely - However, he doesn't ejaculate
          sperm - instead blood. They are shocked. The blood is on
          the bed, her legs, back, and his hands. Charlie cries out

          CHARLIE is sitting in a quiet corner of the restaurant.
          This restaurant was considered an above average business
          with quality and prices to match when it was first opened
          three years ago. The quality has diminished but the prices
          remain the same. As a result the place is dying. CHARLIE
          is scrutinizing the restaurant from his corner. He picks up
          a water goblet and critically examines the water spots on it.
          He calls a waitress to show her the dirt on the glass. She
          apologizes, cleans it with her apron, and places it back on
          the table. He takes a menu.
                         
          A chubby, middle-aged man, OSCAR, approaches the table. He
          is half owner of the decaying restaurant. He is in his
          shirt sleeves which, along with the side of his face, are
          smeared with grease and dirt. He is tired and disgusted.

          CHARLIE enters a small Italian cafe and nods greetings to
          some of the people as he makes his way to the back of the
          room. This cafe is a strange hybred of coffee house, candy
          store, luncheonette, and meeting place for CHARLIE'S uncle
          GIOVANNI and his associates.
                         
          GIOVANNI De STEFANO is sixty. He is well respected and
          powerful both in and out of the neighborhood. He became a
          head figure not by being introduced formally as was the
          custom, but rather by fighting and killing his way into the
          organization. GIOVANNI is well dressed but not a stereotype
          of an old Mafioso, rather a kindly and intelligent old man.
                         
          GIOVANNI converses intermittently in Italian.

          CHARLIE walks through the luncheonette area, past the dining
          room where his uncle is in conference, to the bathroom at
          the very back of the cafe. MARIO is seated with his uncle.
                         
          MARIO is forty five years old. He is GIOVANNI'S closest
          associate, brought into the organization in the traditional
          manner, making his early reputation through hits (murders).
          He is not very intelligent but has an undying loyalty to
          GIOVANNI, and is very fond of CHARLIE.
                         
          MARIO and GIOVANNI are seated with a very old man. They are
          deep in their private conversation. CHARLIE passes by
          unnoticed and walks into the bathroom.
                         
          CHARLIE begins to wash his hands but changes his mind. He
          shuts off the faucet in order to eavesdrop on the
          conversation.

                          CHARLIE
           Yes, I'd say there are some
           Columbian coffee beans in this
           coffee, but only about 39%.
                         
          MARIE is disinterested. CHARLIE continues.
                         
           36.
                         
                         
                          CHARLIE
           You see. You probably don't notice
           this Marie, but Colombian coffee
           beans are rich coffee beans.
           Bursting with that good, deep
           coffee flavor. Picked when they
           are ripe to the point of perfection.
           The beans of course, are protected
           by the tall South American Guama
           trees.
                         
          MARIE chews her gum for a moment and leaves the table.
          CHARLIE'S monologue continues and gradually he falls back
          into his CONFESSION. As he talks, the CAMERA PICKS UP
          DETAILS of the cafe and the people in it.
                         
                          CHARLIE
           Then the bean pickers come down and
           pick each bean by hand. Bean by
           bean, all heavy with flavor. And
           they load them into boxes, one box
           at a time, box by box.
                         
          From time to time CHARLIE is casually glancing at MARIE who
          is busy with her work.
                         
          BLACK & WHITE & COLOR
                         
          The images now move out of the cafe and the CAMERA REVEALS
          aspects of the neighborhood - LIVE ACTION and STILLS:

          JOHNNY BOY closes his eyes. CHARLIE looks at JOHNNY BOY and
          then looks at the cemetary in the moonlight. It seems
          totally apart from the city with the sirens and cars far in
          the distance.
                         
          CHARLIE stands and unravels his robes, preparing to take
          them off. He projects the image of Christ delivering a
          sermon. Music and laughter in the distance catches his
          attention. The lights and the music are coming from the top
          floor of a tenement building where a Puerto Rican family is
          having a party. The sound echoes through the streets.
          Decorations are hanging and blowing away through the open
          windows. As CHARLIE watches a fight break out over one of
          the girls. Screams are heard. People run up and down the
          fire escape.
                         
          CHARLIE has pulled off the robe. He now removes the beard
          and wig and has become himself again. He leans over to find
          JOHNNY BOY fast asleep on a tomb.

          The TWA terminal at Kennedy. TONY'S car pulls up to the
          curb, CHARLIE gets out, waves away help from an idle porter,
          and pulls his suitcases out of the back seat. TONY leans
          across the seat toward him.

          up his bag from the sidewalk and walks into the terminal.

          The place is huge and there is a lot of bustle and excitement.
          CHARLIE is noticeable because he is the only member of the
          crowd who walks slowly, without any apparent mission or
          destination. He makes his way toward the large flight board
          that looms over the whole room. Loudspeakers announce
          planes to and from every part of the world. On the flight
          board, the origins and destinations of the days flight spin
          and change every moment. He passes the insurance machines
          and almost stops - more upset than before. A businessman
          calmly pays for insurance. (Muzak is heard) CHARLIE
          continues on past a novelty shop where some plastic crosses
          and St. Christopher medals hang alongside the stuffed toy
          dogs and flight bags. He looks at the cross.

          The ticket desk is under the flight board. CHARLIE eventually
          works his way over to the desk, drops his bag on the floor
          and stands staring at the board. He sees the names of
          dozens of cities flashing before him. As he watches, a
          pretty ticket clerk speaks to him from behind the desk.

          CHARLIE stares at the flight board in dismay and indecision.

          CHARLIE hears her this time. He reaches into his jacket
          pocket and pulls out the ticket which he passes across to
          her. The clerk starts to open it to check the destination.

          back at her with a quality that is almost defiance.
