          Perhaps even eerie.

          FADE IN:

          On a sea of red, filling the frame. A crimson ocean without
          waves or ripples.

          A thick housepainter's BRUSH dips in, revealing its paint.
          The BRUSH is extracted, paint dripping like congealing blood.
          FOLLOW THE BRUSH to reveal...

          INT. A HOUSE - NIGHT

          A white wall, where the BRUSH is moved horizontally, leaving
          a thick continuous stripe, until the paint thins out.
          A WOMAN'S HAND plunges the BRUSH back into the paint can,
          then takes up creating the stripe again, painting the wall:
          until it reaches &pleated drape --
          -- and doesn't stop. A window and another drape receive the
          same treatment before the BRUSH is re-dipped.

          A PUPPY,
          a sad-eyed basset hound, sits on the floor watching, a bit
          perplexed. This is WALTER and even he knows this is weird.
          The dog looks over to...

          A FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL
          standing next to him, also watching. This is RACHEL. Dark
          haired, in a plain dress. Her large eyes are welling on the
          verge of tears.

          The BRUSH is dragged across the wall, hits a wooden picture
          frame, moves across a cheap oil painting of a pastoral,
          forest scene, and over the other edge of the frame.

          Another ANGLE takes in the red line, five feet high, parallel
          to the floor, extending around a modest living room.

          Painting the line is BARBARA LANG, in her thirties, yet worn,
          haggard- She hasn't slept in a while.

          The precision of her work, her concentration, her focus, as
          the line runs across a wall and into a corner, is more than a
          little frightening.

          This is a very careful line.

                         RACHEL
          Momma, come play with me. In my room.
          But her mother keeps painting across a door.

                         RACHEL
          Right now, mommy, okay?
          BARBARA looks at her, or rather through her. And continues
          her task. RACHEL steps forward, tugs on her mom's

          I got a idea, we could--

                         THE KITCHEN
           A TOY AMBULANCE sits on the floor. RACHEL's tiny hand
           deliberately presses a button on it. The TOY responds with a
          wheep whe ep siren, then:

          A WALL-MOUNTED PHONE
          RACHEL's HAND struggles to reach the buttons to dial 9-1-1.
          BARBARA's still painting the wall in the background.

          RACHEL (O.S.)

          some... some wrong things. She's

          A light rain falls on an AMBULANCE sitting next to a POLICE
          Its dashing red lights

          her hands in plastic restraining cuffs.
          A wet RACHEL stands by a kneeling POLICE OFFICER holding a
          poncho over her head.

                         POLICEMAN
          Rachel? Rachel, are you okay?
          She keeps staring off, watching her mother being stuffed into
          the ambulance.

                         RACHEL
          Momma!
          She starts towards her, but the OFFICER holds her back.

                         POLICEMAN
          Honey, she just has to go somewhere,
          to get some rest, so she'll feel
          better.
          As the AMBULANCE pulls away, RACHEL catches a glimpse of her
          mother in the rear windows, watching her.

                         POLICEMAN
          is your dad around? When's he get
          home from work?
          I don't have a dad.
          The POLICEMAN collects himself.

          Where she runs down the entrance hall. Behind her, outside,
          as the POLICEMAN runs toward the front door, it --
          SLAMS by itself, right in his face.
          FOLLOW RACHEL as she rushes through the living room and down
          a hall. Another door slams shut behind her.

                         HER ROOM
          She spins, frightened by the door that closed behind her. To
          her left...
          A WINDOW crashes shut, startling her. Then, like a wave
          moving in a circle around her, another WINDOW bangs down, a
          DOOR slams shut, another WINDOW. Scared, RACHEL backs into

                         A CLOSET
          where she finds WALTER huddling and cradles him in her arms.
          The CLOSET DOOR swings shut, sealing her off from the world.

                         FROM ABOVE
          In the dark, RACHEL is in a fetal position on the floor, dry
          eyed, in shock, curled around her puppy.
          There's the far-off sound of POUNDING on a door.

          RACHEL, now 17, is curled in bed around WALTER, also now a
          far more senior dog. She's enmeshed in tangled white
          Small TATTOOS come into view -- A delicate angel with broken
          wings on her ankle. A small EGYPTIAN ANKH is etched on her
          shoulder blade.
          Wrapped around her upper arm is an elegant THORN BAND
          encircling a HEART, either protecting or imprisoning it.
          There's a knock on her bedroom door.

          A PAN AROUND RACHEL'S ROOM
          the usual teenage mess, clothes strewn everywhere. A POSTER
          of Jim Morrison reads: "No One Here Gets Out Alive."
          RACHEL stands before her dresser mirror, in a ratty bathrobe,
          putting on a small nose stud. She dons her daily armor --
          -- Slipping on multiple earrings.
          -- Applying Kohl around her eyes.
          -- Shrugging on a T-shirt with a photo of Sharon Tate
          captioned "Manson Sucks".
          -- Disheveling her long black hair.
          Scooping up WALTER, she kisses him, takes him to an open
          ground floor window.
          Sorry, Walt.
          And gently lowers him outside.

          EXT. A HOUSE - MORNING

          It's not the home RACHEL lived in with BARBARA. This one is
          run down and in the section of town where people have cars in
          their yards they've abandoned tinkering with. The lawn is
          overgrown, there's broken glass on the street.

          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

          The crammed eat-in-kitchen of the WALLACE house. EMILYN,
          40's, is ironing a waitress uniform on the counter. A groggy
          BOYD, 40's, enters, he's a trucker and looks like one. He
          goes straight for the refrigerator.
          BOYD and his wife EMILYN have taken in RACHEL as a foster kid
          to augment their income.

          EXT. HOUSE - MORNING

          RACHEL stands outside, clad in a long dark overcoat, with a

          younger sister, also dressed Goth, black lace and metal.
          LISA has a HEART-THORN TATTOO around her arm, like RACHEL's.

          student government types and others who have no idea what it
          is to be alone on a Saturday night.
          At the patio is a pack of muscular jocks in football letter

          A BELL goes off and the STUDENTS start filing into school.
          LISA waves the tips of her fingers to RACHEL, bye-bye.
          RACHEL looks over, catches a glimpse of JESSE, across the
          line of demarcation. For a piece of a second it seems as if
          he's looking back. She drops her head, walks away.

          the same time, all lovers are
          eventually separated by death.

          Well, then Romeo and Juliet isn't a
          tragedy, because the only way they
          could really be together was in death.

          The car pulls away, MARK glances in the REARVIEW MIRROR at
          RACHEL, framed like a target.

          name, her eyes widen.

          EXT. A HILL - NIGHT

          A star-filled sky hangs above the town's makeout spot, a hill
          overlooking Bergen. MARK and CHUCK stand outside a car
          sipping beers. JESSE's CAR, a blue G.T.Â©, is several yards
          away, with foggy windows.

          WITHIN JESSE'S CAR
          The backseat. JESSE's on top of TRACY. He pulls away from
          her. She pulls her top down, sits up.

                         JESSE
          I'm sorry, it's not you. its me.

                         TRACY
          It's okay. You should save your
          energy for the game anyway.
          JESSE opens the door, stands outside, tucking in his shirt.
          MARK and CHUCK make a crude humping gesture to JESSE. He
          hesitates, then nods at them.
          MARK pulls out the SCOREBOARD and enters JESSE's name with
          TRACY's and the number 10.

                         MARK
          He shoots, he scores.
          ON TRACY -- in the front seat, using the rearview to adjust
          her makeup, pleased with what she sees. She glances at JESSE
          as he re-enters on the driver's side.

                         TRACY
          What are you thinking about?

          SMASH as a dish drops onto the floor. RACHEL is at the sink,
          doing dishes. She crouches to retrieve the broken plate.
          WE PAN along the chorus line of dishes, glasses, and
          silverware on the counter as the metronome of the sink
          faucet's DRIP, DRIP, DRIP and the micro-explosions of the
          soap bubbles in the water intensify to deafening levels.
          TIGHT ON a SPOON atop the counter which suddenly begins
          dancing. Pots and pans on a hanging rack start rattling.
          A RUMBLE as more dishes and utensils vibrate and rattle, as
          if by a paranormal force.
          But as RACHEL casually straightens up and looks out the

          TRUCKS streaming by at high speed.

          The high, piercing SQUEAL of a wounded animal.
          In the road, WALTER, laying flat, keening in pain.

          But the CAR passes, blaring its horn. She spins,around.

          THE CAR -- lays down rubber as it screeches to a halt.
          JESSE is at the wheel. Sees through the crazed windshield:
          RACHEL, splattered with dog's blood.
          He gets out, stares at his'windshield, shaken-up, groping for
          some explanation.

          A craftsman bungalow which serves as a vet's hospital. The
          only light is over a FEMALE VET in her bathrobe, tending to
          WALTER on a shiny examining table. There are runnels on both
          sides of the table, for the blood.
          RACHEL and JESSE stand nearby.

          other. Then the moment is gone.

          RACHEL crossing the lot. Her HEARTBEAT can be heard. She

          SLOW MOTION -- LISA falls through the air towards the car,

          Robbie, I had a Freshman crying in the
          hall last week. I couldn't get
          anything out of her, but her friend
          told me a football player slept with
          her, then dumped her.

          Nothing illegal about breaking a
          girl's heart.

          Eric's 18. Lisa was 15. That's
          statutory rape.

                         KELTON
          That's a stretch.

          Then let's make it. I don't know
          what's going on around here, but if
          that's what it takes to stop it, let's
          stop it, before someone else's
          daughter kills herself.

          Does that surprise you?

                         RACHEL

          Why?

                         SUE
          Well, children of schizophrenics
          sometimes live with the fear of it
          happening to them. At your age,
          it's perfectly normal to be afraid
          of turning out like your parents.

                         RACHEL
          Normal, huh? Get real, I know I'm
          ten times more likely to get it
          than most people.

          Never met the gentleman. My mom
          won't even tell me his name.
          RACHEL stares at a ceramic MUG of coffee, very close o the
          edge of the desk.

                         SUE
          Rachel, in a way, you've lost your
          mother. And now you've lost a friend.
          Losing someone can be a very lonely,

          I really do care. How can I show you
          that I do?
          RACHEL is silent, staring at the MUG.

                         SUE
          Rachel?
          But RACHEL's shut off, pushing down a storm of emotions.

          You know, this room is a place where
          if you have feelings, you can talk
          about them. You can let them out.
          RACHEL shifts. SUE sees RACHEL's forearm near the coffee
          MUG. And, as if by proximity alone, it EDGES off the end of
          the desk --
          And FALLS --
          RACHEL catches it in one smooth motion just before it hits.

          SUE, the color draining from her face.

          PLAYERS Pounding into it.

                         WALSH

          You know the drill.
          The other PLAYERS begin a BARKING CHANT. CHUCK strips off
          his helmet, jogs to the bench and opens a styrofoam cooler,
          within it are slabs of raw steak on blood soaked ice..

                         WALSH
          Show me you're a dog, Potter.
          The barking rises as the PLAYERS psyche up CHUCK, who chews
          off a bite of the raw meat. JESSE whispers to MARK...

                         JESSE
          I hate this bullshit.

                         MARK
          Not me. I love it.
          MARK pops up, grabs a steak, rips off a bite, and runs full
          tilt at the, blocking tackle, smashing into it with meaning.

                         WALSH
          You're a piece of work, Bing.
          MARK takes a bow as he jogs away, chewing. He spots the
          SHERIFF's CRUISER pulling --p to the practice field.

          MARK watches ERIC, so intent he bobbles a ball thrown to him.

          JESSE doffs his helmet, jogs to the bench. He douses his
          head with water, sits there, looking angry.

          with a chenille spread.

          firelight. JESSE drapes his jacket over the MOOSE HEAD.

          I'm sorry, I just feel... weird.

          losing my mind here.

          It's okay. Rachel, it's okay. It
          doesn't have to be tonight. Whenever
          you're ready. And, hey, you know
          what, you're the sanest person I know.
          And that's exactly what she needed to hear. She cups the
          back of his neck and pulls his lips to hers. They kiss; a
          deep, healing kiss.

          brushes aside one of the straps to her dress,, which slips off

          Go long, Bradzilla.
          MARK laughs as BRAD circles around RACHEL, twists between
          other dancers. CHUCK tosses the NOTEBOOK over RACHEL and
          BRAD leaps up to catch it.

                         BRAD
          Post-pattern, Mark!
          Ducking around DANCERS, MARK raises his hands for the pass.
          KIDS start to notice their antics and start laughing.
          BRAD passes the book over to MARK who catches it, mimes
          spiking it for a touchdown and does a silly victory dance.
          MONICA laughs and turns to RACHEL, who laughs, even though
          she still looks a bit befuddled.

                         MARK
          Rachel, catch!
          He throws the NOTEBOOK through the air, where it tumbles end
          over end for a few slow beats, then is caught by her.

           THE TV SET -- keeps playing football highlights, but suddenly
          there's an almost subliminal --
          FLASH of TWO INTERTWINED BODIES.
          RACHEL holds the NOTEBOOK, unsure of what to do with it. The
          boys are a little out of breath, but still grinning and
          dancing.

          Yeah, start with poor Eric.
          She opens the book, looks at the pages with a quizzical
          expression. She sees the Bulldog names across the top of the
          page with lists of girls beneath each one. Every girl has a
          number next to her with a total at the bottom.

                         MARK

          RACHEL stops dancing as she spots LISA PARKER's name at the
          bottom of ERIC's column with the number four next to it.

          No, more than that, remember, we

          At the front door, JESSE walks in, TRACY behind him. He

          JESSE breaks free of ERIC's grip, slugs CHUCK and pushes his
          way towards RACHEL.
          Her HEART POUNDS at an alarming rate as she slowly turns and

          embrace.

                         MARK
          lowers his shoulder, crashes through a closing door into.

                         A DEN
          where the walls are decorated with deer heads and hunting
          trophies. MARK and ERIC are smashing a standing glass case
          containing pistols and rifles.
          TRACY leans panting against the wall.
          MARK slips a HANDGUN into his belt.

                         TRACY
          Screw that, get the shotguns!
          Shaking, freaked out, they gather weapons.

          from behind. They take off in the other direction, TRACY
          bringing up the re
          Barrelling shoulders first into a door, the boys burst
          through and into...

          EXTâ¢ THE BACK YARD - NIGHT
          Where they almost stumble into the swimming pool.
          Toting their rifles, MARK, ERIC and TRACY turn to find
          RACHEL, at a gunfighter's distance, coming towards them.
          TRACY and BRAD cock their weapons and bring them to their
          shoulders. TRACY slips on her glasses.

                         MARK
          Wait till she's closer.
          TRACY tightens her finger on the trigger.
          RACHEL's eyes narrow and...
          TRACY's glasses shatter into her eyes, spewing blood
          milky fluid.
          Aaaaa...
          She staggers, fires her shotgun into ERIC's groin and he
          lands sitting next to the pool. A dying ERIC stares at his
          shredded lap, then falls over.
          MARK looks at his dead friend.
          Oh, shit.
          .recovers, and swings his aim back at RACHEL. But his
          rifle goes sailing over his head and into the grass twenty
          feet behind him.
          He makes eye-contact with a grim RACHEL advancing toward him,
          and hauls ass.
          RACHEL glances at a coiled GARDEN HOSE and it springs to
          life, slithering through the grass and across the concrete at
          high speed to wrap around MARK's ankle and trip him up.
          He hits the ground hard and rolls over to find the hose
          twisting around his legs and up his waist like a python.

                         HIS HAND
          grasps for the rifle, but falls short as the hose pins his
          other arm to his side, then curls around his windpipe in a
          stranglehold.

          His eyes widen as the life is squeezed from him and he sees
          RACHEL standing over him.
          He gropes for the shotgun again... and finally grabs it.
          RACHEL looks at the rifle and it flies from his hold,
          splashing into the pool.
          But she jolts on two...

                         GUNSHOTS
          RACHEL looks down. MARK had pulled the handgun from his belt
          with his pinned hand and fired.
          She's holding her belly, gutshot, staggers and falls into the
          pool, disappearing amid a swirl of blood.
          MARK yanks the hose from his neck as it goes slack. He
          gasps, points the gun into the pool and FIRES until it's
          silent and he's left pulling the trigger on empty chambers.
          He gets his breatking under control, leans over to look into
          the water of the deep end. He Aar on the sound of a
          mechanical whirring, and turns.
          A POOL COVER starts to unfold.
          At that moment...

          RACHEL'S BLOODY ARM
          bursts from the water and grips his neck. MARK grabs her
          forearm as her other arm yanks him into the pool.

                         UNDERWATER --
          As RACHEL drags MARK down, he kicks and pummels her, but she
          holds on. The POOL COVER steadily closes over them, shutting
          out the light from above.
          MARK finally frees himself and lunges for the surface, but
          the POOL COVER blocks his escape.
          He desperately pushes at it, eyes bulging, lungs burning, as
          his feet kick to keep him afloat.

          ON THE SURFACE --
          The POOL COYER closing as RACHEI, hauls herself from the
          water, barely making it out. MARK'S HAND, grabs her leg,
          slides, then clutches at the edge of the pool. His fingers
          slip under as the cover completely shuts.

          Rachel!
          A weakened RACHEL lays by the pool. She seems to be snapping
          out of her trance as she rolls over and sees BARBARA.
          RACHEL shudders and suddenly just looks like a wet, scared
          little girl reaching for her mother.

          She looks her daughter in the eyes, backs away in terror.

          Her face is serene.
          JESSE traces his fingers across her brow, embraces her, the
          flames start to encircle them, just like in RACHEL's
          nightmare.
          JESSE pulls RACHEL over the debris ridden floor toward the

          open.

          JESSE is slumped over, asleep on a desk layered in textbooks
          and a notebook. An all-night study session.
          His hair is shor., he's wearing a beard. His face is more
          mature, sadder. The beard largely hides some burn scars on
          one side of his face.
          Over the desk is a MIRROR and a "Fighting Irish" pennant.
          The only light comes from his desk lamp.
          He jerks awake with a spasm, glances at a digital clock
          glowing on his desk: 11:S$ A.M.

          Somehow, he's scrawled on the notebook paper on the desk in
          front of him:
          kINg of HELL
          Or, if you only look at the capitalized letters, it reads:
