          INT. CHURCH

          We're at the funeral of Dorothy Kowalski. In attendance
          are mostly old folks, their offspring and several bored
          teenagers.
          WALT KOWALSKI stands towards the front of the church. He
          speaks to an older MAN in a bulky, out-of-date suit.

          OLDER MAN
          I'm real sorry about Dorothy,
          Walt. She was a real peach.

          WALT
          Thanks for coming, Al.
          Walt Kowalski looks young for his age. He has slate blue
          eyes, physically fit and has had the same buzz cut
          hairstyle since getting out of the military in 1953.
          Walt is also a perfectionist. Nothing escapes his
          hawklike eyes, eyes that pierce and judge.
          Walt looks around at how the young people have dressed at
          his wife's funeral. His eyes narrow at his
          GRANDDAUGHTER's belly button ring.

          WALT
          Jesus Christ.
          Walt's two sons, MITCH and STEVE, watch their father from
          across the pews.

          MITCH
          Look at the Old Man glaring at
          Ashley. He can't even tone it
          down at Mom's funeral?

          STEVE
          What do you expect? Dad's still
          living in the 50s. He expects
          his granddaughter to dress a
          little more modestly.

          MITCH
          Yeah, well your kid's wearing a
          Timberwolves jersey. I'm sure Dad
          appreciates that.

          STEVE
          My point is that there's nothing
          anyone can do that won't
          disappoint the Old Man.

          It's inevitable. That's why we
          stopped doing Thanksgivings; the
          deal with the boat motor, the
          broken bird bath, it's always
          something.

          MITCH
          What are we going to do with him?
          Don't you think he'll get in
          trouble by himself over in the old
          neighborhood?

          STEVE
          Why don't you have him move in
          with you?

          MITCH
          Ha ha.

          INT. CHURCH - LATER


          The choir sings the Beatitudes.
          Walt looks around disgustedly at the people gathered as
          one woman looks through her day planner, an old guy dozes
          and his Granddaughter Ashley applies nail polish.
          FATHER JANOVICH, the very young parish priest, steps up
          to the altar and delivers the eulogy for Walt's wife.
          Walt sits ramrod straight and listens to the thin, weak,
          unconvincing words of Father Janovich.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Death... is often a bittersweet
          occasion to us Catholics. Bitter
          in the pain it causes the deceased
          ... and their families. Sweet to
          those who know the salvation that
          awaits them. And some may ask,
          what is death. Is it the end? Or
          is it the beginning? And what is
          life? What is this thing we call
          life?

          WALT
          Jesus.
          Walt coughs. He takes a handkerchief and wipes his lips.
          He looks down and notices a speck of BLOOD on the white
          cloth.

          INT. WALT'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

          The house is crammed with people following the service.
          Walt doesn't know what to do with himself. He has to
          keep busy. Steve steps over to his father.

          STEVE
          A lot of people showed up after
          the service.

          WALT
          Yeah, well, I s'pose they knew
          there'd be plenty of ham. I think
          I'll go downstairs and get some
          more chairs.

          STEVE
          I'll do it, Dad.

          WALT
          Naw, we need them now, not next
          week.

          INT. CELLAR - SAME TIME

          Grandsons JOSH, DANIEL and DAVID look through boxes in
          the cellar. A box of old Korea War photos are pawed
          through.

          Josh holds up a black-and-white PHOTO -- a young WALT
          looks utterly exhausted, behind him six bodies are
          sprawled dead on the ground.

          DAVID
          Is that Dad?

          DANIEL
          No, it's Grandpa Walt.
          Josh turns the photo over and reads it...

          JOSH
          Third Platoon, E company, March
          second, 1952, Korea.'

          DANIEL
          Where's Korea?

          JOSH
          Hell if I know?
          David holds up a MEDAL.

          DAVID
          Cool, I found a medal.
          They hear someone coming downstairs. By the time Walt
          descends the staircase, the boys sit on the couch,
          pretending to be doing nothing.
          Walt gives them a hard look as he grabs some chairs.

          People eat and chat. Ashley marches over to her parents,
          KAREN and Mitch.

          ASHLEY (GRANDDAUGHTER)
          How long do we have to stay, this
          ghetto is a dead zone for my cell
          and I'm bored.
          Walt stands behind them with an armful of folding chairs,
          he overheard his Granddaughter. Mitch and Karen are
          embarrassed.

          MITCH
          Ashley, honey. Why don't you help
          Grandpa Walt with the chairs?

          ASHLEY
          Me?

          KAREN
          Yes you.

          ASHLEY
          Grandpa Walt, can I help you with
          the chairs.

          WALT
          I'll take care of it, you just
          painted your nails.
          Walt opens the folding chairs and looks out the window.
          It's snowing. Walt puts on his coat, he almost looks
          relieved to get out of the house.

          WALT
          I'd better salt the sidewalk
          before someone falls and breaks a
          hip.
          Walt taps the floor with his boot and DAISY, his very,
          very, very old DOG follows him outside.

          Walt carefully shovels his sidewalk. He deliberately
          stops at the boundary of his property.
          The reason for this is that Walt's neighbors are now
          mostly Asians who moved into the house that once belonged
          to Polish families.
          Next door to Walt's house some sort of party is going on.
          Walt can see through the window that the living room is
          jammed with at least forty people, all Asians, all Hmong.
          And this is a problem for Walt, because Walt is a full-
          blown, unrepentant racist.
          Walt lights a cigarette and speaks to his dog, Daisy.

          WALT
          Jesus Christ, how many swamp rats
          can they cram into a living room?
          Walt spits in the snow and walks back to the garage.

          Walt steps inside and catches Ashley sneaking a
          cigarette. She has pulled back the canvas tarp that
          covers his pride and joy, his beloved 1972 GRAN TORINO.
          The Gran Torino is in mint condition. It has been babied
          since the day it rolled off the line.
          Ashley tosses her cigarette when she sees Grandpa Walt.

          ASHLEY
          Wow, Grandpa, when'd you get the
          vintage car?
          Walt looks at her for a second, then steps on her still
          burning cigarette before answering.

          WALT

          1972.

          ASHLEY
          I never knew you had a cool old
          car.

          WALT
          It's only been in here since
          before you were born.

          So, what are you like going to do
          with it like, when... you die?
          Walt lights up a smoke --

          WALT
          Jesus, Joseph and Mary.
          Walt pulls the cover back over the Gran Torino.

          ASHLEY
          Then what about that super cool
          retro couch in the den, I'm going
          to State next year and I don't
          have, like, any furniture?
          Walt walks out without commenting.

          8
          The doorbell rings and Walt opens the door. Standing
          there is TAO, a sixteen-year-old HMONG boy. Walt scowls.
          TAO is slight, he has long hair, long lashes, but is very
          good-looking -- like an Asian Johnny Depp.

          WALT
          Who the hell are you?

          TAO
          (very quietly)
          I'm Tao, I live next door.

          WALT
          What?! Speak up, boy, get the
          shit out of your mouth. What do
          you want?

          TAO
          Do you have jumper cables? My
          uncle's car is old and...

          WALT
          No. And have some goddamned
          respect, zipper head, we're
          mourning over here.
          Walt slams the door in Tao's face.
          Walt turns and is suddenly cornered by Father Janovich.
          Walt hates situations like this.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          How you holding up, Walt?

          WALT
          Mr. Kowalski.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Huh?

          WALT
          It's Mr. Kowalski, not Walt.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Right, Mr. Kowalski. Your wife
          and I became quite close these
          last few months. She asked that I
          watch over you when she passed on.
          I told her I watch out for my
          entire flock, but she made me
          promise I'd keep an extra sharp
          eye on you.

          WALT
          I appreciate your kindness to my
          wife and now that you've spoken
          your piece, why don't you move on
          to the next sheep?
          Walt starts to step away, but Father Janovich blocks him.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Dorothy mentioned specifically
          that it was her wish for you to go
          to confession. She said she
          couldn't remember the last time
          you went.

          WALT
          Is that so?

          FATHER JANOVICH
          It is.
          Walt drains his lowball glass.

          WALT
          Well, I confess I never much liked
          church and only went because of
          the wife. And I confess I have no
          desire to confess to a boy who is
          fresh out of the seminary.

          People are leaving Walt's house. A mass of shuffling,
          stiff-jointed old Pollacks.
          Right next door -- walking the opposite direction are
          more Hmong going up the sidewalk. They laugh and chatter
          and carry big dishes of food and fruit. They are a happy
          bunch compared to the dour crowd exiting Walt's home.
          The Hmong are going to a birth ceremony. A three-day-old
          baby is named and three souls are located for the
          newborn.

          CUT TO:

          ANOTHER ANGLE
          Walt leans over a car that contains two shivering old
          ladies from the funeral. He hooks up the jumper cables
          to their dead battery.
          Mitch, Karen, Ashley and Josh pull up next to Walt in a
          brand new Toyota Land Cruiser. Mitch opens the window.

          MITCH
          I'd really like to help, Dad, but
          we have to get the kids home,
          they're getting restless.
          Walt just looks at the TOYOTA EMBLEM on the Land Cruiser
          and then gives Mitch a disgusted glance.

          WALT
          Fine. Go.

          MITCH
          I'll call in a few, see how you're
          doing.
          Walt nods and lights a cigarette as they drive off.

          WALT
          Kill you to buy American.

          KAREN
          Well, what do you expect? The man
          worked at a Ford plant for twenty-

          Walt gets his guests' engine running.
          As they drive off, Walt hears faint SINGING. Walt looks
          into his neighbor's backyard and can't believe his eyes.
          The Hmong all sing and chant as three CHICKENS have their
          heads sliced off, right there in the yard.
          The chickens are held up and everyone chants louder.
          It's a sacrifice. Walt spits in the snow and says to
          Daisy.

          The house is a buzz of activity. The older Hmong speak
          their native language, the younger generation speaks both
          English and Hmong.
          (NOTE: Hmong is subtitled when necessary.)
          Tao's Grandmother (PHONG) complains to a MAN.

          PHONG

          (SUBTITLED)
          There's no man in this house,
          that's why my daughter should
          remarry. Being a second wife is
          better than having a woman be the
          head of the household. It's not
          our way.

          Look at him in the kitchen,
          washing dishes like a woman. Even
          his sister gives him orders and he
          obeys.
          The CAMERA PANS TO the kitchen where TAO washes a pile of
          dishes. An older relative drops dishes in the sink,
          without acknowledging Tao's presence. It's clearly an
          insult.
          In the LIVING ROOM the Hmong Soul Calling ceremony
          starts its next phase. An elder, the family SHAMAN, is
          present and begins the ritual.
          As the entire Hmong family gathers to watch. Tao slips
          on his coat and goes out the back door.

          from a shadow, JUMPER CABLES in his hands. They make eye
          contact as Tao passes.
          Walt spits in the snow and looks down at Daisy.

          WALT
          I thought these zips were supposed
          to be such hard workers. Christ,

          A few blocks away, Tao rides past a snowbank when --
          WHAM! A HOCKEY STICK is thrown through the spokes of his
          front wheel. Tao flies over the handlebars into the
          snow.
          A chorus of laughter is heard. Three LATINOS stand
          around the stunned, prone Tao.

          HEAD LATINO
          Whatta you gonna do, gook? You
          gonna Kung Fu' us?
          Tao just lies there as Latino #2 picks up his bike.

          LATINO #2
          Surprised it ain't a girl's bike.
          The Latinos laugh. Tao remains on the ground.

          You gonna get up or what?
          Tao doesn't move.

          the first swing. You drop me and
          you can have your bike back.
          Tao smiles, he can't help it.

          HEAD LATINO
          What the fuck you smiling at,
          gook? Something funny?
          He grabs Tao by the jacket and pulls him to his feet.

          HEAD LATINO
          You better get the fuck outta
          here, bitch.
          He pushes Tao backwards. Tao falls back into the snow.
          This time Tao crab-walks back away from the Latinos.
          The Latinos stroll away with Tao's bike.

          Walt looks around with disdain at his neighbors' houses.
          Walt's property is perfectly kept, whereas his neighbors'
          houses are rundown.
          Walt's eyes linger on every defect, gutter hangs, ripped
          screen doors, peeling paint. One neighbor has installed
          a chicken coop.
          Walt looks down at Daisy --

          WALT
          Damn chinks let their yards go to
          hell. Polarski would turn over in
          his grave if he could see what
          they did to his lawn.
          Tao walks past. Walt watches him pass.

          WALT
          I don't know why these goddamned
          slopes had to move to my block.
          This used to be a nice
          neighborhood.

          Tao nods to an older woman rocking in a broken rocking
          chair. PHONG nods back to Tao, then turns her evil eye
          back on Walt, whom she's been seething at all morning.

          PHONG

          (SUBTITLED)
          Why doesn't that stupid, hairy
          white man move? He must be too
          dumb to realize he's not welcome
          here. All the Mee-Khah left in
          the neighborhood should just move
          away. Look at him strut like a
          rooster.
          She sees Walt glance at her and spit. Phong glares back
          and spits beetle juice, which has turned her teeth black.

          Daisy snoozes next to the front door. The doorbell

          door holding a roll of duct tape. The doorbell rings
          again.

          Father Janovich.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Hi there, Walt.

          WALT
          Listen, son, you're not my barber,
          you're not a friend, so why in the
          hell do you think you can call me
          Walt?

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Sorry... Mr. Kowalski.

          WALT
          So, what are you peddling now?

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Oh, nothing. Thought I'd drop by
          and see how you were doing.
          Haven't seen you in church in
          awhile.

          WALT
          Okay. You've done your good deed,
          now why don't you run along.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I'd really like to talk, Mr.
          Kowalski.

          WALT
          I don't think so, kid. Sorry.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Why? Do you have a problem with
          me, Mr. Kowalski?

          WALT
          You don't want to know.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          No, I do.

          WALT
          The problem is I think you're an
          overeducated, 27-year-old virgin
          who holds the hands of
          superstitious old women and
          promises them eternity.

          Tao walks down the street, his head in a book. He
          finally realizes there's a blue Chevy following slowly
          behind him.
          The blue Chevy is now parallel with Tao and keeps pace
          with his step. Tao looks over to the occupants of the
          Chevy.
          It's two LATINOS. Tao quickens his pace, but the Chevy
          easily keeps up with Tao.

          LATINO DRIVER
          Is you a boy or a girl, I can't
          tell?

          LATINO #2
          What you reading, gook, Jackass
          And The Rice Stalk?
          Tao laughs, but keeps walking.

          LATINO DRIVER
          That's right, you keep walking.
          Fucking slopes everywhere you
          look, man. Why gooks come up in
          here and fuck up our neighborhood?
          Down the street -- is a suped-up HONDA CIVIC with a big
          SPOILER on the back. Inside are five Hmong gangbangers.
          The Hmong gangbangers notice Tao being followed by the
          Latinos. SPIDER, the driver, squints and then points at
          Tao.

          SPIDER
          Dude, that's my little cousin,
          Tao.

          SMOKIE
          You sure about that, Spider?

          SPIDER
          I'm sure. Do we do something...
          or what?
          Smokie is the gang leader. He looks at Tao for a second.

          SMOKIE
          Your cousin tight with anyone?

          Okay. Let's go help out our
          little cousin.
          Smokie nods to Spider, they roar up and stop right across
          from Tao and the Latinos' car.

          SMOKIE
          You better not be giving my bro
          here a hard time or you're gonna
          wish you never been born.

          LATINO DRIVER
          Oh goody, more Rice Niggers.
          The Latino Driver smiles and flashes a PISTOL.
          A Hmong kid in the back seat opens the door and displays
          a sub-machine gun. The Latinos are way out-gunned.

          LATINO #2
          Fucking Viet Cong swamp rats. Go
          back to your fucking rice paddy.
          The Latinos screech their tires and are gone. The Hmongs
          in the car smile and congratulate themselves.
          Tao simply keeps walking down the street!

          SMOKIE
          Where the fuck does he think he's
          going? Turn us around and go
          after that cousin of yours.
          They swing a U-turn and pull up to Tao, keeping pace with
          him as he walks.

          SPIDER
          Hey, cuz, slow down, where you
          going? You should really think
          about hanging with us, man. If we
          all stick together, shit like that
          won't happen, with those Spicks.
          Tao nods as he walks, but doesn't answer.

          SPIDER
          You can't be such a little girl.
          You join up with us, we'll keep
          you out of trouble, cuz.

          gangbanger in the back seat.
          Smokie takes this all in. He looks down the street and
          sees that in a half block, Tao will have to pass a group
          of Latino gangbanger types.

          You think about it and we'll see

          Tao digs in the garden. Tao's younger sister SUE sits
          and reads JANE magazine on the porch.
          The tricked-out Honda with Blue Neon lights pulls up.
          Spider, Smokie and two other Hmong gangbangers get out.

          SPIDER
          Hey, cuz. Hey, Sue.

          SUE
          What do you want?

          SPIDER
          Came to talk to my cousin Tao.
          Smokie looks over to Sue.

          SMOKIE
          Spider, who's the other cousin?
          SUE laughs at the name Spider. Sue is seventeen, has
          long straight hair with red highlights.

          SUE
          Spider'? Is that what he just
          called you, Fong?

          SPIDER
          This is my little cousin, Sue.
          Smokie takes off his sunglasses and smiles at Sue.

          SMOKIE
          Hey, Sue... how old are you, girl?

          Mentally, I'm way too old for you.

          SUE
          Yeah, that's exactly what I'm
          doing, Fong.
          Sue rolls her eyes and goes inside. Smokie stares at
          Tao.

          SPIDER
          You think about what we talked
          about?
          A PAUSE. Smokie watches Tao carefully, offers him a
          cigarette. Tao shakes his head no and looks at the
          ground.

          SMOKIE
          That's exactly the point, Tao.
          Spider told me how everyone thinks
          you're a pushover, how everybody
          walks all over you and shit. I
          mean, look at you, out here
          working in the garden like a
          woman.
          Tao nods silently, but still looks at the ground.

          SMOKIE
          It ain't no big thing. You just
          need a little guidance.
          Tao looks up at Smokie. Tao looks a little skeptical.

          SMOKIE
          It's true, man. Shit, I used to
          be kind of a quiet little punk
          like you, everybody fucking with
          me. But finally I said no more.'
          You, you're lucky, Tao, we got
          your back. Me? I didn't have
          nobody. Had to mold my own tribe.

          SPIDER
          Smokie's right. We're family,
          right? You with us or what?

          SMOKIE
          I swear, brother, we're the best
          friends you'll ever have. And
          anyone fucks with you, they're
          fucked.

          I'm a priest.

          WALT
          You stand at the altar and preach
          on and on about life and death
          without knowing anything other
          than what you learned in priest
          school. Everything you say sounds

          Death is bittersweet? Bitter in
          the pain, sweet in the salvation.'
          That's what you know of life and
          death? Good God, it's pathetic.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          What do you know, Mr. Kowalski?

          WALT
          Plenty. I lived with death for
          three years in Korea. We shot
          people, we stabbed them with
          bayonets, we hacked seventeen-year-
          old kids to death with shovels,
          for Christ's sake. I did things
          that won't leave me till the day I
          die, horrible things, things I
          have to live with.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          And what about life?
          Walt has to think for a second. He struggles with his
          answer.

          WALT
          Well... I survived the war... got

          had plenty to drink at the VFW.

          WALT
          Daisy?
          The dog sleeps in her bed in the corner. Walt looks at
          the clock; it's 3:48 am.
          Walt looks out his bedroom window. He sees the faint
          beam of a flashlight in his garage.

          WALT
          Son of a bitch.
          Walt pulls on his robe, opens the closet and pulls out
          the big, 30-06 M1 Garand Rifle he took home from Korea.
          Walt slides a magazine into the top of the M1 and
          chambers a round with a loud SNAP.

          INT. GARAGE - SECONDS LATER

          The light flips on and before he can blink, Tao is face
          to face with the barrel of Walt's M1 RIFLE.
          Walt is silent, he has one eye closed so he can better
          aim at Tao's forehead -- which is nine inches away. Tao
          drops the tool he was holding, it bounces with a loud
          metallic clang.
          Tao backs away, his eyes wide with terror. As Tao backs
          up, Walt advances, step for step.
          Tao trips over a garden hose, which causes Walt to trip.
          They both start to fall. The lightbulb is bumped with
          the rifle barrel and swings back and forth.
          As Walt hits the garage floor, he accidentally FIRES THE
          RIFLE. The bullet goes through a big, metal Hamm's Beer
          sign on the wall.
          Tao scrambles to his feet and jumps like a deer over
          Walt. Tao runs out of the garage and into the night.
          Walt lies on the floor for a second, stunned. Sweat runs
          down his forehead. He coughs up blood. The lightbulb
          still swings, casting odd shadows in the garage.

          WALT
          Shit.

          Tao scrambles down the alley. Parked off to the side is
          Spider's Honda. Spider opens the door.

          SPIDER
          Get in, get in!
          Tao runs right past him. Spider guns the motor and pulls
          in front of Tao. Smokie, Spider and another gangbanger
          get out.

          No way. No fucking way. Leave me
          alone!
          Smokie, Spider and the other gangbanger grab Tao.

          SPIDER
          I vouched for you, Tao, because
          you're family and you're with us
          now.
          Tao struggles.

          TAO
          He shot at me! I'm out! I'm
          out!!!
          Tao squirms out of Smokie's grasp. Smokie yells at Tao
          as he runs away...

          SMOKIE
          Don't fool yourself, Tao. You
          don't join us and bail. Dumb
          motherfucker.

          SPIDER
          Should we go after him?

          SMOKIE
          Naw, he's got nowhere to go.
          Let's get out of here.

          Walt drills heavy-gauge screen mesh over the windows on
          the garage. The phone rings and Walt answers.

          WALT
          Hello?

          MITCH (V.O.)
          Morning, Dad, it's your number one
          son, Mitch.

          WALT
          It's one in the afternoon.
          The CAMERA now INTERCUTS BETWEEN Walt and Mitch in the
          kitchen of his huge, modern suburban house.

          Right, good afternoon, then.

          WALT
          So, what do you want?

          MITCH
          Me? Nothing. What would I want?

          WALT
          I don't know. Your wife already
          went through all of your mother's
          jewelry.

          MITCH
          No. I was just wondering how you
          are, what's going on, anything new
          in the old neighborhood?
          Walt looks at the bullet hole in his Hamm's Beer sign.

          WALT
          Nope.

          MITCH
          Great. Smooth sailing then?

          WALT
          Yup.
          There's a very painful pause in the conversation.

          MITCH
          Well good... Say, Dad?

          WALT
          Uh-huh.

          MITCH
          Do you still know that guy from
          the plant who has Viking season
          tickets?

          Walt has parked the Gran Torino at an angle across his
          driveway. Walt mutters as he rubs Turtle Wax on his car.

          It's stunning. It absolutely sparkles. The chrome
          shines, the tires look new and the paint is waxed and
          polished.
          Walt looks up again and his eyes sweep the neighborhood
          in defiance. A couple of Hmong teenagers look at the
          car.

          WALT

          (MUTTERS)
          That's right, ain't she pretty.
          Walt drops down heavily into an old lawn chair and pops
          open a can of Pabst.

          Dusk is falling. Walt finally gets up, folds up his lawn
          chair and walks stiffly back into the garage.
          Walt flips on the outdoor light, highlighting the Gran
          Torino still sitting at an angle in the driveway. The
          whole scene looks like a mid-sixties car ad in Popular
          Mechanics.
          Walt goes in the back door and a moment later the kitchen
          light comes on. The Gran Torino remains in the driveway.
          It's a challenge, an invitation. Walt is daring the
          thief to come back. And Walt's ready this time.

          29
          The tricked-out Honda drives up, but doesn't stop at
          Walt's. It pulls up in front of Tao's house. Tao and
          Sue exchange looks out on the front step.
          Smokie, Spider and two others get out, walking
          confidently up the sidewalk towards them. They grin,
          they're cocky.

          SPIDER
          Hey, cuz. What's up?

          TAO
          What are you doing here?

          We're giving you another shot.

          TAO
          I don't think so.

          SMOKIE
          You blew it the first time. We've
          got another little inauguration
          planned for you. This time
          there'll be no mistakes.

          SUE
          Another big, tough gangbanger with
          little-man' complex.
          Smokie leers at Sue. It makes her uncomfortable.

          SMOKIE
          I got my eye on you too, little
          girl.

          SUE
          Whatever.

          SMOKIE
          Come on, Tao. Let's go.
          Tao says nothing. He looks at the ground.

          SPIDER
          He said, let's go.

          SMOKIE
          Come on, man. Nobody's gonna get
          hurt. We'll take care of you.

          SUE
          Don't go, Tao.

          You mind your own business, girl.
          Two Hmong gangbangers grab Tao by the arms.
          The front door swings open and there stands a glaring
          Phong.

          than you. You always let little
          girls and old ladies fight for
          you?
          Tao tries to squirm away. Smokie grabs him by the hair
          and opens his coat to reveal the PISTOL in his belt.

          SMOKIE
          I'm not gonna say it again. Let's
          go. Now.
          Tao is shoved towards the car.
          Suddenly -- Sue jumps on the back of one of the
          gangbangers and knocks him to the ground. Tao breaks
          free.

          SUE
          Run, Tao, run!
          Sue is slapped to the ground.

          SUE

          RUN!!
          Tao is tackled by Smokie and punched in the face. Tao's
          mother comes out the front door.
          Smokie and Spider pull Tao towards the car as the other
          gangbangers keep Mom, Grandma and Sue at bay.
          A middle-aged Hmong Man from across the street comes into
          the yard. All the gangbangers overreact and pull their
          pistols. The middle-aged Hmong Man gets in Spider's face
          and is cracked across the jaw with a pistol barrel.
          Tao back-pedals away from Spider and Smokie. It becomes
          a pushing, rolling, surging melee.

          Walt's calm demeanor is unnerving to the gangbangers.
          The guns in their hands seem tiny compared to the big
          military rifle Walt holds.

          Are you fucking crazy? Go back in

          Believe me, kid, I'll blow your

          Coming down the alley is another Hmong couple, they smile
          carrying a basket filled with Asian vegetables.

          No. No more.

          Tao, his mother and Sue argue in the yard. They gesture

          Walt turns on his heels and storms into his house.

          The doorbell rings. Walt opens it to find Father
          Janovich standing on his front step.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Good afternoon, Walt.
          Walt's eyes narrow.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I mean, Mr. Kowalski.

          WALT
          I already told you I'm not going
          to confession.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Why didn't you just call the
          police?

          WALT
          Pardon?

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I do work with some of the Hmong
          gangs and I heard there was some
          trouble in the neighborhood. Why
          didn't you call the police?

          WALT
          Oh, I prayed for them to show up,
          but guess what? No answer.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          What were you thinking? Someone
          could have been killed. We're
          talking life and death here.

          WALT
          Not that it's any of your
          goddamned business, but when
          things happen quickly like that,
          you have to react. In Korea, we
          never called the police' when a
          swarm of screaming gooks came
          pouring into our lines. We
          reacted.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          We're not in Korea, Mr. Kowalski.
          Walt says nothing.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I've been thinking about our
          discussion on life and death.
          About what you said. About how
          you carry around the horrible
          things you were forced to do.
          Horrible things that won't leave
          you. It seems that it would do
          you good to unload some of that
          burden. Things done during war
          are terrible, being ordered to
          kill, killing to save others,
          killing to save yourself. You're
          right, those are things I don't
          know anything about. But I do
          know about forgiveness. And I've
          seen a lot of men who have
          confessed their sins, admitted
          their guilt and left their burdens
          behind them. Stronger men than
          you. Men at war who were ordered
          to do appalling things and are now
          at peace.
          Walt nods. Father Janovich threw a bull's-eye. Almost.

          WALT
          I'm impressed. You came with your
          guns loaded, for once.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Thank you.

          WALT
          You have balls, Father. And what
          you said, you're right. I'm sure
          stronger men than me have found
          their salvation. Hallelujah. But
          there's one thing you're way wrong
          about.

          stuff he wasn't ordered to do.

          The old, balding BARBER finishes cutting Walt's hair.

          BARBER
          There, you look like a human being
          again. You shouldn't wait so long
          between haircuts, you cheap
          bastard.

          WALT
          I'm just amazed that you're still
          alive. I keep hoping you'll die
          and they'll get someone good in
          here, but you just hang in there,
          you dumb, Italian-Wop-Dago, you.

          BARBER
          That'll be ten dollars, Walt.

          WALT
          Ten dollars? Jesus Christ,
          Martin, you keep raising the
          price. You sure you're not part
          Jew?
          Martin the Barber laughs at Walt.

          BARBER
          It's been ten bucks for the last
          five years and you know it, you
          thick-skulled, old Pollack son of
          a bitch.

          WALT
          Here's ten, keep the change.

          BARBER
          See you in three weeks, you prick.

          WALT
          If you live that long, dipshit.
          Walt and Martin shake hands and Walt walks out.

          Walt gets in his old Ford pickup and drives off. This is
          a very bad, rundown neighborhood.

          Sue walks with her ridiculous Wigger (urban white kid)
          boyfriend, TREY. Trey wears big baggy pants, a sports
          jersey and an Oakland Raiders visor upside-down and
          backwards.
          They walk past three BLACK GUYS leaning against a
          building. The TALL BLACK GUY spots Sue and smiles.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          Hey, girl, you come over here and
          talk to me. Come on, baby, don't
          be shy.
          Trey and Sue move as far over on the sidewalk as they can
          to avoid the black guys. They try to ignore them.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          Come on, sweetie, don't be like
          that. You talk to me, don't be
          all stuck up and shit.

          ACROSS THE STREET
          Walt waits at a stoplight. He watches Sue and Trey and
          the three black guys who block their path.
          One black guy flips Trey's VISOR onto the ground. The
          Tall Guy makes kissy faces at Sue as he touches his
          crotch.
          Walt sits there for a second; he shouldn't help, but Walt
          solves every situation by being aggressive.
          Walt drives off, then makes a U-turn.
          The Tall Black Guy now focuses on Trey.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          What are you sposed to be?
          Trey puts up his hand to hi-five. The Tall Black Guy
          just looks at him.

          Nothing. We're going to Red Roost
          to get some CDs. That place is
          trippin', bro.

          TALL BLACK GUY

          Great, another asshole with a
          fetish for Asian girls. God, it
          gets so old.

          My name? It's take your crude,

          That's my name.

          You should keep your bitch on a
          leash, put a choke chain on this
          whore and yank.

          SUE
          Oh, of course, right to the
          stereotype thesaurus. Call me
          whore' and bitch' in the same

          The Tall Black Guy grabs Sue by the arm. Trey moves
          slightly towards Sue and is pushed down into a pile of
          garbage.

          TALL BLACK GUY
          You think you're pretty funny,

          slowly walking across the street
          or harassing women. Nobody owes

          But you might just be dumb enough
          not to recognize that your luck

          written in a woman's cursive style and with the same pen.
          Mitch slides a wrapped gift across the table to Walt.

          MITCH
          Go ahead, Dad. Open it.

          WALT
          What is it?

          MITCH
          Just open it.
          Walt opens the package, it's a Gopher Reaching Tool --
          the kind that has an alligator clamp so you can pick up
          objects that have fallen behind the stove, etc.
          Walt looks at his son and daughter-in-law.

          MITCH
          It's a Gopher. It's so you can
          reach stuff. You know, it makes
          things easier.

          KAREN
          Here's one from me.
          KAREN slides over a another wrapped gift. Walt opens it.
          It's a PHONE with really big numbers for old people.

          (EMOTIONLESSLY)
          Thank you, Karen.

          KAREN
          I just thought... we thought that
          it would... make things easier.

          WALT
          Yeah, I see that.

          KAREN
          There's nothing wrong with making
          things less hard on yourself.

          MITCH
          Karen's right, Dad. You've worked
          hard your whole life. Maybe you
          should think about taking it a
          little easier?
          Walt lights up a cigarette.

          MITCH
          And that's another thing, Dad.
          You should get rid of the coffin
          nails.
          Walt says nothing.

          MITCH
          And the house, now that Mom's
          gone, it's got to be a lot to
          maintain, let alone clean... and
          you're all alone in here.
          It's worse than Walt thought. He puffs smoke.

          KAREN
          There's these great places now,
          these communities where you don't
          have to worry about mowing the
          lawn or shoveling snow. People
          who are like you, alert, active,
          but are alone and would benefit by
          being with other folks their own
          age.

          Mitch and Karen storm out to their Land Cruiser. Mitch
          carries the Gopher Grabber Tool and Karen has the big
          numbered phone in her hand.

          MITCH
          I told you, I told you this was a
          bad idea.

          KAREN
          I know, you were right.

          MITCH
          Son of a bitch! He just won't let
          anyone help him.

          KAREN
          Well, we tried. Now we can just
          drop it. No one can say we didn't
          try.

          MITCH
          To hell with him, kicking us out
          on his birthday?! We should've
          stayed home with Ashley and Josh.
          They knew better, they wouldn't
          even come. The goddamned kids are
          smarter than we are!
          Mitch screeches the tires as they take off. Walt waits
          for them to clear out, before coming out on the porch
          with a can of Pabst.
          Daisy comes out and lies at his feet.
          Walt covers his mouth as he coughs. A dime-sized circle
          of dark, red blood is left in the palm of his hand.
          Walt looks at the blood as he takes another sip of beer.

          Sue comes out and helps the Hmong women unload big
          platters of food and carry them to the house.
          Sue catches Walt's gaze and steps over to his porch.

          SUE
          Hey, Walt, what are you up to?
          Walt points his index finger at the can of Pabst in his
          hand.

          We're having a barbecue. You want

          There's tons of food.

          Walt looks in the refrigerator, Sue looks over his
          shoulder.

          WALT
          You do have a lot of beer, but no
          Pabst.

          Ha ha. Are you sure it's okay I'm

          me and when I look back, they look
          at the ground.

          A lot of the people in this house
          are very traditional. Number one,
          never touch a Hmong person on the
          head, not even a child. Hmong
          people believe that the soul
          resides in the head, so don't do
          that.

          WALT
          That's dumb, but fine.

          SUE
          Hmong people also consider looking
          someone in the eye to be rude.
          That's why everyone looks away
          when you look at them.

          WALT
          Swell. Anything else?

          SUE
          Yeah, some Hmong smile or grin
          when they're yelled at or get into
          a confrontation. It's a cultural
          thing. It expresses embarrassment
          or insecurity, not that they're

          Something like that. The Hmong
          hold their clan Shaman in very
          high regards.

          Boo-ga, boo-ga.
          Kor Khue says something to Sue in Hmong. She turns and
          translates to Walt.

          SUE
          Kor Khue is interested in you, he
          heard what you did. He says he
          would like to read you.

          He wants to read you. Tell you

          Sue speaks Hmong to the Shaman. The Shaman responds and
          sits down across from Walt. He looks at Walt for a long
          time.
          Walt stares straight back at him. The Shaman mumbles to
          himself.
          Finally the Shaman turns to Sue and speaks very rapidly.

          Kor Khue says that you think
          you've been disrespected. You do
          not live your life. Your food has

          Yeah, Toad.
          Tao is in the corner, he avoids Walt's gaze. Sue walks
          over to a group of boys, leaving Walt alone.
          Walt doesn't know what to do with himself. He leans
          against the DRYER. The DRYER wobbles.
          Walt gets on his hands and knees. He looks under the
          dryer. He adjusts the short leg to balance out the
          machine.
          He just can't help it.
          All the Hmong kids watch Walt, trying not to laugh at
          this strange white man on his hands and knees fixing a
          dryer during a party. Walt looks up -- deer in the
          headlights.

          It was wobbly, but I fixed it.

          WALT
          Alright.
          Sue walks off. Walt sips his rice liquor and watches the
          interaction between the boys and girls.
          One particularly gorgeous young willow-wisp of a GIRL
          stares across the room at Tao. Tao looks back at her,
          but then looks away.
          The Girl keeps looking at Tao, smiling and twisting her
          hair.
          Tao doesn't approach her, but three other young men do.
          They do their best to charm her. She's polite, but not
          interested, she keeps looking at Tao.
          Walt laughs at Tao's ineptitude, shakes his head at this
          wasted opportunity. Suddenly the Girl steps over to
          Walt.
          She smiles --

          WA XAM (GIRL)
          My friends and I were just
          wondering what you're doing here?

          WALT
          Good question. What am I doing
          here? Anyways, I'm Walt.

          WA XAM
          Hi, Walt. I'm Wa Xam.

          WALT
          Wa Yum?

          WA XAM
          No, Wa Xam. So... what do you do?

          WALT
          Me? Not too much... I fix stuff I
          guess.

          WA XAM
          Like what?

          WALT
          Well, I fixed my wife's friend's
          sink yesterday.

          That's one thing I've never been

          She laughs at Walt butchering her name and goes upstairs.
          The three young suitors follow her up. Tao watches her.
          Walt comes over to Tao, who is startled. Walt laughs.

          Relax, zipper head, whatta you
          think I'm gonna do, shoot you?
          Tao looks like he wants to run away.

          WALT
          I wouldn't say anything either, if
          I was you.
          Walt sips his rice liquor. Walt can't help but rib Tao.

          WALT
          You know, I knew you were a
          dipshit even before the whole
          garage deal, but I have to say
          you're even worse with women than
          you are stealing cars, Toad.

          TAO
          It's Tao.

          What's that?

          TAO

          know I'm not always the most
          pleasant person to be around, but
          I got the greatest woman who ever
          lived to marry me. I had to work

          come over, each carrying a FLOWER BOUQUET.

          WALT
          No. No thanks. No more flowers.
          The elderly Hmong Women nod and speak rapid sentences in
          Hmong to Walt. He has no idea what they are saying.

          WALT
          No more. Please, keep your
          flowers.
          The Hmong women nod, smile and chatter away, ignoring
          Walt. They walk past him and set the BOUQUETS on his
          porch.

          What now, Gee?
          Gee holds up a plate covered with tinfoil.

          stuff.

          Vu rambles on in Hmong. Walt looks at his watch. He
          looks at Sue for the translation.

          SUE
          Tao is here to make amends, he's
          here to work for you.

          WALT
          No he's not.

          SUE
          Mother says that Tao dishonored
          the family and now he has to work
          off his debt. He'll start
          tomorrow morning.

          WALT
          No. The kid is useless, I don't
          even want him on my property. I
          thought we already went over that.

          SUE
          It's very important to my mother
          that you accept. It'd be an
          insult to refuse.

          WALT
          How is this all of a sudden turned
          around on me? The goddamned kid
          tries to steal my car and somehow
          I'm the bad guy if I don't accept?

          Come on, Sue. If he doesn't want
          to, let's just go.
          Sue and Vu yell at Tao to shut up at the same time; Sue
          in English, Vu in Hmong.

          SUE/VU
          Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!!
          Tao looks at the ground.
          A PAUSE. Walt sees the earnest looks on the Hmong
          women's faces. Their expression begs Walt.
          Walt gazes back at Tao. Walt looks disgusted, he exhales
          loudly...

          Fine. Great. Tomorrow.

          As Walt waits, names are called out such as Alvarez,
          Ngaima, Yang and Abdalla.
          Finally when the name Kowalski is called, the Muslim
          woman can't pronounce it correctly. Walt winces.

          A short Asian man in a doctor's smock comes in with a
          chart.

          ASIAN DOCTOR
          Mr. Kowalski?

          WALT
          That's right.

          ASIAN DOCTOR
          Good afternoon. I looked over
          your paperwork and I think we
          should immediately start on a full
          battery of tests. I feel that
          this...

          ASHLEY
          It's Grandpa Walt.

          KAREN
          Well, pick it up.

          You talk to him.

          MITCH
          I'm doing bills here.

          KAREN
          He's your father.
          Ashley hands him the phone and he pushes the TALK button.

          and Walt sitting on the edge of his bed.

          Um... not much, how about you?

          I'm fine, fine.

          There is a long, uncomfortable pause. Walt looks at some
          Xeroxed medical pamphlets scattered on his bed.

          MITCH
          Good.

          Well, that's good... How's...
          work?

          Right. I s'pose.

          MITCH
          Speaking of busy, I have a lot on
          my plate right now, unless there's
          something pressing.
          Walt looks at a pale, blue pamphlet. Mitch looks at his
          housekeeping bill.

          No. Nope.
          Another pause.

          WALT
          Okay then.

          MITCH
          Okay. Yeah, so it's not a good
          time right now. Why don't you
          call me over the weekend.

          WALT
          Sure.

          MITCH
          Okay, it was nice talking to you,

          While Walt fills a bird feeder, he notices Tao next door.
          Tao stands, tiptoed on the top of a six-foot ladder,
          trying to cut a high branch with a pole saw.
          Walt shakes his head and walks over to Tao.

          WALT
          Hey, moron.
          Tao is startled and almost falls off the ladder.

          TAO
          What?

          WALT
          I appreciate you're doing
          something on your own, but you're
          the only person I know dumb enough
          to get himself killed trimming
          tree branches.

          TAO
          What now?

          WALT
          You don't stand on the top step of
          a ladder and if you cut through
          that branch you're hacking away
          at, you'll end up kaput.
          Tao looks and sure enough -- a thick, black POWER LINE is
          five feet below the branch he's almost severed.

          WALT
          Go grab the extension ladder from
          my garage and I'll show you how to
          do it right, zipper head.

          Tao ties up bundles of branches and twigs. Walt lights a
          cigarette, looks up in the tree and nods.

          WALT
          Looks good. Good job.
          Tao nods.

          Make sure you put the ladder back
          when you're done raking up the
          leaves.

          TAO
          I know. I will.
          Walt walks back over to his porch, grabs a Pabst from the
          cooler and watches Tao rake.
          A white Honda turns the corner and drives slowly past
          Tao.
          Smokie and Spider smile menacingly at Tao as they pass.

          WALT
          This kid doesn't have a chance.
          The Honda now slowly passes Walt's house. Walt just
          stands there, sipping his beer.
          The Honda slows to a stop and the gangbangers glare at
          Walt.
          The REAR WINDOW of the Honda opens.
          Walt holds out his RIGHT HAND like a GUN. He closes one
          eye to better aim his imaginary gun and moves his thumb
          several times as if firing. Bang -- bang -- bang.
          The Honda takes off. Walt watches it drive off and
          lights another cigarette.
          Walt doesn't notice, but Tao witnessed this whole
          interaction from his yard.

          his pockets. He's a bit apprehensive.

          TAO
          What do you know about faucets?

          For the love of Pete.

          TAO
          What?

          WALT
          It must be a hundred degrees in
          here, turn on the fan.
          Tao flips the switch on the CEILING FAN, the fan wobbles
          and shakes, it looks like it's about to fly off.
          Walt stares up at the fan and shakes his head.

          Where the hell do you think I got
          them, Toad? This may come as a
          shock to a thief, but I actually
          bought the things I have with
          money I earned.

          TAO
          Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's not what

          shit packed in here.

          WALT
          Post hole digger.
          Tao starts pointing at things on the workbench in quick
          succession, questioning Walt with his expression.

          WALT
          Hand spade. Tin snips. Nail
          punch. Tack hammer. Putty knife.
          Wire stripper. Drywall saw. Tile
          spacers.
          Silence. Walt can see something is bothering Tao, but
          he's too uncomfortable to speak up --

          WALT
          What?

          TAO
          I can't afford to buy all this
          stuff.

          WALT
          I didn't buy all this stuff at
          once, blockhead. I've lived here
          for fifty years. A man stays in
          one place long enough he tends to
          attract a decent set of tools.

          TAO
          Yeah, but...

          WALT
          Look, kid, I think I know where
          you're going with this. You don't
          need everything to maintain a
          house. I'm going to let you in on
          a little secret.
          Walt rattles around his tool bench and slaps down THREE
          items in quick succession.

          WALT
          This is for you. Roll of duct
          tape, can of WD-40 and a pair of
          vise-grips. Any man who's worth a
          shit can do half his household
          jobs with these three things. In
          the odd chance that doesn't work
          out, you can borrow something.

          the spot of BLOOD in his hand.

          TAO

          That's not good, you should see a
          doctor.

          screws that hold the fan blade to the motor hub.

          WALT
          So... what exactly was the deal
          with those guys out on my lawn
          that night? Who are they?

          TAO
          A gang. Hmong gangbangers.

          WALT
          I gathered that. What did they
          want with you?

          TAO
          They wanted to take me away
          because I blew my first
          initiation.

          You joined up with those pukes?
          Damn, you are a pussy. Why in the
          hell did you do that?

          TAO
          I don't know. They were
          persuasive. My cousin's in the
          gang. They just talked me into it
          I guess.

          WALT

          it.

          WALT
          Naw, I got it.

          TAO
          No really, I'll take the top. It
          looks pretty heavy.

          WALT
          I'm not crippled. I got it.

          TAO
          If you don't let me take the top,
          I ain't helping. I'll go home.

          WALT
          Listen, zipper head, now's not the
          time to go and...

          TAO
          You listen, old man. You came and
          got me because you needed help, so
          let me help you. Either it's top
          or I'm out of here.
          Walt studies Tao for a second. Tao doesn't blink, he
          holds his ground. Walt nods, trying not to grin.

          Tao and Walt ease the freezer down the back steps and
          pause to take a break. They both breathe hard.

          TAO
          That thing weighs a ton.

          WALT
          Yeah, but it runs like new. They
          don't make them like that anymore.

          TAO
          What are you going to do with it?

          washes and waxes the Gran Torino in Walt's driveway.
          Sue laughs and shakes her head.

          SUE
          Kind of ironic, huh?

          What?

          SUE
          What the hell do you think I'm
          referring to? Toad washing the
          car he tried to steal from you.

          WALT
          It seems like justice to me. And
          if he misses a spot, he's doing it
          all over.

          SUE
          It's nice of you to kind of look
          after him like this. He doesn't
          have any real role models in his
          life.

          WALT
          I ain't a role model.

          SUE
          You're a good man, Wally. I wish
          our dad would have been more like
          you.

          WALT
          Don't call me Wally.

          SUE
          No, I'm serious. He was hard on
          us, really traditional, really old
          school.

          WALT
          I'm old school.

          Yeah, but you're American.

          you teach him how to fix things

          And you're a good man.

          WALT
          So tell me the problem with Hmong
          boys again. I'm not completely
          clear.

          SUE
          Hmong girls slip in and out of the
          culture more easily. Date who we
          want, stay close to our mothers,
          but are able to keep a foot on
          each side of the fence. The boys
          fall through the cracks.

          WALT
          Why?

          SUE
          It's tough. The boys float
          around. The fathers belong in a
          totally different world and the
          boys have no one to turn to. Does
          that make sense?

          WALT
          Not sure. No.

          SUE
          The boys don't ask their fathers
          for advice, because over here,
          their fathers no longer have the
          answers.

          from there.

          boys go to jail.

          gardening to be women's work.

          WALT
          Is that why I see you out in your
          garden all the time? Besides,
          zipper head, we ain't in Hu-Mong.

          TAO
          Funny.
          Walt lights a cigarette.

          You should quit those. It's bad

          So, you ever think about what you
          want to do with your life?

          TAO
          I don't know.

          WALT
          You've never thought about it?

          TAO
          Of course I have.

          WALT
          Well, while you're thinking about
          it, try not to stomp all over my
          chives, you dipshit.
          Tao looks down; sure enough, he's standing on Walt's
          chives.

          TAO
          Sorry.

          WALT
          Put some mulch around the
          cucumbers.
          Tao spreads more mulch.

          save instead of spreading mulch in

          have to get your shit together.

          Yeah, yeah.

          WALT
          No, not yeah, yeah. Yes, as in
          yes, sir, I'll do my best.

          TAO
          Yes, I'll do my best.

          WALT
          You better, because when I vouch
          for someone, it's my word and I
          don't want anyone making me look
          bad.

          TAO
          No, I'm good. I'm totally into
          this.

          WALT
          And don't lay down to people all
          the time. Always look a person in
          the eye. When you shake a man's
          hand, you can usually tell where
          you stand with him.
          Walt hands a pair of beat-up WORK GLOVES to Tao.

          Here, stuff these in your back
          pocket.

          Kennedy, you drunken Irish goon,
          how the hell are ya?

          KENNEDY
          Shitty, but who's gonna listen?

          WALT
          Not me.
          Walt pours himself a cup of the bad job-site coffee.

          KENNEDY
          Help yourself, Walt, you dumb
          Pollack.

          WALT
          I already did. This is the kid I
          told you about. Tao, this is Tim
          Kennedy, he's the super on the

          What do we got, Walt?

          WALT
          He's done construction here and
          there. Whatever you need, he'll
          pick it up quick.

          KENNEDY
          You sure?

          Sure.

          I just replaced the tranny in my
          Tahoe and the sons a bitches
          fucked me hard, just under $3200.

          A PAUSE. Walt puts out his HAND to Tao. Tao extends his
          and they SHAKE HANDS.

          Come on, what do you guys want
          with me?

          SMOKIE
          Jesus Christ, Tao. What do you
          think? I've been sooooo easy on
          you, but I can't just go on like
          nothing happened.

          TAO
          You can't just leave me alone?

          SMOKIE
          Afraid not.
          The gangbangers grab Tao. Tao kicks and struggles as
          they yank away his tool belt.

          TAO
          Keep your hands off my stuff.

          SMOKIE
          Your stuff? You and everything
          you have is mine. I own you.
          Smokie pulls the tape measure off the belt and smashes it
          against the pavement. Whatever tools Smokie can't
          destroy, he tosses onto the roof of the closest building.

          SMOKIE
          You can't just walk away from us,
          Tao. It looks bad. It makes me
          look bad.
          Smokie lights a CIGARETTE and exhales...

          SMOKIE
          What's the phrase I'm looking for?
          Oh yeah, I need to save face.'
          Smokie grabs Tao by the neck and presses the lit
          CIGARETTE into Tao's cheek.

          movement.
          It's a cat. Walt puts his pistol away. Smokie exhales.

          WALT
          It's just you and me. Nobody
          knows or has to know I was here.
          You lay off Tao. Tell your guys
          he ain't worth it or whatever the
          hell you want. You don't talk to
          him, you don't go near him. This
          is your one chance. You lay off
          and no one will ever be the wiser.
          Smokie says nothing.

          I'll take that as a yes. I don't
          want to come back here. But if I
          do, believe me, it'll be goddamned

          Sure. Why not.

          TAO
          Really?
          Walt smiles.

          WALT
          Really.
          They shake hands.

          Walt watches baseball. He hears a car outside. Shouts
          are heard and glass breaks.
          Walt gets up and looks out the shades...
          TAO'S HOUSE is raked with GUNFIRE coming from a VAN!
          Windows shatter and the siding splinters.
          FIFTY BULLETS shake the house before the VAN peels off.

          Walt is up their front steps and in the house in seconds.
          Walt goes from room to room, from Vu to Phong finally to
          Tao -- making sure no one's been hit.

          WALT
          Is everyone okay? Is anyone hit?
          Sue? Vu? Tao, where's Tao?
          Tao sits up from behind the couch. Blood pours down his
          neck. He's stunned.

          WALT
          Oh no.
          Walt lays Tao down and rips open the collar of his shirt.
          Walt probes around Tao's neck.

          TAO
          Is everybody else okay?

          WALT
          Yeah.
          Walt looks around at the BULLET HOLES in the walls. Tao
          follows his gaze.

          TAO
          It's a miracle no one was killed.

          WALT
          They aimed high.
          Sure enough -- most of the bullet holes are above head
          level on the walls.

          WALT
          Where's Sue?

          TAO
          She went to our aunt's.

          WALT
          Call her.

          TAO
          What?

          WALT
          I said call her. Get the
          goddamned phone and call and see
          if she's there.
          Tao scrambles for the phone and dials.
          Tao speaks Hmong to whomever answered. Tao starts to
          speak faster. He looks at Walt and shakes his head no.
          For once -- Vu and Phong understand what Walt was talking
          about. There is anguish on every face in the room.

          Walt sits across from Tao, drinking rice liquor. Walt
          speaks loudly, without any consideration for Phong who
          shoots him dirty looks.

          WALT
          This is exactly what I didn't
          want. Damn gooks. Why the hell
          am I even here?

          TAO
          Maybe one of her friends called
          and she just changed plans.
          Walt sips the rice liquor. Walt now speaks quietly to
          Tao.

          WALT
          In Korea I learned not to care.
          The best friends of my life are
          still missing somewhere in Korea.
          You harden yourself. Don't let
          anything get to you.
          Phong looks out the window and screams. She runs over
          and swings open the door.
          Everyone expects the worst...
          And it comes like a cold wind -- SUE WALKS IN LIKE A
          ZOMBIE. She has been brutally beaten. Her clothes are
          dirty and torn.
          BLOOD runs down SUE'S legs from under her shirt.
          Walt looks at her and the glass falls from his hand.
          Sue staggers into Vu's arms. Vu weeps. Sue hugs her
          mother and sobs.
          Tao reaches to hug his sister, but Phong screeches at
          him, pointing at Walt and back to Tao.
          Walt is destroyed. He steps outside into the dark.

          Walt bursts in the door, throws himself in an easy chair
          and CRIES. He tries to stop and cries harder.
          It's the first time Walt has cried in fifty years. He
          wails, crying for Tao, Sue, his wife, kids and himself.
          He lets it all out. Daisy jumps in his lap and he hugs
          his old dog as he bawls.

          albums are scattered around.
          Father Janovich knocks and eases open the front door.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Mr. Kowalski, are you in here?

          WALT
          Come on in.
          Father Janovich comes in and sits down across from Walt.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Are you okay?
          Walt nods.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          The police finally left. No one
          is talking. One thing about the
          Hmong, they keep their mouths
          shut.

          WALT
          I've noticed that.
          Father Janovich picks up a photo album and flips through
          it. Pictures of Mitch and Steve as babies.

          WALT
          You know, there's no way that Tao
          or Sue are gonna have any peace if
          these gang guys don't go away. Go
          away forever. You know it as well
          as I do.

          They took Sue to the hospital.
          She's scared. They're all scared.

          WALT
          I'm not.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I know that. Believe me, they all
          know that. Tao especially. He's
          sitting out there staring at your
          front door. You know what he
          expects, Mr. Kowalski.

          WALT
          Yeah, well what would you do if
          you were me? If you were Tao?
          What would you do?
          Father Janovich shakes his head.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I know what I'd do if I was you,
          or at least what you think you
          should do. If I was Tao I guess
          I'd want vengeance. I'd want to
          stand shoulder to shoulder with
          you and kill those guys.

          WALT
          And you?

          FATHER JANOVICH
          What would I do? I'd come over
          here and talk to you I guess. I
          know you're close with these
          people, but this pisses me off
          too, Mr. Kowalski.
          Walt nods.

          WALT
          Wanna beer?

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I'd love one.

          What are you doing?

          WALT
          I'm thinking.

          Thinking time is over. Now it's

          away from what's happened, Tao.

          TAO
          No. Don't let me down, Walt. Not
          you. This is going to end, today.
          Walt stands up and pulls out a chair for Tao to sit in.

          Sit down.

          I know what needs to be done. I
          need to prepare, this needs to be
          carefully planned. You know I'm

          No.
          Tao aims the rifle at an imaginary target.

          WALT
          Put that down. I got something
          for you.

          TAO
          What?

          WALT
          In Korea, October, 1952. We were
          sent up to sweep a Chink machine
          gun nest that had carved us up
          pretty bad. I was the only one
          who came back... I received the
          Silver Star. I want you to have
          it.

          TAO
          Why?

          WALT
          When we went up that hill, we knew
          it was ten to one against us, but
          we went anyway. This trouble now,
          it's similar. We're walking right
          into it. We might not be coming
          home tonight.

          TAO
          The hell we won't. We're going to
          roll in there and tear ass.

          WALT
          Don't be a fool, these guys are
          waiting for that exact reaction.
          Tao is quiet for a minute.

          TAO
          How many?

          WALT
          How many what?

          TAO
          How many men did you kill in
          Korea?

          WALT
          Thirteen for sure. Probably more.

          What was it like to kill a man?

          WALT
          You don't want to know.

          TAO
          Why not?

          WALT
          Go get the Silver Star. It's in a
          blue wooden box in the cellar.
          Tao goes downstairs. He turns on the light and goes into
          the cellar. Tao locates a BLUE WOODEN BOX and opens it.
          Tao holds up the MEDAL. He looks at it closely.
          AND WHAM -- Walt slams the heavy cellar DOOR shut behind
          him. Walt slides the BOLT LOCK into place with a loud

          CLICK.
          Tao couldn't kick his way out of there in ten years. Of
          course he tries anyway. Tao is furious. He throws
          things.

          TAO
          What the hell are you doing?! Let
          me out of here, you goddamned son-
          of-a-bitch!!

          WALT
          Quit smashing everything. You'll
          never get out of there, so just
          relax.

          TAO
          You let me out, you crazy old
          fuck, or I will kill you when I
          get out of here.
          Tao pounds on the door. Walt pounds back with a strength
          and authority which startles Tao.

          WALT
          You want to know how it feels to
          kill a man? It feels goddamned
          lousy. And it feels even worse
          when you get a medal for bravery
          right after you mowed down some
          scared kid when he tries to give
          up. A dumb, scared, little gook,
          just about your age. I shot him
          with the same rifle you just held
          upstairs.

          boy, you want no part of it. Me,
          I've got blood on my hands. I'm
          soiled. Forgive me for tricking
          you like a dope. I'll call
          someone and have them let you out
          later.

          TAO
          No! Let me out!!
          Tao pounds on the door.

          WALT
          You've come a long way. I'm proud
          to call you a friend. You have
          your whole life ahead of you,
          whereas this is what I do. I
          finish things. You'd just get in
          the way. Sorry.
          Walt goes back upstairs, leaving Tao locked up in his
          cellar.
          Tao howls to be let out.

          Walt walks out his front door with Daisy on her leash.
          He walks over to Tao's house.
          Phong sits in a lawnchair and glares at Walt. She yells
          in Hmong as Walt walks straight up to her.

          WALT
          Aw, pipe down, you hag.

          men's minds with ideas of glory.
          Then you'd lead them away to their
          deaths.
          Walt, of course, has no idea what she said.

          Walt holds out the DOG LEASH to Phong. She looks down at
          Daisy and back at Walt. She lashes out again in Hmong.

          WALT
          I need you to watch my dog.
          Walt holds the leash closer. Phong folds her arms in
          defiance. Walt exhales loudly.
          Walt lifts up one of the LEGS OF HER LAWNCHAIR and slips
          the loop of the leash underneath it so Daisy can't follow
          him.

          WALT
          Her name is Daisy.
          Walt bends down on one knee and lovingly pets Daisy. He
          scratches her belly.

          WALT
          You take it easy, old gal. You
          good old girl.
          Walt gets up and walks away without looking back.

          Walt looks at the liquor display. At the pinnacle of
          bottles sits a bottle of Johnnie Walker Blue.

          brother out of the cellar. I have

          The line goes dead as Walt hangs up. Sue jumps up out of

          Phong blocks her path. Phong grabs Sue by the arms.

          OFFICER
          Sorry, Father, we have to go.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I'm telling you. If we're not

          OFFICER
          We've been here for hours. We
          can't afford to anchor a unit to
          one location.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          I'm begging you to stay.

          No you aren't. My orders are

          you're leaving with us.
          Father Janovich looks hard at the duplex before getting
          into the SQUAD CAR. The SQUAD CAR drives off.
          Walt pulls up in front, gets out of his pickup and slams
          the door. He looks at the duplex. It's a total eyesore.

          Six very scared, very jittery Hmong gangbangers look out
          at Walt from various doorways and windows.

          WALT
          Is that all you swamp rats or is
          there more vermin scurrying in the

          WALT
          Shut up, gook. I'm not here to

          of what a shrimp-dicked little
          baby midget like you has to say.
          Spider pulls his PISTOL.

          WALT
          That's right, boy. Defend your
          boyfriend after he or you or
          whoever rapes a member of your
          family. Your own blood, for
          Christ's sake. Go ahead, pull
          your pistols, just like a bunch of
          ridiculous miniature toy cowboys.
          Smokie and several other Hmong gangbangers pull their
          guns.

          WALT
          You have no honor. You're the
          scum of the earth and when you're
          gone, do you think anyone will
          care? No one will mourn. You
          won't be missed.
          All the Hmong are spooked at Walt's absolute lack of
          fear.

          SMOKIE
          Where's Tao, old man? He too
          scared to come and stick up for

          slight movement has the gangbangers waving their PISTOLS
          around.
          Walt laughs.

          No, I think you'd better watch it.

          Tao and Sue wait in front. Tao wears a suit, Sue is in a
          traditional Hmong dress. A TAXI pulls up and they get
          in.
          Sitting on the porch is Phong who rocks back and forth in
          her rocking chair. Phong holds Daisy in her arms, gently
          petting the old dog.

          We're at the funeral of Walter Kowalski. Walt is dressed
          in his new suit.
          Along with the crowd you'd expect, Tao and Sue are seated
          near the front.
          Walt's sons and family are there. Mitch gives Tao a
          dirty look. Tao looks back at him, his gaze bores right
          through Mitch. Mitch looks away.
          Father Janovich steps up to the pulpit and speaks.

          FATHER JANOVICH
          Walt Kowalski once said to me I
          didn't know anything about life or
          death because I was an
          overeducated, 27-year-old virgin
          who held the hands of
          superstitious old women and
          promised them eternity.' Walt
          definitely had no problem calling
          it like he saw it.' But Walt was
          right. I knew really nothing
          about life or death until I got to
          know Walt. And boy, did I learn.

          112
          All of Walt's family are seated in an office as a LAWYER
          reads Walt Kowalski's will.
          Tao is present along with Walt's family.

          LAWYER
          Which brings us to our last item.
          And again, please forgive the
          language used in Mr. Kowalski's
          will. I'm simply reading it as it
          was written.
          The LAWYER takes a sip of water before reading...

          LAWYER
          And to my friend, Tao Vang Lor, I
          leave my 1972 Gran Torino on the
          condition that you don't choptop
          the roof like a damned spick,
          don't paint any idiotic flames on
          it like some white-trash hillbilly
          and don't put a big gay spoiler on
          the rear-end like you see on all
          the other zipper heads' cars. It
          just looks like hell. If you can
          refrain from doing any of that,
          it's yours.

          FADE OUT.



          THE END
