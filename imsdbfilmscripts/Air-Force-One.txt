                                      Andrew Marlow 

               FADE IN:

               INT. C-130 HERCULES TURBO-PROP - NIGHT

               Eighteen combat-ready special forces, wearing assault black, 
               jump packs and combat gear, stare down the deep end of a 
               greasy ramp into the night sky.  Village lights flicker 19,000 
               feet below.

               The STRIKE FORCE LEADER signals to his team.

               Without a moment's hesitation, they dive into the darkness 
               and plummet toward earth.

               EXT. MANSION - NIGHT

               A military GUARD, old Soviet-style uniform, rounds the corner 
               of the large estate toting an AK-47.

               A red laser dot appears briefly on his forehead and, after a 
               beat, the red dot seems to bleed.  The Guard collapses dead.  
               Two other GUARDS are dispatched with single, silenced shots.

               A Strike Team member at a junction box awaits a signal.

               Through infra-red binoculars the strike Force Leader watches 
               his assault troops as they take positions.

                                     STRIKE FORCE LEADER
                              (into headset/in 
                              Russian)
                         GO!

               On the estate - as the power goes out.  The team on the 
               mansion's front porch pops the door and pours in.

               INT. MANSION - NIGHT

               FOLLOWING - the FIVE TEAM MEMBERS as they rush a stairway in 
               phalanx formation.  They nearly knock over an old lady, who 
               in turn lets out a blood curdling scream.

               UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR -

               The team kicks open a door.  Rushes into the room.

               INT. BEDROOM -

               Assault weapons pointed at the bed.  The soldiers yank back 
               bedsheets to reveal IVAN STRAVANAVITCH, a middle-aged man 
               and his half-naked 18-year-old concubine.

                                     SOLDIER
                              (in Russian)
                         Get up, now!  Up!

               The soldiers pull Stravanavitch to his feet and haul him out 
               of the room.

               FOLLOWING -  As they push down the hallway.

               MANSION SECURITY GUARDS rally with haphazard gunfire.

               Out come the strike force's flash-bang grenades.  Exploding 
               everywhere, disorienting Stravanavitch's men.

               EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

               Signal flares burn as a helicopter descends on the position.  
               The Strike Team evacuates across the field and forces a 
               struggling Stravanavitch into the low-hovering copter.

               The commandos swiftly board the craft as a handful of 
               Stravanavitch's guards break into the clearing.  They open 
               fire.

               And the mounted machine guns on the helicopter return.

               One of the Strike Team members takes a bullet to the neck.  
               He's' pulled by his comrades into the chopper as it lifts 
               into the sky, its guns spitting lead...

               Archangel, this is Restitution.

               Archangel, this is Restitution.  The package is wrapped.  
               Over.

                                     VOICE (V.0. RADIO)
                         Roger, Restitution.  We are standing 
                         by for delivery.

                                     FADE TO BLACK
                         The SOUNDS of a dinner banquet.  
                         Forks clanking against plates and 
                         the din of a hundred conversations, 
                         broken by...

               The DING, DING, DING of a SPOON tapping against a wine glass.

               SUPER TITLE:   "MOSCOW - THREE WEEKS LATER

               FADE IN:

               INT. BANQUET ROOM - NIGHT

               Hundreds of men and women in formal evening wear sit at round 
               banquet tables.  A HUSH falls over the guests as the DINGING 
               continues.  All attention turns to the front table.

               A rotund, silver haired-man in his late sixties rises and 
               sidles past U.S. and Russian flags up to the podium 
               microphone.  He is STOLI PETROV, President of Russia.

                                     PETROV
                              (in Russian)
                         Thank you for joining us this evening.

               Petrov's harsh Russian issues through the room.  But over it 
               we hear a young woman's voice translating.

                                     TRANSLATOR (V.0.)
                         Tonight we are honored to have with 
                         us a man of remarkable courage, who, 
                         despite strong international 
                         criticism...

               AT THE FRONT TABLE -

               A translator's words ring in the earpiece of a handsome man 
               in his mid-forties.  Worry lines crease his forehead and the 
               touch of gray at his temples attest to three very difficult 
               years in office.

               This man is JAMES MARSHALL, and he is the PRESIDENT of the 
               UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  He busily makes last minute changes 
               to his speech.

                                     TRANSLATOR
                              (V.0. earpiece)
                         Has chosen to join our fight against 
                         tyranny in forging a new world 
                         community.  Ladies and gentlemen, I 
                         give you the President of the United 
                         States of America...

               Mr. President.

               Thunderous applause as Marshall rises and approaches the 
               podium.

               At the back of the room, DOHERTY, a senior policy adviser 
               whispers to the President's Chief of Staff ED SHEPHERD...

                                     DOHERTY
                         Maybe we should consider running him 
                         for re-election instead of the U.S.

               The applause dies as Marshall begins to speak.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (in Russian with 
                              subtitles)
                         Good evening and thank you.  First I 
                         would ask you to join me in a moment 
                         of silence for the victims of the 
                         Turkmenistan massacres.

               The room remains silent a few beats.  Most guests respectfully 
               bow their heads.

               Marshall begins again, but this time in English.  The young 
               woman translates simultaneously for the Russian audience.

                                     MARSHALL
                         As you know, three weeks ago American 
                         Special Forces, in cooperation with 
                         the Russian Republican Army, secured 
                         the arrest of Turkmenistan's self-
                         proclaimed dictator, General Ivan 
                         Stravanavitch, whose brutal sadistic 
                         reign had given new meaning to the 
                         word horror.  I am proud to say our 
                         operation was a success.

               Applause from the audience.  Marshall turns the page on his 
               speech.

                                     MARSHALL
                         And now, yesterday's biggest threat 
                         to world peace... today awaits trial 
                         for crimes against humanity.

               During the applause, Marshall pulls a page from the speech, 
               folds it and slides it into his pocket.  He removes his 
               glasses and looks out into the crowd.  His tone becomes more 
               personal.

               He's not reciting the speech anymore.

                                     MARSHALL
                         What we did here was important.  We 
                         finally pulled our heads out of the 
                         sand, we finally stood up to the 
                         brutality and said "We've had enough.  
                         Every time we ignore these atrocities-- 
                         the rapes, the death squads, the 
                         genocides- every time we negotiate 
                         with these, these thugs to keep them 
                         out of gig country and away from gig 
                         families, every time we do thiS.E. 
                         we legitimize terror.

               Terror is not a legitimate system of government.  And to 
               those who commit the atrocities I say, we will no longer 
               tolerate, we will no longer negotiate, and we will no longer 
               be afraid.  It's your turn to be afraid.

               Applause rolls through the crowd.

               EXT. MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

               Sprawling terminals spread out to runways like tentacles.

               ON THE TARMAC -

               Bathed in floodlights, perched majestically on the runway, 
               dwarfing nearby commuter and military jets, stands...

                                     AIR FORCE ONE
                         The President's own Boeing 747-200, 
                         dubbed "the flying White House".  
                         The distinctive royal blue stripe 
                         over a thin gold line tapers to a 
                         tail adorned with the American flag 
                         and the Presidential Seal Secret 
                         Service agents and Marines stand 
                         guard at the aircraft's perimeter.

               A RUSSIAN NEWS VAN emerges from the darkness and pulls to a 
               stop by a Secret Service barricade.

               SPECIAL AGENT GIBBS greets the Russian news team that emerges.

                                     GIBBS
                         Gentlemen, welcome to Air Force One.

               Please present your equipment to Special Agent Walters for 
               inspection.

               The news team's segment producer, a crusty old Russian named 
               KORSHUNOV raises his big bushy eyebrows.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         We've already been inspected.

                                     GIBBS
                         Sir, this plane carries the President 
                         of the United States.

               Though we wish to extend your press service every courtesy, 
               you will comply with our security measures to the letter.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Of course.  I'm sorry.

               Korshunov and the FIVE MEMBERS of his news crew present their 
               video cameras, sound equipment and supplies to Special Agent 
               WALTERS for inspection.  Secret Service DOGS sniff through 
               the baggage.

                                     GIBBS
                         Please place your thumbs on the ID 
                         pad.

               Korshunov puts his thumb on the ID pad of a portable computer.

               The computer matches up his thumbprint with his dossier and 
               photograph.  "CLEARED" flashes on the computer screen.

               INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

               The President, walking with his entourage.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         *                     CBS said they'll 
                         give us four minutes.  They thought 
                         the Russian was a nice touch.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I always wondered if my freshman 
                         Russian class would come in handy.

                                     DOHERTY
                         Sir, you threw out page two.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Goddamn right I did.  I asked for a 
                         tough-as-nails speech and you gave 
                         me diplomatic bullshit.  What's the 
                         point in having a speech if I have 
                         to ad-lib?

                                     DOHERTY
                         It was a good ad-lib, sir.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Thanks.  Wrote it last night.

               The President exits the building and enters his limousine.

               EXT. TARMAC - AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               Walters hands the bags back to the Russians.

                                     WALTERS
                         Equipment checks out.

               A striking woman in her early thirties descends Air Force 
               One's stairway.  MARIA MITCHELL.

                                     GIBBS
                         Gentlemen, this is Maria Mitchell.

               Press Relations for the Presidential Flight Office.  She'll 
               take you from here.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Ms.  Mitchell.  So nice to finally 
                         meet you in person.

                                     MITCHELL
                         The President and I were delighted 
                         that we could accommodate you.  Now 
                         if you're all cleared?
                              (Gibbs nods)
                         You can follow me then.

               They ascend into the belly of Air Force One.

                                     MITCHELL
                         *                    I'll be giving 
                         you a brief tour, then during the 
                         flight, two members of your crew 
                         will be allowed out of the press 
                         area at a time for filming.  You 
                         will have exactly ten minutes with 
                         the President and twenty with the 
                         crew...

               EXT. STREETS OF MOSCOW, PRESIDENT'S MOTORCADE - NIGHT

               Winding its way down narrow cobblestone streets onto a major 
               thoroughfare.

               INT. PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

               The limousine is packed with advisers, aides, military staff, 
               including LT. COL. PERKINS, the keeper of the NUCLEAR FOOTBALL 
               handcuffed to his wrist.  In the b.g. on the limo's television 
               set, the LARRY KING SHOW indulges in its normal banter.

               Marshall wearily rubs his temples as he stifles a yawn.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         You wanna knock of f?

                                     MARSHALL
                         No, no.  I'm fine.  What did the 
                         Speaker say?

                                     SHEPHERD
                         He and the NRA don't like the wording.

                                     DOHERTY
                         Apparently taking uzis away from 
                         sixth graders isn't as popular as we 
                         thought it'd be.  Representative 
                         Taylor is working on a compromise.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Put together a score sheet.  I'll 
                         make some calls.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         With all due respect, sir, maybe you 
                         should give them this one.  Your 
                         numbers are still pretty low and you 
                         called in a lot of chips to nail 
                         Stravanavitch.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I might still have a few chips left.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         *                     We could always 
                         put you in a duck blind with a twelve 
                         gauge.  The second amendment types'll 
                         love that.

                                     MARSHALL
                         This is a crime bill, Shep.  Killing 
                         a couple ducks won't get it through 
                         committee.  Besides, Shep, I told 
                         you...  I don't shoot babies and I 
                         don't kiss guns.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Other way around, sir.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (realizing what he 
                              said)
                         Right... Christ I'm tired.  Do me a 
                         favor and keep me away from the press.

               Marshall's watch alarm beeps and he automatically reaches 
               into his breast pocket, pulls out a medicine vial and downs 
               two pills with a coffee chaser.

               On the T.V.

                                     LARRY KING (T.V.)
                         ... and your reaction to the 
                         President's trip to Moscow.  Good or 
                         bad?

               Shepherd turns up the volume.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         This is the part I wanted you to 
                         see.

                                     REP. DANFORTH (T.V.)
                         Criminal.  One of our boys died in 
                         Marshall's little publicity stunt 
                         and for what?  So we could claim 
                         victory over another country's 
                         problems instead of our own?  And 
                         now he's got the nerve to prance 
                         around Moscow gloating, while that 
                         poor boy's family is left to bury 
                         him.  If I were Marshall, I'd be 
                         ashamed of myself.

                                     LARRY KING
                         There you have it.  Harsh words for 
                         the President from Michael Danforth, 
                         the Speaker of the House.

               Marshall mutes the television.  A quiet moment.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         *                     My opinion.  
                         We can't let him get away with that 
                         kind of language.

               Marshall considers.  Then decides.

                                     MARSHALL
                         It's bait.  Don't take it.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked 
                         this administration on national 
                         television.  You can't afford to 
                         leave that hanging.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (ignoring Shepherd)
                         Did we tape the Duke game?

                                     AIDE
                         It's waiting on the plane.  The ending 
                         was pretty...

                                     MARSHALL
                              (interrupting)
                         Please don't tell me.  Just for once, 
                         *                     let me be 
                         surprised.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE, CORRIDOR, TRAVELING - NIGHT

               Maria Mitchell escorts the Russians down the plane's length.  
               As they pass the galley, Maria motions up a set of stairs.

                                     MITCHELL
                         Up on the upper deck is the cockpit 
                         and the Mission Communication Center.  
                         The MCC, as we call it, can place 
                         clear and secure phone calls to 
                         anywhere on earth.  We're linked to 
                         a network of military and civilian 
                         satellites and ground stations.  We 
                         could run the country or run a war 
                         from there if we had to.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         This is a remarkable aircraft.

                                     MITCHELL
                         You don't know the half of it.  Did 
                         you know this entire plane is shielded 
                         from radiation?  We could fly through 
                         a mushroom cloud completely unharmed 
                         if necessary.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         A dubious distinction, no?

                                     MITCHELL
                         I guess it depends on your 
                         perspective.

               They walk by several conference rooms, running down the 
               starboard side of the plane.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         And all these rooms here?

                                     MITCHELL
                         Conference rooms, though some have 
                         other functions.  The one up front 
                         doubles as an emergency medical 
                         center.

               Past the conference rooms, they walk by a small side room 
               where SECRETARIES work on computers, generating documents.

                                     MITCHELL
                         As you can see, back here's more 
                         like a regular plane.  Security and 
                         Secret Service take this cabin.
                         You'll be in the rear with the press 
                         pool.

               The REAR PRESS CABIN, just ahead of the rear galley and bank 
               of bathrooms.  A handful of disgruntled reporters feign sleep.

                                     MITCHELL
                         Here's a press kit.  I'll let you 
                         guys get comfortable and once we're 
                         airborne I'll be able to schedule 
                         the interviews.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Thank you.

               Mitchell exits forward.  One of the reporters stirs and looks 
               up at the news team.  He groans.  Space is a premium back 
               here.

                         You fellas win some sort of fly-with-

                                     KORSHUNOV

                         Right.  Listen, this here... This is 
                         my row.  You'll have to sit over 
                         there.

               Korshunov trades looks with his news team.

               EXT. MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

               The President's motorcade pulls up in front of Air Force 
               One.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               The President and his entourage ascend from the lower deck 
               platform onto the main deck.  COL. DANIEL AXELROD, Air Force 
               One's pilot, snaps off a salute as he passes.

                                     COL. AXELROD
                         Welcome aboard, Mr. President.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (returns salute)
                         Hey Danny.  How's it look tonight?

                                     COL. AXELROD
                         Glassy, sir.  Care to take the wheel?

                                     MARSHALL
                         You keep offering, one of these days 
                         I'll take you up on it.
                              (to no one in 
                              particular)
                         Rose and Alice back yet?

                                     AIDE
                         No, Mr. President.  The ballet ran 
                         late.  Their ETA is seventeen minutes.

               Marshall nods as he pulls off his bow tie and enters his 
               stateroom.  Shepherd follows two steps behind.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Mr. President?

               Marshall halts Shepherd with a gesture.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Thirty seconds.

               Shepherd nods and waits by the door.  Lt. Col. Perkins takes 
               a seat outside the Presidents stateroom and opens the latest 
               Tom Clancy thriller, using the nuclear football as a lap 
               desk.

               INT. PRESIDENT'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

               Marshall collapses on the couch, rubs his eyes, then closes 
               them.  A moment of peace in a breakneck day.

               The knock at the door jars him.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Yes.

               Shepherd enters.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Can I at least issue a press release 
                         objecting to the Speaker's choice of 
                         wording?

               President Marshall picks up one of the many phones in his 
               office.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I said it's not worth the fight.
                              (into phone)
                         Steward, please.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         We'll just say it was in bad taste.

               *                               MARSHALL

               Forget it, Shep.  The kid gave his life for his country and 
               the

               Speaker's a bastard for turning him into a sound bite.  I'll 
               take the heat.  Understood?

                                     SHEPHERD
                         You give me ulcers.

                                     MARSHALL
                         That's my job.

               A STEWARD enters the room.

                                     STEWARD
                         Mr. President?

                                     MARSHALL
                         Hey Mike.  Could you get me a 
                         Heineken?

                                     SHEPHERD
                         No, wait.  Get him one of the Russian 
                         beers.

               The steward nods and disappears from the room.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         We've got those Russian news guys on 
                         board and it'll look good in the 
                         papers.

               Marshall picks up a stack of policy reports.  Thumbs through 
               them.

                                     MARSHALL
                         C'mon Shep.  I've been eating borscht 
                         and drinking vodka for days.  Isn't 
                         that enough?
                              (off paper)
                         New home starts are down.

               The steward arrives with the Russian beer.  Marshall takes a 
               swig.  He swallows hard.  Piss-water.  Marshall crosses to 
               his sink and pours the beer out.  He hands the bottle to the 
               steward.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Fill this with Heineken.

               The steward nods...

                                     STEWARD
                         Yes, Mr. President.

               AND SLINKS AWAY WITH THE BOTTLE. MARSHALL CATCHES HIMSELF --

                                     MARSHALL
                         I don't believe this.  I'm playing 
                         politics with a bottle of beer.  A 
                         goddamn bottle of beer.  I've been 
                         in office too long.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Look on the bright side... if the 
                         polls don't change, you won't have 
                         that problem, sir.

               Marshall picks up the phone again.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Yeah.  Put the Duke game on in my 
                         room.

               INT. AFO'S MISSION COMMUNICATION CENTER - NIGHT

               THREE Air Force SPECIALISTS man the elaborate communication 
               system occupying much of the upper deck.  Top-of-the-line 
               computers, communication systems, video decks, and satellite 
               receivers.

                                     AIR FORCE SPECIALIST
                         Yes, Mr. President.

               He slides in a videotape and channels the feed to the *         
               president's stateroom.

               INT. PRESIDENT'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

               A monitor comes to life with a basketball game.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (to Shepherd)
                         Defense and State Department in the 
                         conference room in one hour.  I want 
                         to review the Iraq situation.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Yes, sir.

               Shepherd exits as Marshall settles into his leather chair 
               and dives into work.  He punches a button on the speakerphone.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Get me the Housing Secretary...

               EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               The Marine Guards snap to attention once again as the First 
               Lady's motorcade arrives.

               ROSE MARSHALL, a self-assured woman with an aristocratic 
               gleam, alights from her limo.  She takes a few steps, then 
               turns, tapping her foot impatiently.

                                     ROSE
                         C'mon Alice, we're 20 minutes late.

               Your father's gonna have a fit.

               ALICE, the President's 13-year-old daughter, straggles out 
               of the car, rolling her eyes.

                                     ALICE
                         It's not like he hasn't made us wait 
                         a few times.

                                     ROSE
                         Well, you aren't the President, dear.

                                     ALICE
                         Yeah, no duh.

               INT. MAIN DECK, AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               As the First Lady's entourage enters.

                                     ROSE
                         Why don't you go say hi?

               Again, Alice rolls her eyes.

                                     ROSE
                         What is wrong with you tonight?  
                         Come here.

               Rose pulls Alice aside.

                                     ROSE
                         You don't want to say hi to your 
                         father?

                                     ALICE
                         I'm sure he's busy.

                                     ROSE
                         Don't you even want to ask?

               Alice toes her foot into the carpet as she releases an 
               exasperated sigh.  She is, in this moment, the patron saint 
               of know-it-all 13-year-old girls.  Alice waves toward the 
               Presidential Suite.

                                     ALICE
                         If I go over there to say hi to daddy 
                         President, Mike's going to tell me 
                         he's in a meeting and can't be 
                         disturbed.  Then when the plane starts 
                         to taxi, he'll come out and say "Hey, 
                         are you guys back?  Did you enjoy 
                         the ballet?"  But he'll be on his 
                         way to another meeting and won't 
                         wait for an answer.  Then you'll get 
                         pissed at him and he'll get pissed 
                         at you.  It's like you guys rehearse 
                         or something.

               With the weight of the entire world on her shoulders, Alice

               Collapses into one of the many leather chairs.  It seems to 
               swallow her.  JORY, a steward passes.

                                     ALICE
                         Hey Joey, how `bout a cocoa, double 
                         whip cream.

                                     ROSE
                         Alice...

                                     ALICE
                         Mom, just this once, give it a rest.

                                     ROSE
                         You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about 
                         this back...

                                     ALICE
                         Back at The Fishbowl?

               Alice eyes the swirl of Aides who are pretending to work 
               nearby.

               But it's obvious that they're eavesdropping.  Alice smiles 
               and waves at them dramatically.

                                     ROSE
                         We'll talk at home.
                              (beat)
                         You know, most girls aren't as lucky 
                         as you.  For most girls seeing the 
                         Bolshoi ballet would be the experience 
                         of a lifetime.

                                     ALICE
                         I know, Mom.
                              (sees the hurt in her 
                              mom's eyes and softens)
                         It was great... really.

               Rose nods, smiling a half-smile.  After a thoughtful beat, 
               Alice gets up and crosses to the Presidential suite.  She 
               exchanges words with the Aide standing outside the door and 
               comes back, covering her disappointment.

                                     ALICE
                         He's in a meeting.  He can't be 
                         disturbed.

                                     ROSE
                         I'm sorry, honey.

                                     ALICE
                         No, it's okay.  After all, he is the 
                         President, right?

               Joey the steward hands her her cocoa with a wink and a smile.

               Her eyes light up at the mound of whip cream on top.

                                     ALICE
                         When I write my memoirs I think I'll 
                         devote an entire chapter to the cocoa 
                         aboard Air Force One.

                                     ROSE
                         Your father never means to be so...

                                     ALICE
                         I know...
                              (beat)
                         But lotsa times I feel like it's me 
                         versus the world.  Some kid at school 
                         teases me and the same day a plague 
                         breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it 
                         doesn't take a genius to figure which 
                         is more important.

                                     ROSE
                         Some kids were teasing you?

                                     ALICE
                         That's not really the point.

               A quiet pause, then...

                                     ROSE
                         You're right and I'll tell you a 
                         secret.  I know exactly how you feel.

                                     ALICE
                         Big secret.  You said the same thing 
                         to Newsweek.

               The plane jolts forward as it begins to taxi.

                                     ALICE
                         We're taxiing.  Ready.  And... five...  
                         four... three.. two... one... Cue 
                         Daddy.

               Alice points.  And as if on cue, Marshall exits from his 
               office and checks his watch.

                                     ALICE
                         Oooooh, I'm good.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Hey, you guys back already?

               Alice nods.

                                     MARSHALL
                         How was...
                              (thinks, then remembers)
                         ...the ballet?

                                     ALICE
                              (theatrically)
                         It was the experience of a lifetime.

                                     MARSHALL
                         How `bout a hug for the old man.

               Alice rises and hugs her father.  A White House PHOTOGRAPHER 
               snaps off a few shots for the papers.  Alice makes a face at 
               them.  A second later, Shepherd comes up the corridor, 
               breaking up the pair.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Mr. President... they're ready for 
                         you in the conference room.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Okay.  Hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me 
                         all about it later, right?

                                     ALICE
                         Sure.

               As Marshall moves toward the conference room, he bends and 
               gives Rose a quick peck on the cheek.  It all reeks of 
               formality.

                                     ROSE
                         May I speak to you for a moment?

                                     MARSHALL
                         Can't it wait?

                                     ROSE
                         No, Mr. President.  It can't.

               INT.  PRESIDENT'S OFFICE.

               Rose shuts the door behind them.  As she starts to speak, 
               Marshall pulls her into a long passionate kiss.  Rose pulls 
               away.

                                     ROSE
                         Don't.  I know spin control when I 
                         feel it.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Rose, I don't have time for this.

               I've gotta go stop a war.

                                     ROSE
                         For godsakes, Jim, slow down and 
                         stop acting like the little dutch 
                         boy.  Not even you can plug all the 
                         world's leaks.  Don't you think it's 
                         a sign you're pushing too hard when 
                         your daughter sees more of you on 
                         MTV news than in person.

                                     MARSHALL
                         She's a big girl.  She understands.

                                     ROSE
                         How do you know she understands?  
                         You haven't spent more than five 
                         minutes with her, or me, in weeks.

                                     MARSHALL
                         And when have I had five minutes?
                         When I wake up in the morning and 
                         I'm already three hours behind 
                         Schedule.  What do you want me to 
                         do, Rose, tell the G7 to fuck off 
                         because I'm a family man?

                                     (BEAT)
                         I'm sorry. That wasn't fair.

                                     ROSE
                         No. It wasn't.

               He takes her in his arms.

                                     MARSHALL
                         You know what?

                                     ROSE
                         What?

                                     MARSHALL
                         I miss you. And I miss her.

                                     ROSE
                         But that's the point, Jim. We're                     
                         right here.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I wish it were that easy...

               Long beat. He smiles at her, it's the same sweet smile that 
               won her heart, the same smile that got him elected. She 
               softens.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I'll make it up to you, I promise.

                                     ROSE
                         I should trust that promise? Because 
                         you know the voters are still waiting 
                         for that middle class tax cut.

                                     MARSHALL
                         This promise isn't subject to 
                         Congressional approval.

               She smiles. The tension breaks.

                                     ROSE
                         How did your speech go?

                                     MARSHALL
                         Well, they aren't burning me in 
                         effigy. That's always a good sign.

               They kiss again, this time for real. But... a knock on the 
               door.

                                     SHEPHERD (0.5.)
                         Mr. President.

               Shepherd opens the door.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Look on the bright side, hon. Shep 
                         here thinks I'll be a one termer.

                                     ROSE
                         Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to 
                         schedule your daughter in?

                                     SHEPHERD
                         She is scheduled. Her school play's 
                         Tuesday night.

               Rose rolls her eyes.

                                     MARSHALL
                         The First Lady was making a joke, 
                         Shep. I'll make some time, Rose. I 
                         promise.

               Marshall heads for his meeting.

               EXT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

               Col. Axelrod and his co-pilot LT. COL. ARTHUR INGRAHAMS are 
               at the wheel.

               RUSSIAN AIR TRAFFIC (V.0)

                                     (THICK ACCENT)
                         United States Air Force One, this is 
                         tower. It's an honor to clear you 
                         for immediate take-off on runway 
                         three.

                                     COL. AXELROD
                         Roger, Tower. And thank you for the 
                         hospitality.

               Axeirod eases up the throttle and the four GE-F103 Turbofan 
               engines spring to life.

               EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT

               A picture perfect take-off as Air Force One slides through 
               the moonlight and skates upward on a sheet of air.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE, GALLEY - NIGHT

               Aircraft engines drone.

               CLOSE ON - A coffee pot pouring piping joe into a mug 
               emblazoned with ubiguitou Presidential Seal. The mug is placed 
               on a tray with a half-dozen other mugs and passed to a STEW. 
               He carries the tray down the corridor past passenger cabins.

               Drowsiness has overtaken the plane. Many of the passengers 
               and aides are asleep. CNN plays On T.V. sets, entertaining 
               the few night owls and news junkies.

                                     CNN REPORTER (T.V.)
                         In an unusually aggressive speech, 
                         the President characterized the 
                         Stravanavitch regime as thugs whose 
                         brutality will no longer be tolerated.  
                         Meanwhile, in Turkmenistan, 
                         Stravanavitch's ouster has sent the 
                         country into turmoil.  Tens of 
                         thousands of refugees continue to 
                         huddle in U.N. safe havens, as rival 
                         Stravanavitch loyalists fight among 
                         themselves for control. But at least 
                         for the time being, the ethnic 
                         cleansing has been stopped.

               Toward the front of the plane, the steward enters the 
               conference room.

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               As the steward closes the door behind him, all background 
               noise disappears. We are in a sound shielded room. Even the 
               engines' drone cannot be heard.

               The lights in the room are dim as MAJOR CALDWELL, a military 
               advisor, projects satellite photos of Iraqi military bases 
               onto a screen.

               The steward serves coffee as unobtrusively as he can while 
               the meeting continues.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                         Our KH-ll's took this one at 0100 
                         hours. What you see here is the 
                         mobilization of two mechanized 
                         brigades.

                                     MARSHALL
                         They've gotta be joking.

                                     DOHERTY
                         The Iraqi ambassador is claiming 
                         it's just an exercise.

                                     MARSHALL
                         An exercise in futility. Send the 
                         Nimitz back in.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                         The northern border's gotten a bit 
                         hairy. Their MiGs are playing tag 
                         with our Tomcats and our boys are 
                         just itching to engage.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Tell our boys to cool their jets. I 
                         don't need `em creating policy for 
                         me.

               We follow the steward as he slips out of the conference room 
               and back into the...

               INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               with a few coffees left on his tray. One of them is scooped 
               up by Gibbs as he passes, his nose is buried in a fax.

               INT. SECRET SERVICE CABIN - NIGHT

               Gibbs leans in the cabin.

                                     GIBBS
                         Hey Walters, you and Johnson come 
                         here a second. Reykjavik just sent 
                         the advance team report.

               Special Agents Walters and JOHNSON rise and follow Gibbs 
               into an adjoining office.

               INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

               Gibbs closes the door behind the two agents. As Walters and 
               Johnson take their seats, Gibbs WITHDRAWS HIS WEAPON and...

               SHOOTS each of the agents in THE BACK OF THE HEAD.

               Silenced pistol. Blood all over the desk. Gibbs removes each 
               of the agent's weapons and slips them into his waistband. He 
               waits a few beats, takes a long sip of coffee, then exits 
               the office.

               INT. SECRET SERVICE CABIN - NIGHT

               As he passes through the cabin he takes a silent inventory. 
               Five other agents working, sleeping, on the phone.

               INT. PRESS CABIN - NIGHT

               Gibbs nods to Korshunov. Korshunov nods one of his men.  
               NEVSKY removes one of his videotapes, pops the front cover 
               exposing the tape. Across the face of the tape is a thin 
               strip of a rubbery substance. Nevsky pulls the strip up and 
               out, making a kind of fuse. He reaches for a pack of 
               matches... courtesy matches, sporting the Seal of the 
               President.

               Nevsky nods and lights the fuse.

               IN A RAPID SUCCESSION -

               GIBBS tosses his two extra weapons to Korshunov's men, pivots 
               the corner and begins firing at his colleagues. The SECRET 
               SERVICE AGENTS try to get at their weapons, but Gibbs has 
               caught them completely off-guard.

               Several silenced central nervous system shots (head and neck) 
               and the five agents slump back, their red blood cascading 
               down the creases of the fine Corinthian leather chairs.

               Nevsky tosses the cassette up the corridor... smoke pours 
               out of it. Smoke screen.

               BAZYLEV and ZEDECK catch the guns Gibbs tossed and hold them 
               on the reporters.

                                     BAZYLEV
                         UP! GET UP NOW!

               Bazylev grabs the stunned reporters, yanking them into the 
               aisle.

                                     BAZYLEV
                         Walk in front of us. Go! Go! Go!

               Human shields. A half dozen of them.

               Behind the terrorists, one of the bathroom doors swings open. 
               A SECRET SERVICE AGENT emerges. Sees what's happening. Reaches 
               for his gun. ZEDECK fells him with a well placed unsilenced 
               GUN SHOT. SCREAMS ensue...

               INT. FORWARD CABIN - NIGHT

               A sleeping SECRET SERVICE AGENT bolts upright. HEARS MORE 
               SHOTS.

               He springs up and moves toward the gunshots, his weapon drawn.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         SHOTS FIRED! SECURE BOY SCOUT!
                              (screaming out and 
                              into his lapel mike)
                         SHOTS FIRED! SHOTS FIRED!

               INT. SECRET SERVICE CABIN - NIGHT                           

               Bazylev and Zedeck lay down a suppressing fire outside the 
               door.

                                     GIBBS
                         Come on! Quickly.

               Korshunov, Nevsky and VLAD follow Gibbs into the Secret 
               Service office. Gibbs opens a locker and pulls out a stash 
               of MP5 automatic assault rifles and bullet-proof vests.

               Korshunov raises his bushy eyebrows in delight.

                                     GIBBS
                         The Secret Service believes in being 
                         prepared for any eventuality.

               INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               The Secret Service agent fights his way through the smoke to 
               a wall panel. Punches a red buttoned intercom.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE'S FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               A red light on the security panel lights up...

                         We are scrambling our fighters.

               The controller hits a red button on his console. Sirens flare 
               up and klaxons wail across the base.

               The controller looks down to his runways. In the light of 
               the moon he sees a half-dozen men rushing toward F-15 Eagles.

               mode.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE, MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

               Pandemonium. GUNFIRE pops in the b.g. Air Force Specialists 
               try to get the word out.

               AIR FORCE SPECIALIST

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               The conference room door bursts open and TWO SECRET SERVICE 
               AGENTS, weapons drawn, enter the room and run to Marshall.

               The once quiet room floods with light. The sounds of a 
               gunfight and a blanket of smoke sweeps into the cabin.

                                     MARSHALL
                         What's going on?

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         We're under attack.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         We're handling it, sir.

               The agents lift Marshall to his feet, and practically carry 
               him from the room, leaving the other high ranking officials 
               to scramble for themselves in a cacophony of shouts.

                                     MARSHALL
                         The launch codes! Who's protecting 
                         the football?

               FORWARD CORRIDOR -

               Perkins, carrying the nuclear football, ducks and weaves his 
               way down the corridor into the fray. He takes a bullet to 
               the shoulder, which fells him.

               NEAR THE FORWARD GALLEY -

               Alice is nearly trampled by agents responding to the gunfire.

               One agent grabs her and shoves her into a bathroom.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         Don't open the door!

               GUNFIRE pops all around her.

               INT. CORRIDOR, REAR CABINS - NIGHT

               Smoke, automatic weapons fire. Secret service agents battling 
               the terrorists. Aides, diplomats, crew and personnel caught 
               in the crossfire.

               Air Force One banks into a curve and descends through broken 
               clouds.

               INT. PRESIDENTIAL STATEROOM - NIGHT

               The sounds of gunfire have reached the the nose of the plane.

               Rose peers out to see what's the matter. An armed Secret 
               Service agent runs toward her.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         Get back! Get back!

               A spray of bullets mows him down. He collapses in the door 
               frame. Terrified, Rose tries to close the door, but the dead 
               agent is in the way.

               INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Filled with smoke and gunfire. The agents rush the President 
               behind a forward bulkhead.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT

                         Roger. We're going to the chute.

               Marshall looks up the hallway toward his stateroom.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (calling out)
                         ROSE! ALICE!

               DOWN THE CORRIDOR -                                       

               Gibbs fires.

               HITS - One of the Secret Service agents in the shoulder. 
               Blood blossoms through his clothes but he winces it off.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         Come on, sir.

               The Secret Service agents whisk the President to the front 
               stairwell. They pull up a floor panel, revealing stairs 
               descending toward the baggage deck.

               INT. BATHROOM -

               Alice, huddled atop the commode.

                                     MARSHALL (O.S.)
                         Alice!

                                     ALICE
                         Daddy...

               Alice opens the door and rushes...

               INTO THE CORRIDOR...

               Tripping and falling over Joey, the steward. His dead eyes 
               swim in a pool of blood that was his face. Alice screams, 
               scrambling to her feet.

               MID-PLANE CORRIDOR -

               Perkins manages to push himself to his feet and stumbles 
               down the hall into the computer room. Terrorist SERGE spots 
               the nuclear football dangling from his wrist. He pursues.

               INT. COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

               Hysterical SECRETARIES feverishly dump classified documents 
               into a shredder, while Perkins struggles to open the black 
               leather briefcase handcuffed to his wrist.

               Bullets tear up the doorknob lock arid SERGE kicks in the 
               door.

                                     SERGE
                         Down! Everyone down!

               The Fawn Halls hit the floor as gunfire sprays overhead. But 
               Perkins swings around brandishing his sidearm. He opens fire 
               on Serge, but the bullets smack harmlessly against the SWAT 
               vest.

               Serge returns fire, ripping up Perkins who collapses over 
               the shredder, and with his last bit of strength, he dumps 
               out the briefcase.

               Papers containing NUCLE WAR STRATEGIES and MISSILE LAUNCH 
               CODES slide into the hungry Shredding machine. Perkins manages 
               a slight smile before he keels over dead, his duty fulfilled. 
               The shredded remains of the nuclear football rain over his 
               head like tickertape at a hero's parade.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               The pale moon catches shiny streaks of metal that descend 
               through the broken clouds. The Squadron of F-15 Eagles drops 
               into formation around Air Force One.

               Encased in a helmet, mask, and visor, Carlton watches the

               INT. LOWER DECK OF AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               Beneath the main cabin, the Secret Service agents run the 
               President through the forward baggage compartment and the 
               lower galley: a large room with compartments, storage freezers 
               and food preperation tables.

               On the far side of the galley, the agents fling open a 
               hatchway and enter...

               A NARROW GANGWAY - running between the lower galley and the 
               rear baggage hold, flanked on either side by the landing 
               gear bays.

               They duck under wing supports until they come to a mesh 
               grating.

               The uninjured agent lifts the grating revealing an ESCAPE 
               POD.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         Get in!   

               Marshall freezes.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         Get in, sir.

               A second later gunfire rips Up the agent's face. The new 
               volley sends Marshall under the cover of a wing strut. The 
               second agent takes Position and returns fire. He quells the 
               incoming volley for a moment.

                                     MARSHALL
                         What about my family?

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT #
                         I have a family, too, sir. Now get 
                         in the fucking pod.

               The firing begins again. Marshall struggles with the decision.

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT #
                         Mr. President... MR. PRESIDENT! You 
                         have to do this! The pod, on three.
                         Ready?

               The agent shoves in a fresh clip...

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                         One.

                                     MARSHALL
                         But...

                                     SECRET SERVICE AGENT
                              (cutting him off)
                         Two... THREE. GO!

               The agent combat-rolls into the open and fires. He advances 
               down the gangway acting as a shield for the president, 
               shooting blindly.  Marshall watches as he's hit repeatedly, 
               but it gives him the time he needs to dive for the pod.

               REVERSE ANGLE - VLAD AND NEVSKY

               behind the bulkhead. When the agent drops, Nevsky and Viad 
               rush down the gangway. They arrive at the closed pod just as 
               it begins to slide on its rails. They let loose dozens of 
               rounds from their MP55, but the bullets just plink off.

               The pod-lock doors slide shut. The President is on his way 
               to safety.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               Small bay doors open in the belly of Air Force One, and a

               Her voice comes closer, filled with choking fear and panic.  
               She rounds the corner and Nevsky catches her hair with a

                         Open! Now!

               INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               Through the cockpit window, the glowing landing lights of 
               Ramstein Base are visible in the distance, cutting a wedge 
               through the German towns and fields.

               Zedeck's pounding continues.

                                     COT. AXELROD
                         Ramatein, we are fifteen miles away 
                         on final approach. I'm coming in 
                         fast and will need every inch of 
                         runway.

               RAMSTEIN A.B. CONTROLLER (V.0.)

               Copy, Air Force One. Wind is twelve knots from the east. 
               Tactical and emergency are in position.

               EXT. RANSTEIN AIR FIELD - NIGHT

               Rescue vehicle sirens gyre in the darkness. A team of black-
               faced commandos unload from troop truck. Snipers take position 
               atop rescue vehicles, barracks, and the control tower.

               High-powered rifles with infra-red scopes.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

               Zedeck aims his MP5 at the flight door. Fires off a dozen 
               rounds. Nickel sized indentations blossom across the steel 
               surface.

               INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               Dull thuds of bullet impacts.

                                     COT. AXELROD
                         Let's get this crate on the ground.

               They're some real good men waiting to help us.

               EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               The plane sprouts landing gear as it descends over the city.

               Coming in fast and low.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

               Gibbs shoves Zedeck aside. Produces a thumb-sized amount of 
               C-4.

               INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               Final approach... the landing strip not far at all.

                                     COL. AXELROD
                         Almost there.

               He raises his flaps. Air speed and altitude drop.

               EXT. RAPISTEIN AIR FIELD - NIGHT

               Spotters find Air Force One's navigation lights visible in 
               the sky, descending from the distant darkness. Followed by 
               the cluster of F-lSs.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

               Gibbs rolls out the C-4 like a kid making a snake in pottery 
               class. He presses it along the door seal.

               INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               Altitude decreasing. 300 feet... 200 hundred feet...

               The runway coming up to meet them.

               EXT. RAMSTEIN AIR FIELD - NIGHT

               As the entire airbase collectively holds its breath. Air 
               Force One's tires hover 50 feet above the ground... 40 feet...   
               30...

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

               Gibbs raises his pistol. Aims at the C-4. Fires. BAM!

               INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

               A BLINDING FLASH. The door blows in.

               EXT. RANSTEIN AIR FIELD - NIGHT

               The wheels touchdown.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

               Gibbs and Zedeck storm the cockpit.

               RNT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               Axeirod gropes at the plane's controls, trying to retain the 
               wheel. Gibbs dispatches Axeirod with one shot. Zedek is a 
               little messier with Ingrahams. But both pilot and co-pilot 
               slump over their controls.

               EXT. RANSTEIN AIR FIELD - NIGHT

               The taxiing Boeing 747 suddenly veers to the right cutting 
               across runways. Emergency vehicles give chase.

               The plane bounces. Is airborne for a second. Touches down 
               again with a jolt.

               INT. CORRIDOR - AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               Terrorists lead hostages to the conference room. Everyone is 
               bounced around, slamming against walls, spilling over chairs.

               A MASTER SERGEANT seizes the opportunity and grabs for 
               Bazylev's gun, but Bazylev shoots him almost point blank.

                                     BAZYLEV
                         Keep moving!

               INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               Chaos. Gibbs tries to pull Axelrod off the controls.

                                     GIBBS
                         Throttle up. Throttle up!

               Zedek slams the throttle all the wa up. Spotlights and sirens 
               swirl outside the cockpit window.

               EXT. RMMSTEIN FIELD - NIGHT

               The Flying White House careens toward the barracks, then 
               edges toward a hangar. The jet engines strain to reach full 
               power.

               INT. RAMSTEIN CONTROL TOWER - NIGHT

               The controller stares down at the out-of-control plane.

                                     RAMSTEIN A.B. CONTROLLER
                         Aw Fuck. We're losing it!

               INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               Gibbs pulls Axeirod's body out of the pilot's seat. Looks 
               out the cockpit window and sees...

                                     A C-141 STARLIFTER
                         in his path. A monstrous plane, every 
                         bit as big as Air Force One. Gibbs 
                         eases back on the wheel and the 747 
                         sluggishly responds, its nose creeping 
                         upward.

                                     GIBBS
                         Come on.

               Adjusts the flaps...

               EXT. RAMSTEIN AIRFIELD - NIGHT

               Air Force One closes in on the Starlifter. She's struggling 
               off

               the ground like some injured bird. The straining metal defies 
               gravity.

               INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               Gibbs senses that he's too close. He pulls way back on the 
               stick, risks stalling her out... but the bird responds.

               EXT. RAMSTEIN FIELD - NIGHT

               Air Force One barely clears the Starlifter, the edge of her 
               wing just missing the top of the C-141's tail.

               The sharpshooters, the emergency crews, the commandos from 
               Delta Force...  Nothing they can do but watch her rise out. 
               of sight.

               INT. FLIGHT DECK - LATER

               Gibbs and Zedeck. Gibbs checks over all the instruments.

                                     GIBBS
                         Okay, 30,000 feet. Give me my heading.

                                     ZEDECK
                         Bearing 110 point eight two.

               Gibbs banks the plane into a curve, then activates the auto-
               pilot.

                                     GIBBS
                         Call me if something changes.

                                     ZEDECK
                         That's it?

                                     GIBBS
                         To fly a 747 you need to know three 
                         things. How to take of f, how to 
                         land, and how to engage the autopilot.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               SERIES OF SHOTS--

               The terrorists, from every corner of the plane, lead the 
               stunned survivors, hands on heads, to the central conference 
               room.

               As Korshunov walks Rose up the corridor, he meets up with 
               Gibbs, descending from the upper deck.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         The rest of the secret service?

                                     GIBBS
                         Dead.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         How many others killed?

                                     GIBBS
                         Nine.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Any of us?

               Gibbs touches his bulletproof vest.

                                     GIBBS
                         No damages.

                                     ROSE
                         Where's my daughter?

                                     GIBBS
                         She's alive, ma'am, for the time 
                         being.

               Rose allows herself a half-sob of relief.

                                     ROSE
                         And my husband?

                                     GIBBS
                         The secret service did their job, 
                         ma'am. The President is safely off 
                         the plane.
                              (to Korshunov)
                         But that still leaves us plenty to 
                         bargain with.

               Eyes filled with hatred... Rose SLAPS Gibbs face.

                                     ROSE
                         Mr. Gibbs. You, of all people...

               Gibbs doesn't react.

                                     GIBBS
                         Follow me, ma'am.

               INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - DAY

               High-tech maps and communications systems line the walls, 
               surrounding an austere main conference table. Laptop computers 
               and secure telephones by every seat. Side tables. Tele-type 
               machines spitting out classified information.

               VICE PRESIDENT CHANDLER analyzes the projected course of Air 
               Force One on the tactical vid-map.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         We should have the President secure 
                         within minutes. Do we know who these 
                         terrorists are or where they're going?

               GENERAL NORTHWOOD, head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff...

                                     GENERAL NORTHWOOD
                         General Greely says it looks like 
                         the Middle East.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Does your office have anything to 
                         add, Mr. Dean?

               National Security Advisor WALTER DEAN leans forward.

                                     DEAN
                         The garners believe that, given the 
                         scenario, there's an 86% chance that

               we'll be dealing with a hostage situation and not an 
               assassination attempt. Not much else until there's more data.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         If we're dealing with an airborne 
                         hostage situation what's our 
                         procedure?

               The Under-Secretary of Defense, THOMAS LEE, punches up a 
               scenario on the lap-top.

                                     LEE
                         Our only policy assumes the plane is 
                         on the ground. Our hands are 
                         completely tied while they're in the 
                         air.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Okay, Gentlemen, we'll take no action 
                         until we confirm that the president 
                         is off the plane... Lee, go huddle 
                         with the D.O.D. I want an options 
                         paper on this in 20 minutes.

                         Twenty minutes?

                         You heard me.
                              (points to an aide)
                         You. Congress and cabinet heads.

               The aide nods and picks up a telephone.

                                     AIR FORCE COLONEL
                         Madame Vice-President?

               Chandler turns toward the door. The Colonel enters the room, 
               holding a black briefcase identical to Perkins'.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Yes?

                         now.

                         Thank you, Colonel. Have a seat.

               EXT. GERMAN FARMLAND - NIGHT

               A HUEY, flanked by a pair of APACHES, skims the surface of 
               wheat fields at maximum velocity.

               INT. HUEY COCKPIT - NIGHT

               The pilot checks his instruments. He's honing in on a signal.

               EXT. GERMAN FARKD - NIGHT

               The swirling spotlights of the Apaches finally illuminate 
               the Seal of the President atop the EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT POD.

               The Huey drops in for a landing and a half dozen Army Rangers 
               in full combat gear deploy to the pod. They open it.

               But.........

               IT'S EMPTY.

               INT. BAGGAGE DECK GANGWAY - NIGHT

               Bruised and battered, some blood smeared across his tuxedo 
               shirt... PRESIDENT JAMES MARSHALL lowers himself from one of 
               the overhead wing struts.

               He emerges into the bowels of Air Force one.

               He stands quietly a moment, listening... for footsteps, for 
               gunfire. All quiet except for the whine of the jet engines.

               He tak9s a moment to think. Considers his situation. His 
               eyes find the dead agent who risked his life so he could 
               make it to the pod. He trots down the gangway toward the 
               lower galley.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               Air Force One hovers atop billowy peaks. The smaller F-15s 
               cluster around her in a loose formation.

               FIGHTER PILOT #1 (0.5. RADIO)

               Sir, isn't there something we can do besides escort?

               COL. CARLTON (O.S. RADIO)

               Like what, son... shoot our own plane down?

                                     FIGHTER PILOT #1
                         No sir. I just wish...

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         Roger. We all wish... Now shut the 
                         fuck up and escort.

               INT. LOWER GALLEY - NIGHT

               Marshall looks around for a weapon... half-full coffee pot,

               stove, walk-in freezer, plates and silverware. Marshall picks 
               up a butcher knife.

               INT. CORRIDOR, AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               Nevsky and Bazylev guard the conference room door as Korshunov 
               and Vlad enter. Nevsky hands Korshunov a copy of the plane's 
               manifest.

                                     NEVSKY
                         Every weapon and every person is 
                         accounted for.

               Korshunov nods and enters the room.

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

               Korshunov surveys the hostages. Viad covers them at gunpoint.

               Rose holds Alice, comforting her.  shepherd, Doherty, Aides, 
               Advisors, Crew... Fifty of them huddle like sardines.

               The plane's doctor administers to the wounded.

               Korshunov stares down his captives.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Fear will keep you alive. Any one 
                         who is not afraid is bound to do 
                         something foolish, and bound to die.

                                     ROSE
                         What do you want with us?

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Cooperation. If you try to escape, 
                         you will be met with automatic gunfire 
                         and a barricade of your comrade's 
                         bodies will prevent you from exiting. 
                         Good day.

               Korshunov exits, with Viad backing out behind him. Leaving 
               the hostages alone. The sound of the door locking.

               A mournful beat. Everyone looks at each other and the dead 
               and wounded victims of this heinous act...

               Hushed conversation breaks out all over the room.

                                     DOHERTY
                         This can't be happening. You just 
                         don't pull this shit with the United 
                         States. You just don't.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                         Keep your heads.

               Caldwell paces, looks around the room.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Mrs. Marshall, are you okay?

                                     ROSE
                         We're alive.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         That's all that matters. Thank god 
                         the President got of f the plane.

                                     ROSE
                         Yes... thank God.
                              (to caldwell)
                         You there... Caidwell, right? What's 
                         on your mind?  caldwell takes a beat, 
                         then crosses to Rose and Shepherd.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                              (hushed)
                         I don't want to get anybody here 
                         excited, but if we can get out of 
                         this room, I can get us to safety.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         We're thirty five thousand feet up.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                         Yes, sir, that's a problem, but if 
                         we can somehow get to a lower 
                         altitude, the rear loading ramp on 
                         the baggage deck is equipped with 
                         parachutes in case of an engine 
                         failure. Now we can either wait for 
                         a political resolution, or try to 
                         resolve this thing ourselves.

                                     DOHERTY
                         You're goddamn right we can resolve 
                         this ourselves. We'll negotiate.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         You know the President's policy.

                                     DOHERTY
                         The President isn't here.

                                     ROSE
                         Right now we are an enormous liability 
                         to the United States. We can't just 
                         sit and do nothing.

               INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               The terrorists move toward the nose of the plane leaving 
               Nevsky to guard the conference room.

               INT. BAGGAGE HOLD - NIGHT

               President Marshall reaches the front stairway. Cautiously 
               climbs to the main cabin. As he reaches the top stairs, he 
               hears Russian conversation approaching. He ducks back into 
               the stairwell.

               He can't see them, but he can hear them.

               The terrorists pass within a few feet as they ascend to the 
               Mission Communications Center on the upper deck.

               Marshall waits a few beats, listens to the silence. Then re-
               mounts the stairs and almost runs into the back of...

                                     VIAD
                         Standing guard, facing the opposite 
                         direction.

               Marshall FREEZES... looks past Viad down the corridor where 
               Nevsky guards the main conference room floor.

               Unaware of Marshall, Viad reaches into his pocket and pulls 
               out a cigarette. Lights it. On the first puff he feels a 
               presence behind him.

               VLAD slowly turns around...

               Nothing there.

               He smiles at his jittery nerves, turns back round.

               REVERSE ANGLE -

               Over Vlad's shoulder...

               MARSHALL, flattened behind the edge of the galley divider. 
               He creeps away from Vlad toward the Presidential Suite...  
               stepping gingerly over dead secret service agents.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER -

               *       Korshunov pulls a handkerchef from his breast pocket 
               and wipes the blood from a telephone headset.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Proceed.

               Gibbs works the communications board, dialing in a series of 
               numbers. Telephone ringing...

               INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - DAY

               A map of Air Force One's flight trajectory is displayed on 
               the rear screen. Moscow to Berlin and back toward the Black 
               Sea.

               The assembled brass listens as Korshunov's voice slithers 
               off the speaker phone.

                                     KORSHUNOV (SPEAKER)
                         ...the Chief of Staff, the First 
                         Lady, and the First Daughter.  Our 
                         demands are simple. Arrange the 
                         release of Ivan Stravanvitch.  Once 
                         our leader is returned to Turkuenistan 
                         soil, Air Force One and it's occupants 
                         will be allowed safe passage to 
                         Switzerland. You have one hour before 
                         we start killing hostages.

               The phone clicks off. A silent beat in the room.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Find that voice for me, I want to 
                         know who we're dealing with. And get 
                         President Petrov on the phone.

               GENERAL CHARLES GREELY, head of the 87th Mechanized Air Wing, 
               the unit responsible for Air Force One, enters the room.

                                     GENERAL GREELY
                         Madame Vice-President, we just got 
                         word from Ramstein... The nod was 
                         UntiL Chandler stands.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Empty?

                                     GENERAL GREELY
                         The President... he must still be 
                         onboard.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Play back that call.

                                     TECHNICAL OFFICER
                         Yes, sir.

               The Tech Officer indexes back on his computer.

                                     KORSHUNOV (V.0. TAPE)
                         The plane is under our command, and 
                         those we did not kill we hold as 
                         hostages, including the Chief of 
                         Staff, the First Lady, and the First 
                         Daughter.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         but not the President. Not the 
                         President.

               A silent beat.

                                     GENERAL NORTHWOOD
                         He's dead then. They must have killed 
                         him.

                                     DEAN
                         We don't know that.

                                     GENERAL NORTHWOOD
                         Holding the president hostage is not 
                         something that slips your mind when 
                         you're making demands.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         And if he's dead? Do you really think 
                         they'd risk telling us?

                                     DEAN
                         There is a possibility we're 
                         overlooking.

               All eyes turn to Dean.

                                     DEAN
                         When I ran Specops in `Nam, I ordered 
                         the destruction of a V.C.  munitions 
                         dump. During insertion, the plane 
                         was shot down and the entire team 
                         was killed, or so we thought. Two 
                         days later the dump

               BLEW AND A WEEK AFTER THAT, THIS 19-

               year-old kid, the pilot... he walks out of the jungle in 
               pretty bad shape. He survived the crash and finished the 
               mission... alone.

                                     GENERAL NORTHWOOD
                         Walter, if you have a point, make 
                         it.

                                     DEAN
                         That kid's name was Jim Marshall.

               Most of the President's service record makes for dull reading 
               because most of what he did iarLZ ULirn.   History remembers 
               him for what he did aflar he got back to the states -- the 
               protests, the rallies -- But he was a soldier once, a damn 
               fine one.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         So what are you saying?

                                     DEAN
                         Maybe he's alive on that plane and 
                         those bastards don't even know it.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Mr. Dean, may I remind you that the 
                         President is not 19 anymore.

               INT. PRESIDENT'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

               Marshall cautiously enters the room. Ready for action.

               The room is empty, but it's been trashed by the firefight.

               The sound of voices... coming from the Duke game which still 
               plays. Marshall hustles over to one of the secure phones.

               It's dead. He tries the regular phone. Dead. Hangs it up in 
               disgust.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Goddamnit.

               He steps on some glass. It's a broken frame holding a 
               PHOTOGRAPH of Alice and Rose. He picks up the photo and lays 
               it on a table.

               He thinks for a beat... glances around the room, searching...

               Then he crosses to the closet, opens it and begins rifling 
               through his wardrobe.

               INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM.

               Caldwell stands on the conference table. The hostages have 
               removed one of the ceiling panels. Air supply ducts and 
               bundles of wiring run through the ten-inch space between the 
               ceiling and the shielding plates.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                         This is a dead end.

               Rose looks around the room. Hopeless. Her eyes land on the 
               carpet...

               INT. CORRIDOR.

               Marshall opens the stateroom door and slowly slides into the 
               corridor.

               Vlad still faces the opposite direction.

               Marshall creeps down the hallway, when...

               Beep... Beep... Beep...

               Marshall's watch alarm goes off.

               Marshall dives for the nearest doorway. Vlad swings round to 
               see a figure slip into the senior staff cabin.

               Vlad, unsure of what he saw., cautiously heads toward the 
               staff cabin. As he nears, he bends over a dead Secret Service 
               agent and pulls up the lifeless wrist revealing abeening 
               watch. It wasn't Marshall's after all. No matter. Vlad 
               continues to the staff Cabin.

               INT. STAFF CABIN - NIGHT

               Marshall frantically searches for something he can use as a 
               weapon. In the room: some video monitors, leather chairs and 
               phones. stainless steel cabinets run the length of one of 
               the walls.

               Marshall throws the cabinet doors open, revealing...

               A fully stocked MEDICAL CENTER... fold-down operating

               table... high-intensity lights. Equipped to deal with any 
               medical emergency the president might encounter.

               But too late. Vlad kicks the door open.

                                     VLAD
                         Get on the floor, now!

               Marshall yanks down the operating table, and it smashes into 
               Vlad, knocking him down. Marshall lunges with his knife, but 
               Vlad OPENS FIRE. A HALF DOZEN ROUNDS pump into Marshall's 
               belly. He's thrown back against the wall, then slumps to the 
               floor.

               Vlad approaches the crumpled body. Leans down to examine his 
               victim. He cups his hand under the man's chin and lifts his 
               head. Recognizes him.

                                     VIAD
                              (wonderment)
                         The President.

               But Marshall's eyes flash open.

                                     MARSHALL
                         That's right, asshole.

               He springs, shoving the butcher knife under the flack jacket 
               and into Vlad's spleen. Vlad freezes, unsure of what just 
               happened.

               Marshall is on his feet. Never letting go of the twisting 
               knife, he grabs Vlad by the back of the head and slams his 
               face against the mirror above the surgical scrub sink. The 
               mirror shatters and streams of blood erupt cn the terrorist's 
               face. The blood drips down into the white porcelain sink, 
               swirling into the drain.

               Vlad elbows Marshall in the neck, stunning him momentarily.

               He wipes the blood from his face, spins and hits Marshall 
               with a devastating right cross. Marshall reels back against 
               the wall, and Vlad follows, shoving the MP5 into Marshall's 
               throat. Marshall grabs the gun near the trigger...

               *                               VLAD

               Don't move or I'll blow your head off.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I don't think so.

               Marshall presses the saftey button on the gun with his 
               forefinger, then knees Vlad in the balls. Viad pulls the 
               trigger repeatedly as he goes down, but nothing happens.

               Instead he comes up swinging his gun butt against Marshall's 
               face. Like a bat hitting a baseball, it knocks Marshall into 
               the medical closet. The gun goes flying, skittering

               UNDERNEATH A CABINET.

               Marshall pulls himself up the shelves trying to keep his 
               legs from buckling. Vlad grabs some I.V. tubing and wraps it 
               around Marshall's neck. Marshall struggles for breath, clawing 
               at the tube.

               HE SPOTS A DEFIBRILLATOR, REACHES AND SWITCHES IT ON. LOW-

               pitched hum and beeping.

               Marshall pulls his head forward, straining against the plastic 
               tubing. Then slams back into Vlad's head. Viad releases his 
               grip just for a moment...

               The beeping becomes a steady whine.

               ... but a moment is all Marshall needs as he grabs the def 
               ib's CARDIAC PADDLES, turns, and SLAMS them on either side 
               of Vlad's head.

               Vlad convulses from the shock for a full five seconds... his 
               eyeballs roll, his hair stands on end.  then he collapses to 
               the floor.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Clear.

               Marshall catches his breath for a moment. Pulls open his 
               shirt. Beneath it he wears a bulletproof Kevlar vest. He 
               lifts the vest and a half-dozen angry welts have blossomed 
               across his skin. The stuff may be bulletproof, but each of 
               Vlad's shots sting like a motherfucker.

               EXT. CORRIDOR.

               Nevsky walks down the corridor. Sees that Vlad is away from 
               his post.

                                     NEVSKY
                         Viad?

               *       INT. STAFF CABIN.

               Marshall opens the medical cabinets, rifling through them.

               Pulls out hypodermics, adrenalin, rubbing alcohol... arming

               himself.

                                     NEVSKY (O.S.)
                         Vlad? Vlad?

               EXT. CORRIDOR.

               Nevsky works his way up the corridor, peeking in rooms.

               As he enters the...

               INT. STAFF CABIN.

               he's blinded by the high intensity surgical lights.

               Marshall cracks a tank of anesthesia across Nevsky's heu 
               Nevsky goes down.

               Marshall rips Nevsky's MP5 off of him. Holds it to Nevsky's 
               throat.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Where are th*y? fly tamily, the 
                         crew.... where are they?

               Nevsky says nothing.

               The conference room, right? Right?

               Marshall jerks him to his feet.

                                     MARSHALL
                         o'11 unlocli the door for me or I'll 
                         kill you.

               INT. CORRIDOR -

               Marshall walks flevsky toward the mj vonteronve room3 As 
               they pass the stairs to the upper deck, Nevsky breaks away.

                                     NEVSKY
                         KORSKUNOV!

               Marshall fires. Killing him.

                                     SHIT1
                         INT. CORRIDOR.

               No time for remorse. Marshall tries the Main conference Room 
               door. Locked. He knows the others will be coming so he 
               flattens himself against the corridor wall. Trains his gun 
               on the stairs.

               Just as the terrorists descend, Marshall squeezes off a few 
               rounds. The terrorists edge back up the steps, returning 
               fire.

               Marshall checks his clip, not many bullets left. He fires 
               off a few more shots to buy some time then ducks round the 
               corner and pulls out the bottle of rubbing alcohol and some 
               gauze.

               The terrorists seize the moment of quiet, descending the 
               stairs to take position.

               Marshall lights the gauze fuse of his new made Molatov

               cocktail and throws it down the corridor. The bottle crashes 
               into a BALL OF FLAME. Catching Bazylev on fire. He yells, 
               drops and rolls. FIRE SUPPRESSING FOAM immediately sprays 
               down from overhead.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Go after him.

               Serge hops Bazylev's burning body and heads down the corridor, 
               looking for this new wildcard. Korshunov grabs a fire 
               extinguisher from the galley and attends to Bazylev.

               INT. CORRIDOR, TOWARD THE REAR OF AIR FORCE ONE.

               Marshall retreats behind a divider. Sees Serge coming. Fires 
               a few rounds, then retreats to the next divider. Working 
               toward the rear of the plane.

               Serge picks his way through the rear cabins, advancing 
               cautiously.

               INT. REAR GALLEY/BATHROOMS.

               Marshall's out of plane. Nowhere to hide in the galley.

               Marshall eyes the bathrooms, doors flapping.

               FOLLOWING SERGE...

               as he reaches the rear galley and bathrooms. Marshall is 
               nowhere to be seen. But the bathroom doors are all closed.

                                     SERGE
                         I know you're in there. Come on out.
                              (a few beats)
                         Okay. Have it your way.

               Time for a deadly version of the shell game. serge fires 
               several rounds into the first closed bathroom door. The 
               bullets slice easily through the thin doors. He kicks the 
               riddled door open. The stall is empty.

               Serge moves to the next one. Same procedure. It's empty.

               Moves to the last bathroom, confident he's got him. He wails 
               with his MP5, turning the hatch into swiss cheese. Waits a 
               beat, then...

               Kicks it in. It's empty too.

               Serge looks around. Where the hell is this guy?

                                     KORSHUNOV (O.S.)
                              (calling down)
                         Serge?

               Serge reluctantly returns to his group.

               INT. LOWER GALLEY, BAGGAGE LEVEL -

               Marshall tumbles out of the cramped galley dumbwaiter, 
               breathing heavy. He slumps against the bulkhead and slides

               down to the ground.

               He takes a moment to pull himself together, to clear his 
               head. He hefts the MP5, refamiliarizing himself with the 
               weight and texture of a gun. He checks the clip. Only a 
               handfull of rounds left. He slaps it back in and switches 
               from automatic fire to single-shot then pantomimes firing.

                                     MARSHALL
                         The NRA'll love this.

               Looking down the barrel of the gun, he notices bins loaded 
               with luggage.

                         make it into Turkienistan airspace.

               I've got a satellite passing overhead in twenty minutes. We 
               can narrow down the landing site choices based on runway 
               length and any unusual activity.  With luck we'll only have 
               to capture three or four sites.

                         He's been holding on line four.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               Air Force One, lit up by moonlight.

               INT. CORRIDOR.

               The fire is extinguished. Zedeck squats over Nevsky's body.

               Gibbs and Serge maintain a defensive position, guns ready.

               Bazylev emerges from the Senior staff Conference room. He 
               shakes his head "no". Korshunov nods and furrows his brow.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Who did this?

                                     GIBBS
                         We checked the manifest. Everyone 
                         was accounted for.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         A secret service agent. It must be.

               Wounded but alive. Serge, Bazylev...

               Find him.

               Serge and Bazylev lock and load, head off in separate 
               directions.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         The conference room is no longer 
                         secure. We'll take the First Lady 
                         and the girl up top where we can 
                         keep a closer eye on them.

               INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM -

               The hostages have torn up a section of carpeting. Caidwell 
               and Shepherd examine the floor. Smooth sheets of steel riveted 
               together. Pointless.

                                     MAJOR CAL DWELL
                         We're not getting out that way.

               The door swings open and Gibbs and Korshunov enter. They 
               spots the ripped up carpeting.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Admirable, but you're wasting your 
                         time.
                              (beat)
                         Mrs. Marshall, would you and your 
                         daughter please come here.

               They don't move. Korshunov raises his gun, points it a 
               Shepherd's head.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Now, or he dies, please.

                                     ROSE
                         Come on, Alice.

                         I'm scared.

               Doherty steps forward. Shepherd tries to pull him back, to 
               no

               *       avail.

                                     DOHERTY
                         You've got the better part of the 
                         White House locked in this room, you 
                         know. If you want to negotiate, we're 
                         the ones to do it with.

               Korshunov SHOOTS Doherty through the head. Screams from some 
               of the hostages. Korshunov squeezes off a few shots to quiet 
               everyone.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Mrs. Marshall. Alice. If you please.

               Rose turns to the other hostages.

                                     ROSE
                         It's okay. Do what you're told. It's 
                         okay. We'll be okay.

               She locks eyes with Caldwell. HKeep working.N He nods.

               INT. REAR BAGGAGE HOLD -

               The President hunts through luggage. Overturned garment bags 
               and suitcases around him, belongings littered all over the 
               bulkhead. He sifts through heaps of clothing and finally 
               recovers what he's been looking for...

               A CELLULAR PHONE...

               He flips it open, starts to dial... but freezes.

               Bazylev, moving like a commando, slowly and methodically 
               works his way into the lower galley.

                         Yes, the number for the White House.

               INT. PILOT'S REST AREA - NIGHT

               The rest area consists of a couple of bunks behind the

               cockpit area, still soiled black from the earlier C-4 
               explosion. Korshunov pours a cup of coffee and offers it to 
               Alice.

                                     ALICE
                         I don't drink coffee.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         You must be tired. It'll wake you 
                         up.

                                     ALICE
                         No, thank you. The gunfire did that.

               Gibbs wraps Rose's hands behind her back with duct tape.

                                     ROSE
                         Leave my daughter alone.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?
                              (beat, he chuckles)
                         But I admire your courage. Your 
                         husband, on the other hand...

                                     ROSE
                         What do you know of my husband?

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         I know he left you behind.

                                     ROSE
                         My husband is a very courageous man.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Your husband is a coward. He sends 
                         soldiers half-way around the world 
                         to steal a man from his home in the 
                         middle of the night.

               Alice sits up, attentive.

                                     ALICE
                         You're one of Stravanavitch's men.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         So, you study world events, little 
                         one. That's good for a girl your 
                         age.

                                     ALICE
                         Yeah, I study world events. Five 
                         thousand Turkienistan Muslims were 
                         slaughtered in Stravanvitch's 
                         cleansings... along with 15 American 
                         school kids. You know hQw I studied 
                         that. I went to their funerals with 
                         my dad. I met their parents.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Smart for your age, eh? Top of your 
                         class? Tell me, do you know what the 
                         word "propaganda" means?

                                     ALICE
                         Yeah. Do you know what the word 
                         "asshole" means.

                                     ROSE
                         Alice!

               Rose doesn't know whether to be pissed at Alice or proud of 
               her. Korshunov smiles, nods his head and lifts his gun.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Yes, I have heard that word.

               He aims his gun at Alice.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Yes, I am an asshole.

               A long beat, the Korshunov lovers the gun.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Your father is a reasonable man.

               Once he hears our simple demand, I'm sure he will acquiesce. 
               For your sake.

               Korshunov smiles. Gibbs grabs Alice's hands and pulls them 
               behind her back. Begins wrapping them with the tape.

               INT. MAIN CABING, REAR GALLEY.

               Serge searches through the galley cabinets, spots the galley 
               dumbwaiter. Now he knows where his quarry went.

               He angrily grabs a service cart and shoves it into the 
               dumbwaiter, disabling it.

               INT. GANGWAY -

               Bazylev hears the beeps of a phone dialing. He moves toward 
               the aft portal of the gangway.

                         emergency. Let me talk to anyone.

               The switchboard operator thinks for a moment. Maybe she can 
               have some fun with this nutcase.

               Bazylev appears behind Marshall. Raises his gun.

                                     MARSHALL

               Bazylev points the machine gun at Marshall's head.

                         Hands away from your weapon.

               Marshall doesn't move, his np5 hanging at his waist... his 
               hand inches from it.

                         Come now. You don't want to die.

               Marshall... with no options... slowly moves his hands away 
               from the gun.

               Bazylev motions Marshall to get on his knees. Marshall 
               complies.

                         So a single missile launched from a 
                         distance should be a mere distraction.

                         Theoretically.

               Marshall on his knees, hands behind his head. Bazylev, his 
               automatic pressed against Marshall's forehead, disarms 
               Marshall before stepping away. He slings Marshall's MP5 over 
               his own neck. Studies Marshall a beat.

                                     BAZ YLEV
                         So you're the President. Somehow, I 
                         thought you'd be smaller.

               Marshall stares straight ahead tn silent defiance. Bazylev 
               kicks him in the gut. Marshall doubles over, wheezing.

                                     BAZYLEV
                         Not so powerful now, eh? No aides to

                         protect you, no armies to command.

               Bazylev grabs Marshall's hair and tugs his head back. He 
               holds Marshall with his eyes.

                                     BAZYLEV
                         You'll suffer for what you've done.

               Bazylev slams Marshall's face against his knee. Marshall 
               slumps forward.

                                     BAZYLEV
                         Up. Get up now!

               Marshall slowly rises to his feet. Bazylev swings wide around 
               him.

                                     BAZYLEV
                         You will walk ahead... slowly. Do

                         Do you know what's going to happen 
                         to you because of this? Do you know 
                         what the world will do?

                                     BAZYLEV
                         Nothing. The world will do nothing.

                         Well it worked.

               Korshunov smiles and puts his hand on Gibbs shoulder.

                         Relax, my friend. Apparently they 
                         cannot harm us. Even if they wanted 
                         to.  rNT. FRONT GALLEY.                                        
                         67.

               Marshall Struggles to assemble the hypodermic and the 
               container of adrenalin.

               INT. REAR BAGGAGE HOLD.

               Bazylev pulls to his feet, heads back down the gangway.

               INT. FRONT GALLEY.

               Marshall greets Bazylev with a spray of hot coffee from the 
               Simmering pot as he enters. Bazylev covers up, but the spray 
               sears him pretty bad. He yells in pain, turning.

               Marshall springs, imbedding the hypodermic needle into 
               Bazylev's neck. A full dose of adrenalin. Bazylev pulls the 
               empty needle from his neck. Marshall steps back, waiting for 
               a reaction.

               A pregnant pause as they both wait to see what happens.

               Then Bazylev smiles and slowly turns toward Marshall.

               Marshall backs away as Bazylev levels his gun.

               He fires once, hitting Marshall in the arm. Marshall winces 
               off the pain.

                                     BAZYLEV
                              (disgust)
                         The leader of the free world.

               He backs Marshall against a wall and holds him in his sights.

               But he doesn't shoot. His breathing becomes faster and faster 
               as the adrenalin takes hold. Building... building... He 
               screams and clutches at his throat.

               His eyes spin back and then his heart explodes.

               Bazylev is caught frozen, suspended in a moment of disbelief.

               Death reflex. He fires off several rounds from the gun as he 
               collapses.

               Marshall waits a beat, half-expecting Bazylev to rise. He 
               slowly approaches the body and retrieves the KP5.

               Marshall retrieves the phone, then wedges himself behind a 
               waste storage tank, out of view.

               Rose and Alice On the bunk. Alice's eyes are Watering.

               Korshunov examines tOPographic maps in the adjacent M1C.c.  
               and speaks into a phone in Russian.

                         earlier.

               Rose smiles sadly.

                                     ROSE
                         I know, sweetie. I know.

               INT. REAR BAGGAGE HOLD/INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM

               Marshall rips his sleeve off, swabs the blood off his arm.

               Bazylev's bullet took out a good chunk of flesh when it grazed 
               him.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Did they say anything about my family?

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         They're still alive, but the loyalists 
                         plan to start killing hostages in 
                         forty minutes.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Then tell me there's a rescue 
                         operation underway.

               Marshall opens a travel bottle of Vodka and pours it over 
               the wound. He winces from the pain.

               V.p CHANDLER                      69.

               I think we're okay, sir. flow that we know You're alive we 
               can force Petrov to release Stravanavitch.

               MARSpari Don't tell me you plan to give in to these fuckers.

               GENERAL NORmwOOD We plan to do whatever it takes to keep you 
               alive, sir.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         and if that means negotiating...

                                     MARSHALL
                         You know my policy. We don't negotiate 
                         with terrorists. If we start now, 
                         all of America becomes a target.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         But this is different, sir. You're 
                         the President.

               *                               MARSHALL

               And what happens when Stravanavitch is freed and discovers 
               he's got the President? You think for a second that that 
               crazy bastard is just gonna turn me over? He'll ask for the 
               goddamn moon before he's done.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         Please, Mr. President. You're going 
                         to get yourself killed. Is that your 
                         solution?

                                     MARSHALL
                         Freeing Stravanavitch is gonna get 
                         tens of thousands killed. I can't 
                         live with that.
                              (somewhat resigned)
                         I'm not royalty. I'm an elected 
                         official and the integrity of the 
                         office of the President is infinitely 
                         more important than the man who holds 
                         that office.
                              (beat)

                         I'm President. Is that understood?

               A long silence, then...

               YES SIR.      CHANDLER

                                     MARSHALL
                         flow, is there a rescue operation 
                         under way or not?

               Lee shakes his head at Chandler, signalling "don't tell."

                                     LEE
                         He's not on a secure line.

                         Where's the cavalry?

                                     DEAN
                         We can't do anything until that plane 
                         lands. And when it does land, sir, 
                         it's going to be in hostile *                      
                         territory. To be perfectly honest, 
                         we don't know what the hell to do.

               It's going to take a miracle to figure this one out.

               A long beat. We hold on Marshall's determined face.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I'll see what I can do.

               INT. GALLEY.

               Serge comes across Bazylev. Checks for any sign of life.

               Stone cold dead. He looks around and grips his gun a little 
               tighter as he backs out of the room.

               INT. MAIN CABIN.

               Serge closes the stair access panel to the baggage deck.

               Sealing Marshall off.

               Serge comes trotting up the stairs and collects new clips.

                         Bazylev is dead.

                         No. He has the advantage down there.

               Bring me a hostage. A woman.

               INT. FORWARD BAGGAGE HOLD.

               Marshall sees that the stairway hatch has been sealed.

               INT. LOWER GALLEY - NIGHT

               Marshall hits the button for the dumbwaiter. The dumbwaiter 
               begins to descend then snags on the service cart. Its motor 
               grind to a halt. Marshall slumps dQwn. His hopes dashed.

               Nothing to do now but wait.

               INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM.

               Serge looks over the crowd of hostages like a bouncer at a 
               hip dance club. His eyes fall on Maria Mitchell.

                                     SERGE
                         You. Come with me.

               INT. LOWER GALLEY.

               Marshall, seated on the floor. The cabinet next to him is 
               stacked with packs of complimentary cigarettes, all with the 
               seal of the President.

                                     MARSHALL
                         What the hell...

               He opens up a pack and puts the cigarette in his mouth. He 
               snags one of the Presidential lighters, tries to light it 
               several times but it only sparks. XC shakes it. It's out of 
               tial. He tosses it aside and reaches for a book of matches, 
               but he FREEZES in mid-reach. A thought occurs to him.

                                     MARSHALL

               Marshall, lacking a screwdriver, levers open the hatch to 
               the Avionics compartment with the barrel of his gun.

               RUT. AVIONICS COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

               Marshall sees the stacks of panels, piping, Wiring, 
               electronics.

               He searches up and down.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

               Serge leads Maria Mitchell up the stairway. Korshunov nods.

                         Ms. Mitchell. Hello again.

                         And what is it you do, Ms. Mitchell.

               Maria Mitchell's voice echos over throughout Air Force One.

               INT. AVIONICS COMPARTMENT.

               Marshall halts his search to listen.

                         One...

               Oh shit. Marshall tries to decide what to do.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Two...

               He climbs out of the avionics compartment and hurries to the 
               front baggage compartment.

                                     KORSHUNOV

               INT. MAIN CABIN.

               Zedeck and Serge wait by the stairway hatch.

               INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM.

               Hostages wait, expectantly.

                         Five...

               INT. FRONT BAGGAGE HOLD.

               Marshall frozen near the bottom of the steps. To go up would 
               be to betray everything he believes in, and lose any chance 
               to save the others. But if he stays...

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Six...

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER.

               Tears stream down Maria Mitchell's face. She's trying so 
               hard to be brave in front of Rose and Alice.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Seven...

               INT. FRONT BAGGAGE HOLD.

               For Marshall, this is the hardest decision of his life. His 
               face a mask of anguish as he wrestles with his conscience.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Eight...

               He starts toward the stairs.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER.

               Korshunov looking down the barrel of the gun.

                         Nine...

               INT. FRONT BAGGAGE HOLD.

               It takes every bit of training and will to stop Marshall 
               from going up those stairs. He knows what's going to happen. 
               He closes his eyes tight as if that will stop it from 
               happening.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Ten...

               A long silent beat. Then... BAAAAM!

                                     MARSHALL
                         NO!

               Marshall sinks to to his knees.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Aw, Jesus.

               INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM.

               Hostages hold each other tight for comfort. A mournful silence 
               fills the room.

               INT. FRONT BAGGAGE HOLD.

               Marshall, silhouetted in the half light, craddles his head 
               head in his hands. The shaft of light disappears as the main 
               cabin hatch closes, sealing him off once again.

                                     KORSFL3NOV (V.0.)
                         I'll give you a few minutes to think 
                         about that one and then we'll try 
                         again. Perhaps soon I will choose 
                         somebody important.

                                     MARSHALL
                              (to himself)
                         She was important.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER.

               zedeck and Serge drag the dead woman out of the compartment.

               Alice sobs quietly.

                         Do you have to be so brutal?

                         Yes

                                     ROSE
                         Why? Do you enjoy it?

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         I neither enjoy nor dislike. I do 
                         what is necessary.

                         at me as if I am a monster, but answer 
                         me this -- when your planes bombed 
                         the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry

                         their wives and children. They were 
                         people too, yes... but they were not

                         So is this.

                         That's the way of the world, little 
                         one. Didn't they teach you that in 
                         school?

               INT. FORWARD BAGGAGE HOLD.

               Marshall crosses back to the avionics compartment, talking 
               on the phone.

               Several of the hostages raise their hands.

               INT. AFO'S MAINTENANCE HANGER/ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE - DAY

               The Chief Mechanic has Air Force One schematics open in front 
               of him. He and his staff are huddled around them.

                                     CHIEF MECHANIC
                         Do you see the maintenance panel?

                                     MARSHALL
                         Got it.

                                     CHIEF MECHANIC
                         Pop it open. There should be a red 
                         switch, toggle it up.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Okay, it's on. We've got some 
                         indicator lights here.

                                     CHIEF MECHANIC
                         Okay, you're aerated. To dump the 
                         fuel you have to close the circuit 
                         for the pump. There's no switch in 
                         Avionics so you'll have to cross the 
                         wires. There should be five wires, 
                         just to your left. Do you see them?

               INT. AVIONICS COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

               Marshall finds the wires: red, white, blue, green and yellow.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Got `en.

               Static blankets the conversation.

                                     CHIEF MECHANIC
                         Okay, hang on. Let me double check

               here, because if you get the wrong ones, you'll cut the engine 
               feeds and stall the plane.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I'll wait.

               The static worsens.

                                     CHIEF MECHANIC
                         First... cut... green wire.

               Marshall, Using a kitchen knife, slices the green wire. Heavy 
               static. The phone beeps... lOsing batteries.

                                     MARSHALL
                         It's cut.

                                     CHIEF MECHANIC
                         cross it...  The static overwhelms 
                         the voice, then cuts out.

                                     MARSHALR'
                         Hello? Hello? Goddamnit.

               Static comes roaring back and garbled voices...

               MARSHAlj Hello? Are YOU there?

               Dead. Marshall tries to activate it again.

               MARSHAIJi Hello? Hello?

               Nothing. He tosses the dead phone aside.

               Marshall stares. Cross the green wires with the... what?

               Red, white, blue... or the yellow. His choice is obvious. He 
               cuts the yellow wire and crosses it with the green, leaving 
               the red, white and blue standing.

               He waits. The engines continue to groan. He allows himself a 
               smile.

                                     MARSHALL
                         An emergency landing in friendly

                         miracle.

               EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               Beneath the plane a trickle of gasoline appears and grows 
               into a strong steady stream.

               INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

               A red warning light flashes on the plane's panel.

                         Goddamnit it. We're losing fuel.

               Korshunov crosses to the flight deck.

                         How?

                         Avionics compartment! It's the only 
                         place. You better get Zedeck down 
                         there fast Unless, of course, you'd 
                         rather be a martyr than a savior.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                              (to Zedeck)
                         Go! Take Serge.. and watch your backs.

               Zedeck nods and dashes out of the cabin.

               INT. MAIN CABIN.

               Zedeck pulls open the hatch cover to the forward front stairs. 
               Descends into the dimly lit underneath.

               Serge descends right behind Zedeck.

               INT. FORWARD BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

               Zedeck, Spooked by the dark shadows, senses he's being 
               watched.

                                     ZEDECK
                         He's down here. I can feel it.

                                     SERGE
                         Shut up and do your job.

               Zedeck hastens toward the Avionics compartment, gun at the 
               ready. Serge sweeps the area behind.

               They hear a metallic clank echo and reverberate around him.

               They both check left... right... behind them...

               Nothing.

               It's creepy being a walking target.

               From behind a water storage tank, Marshall watches down the 
               barrel of his Mp5. With all the equipment in the way, it's 
               almost impossible to line up a clear shot.

               And they're both well armed. He looks toward the stairway 
               instead.

               Zedeck enters the Avionics compartment. Serge takes a 
               defensive position outside the door.

                                     ZEDECK (O.S.)
                         The valve is shut. This guy sure 
                         knew what he was doing.

               Serge hears a noise and opens tire.                                                         
               80.

                         You see him?

                         Erring on the side of caution.

               INT. AVIONICS COMPARTMENT -

               Zedeck opens a panel and rips out some wiring.

                         I'm going to deactivate the by-pass 
                         pump. It'll take a minute.

                         Over the Black Sea. I can probably 
                         get us to Turkey or Georgia.

                         No! If we land this plane anywhere 
                         else, we will end up another Entebe.

                         Gentlemen, forgive me for diverting 
                         you from your little wargames, but 
                         I've just added another demand to my 
                         very short list. I assure you it's

                         I'm sure we can strike some sort of 
                         arrangement. Land the plane and we'll 
                         trade you hostages for fuel.

                         No. The plane lands when I say, or 
                         it will crash. The hostages are 
                         released when I say, or they will

                         will execute a member of the senior

               Marshall marches Serge in, they're both tackled and smothered 
               by the group. They wrest the guns away and shut the door

               Marshall grabs a piece of paper and a pen. Scribbles a note.

                         Someone should give you a raise.

               They wait... will it work? A few beats, a few beats more. 
               The machine pulls the paper in and begins scanning.

               Marshall's note spits out of one of the fax machines. But in

               Caidwell assists everyone in strapping on their packs. He 
               addresses one group, mostly women and senior staff, who belt 
               into the larger chutes.

               Two neat lines ready to jump. One line on the deployment 
               wire, and the other set for freefall.

               Zedeck looks around. Crosses to the lower rear galley.

               He kicks open the panel on the stove. Rips out the propane 
               tank. He runs back and wedges the tank into the door lock.

               He backs off 50 feet, turns and opens fire on the tank.

               The remaining parachutists are blown out the rear. Chutes 
               deploying.

               Marshall and Serge are knocked down the ramp, tumbling toward 
               oblivion. Just as Marshall's about to slide off the corner 
               of the ramp he grabs its hydraulic strut.

               Plummeting death.

               His grip is all that separates his dangling body from a long 
               Serge tumbles by Marshall, limbs flailing, and with a scream 
               Woven from a thousand nightma5, he loses his grip and slides 
               off the ramp into the jetblack sky, falling endlessly.

               Shepherd and Caldwell manage to hang to safety webbing as 
               the

               Without chutes also manage to hang on.

               As the plane depressurizes, it BUCKS like a wild bronco.

               Marshall looks down into the sky. Below his dangling legs, 
               parachutes blossoij. He's straining... he can't hold on 
               forever.

               The broken edge of the fueling arm scrapes along the top of 
               Air Force One... metal against metal... tearing a gash in 
               the plane... Sparks fly.

               ONE OF THE SPARKS

               ignites the river of gasoline being pumped from the refueling 
               craft's belly.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE, COCKPIT -

               Gibbs Sees the fueling arm catch fire. It doesn't take a 
               rocket scientist to figure what's coming. The flames creep 
               up toward the gas tanks.

                                     GIBBS
                         Holy Shiti Gibbs pushes the stick 
                         down and Air Force One begins to 
                         dive to safety.

               EXT. SKY -

               Air Force One descends.

               Whipping fire trails the KC-135.

               Slowly rolls it way into the plane's main tank.

               A burning fuse.

               BARRROOOOOOOM! A FIRECLOUD ERUPTS ACROSS THE SKY.

               Sky like daylight.

               From this incredible firecloud, the burned out skeleton of 
               an airplane emerges, falling toward earth.

               The F-15 escort zoom toward the unexpected fireball.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         Everybody break. Now! Now! Now!

               Carlton's planes go into emergency climb, standing on their 
               afterburners to escape the inferno.

               INT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP -

               Marshall hangs on to the strut for dear life as the 
               pressurized air swooshes by him, taking with it everything 
               that isn't nailed down including some of the spare parachutes.

               Fire rains down from the heavens, the sky like one giant 
               napalm nightmare.

               The shock wave hits the plane, slamming it violently.

               Almost yanking the hyraulic arm from Marshall's grasp.

               The military aides without parachutes lose their footing and 
               tumble off the platform. SCREAMING as they fall into fire.

               EXT. SKY -

               The burning KC-135 shell, an apocalyptic Flying Dutchman in 
               a vengeful Kamikazee dive at Air Force One.

               It's gonna be close.

               The flaming shell passes only a few hundred yards to the 
               rear of the 747.

               EXT. PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP -

               Marshall's got a great view. Flames dance in his eyes as he 
               watches the refueling plane descend.

               The brightness subsides, and the sky grows dark again.

               The wave of pressurized air subsides leaving Zedeck, Marshall, 
               Shepherd and Caldwell on the ramp. Caldwell begins edging 
               toward Marshall.

                                     ZEDECK
                         Don't move.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                         Let me save him.

               Marshall barely hangs on.

                                     ZEDECK
                         That man, he is the president, no?

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Yes. Yes he is.

               Zedeck motions to Caidwell with his gun. "Go get him."

               Caldwell crawls down the ramp and extends his hand to 
               Marshall.

               THE PRESSURE DOOR SLAMMING SHUT -

               zedeck leads Marshall, shepherd and Caldwell away.

               IPRR. AFO'S FLIGHT DECK -

               Gibbs steadies the plane.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Fuel?

               Gibbs checks the guages.

                                     GIBBS
                         More than enough to get us home.

               EXT. WHITE HOUSE - EVENING

               The sun begins to set along the Potomac in long streaks of 
               red and pink. The White House lights flicker on uminating 
               the long staunch columns, the pillars of democracy.

               RNT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - EVENING

               Tired. Strung out. Bickering within the small workgroups.

               Chandler crosses to General Northwood, who has just hung up 
               the phone.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         They still have the President, it's 
                         past their deadline and they haven't 
                         called. What do you think it means?

                                     GENERAL NORTHWOOD
                         Like any good poker player, they're 
                         checking over their hand seeing which 
                         cards to play and which to discard.

               INT. AFO, MISSION COMMUNICATION CENTER - NIGHT

               Zedeck leads the three hostage into the M.C.C.

               Rose and Marshall - their eyes meet. Enormous relief for the 
               both of them. Marshall smiles at his wife, as she fights 
               back her tears.

                                     ALICE
                              (to Korshunov)
                         He didn't leave us.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         You are a resilient man, Mr.

               President.

               Zedeck grabs Caldwell's hands and tapes them behind his back 
               with duct tape. Rose and Alice already have their hands taped.

                                     KORSHUNQV
                         You must forgive the tape, but we 
                         were starting to feel outnumbered...

               Gibbs!

               INT. FLIGHT DECK -

               Gibbs puts the plane on automatic pilot. Rises to join the 
               group.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER -

               Korshunov separates Marshall from his family. Waves him into 
               the Com Officer's chair. His hands are now wrapped too.

               Gibbs enters looking down.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Special Agent Gibbs. You helped do 
                         this?

                                     GIBBS
                         Yes, Mr. President.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Why?

                                     GIBBS
                         Because it is my duty.

                                     MARSHALL
                         You're duty to what? The country you 
                         served doesn't exist anymore.

                                     GIBBS
                         My loyalty was never to my country.

               I serve my commanding officers.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         You don't think the leaders of the 
                         KGB would allow peristroika to ruin 
                         years of infiltration? No, when the 
                         Soviet Union collapsed, we took our 
                         sleepers with us.

               Korshunov holds up a telephone.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Now since we've had very little luck 
                         getting Washington or Moscow to 
                         cooperate, I wondered if you would 
                         be so kind.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Over my dead body.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         No. But since I only have a few of 
                         your staff left to kill, perhaps I 
                         will start with your family instead... 
                         Gibbs.

               Gibbs grabs Alice and shoves her into a chair. She fights 
               him off, and he smacks her across the face and shoves his 
               gun into her neck.

               Marshall and Rose struggle against their bonds.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         The world is such a dangerous place 
                         and we can't always protect our 
                         children.

                                     ROSE
                         Please. You can kill me but leave my 
                         daughter alone.

               Korshunov runs his finger down Alice's cheek.

                                     MARSHALL
                         She isn't a part of this. This is 
                         between you and me.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Call up Petrov and order 
                         Stravanavitch' S release.

               Marshall looks to Alice, then Rose, then back to Alice.

                                     MARSHALL
                         This administration does not negotiate 
                         with terrorists.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Pity. Mr. Gibbs.

               Gibbs withdraws his pistol. Places it against Alice's temple.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Perhaps a President does not 
                         negotiate, but does a father?
                              (beat)
                         An interesting choice. Your daughter 
                         versus your world vision. The implicit 
                         trust of a family against your oath 
                         of office.

               Tears of fears are streaming down Alice's face. She looks 
               into her father's eyes.

                                     ALICE
                         Daddy...

                                     MARSHALL
                         Alice... I...

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         And once the trigger is pulled, she 
                         is gone forever. Then, I wonder, how 
                         do you live, knowing you could've 
                         saved her?

               Marshall struggles with his duty. His honor.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         And could you ever forget the look 
                         on her face as she ceases to exist... 
                         Late at night, when you think about 
                         her, will Stravanavitch really matter 
                         anymore?

               Marshall tries to look away, but Zedeck forces him to watch.

                                     ALICE
                         Daddy. Daddy, please...

                                     ROSE
                         Jim... for godsake!

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Look inside your heart. No one will 
                         think you weak. Five...

               Alice's face, trying to be brave.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Four...

                                     ROSE
                         Jim...

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Three...

               Rose looks away.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Two. .

               Alice looks at her father for the very last time. Then shuts 
               her eyes tight.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         One...

               Gibbs begins to squeeze the trigger.

                                     MARSHALL
                         NO!

               Korshunov smiles.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Stop.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         You'll do it?

                                     MARSHALL
                         Yes, I'll do it.
                              (broken)
                         Just leave my family alone.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Good. Good.

               Gibbs withdraws the gun from Alice's temple. Alice opens her 
               eyes and gasps for breath.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Bring him the phone...

               You are true to your nature, Mr.

               President.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Someday, you'll regret my nature.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         You don't like seeing people get 
                         hurt. Now in morality, that is a 
                         virtue. In politics, however, that 
                         is weakness.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               A sleepless Petrov paces back and forth, smoking a cigarette.

               The phone RINGS. He looks up expectantly as his aide answers.

                                     AIDE
                         Sir, the President of the United 
                         States wishes to speak with you.

               Petrov stops in mid-pace. Considers his cigarette for a moment 
               and then walks over to the phone.

                                     PETROV
                         Mr. President.

               INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT

               A guard walks down the cold steel hallway. He rattles the 
               bar of a darkened cage, he pulls out a set of keys and unlocks 
               the door.

                                     GUARD
                         Stravanavitch.

               Stravanavitch awakes, and leans forward into the light. He 
               and the guard trade looks. After a beat, the guard turns and 
               retreats down the the hallway.

               Stravanavitch rises from his bunk and approaches the cell 
               door. He leans against it and it swings open.

               INT. M.C.C. - NIGHT

               Rose stares at Marshall. Her look is hard to read. Distant...  
               cold, perhaps.

                                     ROSE
                         Can my husband sit next to me?

               Korshunov considers the pair. Hands taped behind their back.

               They're harmless. Korshunov nods.

               Marshall rises and joins her on the pilot's rest bunk.

                                     ROSE
                         I don't know why you stayed.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Please... don't start with me.

               Rose moves closer to him, and speaks in a low voice.

                                     ROSE
                         There's something I need to tell 
                         you... and God knows if I'll ever 
                         get another chance.

               From behind, we see her push his taped hands away.

               He looks at her quizically.

                                     ROSE
                         No matter what happens, you have 
                         been and always will be my hero.

               He feels the wall behind him. A dull edge of metal twisted 
               slightly from the earlier cockpit door explosion.

               He understands.

                                     MARSHALL
                         And you have always been my guardian 
                         angel.

               She smiles back at him.

                                     ROSE
                         I will never regret my life with 
                         you.

               Behind Marshall's back, he begins to cut away at the duct 
               tape.

               INT. MOSCOW CENTRAL PRISON, HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Ivan Stravanavitch walks down the long prison hallway. Other 
               PRISONERS see him and begin banging on their bars in rhythm.

               As he parades down the corridor, the banging grows until it 
               becomes deafening. Stravanavitch smiles a cocky smile.

               One by one, guard doors swing open in front of him. In fact, 
               a few of the HACKS salute Stravanavitch as he passes.

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATION CENTER - AIR FORCE ONE

               The communication board beeps and Zedeck picks up the line.

               He exchanges some words with the caller in Russian, then 
               hangs up the phone.

                                     SERGE
                         It's confirmed. Stravanavitch is on 
                         his way out. Our men are waiting 
                         outside.

               Korshunov smiles and puts his hand on Zedeck's shoulder.

                                     ROSE
                         You got what you wanted. You going 
                         to release us now?

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         You're very valuable. And our nation 
                         needs so many things.

               Marshall leans his head against the wall. Just as he expected.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Could I... Could I have some water?

               Korshunov nods, motions Zedeck to take care of it. Zedeck 
               reluctanty descends to the main cabin.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         The taste of defeat is bitter, no?

                                     MARSHALL
                         One thing I've learned as

               President... all defeats are temporary and all victories are 
               temporary. Today' 5 conquerers are tomorrow's vanquished.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         e                    Very poetic.

               Zedeck arrives with a glass of water.

                                     MARSHALL
                         And there's one thing I've learned 
                         from being a sports fan.

               Zedeck brings the cup of water to Marshall's lips. Marshall 
               tips his head back to receive it.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         And that is?

               Water spills over Marshall's face. He shakes it off.

                                     MARSHALL
                         It ain't over, til it's over.

               With blinding speed, Marshall leaps to his feet and swings 
               his arm around Zedeck's throat. He snaps Zedeck's neck with 
               quiet efficency.

               Gibbs fires at Marshall, but Marshall, using Zedeck as a 
               shield, grabs hold of the terrorist'sMP5 and lets loose...  
               mowing down the former Secret Service agent.

               The rest of Gibb's shots pelt against the cockpit controls 
               sending showers of sparks flying.

               Korshunov whips out his gun and lines up a clean shot at 
               Marshall's head.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL
                         Mr. President.

               Korshunov fires at Marshall, but...

               Major Caidwell dives in front of the bullet spray taking the 
               rounds in his chest.

               Marshall turns his aim to Korshunov... but Korshunov grabs 
               Alice and presses his pistol to her head.

               Stand-off.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Don't be hasty.

               Marshall holds Korshunov in his sights. Slowly advancing.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         You love your daughter, Mr.

               President. And I love my country.

               It's a fair trade.

               Korshunov backs away to the steps. Marshall does not lower 
               his gun. Korshunov disappears down the staircase.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Shepherd.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Sir...

               Shepherd stands. Marshall unwraps Shepherd's hands.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Call Petrov...
                              (to Rose)
                         I'll be back.

                                     ROSE
                         Both of you.

               Marshall slowly descends the steps to the main cabin. As 
               soon as Shepherd gets her hands loose, Rose rushes to 
               Caidwell's aid. Shepherd crosses to the communications panel 
               and picks up a headset. Begins dialing numbers

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               In his nightdress, Stoli Petrov nurses a vodka on ice. His

               PHONE RINGS.

                                     PETROV
                         Petrov.

               Petrov's eyes widen.

               EXT. MOSCOW PRISON EXERCISE YARD - NIGHT

               A wall of bars part and Stravanavitch walks through. Into 
               the main exercise yard.

               The main gate separates him from...

               A group of men wait in the street by a limousine.

               The main gate opens slowly.

               When the men sees Stravanavitch they come to attention and 
               salute him. Stravanavitch returns the salute. And then starts 
               his march toward his limousine...

               A SIREN WAILS. LIGHTS FLOOD THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE 
               PRISON.

               The front gate begins to close. Worry crosses Stravanavitch's 
               face. His men rush toward him, take position by the gate.

               Stravanavitch breaks into a run toward his limousine.

                                     GUARD
                         Halt! Halt!

               Stravanvitch looks behind him. Guards rushing toward him 
               from the yard... the limousine fifty yards ahead of him... 
               closing fast...

               On the limo... the back door open and waiting.

               A shot rings out from the guard tower, followed by another, 
               and another. Like popcorn starting to pop. Stravanavitch's 
               men return fire. A minor war breaks out. Loyal guards battling 
               Stravanavitch sympathizers.

               Stravanavitch caught in the middle, hit by one bullet, then 
               another, then another. He makesit to the open rear door of 
               the limousine, but collapses dead.

               Everyone stops firing. Stravanavitch's men rush to his side..

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Petrov slips under the covers as an aide knocks on his door.

                                     PETROV
                         What is it?

                                     AIDE
                         It's about Stravanvaitch.

                                     PETROV
                         What about him?

                                     AIDE
                         He's dead, sir. Shot while trying to 
                         escape.

               A beat.

                                     PETROV
                         So be it. The world will sleep easier.

               Petrov turns out his bedside light.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE, MAIN CABIN - NIGHT

               Marshall ascends down from the upper deck. Spots Korshunov 
               by the front stairway. Korshunov pushes Alice down the stairs 
               to the underdeck.

               INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

               Autopilot engaged. A shower of sparks erupts from one of the 
               bulletholes in the panel.

               Directional compass... the course heading drifts off to the 
               south.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               The squadron of F-15 still surround Air Force One, which

                         for Iraq, sir.

               INT. PILOT'S REST AREA.

               Unaware of the course drift, Shepherd and Rose lift Caldwell 
               onto a bunk.

                                     ROSE
                         Easy, Major. Easy.

                                     MAJOR CALDWELL

                                     ROSE
                         You saved his life.

               Caidwell smiles, settles peacefully back in the cot. He dies.

               Rose reaches up and shuts his eyes.

               INT. LOWER GALLEY - NIGHT

               Marshall makes his way through the dimness. Stepping 
               cautiously.

               A shot rings out and richochets off a piece of piping right 
               over Marshall's head.

               Undaunted Marshall advances.

                                     MARSHALL
                         It's over, Korshunov. You won. Now 
                         let her go.

               He listens, footsteps ahead of him.

               ON Korshunov - holding Alice by her hair, practically dragging 
               her over the mid-section wing cross-braces.

               As Marshall appears in the gangway he fires off another shot, 
               hitting a cooling vent. Steam fills the' gangway area, bathed 
               in red auxiliary lighting.

               Korshunov retreats toward the rear of the plane.

                                     MARSHALL (O.S.)
                         There's nowhere to go.

               Iraqi pilots rush to their MiGs.

                         already in on this or they'll think 
                         we're spying.

                                     V.P. CHANDLER
                         If fired upon, tell our fighters 
                         that they are ordered to engage.

               INT. REAR BAGGAGE HOLD - NIGHT

               Marshall checks behind the racks of stored goods and luggage.

               P.O.V. LOOKING DOWN A GUNSIGHT AS MARSHALL WALKS INTO THE

               open.

               A finger on the trigger.

                                     ALICE
                         Dad, look out.

               Korshunov fires and Marshall dives out of the way. He cones 
               up in defensive crouch ready to shoot, but all he can see is 
               Alice.

                                     MARSHALL
                         How you doing, sweetie?

                                     ALICE
                         Been better, Dad... You?

               Marshall smiles briefly. But Alice is yanked around the 
               corner. Marshall hears foatsteps. He junps to his feet and 
               cautiously follows.

               INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - EVENING

               On the tactical display as a second group of fighters appear.  
               ready to challenge the F-l5's.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               Air Force One and the cluster of F-15's zoom by.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         Air Force one... please respond. Air 
                         Force One, you are entering hostile 
                         air space. Air Force one...

               All Carlton receives is static.

               INT. AFO'S COCKPIT.

               Nobody at the wheel. The automatic pilot is still engaged.

               INT. F-15 EAGLE COCKPIT.

               Con. CARLTON Okay, guys, time to earn your paychecks. Stay 
               in protective formation, and do not engage, I repeat, do not 
               engage... unless you are fired upon. All wings acknowledge.

                                     FIGHTER PILOT #1
                         Halo one, acknowledged.

                                     FIGHTER PILOT #2
                         Halo two, acknowledged.

               The rest of the pilots chime in.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE, LOWER AFT GALLEY - NIGHT

               Marshall swings into the cubicle... empty.

               He crosses to the cargo bay/parachute launch ramp hatchway.

               Looks through the porthole.

               Korshunov straps on one of the few remaining parachutes. He 
               tosses the rest of the spares out onto the platform.

               Marshall steps onto the platform. Korshunov fires off a round 
               forcing him behind the door for cover.

               Korshunov pulls Alice in front of him and yanks down the 
               ramp activation lever.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         Stay where you are.

               The ramp lowers, and Alice gets her first look at the drop.

               Marshall watches the remaining parachutes slide off the ramp 
               and into the stormy sky.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         There goes your ride.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Let my daughter go or I'll take you 
                         out!

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         If you put down the gun, I promise 
                         not to drop her on the way down.

               Korshunov backs toward the edge of the ramp, pulling a 
               struggling and fighting Alice.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Let her go now! Or I will kill you.

               Korshunov is a foot away from the edge of the ramp... two 
               steps back, he and Alice will take the plunge.

               Marshall lines up his shot. Korshunov laughs as he presses 
               his pistol to Alice's ear.

                                     KORSHUNOV
                         No you won't. You'll compromise...  
                         like always.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Hold on, Alice.

               Marshall fires, his bullet ripping apart a good deal of 
               Korshunov's face and snapping his body back.

               Korshunov tumbles off the platform, but his limbs are caught.  
               in Alice's. She's knocked to her belly and his dead weight 
               drags her off the edge of the platform.

                                     ALICE
                         NO!

               Marshall dives down the sloping platform, reaching out for 
               her...

               Alice tries to grip the platform with her hands, but she 
               can't hold on. Her hand slip off the metallic lip.

               But as she falls, she's caught by the wrist. Strong arms 
               pull her up. Her father's arms. He carries her back to the 
               safety of the plane. She's sobs uncontrollably.

                                     ALICE
                         Oh NY god... oh my god... oh my god...

                                     MARSHALL
                         It's okay, honey. I got you. I got 
                         you. You're okay.

               Shepherd and Rose appear. Marshall locks eyes with Rose...  
               smiles. Shepherd crosses to the parachute bins.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Gone. They're all gone.

               The plane shakes with the thunder of a supersonic boom.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               A half dozen MiGs race by the cluster of American aircraft 
               at breakneck speeds.

               INT. IRAQI CONTROL TOWER - NIGHT

               GENERAL CERALLOS eyes the radar.

                                     IRAQI SOLDIER
                         The Americans say they are escorting 
                         a damaged plane. Our pilots confirm 
                         they are surrounding a 747.

                                     CERALLOS
                         Did we warn them off?

                                     IRAQI SOLDIER
                         Yes. They refused to alter course 
                         and the 747 would not answer our 
                         hails.

               Cerallos takes a moment, looking at the screen.

                                     CERALLOS
                         It's some kind of trick... a 
                         preliminary airstrike in response to 
                         our troop movement.

                                     IRAQI SOLDIER
                         They are in our airspace. We would 
                         be within our rights.

                                     CERALLOS
                         The world would not look on us kindly 
                         if we shot down a civilian airliner.

               The Soldier listens to chatter coning over his headset.

                                     IRAQI SOLDIER
                         The pilot says it is does not have 
                         the markings of a commercial jet.

                                     CERALLOS
                         Warn then again. If they don't 
                         respond... shoot them down. We will 
                         not be intimidated.

               EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               INT. MISSION COMMUNICATION CENTER - NIGHT

               Another sonic boom.

                                     MARSHALL
                         What is that sound?

               Marshall makes his way to the cockpit.

               Through the cockpit window, a MiG accelerates out of the 
               darkness coming straight at us. At the last second it pulls 
               up slightly, riding over the top of the 747.

               Its sonic boom rocks the jumbo jet.

                                     MARSHALL
                         My god. I think that was a MiG.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         A MiG? Where the hell are we?

               Marshall rushes back to one of the rear upper deck windows.

               He looks out at the F-l5s.

                                     MARSHALL
                         They're flying a protection formation.
                              (beat)

                         This is your last warning. You are 
                         violating our airspace. Leave 
                         immediately.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         I said back off and hold your fire.

               We are on a rescue mission. Do not engage. I repeat, do not 
               engage.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               A MiG loops into position behind Carlton.

               INT. MIG COCKPIT - NIGHT

               switches his targeting computer on. Finds carlton in his 
               sights. Good tone.

               The pilot pulls the trigger.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               The missile detaches from the MiG and slides toward Carlton.

               Carlton breaks formation, leading the missile astray. His 
               plane tucks into a tight little roll. The missile misses 
               over Carlton's rolling wings.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         Halo Team, this is group leader.

               Halo Team is cleared to engage. I repeat, you are cleared to 
               engage.

               Carlton pulls his plane into a monster climb.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         This is the real thing boys. Let's 
                         fly and fry.

               A ringing phone is answered by an aide. A few beats.

                         It's the Chief of Staff calling...  
                         from Air Force One. They've retaken 
                         control of the aircraft.

                         Then tell him to get the fuck out of 
                         Iraq.

               INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

               Marshall settles into the pilot's chair. Shepherd comes in.

                                     SHEPHERD
                         Iraq, sir. We're over Iraq.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Iraq? Shep, you're fired.

               Marshall looks at the plane's bearing. The instruments are 
               shot to hell.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Shit.

               The MIG pilot targets Air Force One. He cuts his speed as he 
               lines up his shot. Gets a lock.

               Looking forward from underneath an F-15, the MiG heads toward 
               Air Force One. The F-15 fires a sidewinder.

               On the MIG... as it fires its missile. The F-15's sidewinder 
               blows the MIG up, taking the missile with it.

               Air Force One is clear... for the time being.

               MARSHALL STRUGGLES TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE 747. HE OVER-

               compensates and the plane rocks side-to-side.

                         What are you doing?

               Marshall checks out the tactical display.

                                     MARSHALL
                         I'm sure it's like riding a bicycle... 
                         downhill with no brakes and somebody 
                         shooting at you.

               Marshall finds the throttle, pushes it up all the way. He 
               feels the plane out, gently nudges it into a turn.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               Two MiGs flare out of an engagement with the F-15's and break

                         Bullshit. Do it.

               The two MiGs lock onto Air Force One. Each fires a missile 
               at the President's plane, before breaking in opposite 
               directions.

               INT. AFO COCKPIT - NIGHT

               A red buzz. It's all Marshall can do to keep the plane flying 
               straight.

               EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               Brightly burning flares launch from either side of Air Force 
               One's wings and descend toward earth.

               The missiles follow the heat of the flares, plummeting 
               harmlessly to earth.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE COCKPIT - NIGHT

               The shock waves from a nearby MiG explosion shakes the plane.

               In the aftermath, Marshall takes a moment and pulls on the 
               pilot's headset.

                                     MARSHALL

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               On the two MiG's heading for Air Force One.

               An F-15 drops in behind them. The MiGs scissor and break in 
               OPPosite directions. The F-l5 can only follow one of them.

                         I'm tight on one, the other's loose.

               I need help down here.

               The other MiG comes up on the 747 and opens fire with his 
               CANNONS. The shells rip up the surface of the aircraft's 
               wing. The MiG swoops past Air Force One and jerks into a *         
               vertical.

               On the damaged wing - Fuel starts leaking out and the outer 
               jet engine catches fire.

               INT. COCKPIT, AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               Red warning light flashes on the control panel.

                         We're hit. We've got an engine on 
                         fire.

                         Shut it down. Shut it down.

               Marshall reaches over and toggles the shutoff switch.

               EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               The engine whirs to a halt and the rushing wind blows out 
               the fire. But now she's only got three engines.

               INT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

               Through the cockpit window, an F-15 settles in front of Air 
               Force One... Flames pouring out of its tail. Under any other 
               condition, it would be pretty. Alice, Rose and Shepherd watch

                         you guys are busy, but we need some

                         Mr. President, it's an honor. Now 
                         with your permission can we lead you 
                         the fuck out of here.

                         You read my mind.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         Put your pilot on.

                                     MARSHALL
                         He's busy being dead.

               Carlton breaks left, lines up a MiG and fires. He nails the 
               Iraqi aircraft.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         Who's flying the fucking plane?

                                     MARSHALL
                         I'm doing what I can.

                                     COL. CAELTON

                                     MARSHALL
                         Negative. We've lost navagition. I 
                         don't know where that is.

               Buzzer sounds in Carlton's cockpit. He's been locked on.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         Oh shit. Hang on. Somebody help me 
                         out. I got one up my ass.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               Carlton puts his plane into a triple canopy roll then slams 
               on his airbreaks. The MiS shoots by him and Carlton lets 
               loose with his CANNONS. The MiG pulls up and disengages.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         Two and three are heading toward the 
                         Boeing.

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         Okay. We're gonna arc a fat one to 
                         the right. Got it?

                                     MARSHALL
                         Got it.

                         Stay cool.

               Canton's plane edges around to the right... and Marshall 
               follows. The 747 leans at an angle and continues the turn 
               until the F-15 is dead ahead. Another plane explodes ahead 
               of him at three o'clock.

                                     MARSHALL
                         How we doing, Colonel?

                                     COL. CARLTON
                         We still got three MiGs running around 
                         and six more on the way.

               EXT. SKY - NIGHT

               Of course its pointless. The Boeing is a fucking sloth

                         nothing to do, except call the Chief 
                         Justice.

               Dead silence in the room.

               General Greely ambles over to the tactical map and just stares 
               at it. He loosens his tie and scratches his head.

               Marshall, still fighting the yoke, stands. He takes a deep 
               breatn, drops the wheel and runs like a motherfucker for the 
               stairs.

               EXT. SICY,  AIR FORCE ONE.

               Drops into a banking twist.

               The cable line runs taut.

               The KC-lO tries to compensate.

                         Marshall dives down the stairs from 
                         the upper deck, comes up sprinting 
                         for the door.

               TNT. AIR FORCE ONE, COCKPIT -

               Engine four fails.

                         She's out of control. I can't pace 
                         her.

               INT. MAIN CABIN -

               The taut straining cable snaps one corner of the metal clasp.

               The clasp starts to bend.

               IN SLOW MOTION -

               MARSHALL sprinting to the open door.

               The clasp twisting. The cable hook ready to slip of f it.

               Marshall clips on, and dives out of the door. He slides forty 
               feet down, when....

               The clasp gives. The cable line snaps away from the plane...  
               one end connected to the KC-l0, the other connected to...

               Nothing.

               EXT. SKY

               Marshall slides down the cable, gripping at it, trying to 
               break his fall.

               Air Force One plummets toward the water.

               Marshall sliding, right behind it, running out of cable.

               At the end of his rope, literally. Marshall's harness snags 
               on the end clasp. He hangs on for dear life.

               Moments later Air Force One impacts.

               A huge EXPLOSION, water and flames blows sky high into the 
               night.

               The massive fireball and glowing remains of the Presidential 
               aircraft almost reaches up to where the President struggles 
               to hold on to the end of the cable.

               Marshall slipping off the line, unable to get a solid hold.

               His hands slick with blood.

               The belly of the KC-lO gets closer and closer.

                                     MARSHALL
                         Come on. Ten mare seconds.

               He closes his eyes. His fingers begin to give.

               Marshall huddles tight with Rose and Alice as a MEDIC attends 
               to their wounds.

                                     ARMY RANGER
                         Mr. President?

               Marshall turns to see this soldier, a fresh-faced, 19-year-
               old kid, saluting his Commander-in-chief.

                                     ARMY RANGER
                         Welcome aboard, sir.

               The KC-1O soars into the emerging sunrise, flying in the
