          A big, rich, powerhouse all-white high school located near
          the freeway into Cape Town. The RUGBY FIELDS are immaculate.
          FIFTEEN YEAR OLD BOYS in striped rugby jerseys train with
          total intensity under the critical eye of the COACH.
                         
          Right ACROSS THE BOUNDARY FENCE from the rugby fields is an
          area of WASTE LAND leading up to the freeway. There, BLACK
          AND "COLORED" (MIXED-RACE) BOYS of the same age play a loose
          game of soccer with a tennis ball. Most of them have bare
          feet and threadbare, dirty clothes, most of them are
          noticeably smaller and skinnier than the white boys.

          The rugby players are more disciplined -- or obedient -- and
          do not acknowledge the commotion until the convoy passes
          right by them. The coach shakes his head in disgust.

          NELSON ROLIHLAHLA MANDELA, 76, sits up and gets out of bed in

          the stairs and heads for the front door.
                         
          This is a nice, big house but it is amazingly modest for the
          President of a wealthy nation, and arguably the most famous

          conditions in the Highveld at this time of year.
                         
          It is so quiet that, for a moment, it seems as if Mandela is
          completely alone in the world.
                         
          The big yard is fenced. There is a small GUARD HOUSE at the

          that they are a few steps behind him.
                         
          They share a quick look. They hate this walk. It scares
          them. There's no way for it to be anything but completely
          unsanitary, from a security point of view.

          The house is now bustling with activity. A pretty member of
          the KITCHEN STAFF sets a single place at the head of a big,
          formal dining table.
                         
          A LADY CHEF stirs the porridge, a KITCHEN ASSISTANT cuts
          fresh fruit.
                         
          Mandela's PERSONAL SECRETARY, MARY marches out of her small

          Outside, Mandela is surrounded by men. Inside, he has
          surrounded himself with women of all shapes, colors and ages,

          Mandela opens drawers looking for another. He opens a drawer
          that is empty but for a WOMAN'S BEADED BRACELET, broken and
          shedding tiny colored beads.
                         
          Mandela looks for it for a moment, then closes the drawer,
          looks at himself in the mirror. Mostly, Mandela's face is
          warm, animated, energetic and this is how we see him, almost
          all the time.
                         
          But, sometimes, his face can be a remote, sphinx-like mask
          that conceals all emotion, all feeling. This is his prison
          face.
                         
          This is the face that looks back at Mandela, right now, in

          has marked his very soul.

          Two international front rows come together with bone-
          crunching force.
                         
          Huge, violent men grunt like bulls. The crowd roar vibrates
          the stadium. The scrum -- a phalanx of eight men locked
          together against eight -- wheels, buckles, then steadies
          under the watchful eye of the referee.
                         
          Fanning out behind each scrum are the backs -- faster, more
          glamorous players who will run with the ball, or kick it.
                         
          The Lions scrumhalf thrusts the ball into the maw of the

          laterally to the wing, with lightning speed.
                         
          The wing lofts a delicate kick just over the onrushing
          Springbok defenders. The Lions charge the ball, which
          bounces erratically --
                         
          -- right into the hands of the man who kicked it. One last
          burst of speed, one quick juke to avoid a desperation tackle,
          and the wing scores in the corner.
                         
          As the Lions kicker gets ready to convert the try, we find
          the Springboks huddling under their goal posts, hands on
          their hips, stunned.

          match. He is an ex-Springbok player from the boycott years,
          now turned ponderous, florid rugby commentator. He is a

          Springboks.

           I'm sorry, Madiba, but we've got
           problems everywhere we look.
           Housing, food, jobs, crime, our
           currency. You can't keep
           interrupting affairs of state to
           placate a minority.

           But, I must. This minority still
           controls the army, the police, and
           the economy. Without them, we
           cannot address the other problems.

          We have only seen snippets of rugby, so far. And mostly from
          a somewhat polite distance -- the usual distance of TV
          coverage. Say, at closest, the referee's point of view.
                         
          Not now. Not for the climax. We experience this beautiful
          piece of mayhem up close and personal.
                         
          We're inside the heaving scrums. We are the ball. We see
          the way cleats leave a pattern of round white dimples on
          abused skin, which quickly turn to purple as they fill with
          subcutaneous blood.

          the Springbok coach wanted.
                         
          This match is all about a less talented team stifling the
          best team in the world by sheer determination and fitness.
                         
          This is about the Springboks applying continuous, unrelenting
          pressure, and forcing the vaunted All Black attack into
          making mistakes. Lots of them.
                         
          Dropped balls, errant passes, knock-ons. No fluency of

          holds its breath --
                         
          -- until the Springbok wing scythes into him at thigh height,
          wraps him up and brings him down.
                         
          The second time Lomu gets the ball he is brought down from
          behind by Pienaar, with a picture perfect tackle.
                         
          We can cut away to the faces of the spectators when we want;
          from Mandela to Nerine to Sipho and on and on, all over the

          No tries are scored in the Final. The two fly halves match
          each other, penalty goal for penalty goal.
                         
          With each made kick, the goal posts shrink for the next. The
          penalty goals are unchallenged. It is up to the kicker to
          make them or fail. That is pressure.

          So tight, in fact, that there is only one score in the second
          half -- an All Black drop goal that levels the score at 9 -
          9.

          The scrum half sends a long, spiralling pass to the fly half,
          who is in perfect position to go for a drop goal.

          Real gold, against the green of the battered field.
