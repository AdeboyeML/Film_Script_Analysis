INDEPENDENCE DAY
Dean Devlin & Roland Emmerich



	AN AMERICAN FLAG

	Oddly still, posted in gray dusty sand.

	WIDEN TO REVEAL:

	EXT. LUNAR SURFACE - THE MOON

	One small step for man, one large pile of garbage for moon-
	kind.  Untouched for years, the flag stands next to the
	castoff remains of the Apollo mission.  Slowly the discarded
	equipment begins to RATTLE and SHAKE.

	AN ENORMOUS SHADOW creeps towards us blotting out the horizon,
	a loud RUMBLE is heard.

	Suddenly we are covered in DARKNESS as the SHADOW engulfs us.
	Only the lonely image of our EARTH hangs in the air, until a
	huge silhouetted OBJECT suddenly blocks our view.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. NEW MEXICO - RADIO TELESCOPE VALLEY - NIGHT

	A field of large satellite dishes scan the skies.

	Super up: S.E.T.I. INSTITUTE, NEW MEXICO

	INT. INSTITUTE - MONITORING CONTROL CENTER - SAME

	A lone TECHNICIAN works on his putting skills.  Behind him,
	wall to wall technical equipment quietly sifts through data.
	A RED LIGHT begins to flash.

	The Technician turns and slowly walks towards the source.  One
	by one a series of LIGHTS turn on.  The Technician (TECH ONE)
	grabs a pair of headphones.  His eyes widen.

	INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - SAME

	Sleepily a SUPERVISOR picks up the phone.

				SUPERVISOR
		If this isn't an insanely
		beautiful woman, I'm hanging up.

	INT. CONTROL CENTER - SAME

				TECH ONE
		Shut up and listen.

	He holds the phone up to a speaker, increases the volume.  A
	strange FLUCTUATING TONE plays out in sequential patterns.

	INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - SAME

	HEARING it, the Supervisor BOLTS UP, banging his head on the
	bunk above him.

	INT. CONTROL CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

	A pajama party on acid.  Five other technicians, in various
	states of undress, hover anxiously around the main console.
	The Supervisor enters, tying his robe.

				SUPERVISOR
		God, I hope it's not just another
		damned Russian spy job.

				TECH THREE
			(overlapping)
		Negative.  Computer affirms the 
		signal is unidentified.

				TECH TWO
			(hanging up the phone)
		The boy from Air Res Traffic say the 
		skies are clear.  No terrestrial
		launches.

				TECH ONE
		It's the real thing.  A radio
		signal from another world.

	The room becomes quiet as they realize that after years of
	searching the heavens, they might have finally found
	something.

				SUPERVISOR
		Let's not jump the gun.  Run a
		trajectory source computation.

	Tech Three slides over to another computer.

				SUPERVISOR (cont'd)
		I want to know exactly where it's
		coming from.

				TECH THREE
		This can't be right.

	Tech Three just stares at his screen in disbelief.

				SUPERVISOR
		What's wrong?

				TECH THREE
		Calculated distance from source is
		at three hundred and eight five
		thousand kilometers.
			(turning to Supervisor)
		It's coming from the moon.

	The Supervisor reaches over and turns up the volume on the
	speaker.  As they listen to the strange TONES we...

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY - PENTAGON - SAME

	Elevator doors OPENS revealing four star GENERAL GREY,
	Commander in Chief U.S. Space Command.  Understandably
	nervous, the COMMANDING OFFICER escorts him down the hall.

				GENERAL GREY
		Who else knows about this?

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		S.E.T.I. in New Mexico identified a
		signal but they're even more
		confused than we are.

	The General shoots him a disapproving glance.

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		Excuse me, Sir.

	He slides his security card through the lock and the doors fly
	open.

	INT. SPACE COMMAND - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS

	Banks of computers, Technicians and assistants working
	feverishly through the night.  The Officers cross the room.

	Super: SPACE COMMAND - THE PENTAGON

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		Satellite reception has been
		impaired but we were able to get
		these.

	They arrive at a glass table.  The surrounding officers snap
	to attention as a SECOND OFFICER quickly brings over a large
	transparency.  We SEE a grainy image of a large vague OBJECT.

				GENERAL GREY
		Looks like a big turd.

	The two Officers exchange a glance.

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		We estimate it has a diameter of
		over five hundred and fifty
		kilometers and a mass roughly one
		fourth the size of our moon.

	The General turns to the Second Officer, concerned.

				GENERAL GREY
		A meteor?

				SECOND OFFICER
		No Sir.  Definitely not.

				GENERAL GREY
		How do you know?

				SECOND OFFICER
		Well, er... it's slowing down.

				GENERAL GREY
		It's doing what?

				SECOND OFFICER
		It's... slowing down, Sir.

	The General walks over to a phone, picks it up.

				GENERAL GREY
		Get me the Secretary of Defense.
			(pause)
		Then wake him up.

							CUT TO:

	INT. WHITMORE'S BEDROOM - FRE-DAWN

	Laying in bed THOMAS J. WHITMORE reads a stack of papers.  The
	phone RINGS.

				WOMAN'S VOICE
			(filtering through phone)
		Hi. It's me.

	The warm look on Whitmore's face tells us everything about how
	he feels about the woman on the other end.

				WHITMORE
		Hi honey.  What time is it there?

	INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	Dressed in a night gown, MRS. MARGARET WHITMORE unpacks her
	briefing papers lays them out on a small desk as she talks.
	Through the window we SEE Los Angeles at night.

				MARGARET
		Two in the morning.  I know I
		didn't wake you?

				WHITMORE
			(filtered)
		As a matter of fact you did.

				MARGARET
			(smiles)
		Liar.

	INT. WHITMORE BEDROOM - SAME

	Whitmore sits up.

				WHITMORE
		I have a confession to make.
		There's a beautiful young blonde
		sleeping next to me.

	Sleeping next to him, his six-year-old daughter, PATRICIA.

				MARGARET
			(filtered)
		You didn't let her stay up
		watching T.V. all night?

				WHITMORE
		Of course not.

	The little girl stirs awake, looks up.

				PATRICIA
		Mommy?

				WHITMORE
		You're flying back right after the
		luncheon?  Okay, here she is.

	Whitmore hands her the phone and gets out of bed.  Habitably
	he turns on the television.

	T.V. - NEWS PROGRAM

	Several "Pundits" sit around a MaLaughlin-type news discussion
	program.  The picture quality is snowy, static ridden.

				PUNDIT #1
		... the inexperience in public
		office was inevitably going to
		catch up with him.  He's
		scarified his ideals for
		"politics as usual."

	Whitmore ties on his robe as he adjusts the picture quality.

				PUNDIT #2
		...I said this during the
		campaign.  Leadership as a pilot
		in the Gulf War has no
		relationship to political
		leadership.  It's a different
		animal...

	Suddenly the channel changes.  A cartoon comes on.  Whitmore
	turns to his daughter who holds he remote.

				PATRICIA
			(into phone)
		Daddy let me watch Letterman.

				WHITMORE
			Traitor.

	Whitmore exits the room.

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	As Whitmore steps out of his bedroom, a Security guard snaps
	to attention.  Someone hidden behind a newspaper, sits on a
	bench.

				SECURITY GUARD
		Good morning, Mr. President.

				WHITMORE
		Good morning, George.

	The paper is dropped revealing CONSTANCE HALBROOK, mid-
	thirties, aggressive, sharp, the President's communications
	director.  Quickly she gathers her things and follows
	Whitmore.

	INT. BREAKFAST TABLE - CONTINUOUS

	Two servants are preparing breakfast as Whitmore and Constance
	enter.  Whitmore sits down, grabs a coffee.

				WHITMORE
		You're up early this morning,
		Connie.

	She tosses him one of the many newspapers in her hands.

				CONSTANCE
		They're not attacking your
		policies, they're attacking your
		age.
			(another paper; reading)
		"...addressing Congress, Whitmore
		seems less like the President and
		more like the orphan child Oliver
		asking, 'please sir, I'd like some
		more.'"

				WHITMORE
		Clever.

				CONSTANCE
		Age was never an issue when you
		stuck to your gun.  You were
		thought of as young and
		idealistic.  But the message has
		gotten lost.  There's too much
		compromise, too much politics.

				WHITMORE
			(pointedly)
		Isn't it amazing how fast everyone
		can turn against you.

	Realizing she may be pushing him too far, she hands him
	another paper.

				CONSTANCE
		Well, the Orange County Register
		has named you one of the ten
		sexiest men of the year.

				WHITMORE
		You see, substance at last.

	An AIDE appears at the doorway.

				CONSTANCE
		Excuse me, Mr. President.  It's
		the Secretary of Defense.

	Whitmore goes to the phone, picks it up.

				WHITMORE
		Yes?  Say that again?

							CUT TO:

	AN OLD RUSSIAN SATELLITE

	Drifting away from us the old Russian satellite becomes
	smaller and smaller.  We PAN with it as we SEE it's on a
	collision course with something huge.

	Suddenly the satellite EXPLODES on IMPACT with the much larger
	object that dwarfs the puny piece of hardware.  As huge as it
	is, we get the feeling we've only seen a portion of the total.

	NEW YORK SKYLINE - EARLY MORNING

	A slow crane down from the Manhattan skyline, revealing...

	EXT. CLIFFSIDE PARK - NEW JERSEY - MORNING

	With the New York skyline across the Hudson behind them, old
	men sit in this small park playing chess.  Unlike the others,
	DAVID MARTIN is in his early thirties, sixties hippie meets
	nineties yuppie nerd.

	He concentrates intensely on his next move.  MOISHE. sixties.
	smokes a cigar impatiently.

				MOISHE
		What are you waiting?  My social
		security will expire, you'll still
		be sitting there.

				DAVID
		I'm thinking.

				MOISHE
		So think already.

	David makes a move.  Instantly Moishe counters his move.
	David furls his brow in thought.

				MOISHE
		Again he's thinking.

	Moishe reaches into a paper bag and retrieves a coffee in a
	Styrofoam cup.

				DAVID
		You have any idea how long it
		takes for those things to
		decompose?

				MOISHE
		You don't move soon.  I'll begin to
		decompose.

	Just as David finally makes his move, Moishe counters again.
	David shoots him a look and stares back down to the board.

				MOISHE (cont'd)
		David, I've been meaning to talk
		with you.  It's nice you've been
		spending so much time with me,
		but...

				DAVID
		Dad, don't start.

				MOISHE
		I'm only saying, it's been what?
		Four years, you still haven't
		signed your divorce papers.

				DAVID
		Three years.

				MOISHE
		Three, four.  Move on.  It's not
		healthy.

	Moishe takes a big puff on the cigar and coughs.

				DAVID
		Look who's talking healthy.

	Suddenly David's beeper goes off.

				MOISHE
		How many times is that now?  You
		trying to get fired?

	David moves his queen.

				DAVID
		Checkmate.  See you tomorrow, Dad.

	He gives his father a quick kiss and hurries away.

				MOISHE
		That's not checkmate I can
		still... Oh.
			(yelling after him)
		You could let an old man win once
		in a while, it wouldn't kill you.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - MINUTES LATER

	David pedals his bike through mid-town Manhattan.  He arrives
	at COMPACT CABLE SYSTEMS.

	INT. COMPACT CABLE OFFICES - LATER

	His bike hoisted on his shoulder, David squeezes through the
	revolving doors. MARTY GILBERT, short, nervous and harried,
	comes rushing over.

				MARTY
		What the hell is the point of
		having a beeper if you don't turn
		it on?

				DAVID
		It was turned on.  I was ignoring
		you.  What's the big emergency?

				MARTY
		Started this morning.  Every
		channel is making like it's
		nineteen fifty.  Snow, static, all
		kinds of distortions.  No one
		knows what the hell is going on.

	David deposits his bike in the kitchenette as Marty tosses his
	coke bottle in the trash.  David retrieves it.

				DAVID
		Damn it, Marty.  There's a reason
		we have bins labeled "recycle."

	Finding more bottles in the trash, David turns to Marty
	accusingly.

				DAVID
		What the hell is this?

				MARTY
		So sue me.

	Before David can say anything, Marty ushers him out of the
	room.

	INT. TRANSMISSION FEED - CONTINUOUS

	Technicians are working feverishly.  Clearly every monitor is
	experiencing varying degrees of signal disruption.  David
	moves over to the main console.

				DAVID
		Did you try to switch to
		transponder channels?

				MARTY
		Please, would I be this panicked
		if it was that simple?

	David examines the readouts, puzzled.

				DAVID
		Let's retrofit the dish to another
		satellite.

				MARTY
		We've tried.  It's not working.
		It's almost as though they 
		weren't even there.

	David looks up, puzzled.

				DAVID
		That's impossible.

							CUT TO:

	A TELEVISION SET

	Bad reception.  A hand SMOCKS the side of it.  No use.

							WIDEN TO REVEAL:

	INT. MOBILE HOME - DAY

	Eleven-year-old TROY BRENNON tries to fix the television.
	His older brother MIGUEL, seventeen, cooks breakfast.

				MIGUEL
		Stop it.

				TROY
		It's all fuzzy.

				MIGUEL
		You're gonna break it.  Just leave
		it alone.  Here, take your
		medicine.

	Miguel sits a small bottle of medicine and a spoon down in
	front of Troy.  Troy pushes the bottle away.

				TROY
		I don't need it.

				MIGUEL
			(pushing it back)
		Just take it, dick head.
			(turning to his sister)
		Alicia!  Make sure he takes his
		medicine.

	His sister, ALICIA, fourteen, hormones kicking in, testing
	boundaries, listens to her walkman while putting on too much
	makeup.  Miguel throws a dish towel to get her as Troy hits
	the television again.

	EXT. TRAILER PARK - SAME - MORNING

	A beat up pick-up truck comes down a dirt road and skids to a
	halt on the gravel next to the Brennon Mobile Home at this
	small shabby countryside trailer park.  An angry FARMER jumps
	out, slamming his door.

	INT. BRENNON MOBILE HOME - SAME

	Alicia opens the front door and smiles flirtatiously at the
	angry farmers, LUCAS, who marches over.  Miguel edges her out
	of the doorway, wanting to handle this himself.

				MIGUEL
		Morning, Lucas.

	Lucas holds a bowl full of rotted vegetables.

				LUCAS
		You like these!  I've got a whole
		goddamned crop full!

	Unceremoniously, he dumps them at Miguel's feet.

				LUCAS (cont'd)
		Where the hell is your father?
		You know what time it is?

				MIGUEL
		He had to re-fuel.  There musta
		been a problem.

				LUCAS
		We both know what the problem is.
		He's a damned nut case, is what he
		is.  I musta been out of my mind.

	Troy SMACKS the television again.

				MIGUEL
		Troy, stop it!  I swear to God!

				LUCAS
		Miguel, if he's not in the air in
		twenty minutes, that's it.  I'm
		getting someone else.

	Lucas storms away.  Again, Troy whacks at the television.

				MIGUEL
		Stop it, Troy!  I swear to God!

	Determined, Troy HITS the television again.  This time the
	picture goes out completely.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. SPACE - THE ORBIT - SAME

	Rolling over us, the immense under-belly of this enormous
	craft obliterates our view.  A loud SCREECH.  Suddenly the
	bottom begins to SEGMENT.

	Dozens of large sections begins to DISENGAGE, extracting
	themselves, twisting away from the larger bilge.

	The separated SEGMENTS themselves are enormous.  Slowly they
	twist downwards on a collision course to the blue planet
	below... Earth.

							CUT TO:

	INT. WHITE HOUSE - BASEMENT CORRIDORS - DAY

	Under a barrage of questions from her own staff, Constance
	hurries down the corridor.

				AIDE #1
		CNN is running a story that we're
		covering up some kind of nuclear
		testing experiments...

				CONSTANCE
		Tell them to run with it if they
		want to embarrass themselves.

				AIDE #2
		NASA has been up my butt all
		morning.  They want to know our
		position.

				CONSTANCE
		Our official position is we don't
		have an official position.

				AIDE #3
		Connie, what the hell is going on?

	Constance escapes into the elevator, turns around.

				CONSTANCE
			(smiles confidently)
		Come on, people.  Would I keep you
		guys out of the loop?

				AIDE #1
		In a second!

				AIDE #2
		Absolutely.

	Before she can retort, the elevator doors close.

	INT. OVAL OFFICE - WIDE SHOT - SAME

	The President, General Grey, the SECRETARY OF DEFENSE and
	White House Chief of Staff ALBERT NIMZIKI are gathered around
	the couch.

				SEC. OF DEFENSE
		At the moment, our satellites are
		somewhat unreliable.  Isn't it
		possible that thing may just pass
		us by?

				NIMZIKI
		What if it doesn't "pass us by?"
		Let's retarget some ICBMs to blow
		it out of the sky...

				GENERAL GREY
		Forgive me, but with the little
		information we do have, the only
		thing that would accomplish is
		turn one dangerous falling object
		into many.

	Just then the door opens and Constance enters.

				PRESIDENT WHITMORE
		What's the damage?

				CONSTANCE
		The press is making up their own
		stories at this point.

				NIMZIKI
			(to General Grey)
		Get on the horn with Atlantic
		Command.  Let's upgrade the
		situation to DEFCON 3.

				GENERAL GREY
		That's not your call to make, Mr.
		Nimziki.

				CONSTANCE
		Isn't that a little premature?

				NIMZIKI
		I don't think so.

				SEC OF DEFENSE
		We're two days away from the fourth 
		of July.  We have over fifty percent 
		of our armed forces on weekend leave, 
		not to mention the troops and 
		commanders we	have in town for the 
		Fourth of July	parade.  We call them 
		back now, we're sending up a major red 
		flag.

	They go quiet as Commanding Officer from Space Command dashes
	into the room.

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		Our intelligence tells us the
		object has settled into a
		stationary orbit.

				NIMZIKI
		Well that's good news.

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		Not really.

	He lays out the diagrams and photos on the table.  Everyone
	gathers around.

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		Part of it has broken off into
		nearly three dozen other pieces.

				PRESIDENT WHITMORE
		Pieces?

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		Smaller than the whole, yet over
		fifteen miles in width themselves.

				NIMZIKI
		Where are they heading?

				COMMANDING OFFICER
		They should be entering our
		atmosphere within the next twenty-
		five minutes.

	The room is silenced.  All eyes turn to the President who says
	nothing.  Nimziki leans in close to him.

				NIMZIKI
		Like it or not, we're at DEFCON 3.
		Recall the troops and put them on
		yellow alert.

	the door to the microwave.  We WIDEN to reveal...

	INT. DAVID'S CUBICLE - COMPACT CABLE - DAY

	David retrieves his home-make cup-a-soup.  We SEE this cubicle
	clearly has the David touch; ecology posters, plants, tons of
	computers and electronic gizmos.

				MARTY
		Please, tell me you're getting
		something.

	Marty enters, looking over David's shoulder as he eats.

				DAVID
		There's good news and bad news.

				MARTY
		What's the bad news?

				DAVID
		You're in meal penalty for
		disturbing my lunch.

				MARTY
		And the good news is you won't
		charge me.

				DAVID
		No.  The good news is I found the
		problem and it's not our
		equipment.  There's some weird
		signal embedded within the
		satellite feed.

				MARTY
		That's the good news?

	David slides over to another computer and turns on an
	intricate computation program.

				DAVID
		Yes, because the analog signal has
		a definite sequential digital
		patterns embedded within it.  When
		I find the exact binary sequence
		and I apply a phase reversed
		signal to that calculated spectra
		analyzer I built you last
		Christmas, we should be able to
		block out the overlay completely...

				MARTY
		...and we'll be the only guys in
		town with a clear picture?  That's

	EXT. CALIFORNIA FARMLANDS, IMPERIAL VALLEY - DAY

	Racing over back roads behind a long open field, Miguel rides
	his beat-up motor bike, searching.  Looking up he SEES
	something in the air.

	MIGUEL'S POV - AN OLD BI-WING AIRPLANE

	converted into a crop-duster, BUZZES overhead.  Spraying
	insecticide wildly, the plane zigzags over the field.

				MIGUEL
			(yelling)
		Russell!  God damn it, Russell!

	Looking down from the cockpit, RUSSELL BRENNON waves stupidly.
	Shaggy blonde hair and two days' growth, Russell is the image
	of a fifty-one-year-old little boy.

	Miguel follows him below, screaming at him.  Russell, flying
	recklessly, looks down at Miguel not understanding.  By the
	time he looks back he SEES...

	A LINE OF TREES

	at the edge of the field, nearly on top of him.  In a trick
	move, Russell turns the plane on ITS SIDE, and SLICES through
	the narrow gap between the trees.

	Miguel screams with delight at his prowess.  Miguel looks
	pissed.

	ANGLE - OTHER SIDE OF TREES - MOMENTS LATER

	Miguel races over, skidding to a halt next to the landed Bi-
	with plane.

				MIGUEL
		Just what the hell do you think
		you're doing?

				RUSSELL
			(climbing down)
		I'm bringing home the bacon.
		Earning my keep.  And doing a fine
		job if I do say so myself.

				MIGUEL
		It's the wrong field, you idiot!
		Lucas' farm is on the other side
		of town.

				RUSSELL
		You sure?

				MIGUEL
		Damn it, he was doing you a favor.
		You know how hard it is to find
		someone who doesn't think you're
		completely crazy?
			(MORE)
		What are we supposed to do now?
		Huh?  Where are we supposed to go

	Pissed, Miguel peels away, kicking gravel back at Russell.
	Pathetically, he reaches into his jacket and pulls out a

		Mr. President, you can discuss

		We must maintain a working

				PRESIDENT
		I want the Vice President,

				FEMALE CO-WORKER

		Huh?  Oh, good, hood.

		Strange thing is, if my

	Panicked they turn and RUN AWAY.  Russell just looks up at the

	Patricia bursts through the door and runs into her father's

	SKYLINE AND ALIEN CRAFT

	Protruding through the dark clouds we get a glimpse of the
	underbelly of a colossal ALIEN CRAFT, its outer veneer of
	smoke and clouds beginning to fade away.

	Below we see PANIC, cabs SLAMMING into one another, people
	staring, people screaming.  No one knows how to react.

	David runs to the other side of the rooftop, overlooking
	Central Park, to get a better look.

	DAVID'S POV - CENTRAL PARK - SAME

	The entire park is plunged into darkness as the craft above
	blots out of the sun.  Amazing as it may seem, the hovering craft

	bound.  As the Housewife turns she SEES...

				JASMINE
			(re: darkness)
		It's too early, baby.

	She turns back over.  Suddenly the room briefly RUMBLES.

				JASMINE
		Not even a four pointer.  Go back

	Shrugging, the man does.

	HOLLYWOOD SIGN (FORMERLY SC. 72) - SAME

	As Steve takes a pee, he SEES out the window a family packing
	up their car, others standing around staring at something in

	notice the DOZENS of neighbors quickly packing up and rushing
	to get away as he reads the paper oblivious.

				JASMINE (O.S.)
		You want milk with your coffee?

	Jasmine appears behind him, her view, too, obscured by the
	open newspaper.  Suddenly another HELICOPTER room overhead.
	Annoyed, Steve lowers his paper.

	STEVE AND JASMINE'S POV

	As the paper is lowered we SEE the helicopter SWOOP down.  As
	it flies away we SEE...

	THE ALIEN CRAFT

	Covering all of Los Angeles.  This is the first time we see
	the entire craft.  It is stupendous.  Steve's jaw hits the
	floor.  The milk goes CRASHING as Jasmine SCREAMS.

		Remember I told you that the

				MARTY
		Not really...

				DAVID
		That signal.  It's a countdown.

				MARTY
			(confused)
		A countdown to what?

				DAVID
		Think.  It's like in chess.  First
		you strategically position your

		right.  You strike.

	David motions to the television.

				BLITZER
		...there are additional
		unconfirmed sightings over Japan,

		They are positioning themselves

	Marty takes a beat to digest.  Then, grabbing the phone....

	Her expression drops.  She takes the phone from her.

	Kissing.  It's getting hot.  Alicia laughs, pushes him away.

	David starts to look it up.  Suddenly...

	DOZENS OF CARS HEADING STRAIGHT FOR THEM

	In the attempt to get out, hundreds of cars have been re-
	directed by the military to use the opposite side of the
	highway.

				MOISHE
		Oh my God!

	Moishe SWERVES violently to avoid collision, barely missing
	the oncoming traffic.  Dodging right to left, Moishe hangs on
	for dear life.

	A Military Office, assisting in diverting the cars turns just
	in time to see the Olds whiz by.

	David and Moishe are bounded around the inside of the car as
	Moishe tries to veer through traffic.

	Suddenly A TRUCK  blocks off their only escape route.

	Moishe turns HARD and drives up onto the right shoulder.

	OVERHEAD ANGLE - OLDS AND TRAFFIC

	The Olds is the only car in headed that direction.  Using the
	shoulder, swerving to miss barricades, they drives off an exit
	ramp.

				DAVID
		Nice driving, pops!

		Junk mail.  You don't want this.

	Steve quickly snatches it back, right it open and reads.  From

	Realizing, Jimmy puts a hand on Steve's shoulder.

		I don't believe it.  They make you

		How to kiss ass.

	Steve crumples at the letter and tosses it.  Angrily he opens his

	him.

	Leaning back out, Jasmine looks for Boomer who stares at her,
	wagging his tail.

		Boomer, come.  Come boy!

	Boomer LEAPS inside and Jasmine ducks to the side of the WALL
	OF DESTRUCTION hits the tunnel entrance, cars are JAMMED

		Any news on my wife?

				GENERAL GREY
		The helicopter never arrived at

	The missiles are headed straight for the alien ship.

	The first attack group, Steve's, are the first to near the
	colossal alien craft. Simultaneously they drop their AIM-9

	They reach the same quarter-mile proximity and EXPLODE.

	Steve's squadron BANKS hard, skirting the edge of the ship's

	ALIEN ATTACKER

	The Sidewinder overtakes the attacker as Steve ROLLS AWAY out
	of position.  Five yards before the sidewinder can get to the
	Attacker, it EXPLODES.

				JIMMY
			Shit!  They've got shield too.

	STEVE'S FIGHTER

	Banks back around to get a shot.  Just as he turns, three
	American Fighters are BLOWN TO RIBBONS from Attacker tracer
	fire.

	The Attackers are in hot pursuit of Jimmy's fighter.  The
	Fighter flying next to Jimmy is DEMOLISHED.

				STEVE
		Jimmy, roll right.  I'll cover.

	Jimmy's fighter narrowly rolls away from the tracer fire as
	Steve fires another Sidewinder, momentarily distracting the
	Attacker.

	Jimmy falls in line with Steve as the attackers turn on them.
	Both fighters jerk downwards at a ninety degree angle at MACH
	ONE.  Narrowly missing the ground, they bank away.  The
	Attackers can't follow.

	BOLTING AWAY at Mach 2.

	Both  Jimmy and Steve are held tight against their seats,
	straining against the G-Force.

	Two Attackers spot them and follow in hot pursuit.

	Steve and Jimmy are flying at breakneck speeds, the attackers
	slowly gaining on them.

				STEVE

	gain on them.  One catches up with Jimmy's fighter and FIRES.

	Laser-tracers SHOWER the Fighter.  It EXPLODES.  Job done, his

	Taking the moment, Steve DIVES down INTO THE GRAND CANYON.

				STEVE
			(to himself)
		Okay, jerk-off.  Let's have some
		fun.

	The Attacker recovers, dives after Steve who flies dangerously
	close to the canyon walls.  The Attacker has trouble keeping
	up with him but does.

	Steve puts on a clinic in advanced aerobatics, banking,
	diving, swerving.

	The Attacker seems to be improving, following closer and
	closer.

	Steve ducks into smaller canyons, twisting sideways.  Still
	the Attacker follows close.

	FUEL GAUGE - RUNNING LOW

	Near empty.  Frustrated, Steve gets pissed.

				STEVE
		Damn it!

	Steve turns down a dead and side canyon.  The Attacker is

	The Fighter is on a collision course with the end of the
	canyon wall.  Suddenly Steve yanks his ACES II - EJECTION
	SEAT.

	Stave SAILS UPWARDS into the air.

	The Fighter CRASHES into the canyon wall.

	The Attacker can't turn in time.  He tries to pull up, over
	it, just misses the top of the canyon wall.

	As the nose of the Attacker hits the tip of the canyon wall
	the Attacker is FLIPPED OVER, ROLLING END OVER END over the
	top of the canyon.

	The parachute on Steve's ejection seat pops OPEN.

	EXT. TOP OF CANYON - CONTINUOUS

	Rolling end over end, the Attacker is banged up BADLY as it
	finally comes to a stop.

	Not far away, Steve has a quick, hard, landing.  Rolling over,
	Steve quickly pops the buckles on the chute and frees himself.

	He stands and looks around.  Spotting the beat up and
	incapacitated alien Attacker, Steve gets an angry resolved
	look.  He marches over to the fallen alien Attacker.  He scans
	it quickly, spots a type of door that has been knocked ajar.

	With all his might, Steve YANKS the door OPEN.

	AN ALIEN

	For the first time we get a quick glance at these aliens, an
	odd hybrid creature with fluctuating skeletal structure.

	The reason we only get a quick glance is because the moment it
	turns woozily towards us, Steve rears back and SLUGS HIM IN
	THE FACE, knocking the alien totally unconscious.

	His anger finally subsiding, exhaustion taking over, Steve
	stands over the craft, slowly withdrawing the prized Victory
	Dance cigar.  He lights it and takes a long angry puff.

	Jasmine rushes over to a phone but the line is dead.  Taking

	Exhausted, Steve stops to wipe his brow.  He hears something,
	turns around.

	STEVE'S POV - THE TRAILER ARMADA

	Several hundred of the trailers from the refugee camp are
	headed en mass towards him.  Smiling, Steve signals them.

	The trailers pull up on either side, surrounding him.  Miguel
	leans out of his trailer.

				MIGUEL
			(sarcastic)
		Need a lift?

				STEVE
		When I flew overhead, I saw some
		kind of base, not far.

	Confused, Miguel checks his map.

				MIGUEL
		It's not on the map.

				STEVE
		Trust me, it's there.

	EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - LATER

	Flying over the desert, Air Force One sails over an immense
	valley, Area 51 below - hangars, a few buildings, a small air
	strip, not much.

	Super: N.I.A. Base - "Area 51", Nevada

	EXT. RUNWAY - LATER

	Air Force One lands.  Wheels touch down, skid.

	INT. HANGAR - LATER

	The large hangar doors open and Air Force One is rolled
	inside.  The President and his entourage are met by a
	contingent of base personnel led by field operative, LT.
	MITCHELL.  He escorts them to a side hallway.

	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

	Lt. Mitchell walks over to an odd wall switch as the President
	and his entourage wait in the center of the hall.  With a loud
	hydraulic HUM, the entire hallway begins to SINK DOWN, an
	enormous ELEVATOR.

				PRESIDENT
		Why the hell wasn't I told about
		this place?

				NIMZIKI
		Two words, Mr. President.
		Plausible deniability.

	General Grey shoots Nimziki a pissed off look.  When the
	elevator stops, a door SLIDES open.

	INT. RESEARCH FACILITIES - CONTINUOUS

	Stepping out of the elevator, they walk into a large state of
	the art, sterile clean research facility.  It is amazingly
	well staffed and organized.

				PRESIDENT
		I don't understand.  Where did all
		this come from?  How did this get
		funded?

				MOISHE
		You didn't think they actually
		spent ten thousand dollars for a
		hammer and thirty thousand for a
		toilet seat, did you?

	The President shoots him a look.  They are greeted by a group
	of SCIENTISTS in whit coats led by, DR. OKUN.

				MITCHELL
		Mr. President, I'd like to
		introduce you to Dr. Okun.  He's
		been heading up our research here
		for the last fifteen years.

	Dr. Okun is an odd, hyper-energetic man who's spent too much
	time in isolation.

				OKUN
		Mr. President, a real pleasure.
		They don't let us out much, you
		you.

				PRESIDENT
			(uncomfortable)
		Yes.

				OKUN
		Well, I guess you'd like to see
		the big tamale?  Follow me.

	They walk up a ramp at the end of the room.  Large heavily
	enforced doors SLIDE open.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - CONTINUOUS

	The group steps inside and nearly gasps at...

	THE ALIEN ATTACKER

	Just like the one that chased Steve.  The entourage stares in
	horror and wonder.  We can SEE the patch-work repairs they've
	made on the ship over the years.

				OKUN
		She's a beaut, ain't she?

	Moishe leans close to David and Constance.

				MOISHE
			(smug)
		Never any space ships recovered by
		the government, huh?

				PRESIDENT
		We've had this for forty years and
		you don't know anything about
		them?

				OKUN
		Hell no, we know tons about them.
		The nearest stuff has only
		happened in the last few days.

	The President slowly walks around the ship as Okun talks.
	David, mouth agape, just stares at it.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		See, we can't duplicate their type
		of power so we've never been able
		to experiment.  But since these
		guys started showing up, all the
		gizmos inside turned on.  The last
		twenty four hours have been really
		exciting!

				PRESIDENT
			(exploding)
		People are dying out there.  I
		don't think "exciting" is the word
		I'd choose to describe it!

	The room goes silent, letting the President blow off steam.

				PRESIDENT
			(calming)
		What can you tell us about the
		enemy we're facing?

				OKUN
		Not all too dissimilar to us.
		Breathes oxygen, comparable
		tolerances to heat,
		cold...probably why they're
		interested in our planet.
			(suddenly excited)
		Hey, you wanna see them?

	INT. MEDICAL RESEARCH VAULT - MOMENTS LATER

	The lights slowly TURN ON, illuminated the vault.  Okun leads
	the group to a sealed partition.

				OKUN
		This is vault, or as some of us
		have come to call it, the "freak
		show."

	Okun hits a switch and the sealed partition lifts revealing...

	FORMALDEHYDE TANKS - ALIENS

	Three dead aliens float in the milky formaldehyde tanks.  The
	murky fluid and condensation obstructs our view.  What we do
	see is not pretty.

				OKUN
		When we found them they were
		wearing bio-mechanical suits.
		Once we got them off, we were able
		to learn a great deal about their
		anatomy; eyes, ears, bipolar
		digestive system... no vocal cords
		though.  We're assuming they
		communicate with each other
		through other means.

	David cannot contain his fascination.  He steps forward.

				DAVID
		What kind of other means?  Hand
		signals, body language?

				OKUN
		Some kind of extra sensory
		perception.  Telepathy.

				PRESIDENT
		Can they be killed?

				OKUN
		These three died in the crash.
		Their bodies are as frail as our
		own.  You just have to get past
		their technology, which is, I'm
		sorry to say, far more advanced.

	The President turns to David.

				PRESIDENT
		You unlocked a part of that
		technology.  You cracked their
		code.

				DAVID
		All I did was stumble onto their
		signal.  I don't know how helpful
		I can be...

				PRESIDENT
		Show them what you've discovered.
		Work together.  We've got to find
		a way to beat them.

	EXT. SECURITY GATE - SAME

	Four armed GUARDS watch the gate.  An armada of trucks and
	trailers heads right for them.  They move into position to
	block their entrance as a blue pick-up skids to a halt before
	them.  Steve stands up from the back of the pick up.

				GUARD
		Sorry, Lt. Colonel, I can't open
		the gates without clearance.

				STEVE
		You want to see my clearance?

	Impatiently Steve grabs the Guard by the collar, pulling him
	over the side of the truck putting him face to face with the
	bundled parachute in the flatbed.  Steve rips the fabric aside
	revealing...

	THE ALIEN CREATURE

	Still unconscious, the alien stirs.  The Guard JUMPS BACK,
	shitting in his pants.  Quickly he signals for the other to
	open the gate.

	The armada quickly drives past.

	BLACKNESS

	Total darkness.  Suddenly light pours in as a  door is open.
	We see the faces of Okun, David and three technicians all
	peering at us with inquisitive expressions.

				OKUN
		See the gizmos flashing?

	REVERSE - INSIDE ALIEN CRAFT

	Sure enough, tons of gizmos with lights flashing.  High tech
	meets organic organisms.  This alien ship looks familiar to
	our own technology and completely different at the same time.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		We've been working around the
		clock trying to get a fix on all
		this crap.  Some stuff we figured
		out right away.

	David climbs in, fascinated.  He touches everything.  Okun
	points to everything as he describes it.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		This thing we're pretty sure is
		the life support for the cabin,
		this do-hickey over here is
		connected with the engines, this
		crap...we have no idea what that
		stuff is for.

	David is transfixed by it.  He stares at the small screens
	with flashing light patterns on them.

				OKUN (cont'd)
		But this over here is clearly what
		they use to navigate and guide the
		craft.

	But David still stares at the small screens.

				DAVID
		Someone grab my laptop for me?

	One of the technicians rushes off as Okun leans close.

				OKUN
		Find something interesting?

				DAVID
		Maybe.

	The technician hands David his retrieved laptop which he
	quickly flips open and turns on.

				DAVID
		These patterns here, they're
		repeating sequentially, just
		like...

	David turns his laptop around for Okun to see.  The pattern on
	David's laptop flashes identically as the alien screen.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		...their countdown signal.  Their
		using this frequency for computer
		communications.  It's how they co-
		ordinate their ships.

				OKUN
		You know, you're really starting
		to make us look bad.

	The two men exchange a smile.  Another TECHY pops his head
	inside.

				TECHY
			(out of breath)
		They got one!  They got one,
		alive!

	INT. HALLWAY OFF MAIN HANGAR - AREA 51 - SAME

	The bundled alien lays on a stretcher that's wheeled quickly
	into the hall.  Okun and his staff surround it.  Trailing
	behind them is Steve, Russell and Miguel.

				OKUN
		How long has it been unconscious?

				RUSSELL
		Excuse me Doctor...

				STEVE
		Three hours.

				OKUN
		Get him into containment, stat.

				RUSSELL
		My boy is very sick, he needs
		immediate attention.

	Okun ignores Russell, hitting the elevator switch on the wall,
	the room begins its hydraulic HUM.

				OKUN
		He's dying out.  I want him
		sprayed down with saline.

	Russell SLAMS his fist against the switch, the room stops.  He
	GRABS a doctor nearby, gets in his face.

				RUSSELL
		My boys is slipping into a diabetic
		coma.  If you don't do something
		about it right now he will die.

	Miguel is surprised and proud of Russell as he holds DOCTOR
	ISAACS, meaning business.

				DR. ISAACS
		O'Haver, Miller, come with me.
			(to Russell)
		Take us to him.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. ROAD - MAINTENANCE TRUCK - NIGHT

	Headlights pierce the darkness as the maintenance truck rolls
	to a stop.  Jasmine climbs down out of the truck, her face
	ashen.

	She walks past a sign reading: El Toro Marine Corps Air
	Station.  Tears begin to roll from her eyes.  We follow her
	gaze to see...

	EXT. EL TORO MARINE CORPS AIR STATION - CONTINUOUS

	The entire facility is smoldering, the last remnants of the
	fire burning itself to extinction.  Jasmine is devastated.

							CUT TO:

	INT. AREA 51 COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

	General Grey and Nimziki are in a heated argument.

				GENERAL GREY
		You were the head of the National
		Intelligence Agency!  You knew all
		about this.  When were you
		planning on informing the rest of
		us!?

				NIMZIKI
		It had been deemed classified.

				GENERAL GREY
		Christ, why didn't you say
		anything about this when they
		first arrived?  You could have
		warned us before we launched a
		counter attack that cost us
		hundreds of American pilots!

	Just then the President enters along with Constance and some
	other ADVISORS.  He examines a paper map of the United States,
	tacked to the wall, each major city circled in black.

				PRESIDENT
		Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia,
		destroyed?

				GENERAL GREY
			(composing himself)
		And there are scattered reports of
		sightings over Miami, Ft. Worth,
		And Memphis.

	The President and his team take seats at the large conference
	table.

				GENERAL GREY (cont'd)
		We've learned that NATO and
		western allied installations were
		the firs to be taken out.  We
		were next.  They knew exactly where
		and how to hit us.

	Grey sneaks an accusatory glare at Nimziki.

				PRESIDENT
		And our forces?

				GENERAL GREY
		We're down to approximately
		fifteen percent, Sir.
			(beat)
		If you calculate the time it takes
		them to destroy a city and move
		on, we're looking at world wide
		destruction of every major city
		within the next thirty six hours.

				PRESIDENT
		We're being exterminated.

	The room is quiet.  Constance runs her fingers through her
	hair.  The door to the room opens and Lt. Mitchell enters with 
	Steve.

				MITCHELL
		Mr. President, this is Lt.
		Colonel Steven Hill.

	The President quickly gets to his feet, anxiously shaking
	Steve's hand.

				PRESIDENT
		Lieutenant, congratulations.

				STEVE
		Thank you, sir.

				PRESIDENT
		Where is the prisoner now?

				MITCHELL
		We have him in isolation.  The
		doctors are very hopeful he will
		survive.

				PRESIDENT
		I'd like to see him.

				MITCHELL
		Yes, sir.

	The General is concerned but the President is determined.
	They head for the door.

				STEVE
			(to General Grey)
		General, I'm anxious to get back
		to El Toro.

				GENERAL GREY
		Didn't anyone tell you?  I'm
		sorry.  El Toro was destroyed in
		the attack.

	Steve is shattered, he had no idea.

							CUT TO:

	EXT. EL TORO BASE - NIGHT

	The injured are gathered around a small camp fire.  Jasmine
	walks up, dumping a box full of charred can goods.

				JASMINE
		These should last us a while.

	As Margaret tries to move, she winces in pain.  Jasmine rushes
	to her aid.  The color from her face drained, Margaret looks
	like she's taking a turn for the worse.

				JASMINE
		Don't move.  Stay still.

	Jasmine adjusts the bandages as Margaret turns and see Dylan
	curled up next to Boomer, too adorable.  Slowly he starts to
	wake up.

				MARGARET
		Your son.

				JASMINE 
		He's my angel.

				MARGARET
		Was his father stationed here?

				JASMINE
		He wasn't his father.  I was kinda
		hoping he'd want the job, though.

	Jasmine becomes sad, remembering.  Margaret changes the
	subject.

				MARGARET
		So, what do yo do for a living?

				JASMINE
		I'm a dancer.

				MARGARET
		Really?  Ballet?

				JASMINE
			(laughs)
		No.  Exotic.

				MARGARET
		Oh.  Sorry.

				JASMINE
		Don't be.  I'm not.  It's good
		money.
			(re: Dylan)
		'Side, he's worth it.

	The bandages changed, Jasmine sits down next to Margaret.

				MARGARET
		And when the dancing's over?  What
		about your future?

				JASMINE
		Funny, it used to scare me when I
		thought about the future.
			(looking around)
		Guess it doesn't really matter
		anymore.

	Dylan comes walking over.

				JASMINE
		Dylan, come here.  I want you to
		meet the First Lady.

				MARGARET
			(surprised)
		I thought you didn't recognize me.

				JASMINE
		Didn't want to say anything.  I
		voted for the other guy.

							CUT TO:

	INT. CONTAINMENT LAB - NIGHT

	Okun and two Medical assistants examine the alien creature.
	His arms and chest have been strapped down to the examining
	table.

	For the first time we get a good look at the head of this
	creature, long tentacled-type cords interlocked, covering the
	face.  The doctors attach clamps to each of the cords.

				OKUN
		Everyone ready?

	The doctors exchange nervous glances, nod to each other.  At
	the same moment all they pull on the clamps, unraveling the
	interlocked cords.  As the cords unravel, we SEE that this is
	in fact a bio-mechanical SUIT as we REVEAL...

	THE ALIEN

	Beneath the cords lay the unconscious face of the alien, his
	skin translucent, his body fluids, capillaries, muscle tissue,
	alien's skin.

				OKUN
		Do we have life support monitors
		recording?

				MED ASSIST #2
		Yes.  If we fuck up it'll all be
		on tape.

				OKUN
		Can we get some ventilation in
		here?  I can't take this smell.

				MED ASSIST #2
		They've conquered space travel but
		not b.o.

	As Okun begins to put on a pair of surgical gloves he suddenly
	grabs his forehead.

				MED ASSIST #1
		You all right?

				OKUN
		Yeah.  It's just that stink gives
		me a headache.

				MED ASSIST #2
		He's moving!

	Instantly everyone's attention is riveted to the arm of the
	alien as it moves beneath the sheet.  Unseen by the others the
	alien creature's EYES OPEN.

	Another SHARP PAIN hits Okun who SCREAMS, stumbling backwards
	grabbing his head.  The others turn in surprise.

	THE ALIEN

	Suddenly SPRINGS up, the restraining straps SNAPPING.  Before
	Med #2 can react, one of the alien's tentacles SMASHES her
	across the face.  She is sent sprawling backwards.

	LOW ANGLE - THE ALIEN

	Standing before her.  In a wink of an eye, he ATTACKS, leaping
	on her.

	Together they TUMBLE back into a formaldehyde tank.  Hoses
	are ripped from their sides and STEAM pours out.  We get quick
	glimpse of their struggle as the steam engulfs them.

	INT. HALLWAY - SAME

	Mitchell leads the Presidential party down the hall.  They
	turn and enter the Medical lab.

	INT. CONTAINMENT LAB - CONTINUOUS

	The group slows as they enter the room.  They see the
	containment room through the glass is covered with white
	steam.  Nothing can be seen.  It's eerily quiet.

	Cautiously they approach.  Suddenly Okun is SLAMMED AGAINST
	the glass partition, the creature's tentacles wrapped around
	him.  Pressed firmly to the glass, his eyes are shut, his
	expression pained, but when he speaks the voice is angry.

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Release...me.

				MITCHELL
		Open the door.  Get him out of
		there.

	Suspicious, General Grey stops him.

				GENERAL GREY
		Wait.
			(to Okun)
		Can you hear me?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Will kill...release me.  Now!

	They follow the tentacles with their eyes, up to the ceiling
	of the containment tank.  Suddenly the alien LEAPS DOWN,
	startling them, landing before them behind the glass.

	We see he's holding Okun against the glass, speaking THROUGH
	HIM.  This is the first real good look we get at the this bizarre
	creature.  Everyone in the room is repulsed and compelled by
	it at the same time.

	EXT. AREA 51 - NIGHT

	Through the hundreds of campers and trailers parked outside,
	Steve runs past until he reaches the open tarmac.

	A transport helicopter sits on the edge of the landing area.
	Steve runs up to it and climbs inside.

	INT. TRANSPORT HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

	Steve quickly starts it engines, preparing to take off.  A
	SOLDIER rushes over to the cockpit.

				SOLIDER
			(yelling)
		What the hell are you doing?  Get
		out of there!

				STEVE
		I'm just going to borrow it.

	The Soldier pulls out his pistol, taking aim.

				SOLIDER
		No you're not, sir.

				STEVE
		You really want to shoot me?

	Steve stares the Soldier down.  Reluctantly he lowers his gun.

				SOLDIER
		Shit.  I'm gonna catch the hell for
		this.

	Steve smiles and gives him a quick salute then TAKES OFF.
	Quickly the bird RISES UP and darts off into the night.

	INT. MEDICAL LAB - SAME

	The President has moved closer to the glass and is talking
	with the alien.  The alien uses Okun like a ventriloquist's
	dummy.

				PRESIDENT
		Why did you people come here?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Air...water...your "sun."

				PRESIDENT
		Where do your people come from?
			(no answer)
		Where is your home?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Here...now.

				PRESIDENT
		And before here?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Many worlds...

				PRESIDENT
		Can we negotiate a truce?  is
		there room for co-existance?
			(no answer)
		Can there be peace between us?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Peace?  No peace.

				PRESIDENT
		What do you want us to do?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		Die.

	The Alien moves closer to the glass staring at the President.
	Suddenly the President clutches his head in pain.

				NIMZIKI
		Mr. President?

				OKUN/ALIEN
		We kill you...all.

	The pain becomes more severe and the President SCREAM OUT.
	There is general panic as people rush to the President's side.

				GENERAL GREY
			(to Mitchell)
		Is that glass bullet proof?

				MITCHELL
		No sir.

	The General draws his pistol.  Mitchell and the other military
	officers follow his lead.  Simultaneously they all begin to
	FIRE!

	The glass SHATTERS into a billion pieces.  The Alien is cut to
	ribbons, falling backwards.

	The President collapses.  So does Okun.  A STAFFER rushes over
	to Okun, checks his pulse.

				STAFFER
		He's dead.

	General Grey moves to the President who slowly recovers.

				GENERAL GREY
		Mr. President, are you okay?

	Woozily the President sits up, a strange look in his eye.

				PRESIDENT
		He wanted me to understand.  He
		communicated with me.
			(turning to Grey)
		They're like locusts.  They travel
		from planet to planet, their whole
		civilization.  After they've
		consumed every natural resource
		they move on.  And we're next.

	The President stands with a new resolve.  He stares at the
	dead alien on the floor.

				PRESIDENT
			(cold)
		Prepare a nuclear strike.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - MINUTES LATER

	The research staff are working near the recovered alien
	attacker.  Constance comes rushing in.  She looks around for

	INT. OFFICES - CONTINUOUS

	Holding a bottle of Jack Daniels, David fishes through a small
	refrigerator as Constance enters.

				DAVID
		Just my luck, no ice.

				CONSTANCE
		I take it you've heard.

				DAVID
		A toast to the end of the world.

	David toasts her with the bottle, takes a swig.

				CONSTANCE
		He didn't come to this decision
		lightly.

	David nods, he doesn't want to argue.  He smiles cynically.

				DAVID
		You still believe in him.

				CONSTANCE
		He's a good man.

				DAVID
		Better be.  You left me for him.

				CONSTANCE
		I wanted a career.  Didn't you
		ever want to be part of something

		the target?

	TANK COMMANDER'S POV THROUGH PERISCOPE - SAME

	As the cloud begins to dissipate we see THE SPACE CRAFT IS
	STILL THERE, completely unharmed.

	INT. ARMORED TANK - SAME

				TANK COMMANDER
		Negative.  Target remains.

	INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

	On the monitors as well, we can see the target remain.  The
	air is let out of the room, everyone deflated.

				PRESIDENT
		Call them back.

				NIMZIKI
		The other bombers might have more
		luck.  We shouldn't just give
		up...

				PRESIDENT
		I said call them back.

	As the technicians call the bombers away, the President sinks
	into a depression.  His last hope of survival gone.

	EXT. EL TORO MARINE CORPS AIR STATION - NIGHT

	Jasmine keeps Margaret company as the rest sleep around the
	last flames of their campfire.  From the worried expression on
	Jasmine's face we can tell that Margaret has gotten worse, her
	wounds bleeding badly.

	A WIND kicks up, the sound of an ENGINE approaching.  Jasmine
	squints her eyes looking up into the wind when a BRIGHT LIGHT
	engulfs her.

	JASMINE'S POV - LIGHTS - NIGHT

	Bright lights in the sky growing nearer.  Slowly the others
	begin to wake up, frightened as the lights INTENSIFY.

	The others slowly begin to retreat but Jasmine stands, staring
	defiantly.  A smile creeps across her face as she sees that
	the lights belong to...

	TRANSPORT HELICOPTER

	The Transport Helicopter touches down and Steve leaps out,
	racing towards Jasmine.  Overwhelmed, Jasmine jumps into his
	arms.

				JASMINE
		You're late.

				STEVE
		You know how I like to make a big
		entrance.

	They kiss.

							CUT TO:

	INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

	The double doors burst open as the President carrying his
	young daughter marches through.  Doctor ISAACS comes over to
	them.

				PRESIDENT
		How is she?

				ISAACS
		I'm sorry, Mr. President.  If only
		we could have gotten to her
		sooner.

	The President puts his daughter down as he sees...

	PRESIDENT'S POV - MARGARET

	Margaret lays in bed, doctors and nurses surrounding her.
	Patricia rushes over.

				ISAACS
		She's bleeding internally.
		There's nothing else we can do.

	Stunned, the President watches as Patricia hugs her mother.

				MARGARET
		Hiya Munchkin.

				PATRICIA
		Mommy, we were worried.  We didn't
		know where you were.

				MARGARET
		I'm right here, baby.

	Recovering, the President nods for the doctors to leave the
	room.  As they begin to march out, he makes his way over to
	his wife and daughter.

				PRESIDENT
		Honey, why don't you wait outside
		so Mommy can get some rest.

	Patricia kisses her mother, says goodbye and leaves.  Out of
	sight, Margaret winces, fading away.  The President grabs her
	hand for support.  She squeezes tightly.

				MARGARET
			(through tears)
		I'm scared, Tom.

				PRESIDENT
		It's okay.  The doctors said
		you're going to be just fine.

	Margaret smiles at the man she knows all too well.

				MARGARET
		Liar.

	The look between them says more than any words.

	INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE MARGARET'S ROOM - LATER

	The President exits the room, overcome with emotion.
	Constance, the doctors and some medical crew move to comfort
	him.  He holds them off with a gesture.

	He looks up and sees Jasmine, Steve and Dylan down the hall.
	He pushes through the crowd and makes his way over to them.

				JASMINE
		I'm so sorry.

				PRESIDENT
		I just wanted to thank you.
		You're a very brave woman.

	Across the hall, Patricia sits in a chair, waiting.  Whitmore
	walks over to her and kneels down next to his small child.

				PATRICIA
		Is Mommy sleeping now?

				PRESIDENT
		Yes, baby.  Mommy's sleeping.

	EXT. AREA 51 - NIGHT

	David is drunkenly knocking everything over, making a gigantic
	mess.  Moishe comes up behind, restraining him.

				MOISHE
		David, David!  What the hell are
		you doing!?

				DAVID
		I'm making a mess.

				MOISHE
		This I can see.

				DAVID
		We've gotta burn the rain forest,
		Pops.  Dump toxic waste, pollute
		the air, rip up the ozone.  Maybe
		if we screw this planet up enough
		they won't want it anymore.

				MOISHE
		David, you're drunk.

	David slips, falls on his ass, hard.  Moishe helps him back up
	on his feet.

				MOISHE
		I think you better sleep this off.
		Go back inside before you catch a
		cold.

	Slowly David looks up towards Moishe, an idea.

				DAVID
		Pops, you're a genius!

				MOISHE
		What'd I say?

				DAVID
		A cold?  Of course.

	Sobered, David jumps kisses his father and bolts inside.

							CUT TO:

	INT. STORAGE LAB - DAY

	A large crowd has been gathered here at the lab.  General Grey
	and Nimziki walk up to Constance.

				NIMZIKI
		All right, Connie, we're here.
		What's this all about?

				CONSTANCE
		I really have no idea.  He just
		said to bring everyone down here.

	Steve shows Dylan the alien space craft.

				DYLAN
		Does that thing fly in outer
		space?

	Steve loos up at the craft admiringly.

				STEVE
		It certainly does.

	When the President enters a technician rushes over and knocks
	on the hatch door on the alien attacker.  The door swings open
	and David climbs down.

	Grabbing a coke can from the "recycle" trash bin, David places
	the empty can on top of the alien attacker.  David turns and
	faces the gathering.

				DAVID
		Could anyone please step back
		away from the craft?

	They do and David nods to a Technician inside the craft.  The
	Technician disappears inside, closing the door behind him.  A
	loud HUM emits from the craft.  David has to yell over it.

				DAVID
		Lt. Mitchell, would you mind
		drawing your pistol?

				MITCHELL
		What?

				DAVID
		From where you're standing, do you
		think you could shoot that can off
		the alien craft?

	Mitchell shrugs affirmatively.  David gestures for him to try.
	Taking aim, Mitchell SHOOTS.

	The bullet RICOCHETS off the attacker's protective shield.
	Several people in the crowd dock, afraid of being hit by the
	errant bullet.

				DAVID
		Sorry 'bout that.  You see, it's
		protected by the craft's shields.
		We can't penetrate their defenses.

				NIMZIKI
		We know that already.  What's your
		point?

	David walks over to his laptop, now connected directly to the
	craft by cables and starts typing furiously.

				DAVID
		My point is if we can't beat their
		defenses, then we must get around
		them.

	David stops typing and stares at his wrist watch, silently
	counting down.

				DAVID
		Lt. Mitchell, would you please try
		to shoot it again?

	Reluctantly Mitchell obliges.  This time the can is BLOWN OFF
	THE CRAFT.  Everyone in the room is shocked.  The Technician
	re-opens the craft's door and the loud HUM disappears.

				GENERAL GREY
		How did you do that?

				DAVID
		I gave it a cold.

	The President is fascinated, he steps closer.  Moishe beams
	proudly at his smart son.  Constance is amazed.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		More accurately, I gave it a
		virus.  A computer virus.

	David turns his laptop around for the President to see.

				GENERAL GREY
		Are you telling us you can send
		out a signal that will disable all
		their shields?

				DAVID
		Just as they used our satellites
		against us, we can use their own
		signal against them.

	David walks over to a diagram he's made showing the
	relationship between the Mother Ship, the Space Crafts and the
	smaller alien attackers.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		If we plant the virus directly
		into the mother ship, it would
		then filter down into all the
		corresponding ships below.

				NIMZIKI
		And just how do we infect the
		"Mother Ship" with a virus?

	David gestures to the alien attacker behind him.

				DAVID
		We'll have to fly their craft out
		of our atmosphere and dock with
		the mother ship.

	Intrigued Steve turns and looks back at the alien attacker,
	sizing it up.  David points to a satellite photo of the
	underbelly of the Mother Ship.

				DAVID (cont'd)
		We can enter here, upload the
		virus and set off an explosion
		that could disable it.  This would
		disorient the smaller ship below
		and buy you some time to take them
		out.

	Constance reacts, realizing David's participation in the plan.

				NIMZIKI
		This is ridiculous.

				GENERAL GREY
		How long would their shields be
		down?

				DAVID
		Once they discover the virus it
		could be a matter of minutes.

				NIMZIKI
		You want us to co-ordinate a
		massive world wide counter strike
		with a window of only a few
		minutes?

				GENERAL GREY
		With their shields down it might
		be possible.

				NIMZIKI
		Please, you're not buying into any
		of this nonsense, are you?  We
		don't have the manpower or the
		resources to launch that kind of a
		campaign.
			(gesturing to the alien
			 ship)
		Not to mention that this whole
		cockamamie plan is dependent on a
		machine that no one in the world
		is qualified to operate.

				STEVE (O.S.)
		I wouldn't say that, sir.

	Everyone turns to Steve who steps through the crowd.

				STEVE
		I've seen them in action.  I've
		watched their maneuvers.  With
		your permission, sir, I'd like the
		opportunity to try.

				NIMZIKI
		That thing's a wreck.  It crash
		landed back in the fifties!  We
		don't even know if it's capable of
		flying.

	David turns to the Technicians.

				DAVID
		Remove the clamps!

	Technicians move to the large holding clamps on either side of
	the craft.  With a loud CLANK, the clamps are pulled away.

	For a moment the hulking craft TEETERS unevenly, but quickly
	stabilizes, FLOATING ABOVE THEM.

				DAVID
		Any other questions?

	Everyone stares at the floating ship with wonder.

				PRESIDENT
		Let's do it.

	INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

	Constance, General Grey and the President are walking down the
	hall.  Nimziki rushes to catch up.

				NIMZIKI
		I understand that you're upset
		over the death of your wife but
		that's no excuse for making
		another fatal mistake...

	The President whirls, grabs Nimziki and SLAMS him against the 
	wall.  Holding him tight, the President gets in his face.

				PRESIDENT
		The only mistake I made was
		appointing a sniveling little
		weasel like you Chief of Staff.

	Constance is about to intervene when General Grey stops her.

				PRESIDENT (cont'd)
		But this is a mistake, I am
		thankful to say, I do not have to
		live with.  Mr. Nimziki, you're
		fired.

	The President releases him and turns to General Grey.

				PRESIDENT (cont'd)
		Organize every plane you can find
		and get some Goddamned pilots
		to fly them.

				GENERAL GREY
		Yes, Sir.

	He storms off leaving everyone stunned.

				NIMZIKI
		He can't do that.

				CONSTANCE
			(amazed)
		He just did.

	INT. MILITARY TENT - CONTINUOUS

	Four BRITISH AIR PILOTS are gathered around a table going over
	a map.  One pilot, REGINALD, is in charge.

				REGINALD
		...we've been told that there may
		be additional re-enforcement in
		hiding near the Golan Straights...

	Suddenly the flap to the tent opens.  All the pilots draw
	their pistols frightening the ARAB PILOT who stands in the
	doorway.  The Arab Pilot speaks quickly in Arabic.

				REGINALD
		What the hell's he saying?

				THOMSON
			(explaining)
		Seems they're getting a signal.
		One Morse code.

	EXT. DRY LAKE - SECONDS LATER

	As they step out of the tent we SEE more than a HUNDRED
	FIGHTERS PLANES from different nations parked around them.
	They've all gone into hiding out here in the desert, divided
	into many smaller camps.

	Reginald and Thomson follow their Arab cohort, walking through
	the many other campsites.  Thomson gets some stares from the
	IRAQI PILOTS.

				REGINALD
		I still get believe this.

				THOMSON
		The Iraqis don't appear altogether
		too pleased with this arrangement.

				REGINALD
		How do you think the Israelis
		feel?

	Sure enough a campsite of ISRAELI PILOTS sits very near by.

	ANGLE - ARABIAN AIR FORCE CAMP

	Dozens of Arab pilots are gathered around a large radio as the
	Morse code comes through.  Thomson quickly kneels down, taking
	notes.

				THOMSON
		It's from the Americans.  They
		want to organize a counter

				REGINALD
		It's about bloody time.  What do

	EXT. ICE PLATEAU - SIBERIA - DAY

	Several Russian Pilots are gathered around a radio, their

	Striding in, the President surveys the war room.  General Grey
	rushes over to meet him.

				PRESIDENT
		How're we doing?

				GENERAL GREY
		Better than we thought.

	General Grey leads the President over to the wall map.

				GENERAL GREY
		We have confirmed divisions of

				MIGUEL
		How' he doing?

				RUSSELL
		Just fell asleep.  He's gonna be
		just fine.  Join me in a little

	Russell holds up his bottle of Jack Daniels.  Clearly he's

	and storms out.

				RUSSELL
		Miguel.  Don't be mad.  Miguel!

	Drunkenly, Russell chases after him.

	INT. AREA 51 - REFUGEE CAMP - CONTINUOUS

	Making his way through the campers, Russell SEES a group of
	refugees around some MILITARY OFFICERS who addresses them.

				OFFICER
			(through megaphone)
		...We're planning to launch a

	Russell wanders over towards them.

				OFFICER (cont'd)
		...with our depleted manpower we
		must ask that anyone with any
		flight experience come forward.
		Military training is preferable
		but anyone who can fly a plane
		could be useful...

	Russell pushes his way through the crowd.

				RUSSELL
			(slurred)
		I can fly, I mean, I'm a pilot.

	The officer just stares at the bottle of Jack Daniels still in 
	his hand.

				OFFICER
		Sorry, sir.

	Russell gets into his face, desperate.

				RUSSELL
		You don't understand.  I've gotta
		be part of this.  This is
		important to me.  They ruined my
		life.

				OFFICER
		Why don't you go somewhere and
		sleep it off.

	The Officers move on, taking a few volunteers with them.
	Russell watches them go, dejected.  Angrily, he throws the
	bottle of Jack, SMASHING it.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - NIGHT

	A large MISSILE slides back into a LAUNCHER that has been
	attached to the top of the alien attacker.  Some workers PAINT
	over the patch-work repairs.  Below, Mitchell briefs Steve and
	David.

				MITCHELL
		We've hid the launcher in the
		ship's manifold.

	Mitchell takes a small black box from a table near by.

				MITCHELL (cont'd)
		This will be attached to the ships
		main console.

				STEVE
		It's just like an AMRAAM launch
		pad on the stealths.

				MITCHELL
		Exactly.  Use it the same way.
		Only the nuke won't detonate on
		impact.  You'll have another
		thirty seconds to get as far away
		as you can.

				DAVID
		I'll see how they're doing with
		the radio transmitter.

				STEVE
			(checking his watch)
		Oh shit, we're late.

				DAVID
		We'll meet you there.

	Steve dashes off as David moves toward the attacker.
	Constance has been eavesdropping.  She walks to David.

				CONSTANCE
		Thirty seconds?  Isn't that
		cutting it a little too close?

				DAVID
		We'll be well on our way out of
		there before we shoot that thing
		off.

	David leans under the attacker where a TECHNICIAN is attaching
	another device.

				TECHNICIAN
		It's the strongest SHF transmitter
		we could get.  It'll tell us when
		you've uploaded the virus.

				DAVID
		Then cross your fingers the
		shields go down.

	David turns and walks away, Constance following.

				CONSTANCE
		With you?  I don't understand why
		you can't just show someone how to
		plant the virus, somebody trained
		for this kind of mission?

				DAVID
		If anything goes wrong I'll have
		to think quickly, adjust the
		signal, who knows?

	David stops, picking up a small trash can labelled "recycle."

				DAVID
			(smiling)
		You know how I'm always trying to
		save the planet.  This is my

	Jasmine stands, turns to Dylan.

				JASMINE
		How do I look?

	She looks great.  But Dylan only gives her the "so-so" hand
	gesture.

				JASMINE
		You're a lot of help.

	The door behind her flies open and Steve marches in.

				JASMINE
		You're late.

				STEVE
		You know me...

				JASMINE
		I know, you like to make a big

		Before we do this, I want you to

				JASMINE
		Sorry for what?

				STEVE
			(serious)
		I should have done this a long

				MALE VOICE (O.S.)
		Do you have the ring?

	As we REVERSE ANGLE we see that we are in a military CHAPEL, a
	large crucifix on the wall.  A CHAPLAIN stands by the altar.

				STEVE
		You bet.

	Steve pulls out the famous "dolphin" ring.

				CHAPLAIN
		Witnesses?

	Just then the doors open and David and Constance enter taking
	seats on opposing sides of the aisle.

				CHAPLAIN
		Then let's get this show on the

	Steve and Jasmine take their places at the altar.  Jasmine is

				PRESIDENT
		Good morning.  In less than one

			(beat)
		Mankind.  The word has new meaning

	Constance, David and Moishe join the group, listening.  Even
	David is moved.

				PRESIDENT (cont'd)
		Perhaps it's fate that today, July
		the Fourth, we will once again
		fight for our freedom.  Not from
		tyranny, persecution or
		oppression.  But from
		annihilation.  We're fighting for
		our right to live, to exit.  From

		as an American holiday but as the
		day that all of mankind declared
		we will not go quietly into the
		night.  We will not vanish without
		a fight.  We will live on.  We
		will survive.

	The crowd erupts into applause and cheers.  The President
	turns and walks over to an Officer holding a bundle of
	clothes.  General Grey confronts the President as he begins to
	disrobe.

				GENERAL GREY
		Mr. President, just what do you

	David looks down at the "barf bags" in Moishe's hand.

				DAVID
		Thanks, Pops.

				MOISHE
		I want you should know, I'm very
		proud of you, son.

	That means more to David than Moishe could have known.

				CONSTANCE
		Be careful.

	Constance hugs David as Steve suddenly freaks out.

				STEVE
		Damn it.  We can't go yet.  I
		gotta find some cigars.

	Steve is about to bolt when Moishe grabs him, retrieving two
	cigars from his coat pocket.

				MOISHE
		My last two.  With my blessings.

				STEVE
		You're a lifesaver.

	Steve grabs them and climbs inside.  David smiles awkwardly,
	then follows Steve.

	The hatch shuts and David takes a seat next to Steve who hands
	him one of the cigars.

				STEVE
		Hang on to this.  For our victory
		dance.  But not 'til we hear the
		fat lady sing.

	Reluctantly David takes it.  As he does Steve notices the
	"barf bag" on David's lap.  Off Steve's look...

				DAVID
		I have a confession to make.  I'm
		not real big on flying.

				STEVE
		Great.

	INT. STORAGE LAB - SAME

	Constance and Jasmine join the others behind the observation

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

	Embarrassed, Steve adjusts the throttle.

				STEVE
		Oops.

	Like a stick shift diagram of a car, a small hand written
	"post it" card is pasted onto the dash.  Steve reaches over

	David nods sheepishly.  Steve's eyes go wide with wonder as
	the ship climbs to the edge of our atmosphere.

				STEVE
			(to himself)
		I've waited a long time for this.

	The ship begins to SHAKE, rattling harshly as it climbs.
	Through the window we SEE the blue sky EVAPORATE.  Slowly a
	field of STARS take its place.

	This is the moment Steve had wished for all his life.  He's

	David looks over at his laptop, connected to the ship's on
	board computers.  Th signal is ADJUSTING.

				DAVID
			(thrilled)
		I was counting on that.  They're
		bringing us in.

	EXT. BLUE SKIES - MORNING

	The President's plane leads thirty fighters in attack
	formation.

				PRESIDENT
		We have visual.

	RESERVE ANGLE - ALIEN SPACE CRAFT

	The fifteen mile wide space craft peeks over a mountain range
	headed straight for us.

				GENERAL GREY
			(filtered)
		Do not engage until we've
		confirmed the package has been
		delivered.

				PRESIDENT
		Roger.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Constance is standing by Lt. Mitchell behind the Military
	cadre coordinating the battle.

				CONSTANCE
		What if that thing gets here
		before we can plant the virus?

				MITCHELL
		The entire compound is buried deep
		within the mountain.  It should
		give us some protection.

				CONSTANCE
		But what about all the people
		outside?

	Mitchell shoots her a worried look.  Quickly they both dash
	outside.

	EXT. MOTHER SHIP - SAME

	Steve and David's attacker flies towards the gigantic Mother
	Ship.  Hundreds of other attackers flow in and out of the
	Mother Ship through the many triangular portals.  Steve and
	David's attacker's drawn into one of them.

	INT. PORTAL SHAFT - MOTHER SHIP - SAME

	Caught in a stream of attackers, they flow through the portal
	shaft leading into this planet sized space craft.  They pass
	by enormous windows revealing the HUNDREDS OF ALIENS working
	within the Mother Ship.

	We spill out of the shaft and into a gigantic cavity
	stretching out beyond visibility.  Enormous TOWERS are
	scattered throughout.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - CONTINUOUS

	Neither can believe their eyes.  Staring out the front window
	they SEES...

	STEVE AND DAVID'S POV ALIEN TROOP PARADE GROUND

	Below them THOUSANDS OF ALIENS can be seen as they are marched
	into dozens of enormous TROOP CONTAINERS docked at the edges
	of the parade grounds.

				DAVID
		Must be thousands of them.  What
		are they doing?

				STEVE
		Looks like they're preparing the
		invasion.

	INT. DOCKING STATIONS - MOTHER SHIP - CONTINUOUS

	They pass the parade ground and head into the middle of this
	huge cavernous sphere, closing in on the many LANDINGS.
	Hundreds of attackers are docked at each one.

	In the center of the Landing are large BAY WINDOWS, inside is
	a kind of control tower.  We can SEE several ALIEN WORKERS
	through the glass.  Steve and David's attacker is heading
	straight towards them.

				STEVE
		This won't work.  They'll see
		before we can do anything.

	Lifting up another hand written card labeled "window," David
	pushes the button underneath.

				DAVID
		These things are fully equipped.
		Reclining bucket seats, power
		windows...

	A BLAST SHIELD lowers covering the window.

	Slowly Steve and David's attacker lowers onto large docking
	CLAMPS which LOCK ON, holding it in place.

				DAVID
		We're in!

	David starts typing frantically.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Mitchell turns from one of the consoles to General Grey.

				MITCHELL
		He's uploading the virus.

				GENERAL GREY
			(into mic)
		Eagle One...

	EXT. BLUE SKIES - SAME

	The Presidential attack squadron zeroing in on target.

				GENERAL GREY
			(filtered)
		...the package is being delivered.
		Stand by to engage.

				PRESIDENT
		Roger.

	EXT. AREA 51 - BRENNON TRAILER - SAME

	Alicia struggles to drag out a large duffle bag.  Philip (the
	boy who brought the penicillin earlier) rushes over.

				PHILIP
		Let me get that.

	He grabs the bag for her.  Alicia smiles.  Miguel helps Troy
	down from the trailer.  As they rush away, Miguel turns to
	Philip.

				MIGUEL
		Where's Russell?

	ANGLE - HANGAR - ENTRANCE TO COMPOUND

	Constance, Jasmine and Mitchell are helping to usher the
	refugees into the compound.

				CONSTANCE
		Hurry, we've got to get everyone
		inside.

	Constance looks up and SEES off in the distance...

	THE ALIEN SPACE CRAFT

	Piercing the horizon, coming over the top of a distant
	mountain.  Headed this way.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	David finishes typing.  The screen on his laptop flashes:
	UPLOAD COMPLETE.

				DAVID
		The virus is in.  All we can do
		now is pray.

	EXT. BLUE SKIES - AMERICAN FIGHTERS - SAME

				GENERAL GREY
			(filtered)
		Delivery complete.  Engage.

				PRESIDENT
		Roger.

	The fighter jets GUN IT and overtake the smaller planes in
	front of them.

	Below the President's plane the weapons bay door opens and a
	long range AMRAAM Missile DROPS DOWN, computes its target and
	DARTS OFF.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Mitchell and General Grey move over to a monitor showing
	visual from the Present's Plane.  They SEE the missile
	moving towards target.

				GENERAL GREY
		Keep your fingers crossed.

	EXT. AMERICAN FIGHTERS - SAME

	The pilots watch nervously as the missile nears its target.

				PRESIDENT
		Come on, baby.

	ANGLE - AMRAAM MISSILE

	Just as it gets to the shield perimeter, the missile EXPLODES.
	The shields are still up.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	They watch the missile blow up harmlessly.  Deflated, General
	Grey grabs his mic.

				GENERAL GREY
		It didn't work.  Disengage.  Sir,
		get your people out of there.

	EXT. PRESIDENT'S PLANE - SAME

	The President is not ready to give up.

				PRESIDENT
		Not yet!

	Below his plane another MISSILE drops down, and DARTS OFF.

	ANGLE - MISSILE

	This one goes past the point of the previous explosion.  It
	moves in closer and closer.  Suddenly it HITS THE SIDE OF THE
	SHIP.  A HUGE EXPLOSION, rips off a part of the side of this
	immense ship.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	We SEE the explosion on the monitor.  Everyone in the room
	CHEERS.

				GENERAL GREY
		You did it!  A direct hit!

	EXT. BLUE SKIES - AMERICAN FIGHTERS - SAME

	The pilots are thrilled.

				PRESIDENT
		We're going in!  Squadron leaders,
		take point.

	The fighters break off into six group of five.  One by one,
	each fighter DROPS A MISSILE.  We follow DOZENS OF MISSILES on
	their way to the space craft.

	ANGLE - SPACE CRAFT

	The Attacker Bay doors open and DOZENS OF ALIEN ATTACKERS
	shoot out.  Spreading wide.

	Guided missiles EXPLODES as they hit the City Destroyer,
	damaging the outer hull.  The Attackers go after the American
	fighters.  The six groups split wide.  An aerial dog fight
	ensues.

	EXT. AREA 51 - REFUGEE CAMP - SAME

	Miguel searches for Russell as the refugees run for the
	hangar.

				MIGUEL
		Russell!

	Miguel gets swept up in the tide.  As the last of them enter
	the hangar, TWO ALIEN ATTACKERS arrive behind them, STRAFING
	the ground.  The rows of trailers homes EXPLODE one after
	another.

	ANGLE - ELEVATOR HALLWAY - BACK OF HANGAR

	Constance ushers the crowd into the elevator hallway.  Packed
	into the hallway together, they are panicked at the sound of
	the nearby explosions.  As the last one is safely inside,
	Constance turns back and SEES...

	CONSTANCE'S POV - HANGAR AND ATTACKERS

	The attackers FIRE and the front half of the hangar EXPLODES.
	Constance is KNOCKED back against the wall.  She activates the
	elevator and the room begins to SINK.

	As the hallway submerges, the entire hangar comes CRASHING
	DOWN behind them.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Over monitors the General observes the aerial battle.  This
	room, too, ROCKS from the explosions.  The monitors FLICKER.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Steve struggles with the controls but is getting no where.

				DAVID
		Get us out of here!

				STEVE
		I can't shake her free.

	EXT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Though the attacker guns its engine, the CLAMPS below HOLD
	TIGHT.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	David moves over to the computer to see if he can help.
	Suddenly the large window slowly begins to DROP DOWN.

				STEVE
		What're you doing?

				DAVID
		It's not me.  They're overriding
		the system.

	The blast shield continues to peel away.  David and Steve drop
	down below the dash, hiding from view.  As the view becomes
	unobstructed we SEE...

	POV - THROUGH WINDOW - THE LANDING

	Several Alien's looking across at us from the large bay
	window of the Landing's control tower.

				STEVE
		Damn!

	David leans from his hiding position and SEES several other
	alien attackers are moving in on them.  They are surrounded.

				DAVID
		Check and mate.

	INT. AREA 51 - RESEARCH FACILITY - SAME

	Like images from England during the blitzkrieg, the refugees
	are huddled on the floor, the lights FLICKERING and the muted
	sounds of distant EXPLOSIONS.  Miguel moves through the
	refugees, searching for Russell.

	A Yarmulke is unfolded.  As it is lifted we realize Moishe is
	putting it on.  He holds the hands with the people around him
	and begins to pray.  Nimziki moves next to Moishe.  Moishe
	takes his hand.

				NIMZIKI
		I'm not Jewish.

				MOISHE
		It's okay.

	ANGLE - PHILIP AND ALICIA

	As another bomb rocks the room, Alicia moves closer to Philip.

				ALICIA
		This could be our last night on
		Earth.  I don't want to die a
		virgin.

				PHILIP
		If we do, we'll both die virgins.
		But at last we'll be together.

	Alicia smiles, a nice guy at last.

	EXT. AREA 51 - SPACE SHIP - SAME

	The City Destroyer space ship is settling just above the
	compound as the American fighters circle it, chased by the
	attackers.  Below the SCHISM begins to open!

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	In all the commotion, no one notices as Miguel sneaks inside.

				OFFICER
		We're running out of missiles,
		Sir.  We're just not causing
		enough damage.

	EXT. PRESIDENT'S PLANE - SAME

				GENERAL GREY
			(filtered)
		They're getting ready to fire the
		big gun.  You're going to have to
		find a vulnerable spot, fast.

				PRESIDENT
		I've got an idea.  Keep 'em off my
		tail.

	Taking the advice, the President DIVES.  He's met by two
	flanking Fighters (EAGLES 9 & 2) as they cruise the underbelly
	of the City Destroyer.  Sure enough, the SCHISM is opening,
	preparing to fire the WALL OF DESTRUCTION.

				PRESIDENT
		Let's take 'em out before they
		take us out.

	The President locks the SCHISM hatchway into the center of his
	HUD (heads up display).  Just as he FIRES, Eagle 9 is BLOWN
	OUT OF THE SKY.  It rocks the President, sending his missile
	off target.

	Off balance, the missile hits just wide of the hatchway and
	EXPLODES, rocking the entire ship.

				PRESIDENT
		I'm out of missiles!  Eagle 2?

				EAGLE #2 PILOT
		I'm on it.

	But before he can target, his fighter EXPLODES.

	INT. HALLWAY - SAME

	The lights continue to flicker.  Jasmine grabs onto Dylan and
	Patricia, holding them tight.

	INT. WAR ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	On the monitor we SEE the SCHISM, and BRIGHT LIGHTS as several
	fighters fly past.

				GENERAL GREY
		We're out of time.  Get out of
		there!  Get as far away as you
		can.

	EXT. PRESIDENT'S FIGHTER - SAME

	Pissed, the President refuses to give up.

				PRESIDENT
		Doesn't anyone have any damned
		missiles left?!

				RUSSELL (O.S.)
		Sorry I'm late, Mr. President.

	The President spins and SEES darting out of the clouds...

	RUSSELL'S OLD BI-PLANE

	Russell ZOOMS past the President and alien attackers, barely
	missing their FIRE.

				PRESIDENT
			(filtered)
		Who is that?  What are you doing?

				RUSSELL
			(into mic)
		It's okay, Sir.  I'm packin'.

	We SEE he has a large MISSILES propped up in the seat behind
	him.  A light on it flashes ARMED.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

				RUSSELL
			(filtered)
		Just keep those guys off me for a
		few more seconds.

	Hearing his voice, Miguel is shocked.  He moves closer towards
	the monitors.

	EXT. CITY DESTROYER - SAME

	The remaining fighters lay down COVER FIRE for Russell's old
	bi-wing.  Russell heads directly TOWARDS THE SCHISM.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Everyone is gripped to the screen as we see it get closer and
	closer to the closing bay doors.  Miguel is aghast.

				RUSSELL
			(filtered)
		Do me one favor...

				OFFICER
		Who is that guy?

				MIGUEL
		Russell!

	Miguel races over to the microphone, attempts to grab it.

				RUSSELL
			(filtered)
		...tell my children I love them
		very much.

	EXT. CITY DESTROYER - SCHISM - SAME

	Russell nears the SCHISM, a hail of alien firepower erupting
	around him.

				MIGUEL
			(filtered)
		Dad!  No!

	Russell smiles at b being called "Dad."

				RUSSELL
		I've got to, kid.  You were always
		better at taking care of them than
		I was anyways.

	Russell turns off his radio as he banks UPWARD towards the
	open SCHISM.  The climb is steep, and the bi-wing nearly
	stalls out.

	Suddenly the bright lights VANISH and the beam begins to form.

	Russell's bi-wing just makes it INSIDE THE OPEN SCHISM and
	disappears from view.

	The President and remaining fighters BANK AWAY, clearing.

	Suddenly, A GIGANTIC EXPLOSION, RIPS THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE
	SPACE CRAFT.  It's causing a CHAIN REACTION of explosion.

	Teetering, the entire space ship, turns away out of control.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	The room erupts in CHEERS.  Everyone, that is, except Miguel.

	EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - SAME

	Not far away from Area 51, the enormous craft is burning from
	the center outwards.  Suddenly it DROPS and COLLIDES with the
	mountain range, EXPLODING ON IMPACT.

	INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

	Intercepting the celebration, General Grey moves over to a
	radio technician.

				GENERAL GREY
		Let's get on the wire.  Tell every
		squadron around the world how to
		shoot those fuckers down.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

	Sitting below the dash, Steve takes out the cigars, hands one
	to David.

				STEVE
		I guess there's nothing left to
		do.  Let's nuke 'em.

	David realizes they're both about to die.  He stares at the
	cigar.

				DAVID
			(re: cigar)
		Funny, I always thought things
		like these would kill me.

	They share a quick sober laugh.

				STEVE
		Nice meeting you.

				DAVID
		You as well.

	Steve lights his cigar, then lights David's.

				STEVE
		Ready?

	EXT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

	Popping up from behind the dash, cigars in their mouths, Steve
	and David start waving "good-bye" like idiots.

	The Aliens in the tower don't know how to react.  The
	attackers move in for the kill.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

				STEVE
		Think they know what's coming?

	He reaches down to the black box we saw before and enters the
	launch code.

				DAVID
			(still waving)
		Not a chance in hell.

	EXT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Suddenly the missile ERUPTS from behind the manifold and
	BLASTS into the control tower, SHATTERING THE GLASS WINDOW.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	The missile SMASHES through the glass.  The atmosphere
	impeached, the aliens quickly succumb to the elements, chocking
	and dying.

	The missile BLASTS by WRECKING equipment until it LODGES into
	the back wall of the Landing tower.

	A small counter on the missile begins to count down 30:00,
	29:00, 28:00...

	EXT. DOCKING CLAMPS - SAME

	Rocked from the explosions, the docking clamps RELEASES and the
	ships jostles free.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

	Steve grabs the controls.

				STEVE
		We're loose!

				DAVID
		Doesn't matter.  Game's over.

				STEVE
		I don't hear no fat lady.

	Steve THROTTLES IT.  The craft JOLTS AWAY.

	EXT. DOCKING STATION - SAME

	Steve and David's attacker BLAST away, the other alien
	attackers follow in hot pursuit.

	The attackers FIRE.  Steve SWERVES avoiding the blasts as they
	race for the exit.

	INT. LANDING - CONTROL TOWER - SAME

	Grasping for breath, a dying Alien looks up at the wedged in
	nuclear missile.  The counter reads: 00:04, 00:03, 00:02.

	We get the feeling the Alien knows what's coming.

	INT. DOCKING BAY - SAME

	Steve and David's attacker just reaches the doorway as the
	center of the landing EXPLODES behind them.

	The enormous impact, rocks some of the lagging attackers off
	track.

	EXT. MOTHER SHIP - SAME

	Steve DARTS his attacker out from underneath the Mother Ship's
	belly.  A group of attackers FOLLOW.

	Just as the last of them exit the docking bay, a HUGE FIREBALL
	erupts behind them ripping through the Mother Ship.

	ANGLE - FARTHER AWAY

	ZOOMING towards us, Steve guides his ship away.  The Alien
	attackers in hot pursuit.  Behind them we SEE the ENTIRE
	MOTHER SHIP EXPLODE.

	The immense EXPLOSION GROWS OUTWARDS coming right at us.  The
	ATTACKERS are GOBBLED UP as the EXPLOSION WIDENS.  Quickly the
	explosion gains ground on Steve and David.

	ANGLE - STEVE AND DAVID'S SHIP

	Like a loose board caught in the surf, Steve and David's ship
	rides the edge of the explosion, getting knocked END OVER END.

	INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER

	Tumbling ass over tea kettle, David and Steve are ROCKED in
	their seats.  Steve battles to regain control of the ship.

	EXT. STEVE AND DAVID'S SHIP

	The mammoth fireball reaches the outer edge of its zenith.
	Steve and David's ship is SPIT OUT, tumbling down towards
	EARTH.

	EXT. AREA 51 - TARMAC - SAME

	The fighters are returning home.  Crowd RACE out of the ruins
	of the smoldering compound to greet them, cheering their
	arrival.

	THE PRESIDENT'S PLANE

	The President is climbing out as General Grey rushes to his
	aid.  Behind him, Jasmine leads Dylan and Patricia, who breaks
	free and RUSHES to her father.  The President sweeps her up in
	his arms as Jasmine approaches.

				JASMINE
			(to General Grey)
		Any word from Steve?

	Behind her, Constance rushes over, the same thing on her mind.
	Before he can answer they HEAR a ROAR above.  They all become
	silent as they turn and look to the skies.

	ANGLE - BLUE SKIES - FIREBALL

	The FIREBALL COMET is rapidly shooting down towards us.
	Suddenly BURSTING OUT OF THE FLAMES, Steve and David's ship
	DARTS DOWN.

	Just over the heads of the cheering crowds, Steve and David's
	ship ZOOMS overhead, disappearing out of sight.

	EXT. DRY LAKE - DESERT - MINUTES LATER

	Several army JEEPS race across the arid desert floor.  As they
	WHIP past we see they are headed towards a gigantic BLACK
	PLUME OF SMOKE in the distance.
	
	ANGLE PLUME OF SMOKE

	The Jeeps SKID to a halt.  Jasmine and Constance are the first
	to leap off the Jeeps.

	Steve and David walk towards us, cigars in their mouths.
	Jasmine races over to him.

				JASMINE
		You scared the hell out of me.

				STEVE
		Yeah, but what an entrance!

				JASMINE
		Dick-weed.

				STEVE
		Butt-munch.

	Constance comes running up to David, hugs him tightly.

				CONSTANCE
		Are you all right?

				DAVID
		Did it work?

				CONSTANCE
		You bet it did.

	She hugs him.  They kiss.

	ANGLE - STEVE AND JASMINE

	Behind them Dylan, Patricia, the President and General Grey
	come walking over.  The President and General Grey approach.

				PRESIDENT
		We're getting reports from all
		over.  Their ships are going down!

	As they begin to celebrate, they look up to the sky.

	GROUP POV - BRILLIANT LIGHTS IN THE SKIES

	The debris from the Mother Ship explosion enters the
	atmosphere like thousands of SHOOTING STARS.  It's an
	incredible sight.

	The group stares happily at the show in the sky.  Steve takes
	Dylan by the hand.

				STEVE
		Didn't I promise you fireworks?

	Everyone stares in wonder at the beautiful lights.
