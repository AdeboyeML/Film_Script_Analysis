          EXT - COUNTRYSIDE - BROILING HOT DAY

          As the film's OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE plays, complete with its own
          SPAGHETTI WESTERN THEME SONG, we see SEVEN shirtless and shoeless
          BLACK MALE SLAVES connected together with LEG IRONS, being run,
          by TWO: WHITE MALE HILLBILLIES on HORSEBACK.

          The location is somewhere in Texas. The Black Men (ROY, BIG SID,
          BENJAMIN, DJANGO, PUDGY RALPH, FRANKLYN, and BLUEBERRY) are slaves just
          recently purchased at The Greenville Slave Auction in Greenville
          Mississippi. The White Hillbillies are two Slave Traders called,
          The SPECK BROTHERS (ACE and DICKY).

          One of the seven slaves is our hero DJANGO... . he's fourth in the leg
          iron line. We may or may not notice a tiny small "r" burned into his
          cheek ("r" for runaway), but we can't help but notice his back which
          has been SLASHED TO RIBBONS by Bull Whip Beatings.

          As the Operatic Opening Theme Song plays, we see a MONTAGE of misery
          and pain, as Django and the Other Men are walked through blistering
          sun, pounding rain, and moved along by the end of a whip. Bare feet
          step on hard rock, and slosh through mud puddles. Leg Irons take the
          skin off ankles.

          AS The CREDITS play, DJANGO has a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK.
          Now Spaghetti Western Flashbacks are never pretty, it's usually the
          time in the film when the lead character thinks back to the most
          painful memory inflicted on him or his loved ones from evil characters
          from his past. In this instance we see Django in a SLAVE PEN at the
          Greenville Auction.

                         DJANGO
          Amongst many other shoulders and heads, sees through the bars of the
          cell door, his wife BROOMHILDA being led to the auction block.

          He fights his way to the door, and far off and obscure in the distance,
          he can see Broomhilda up on the auction block, and in the distance he
          hears the Auctioneer yell; "Sold." Then she's taken away to whereabouts
          unknown, never to be seen again.

          As the sun continues to beat down on Django's head, he remembers;

          DJANGO in the SLAVE PEN
          with what seems like a one hundred and fifty Slaves in a cell designed
          for forty.

          WHITE MEN yank him out. of the cell, shirtless, shoeless, and lead him
          down a hallway, into a giant round pen, an audience viewing area
          circles the round pen floor on three different stories of the
          structure.

          The ground floor is covered by the BIG MONEY BUYERS who stand in front
          of the auction block.

          (their White Owners), and their SELLERS (the White Man actually doing
          the sales pitch on the auction block), as they wait for their turn on
          the block.
          A SLAVE (ROBBIE), stand on the auction block in view of the room full
          of Buyers, The SELLER sells, and the OWNERS stand off to the side.

                         DJANGO
          takes in the environment around him. Django has never cared for white
          folks, but these white folks are in particularly ugly.

          It's DJANGO's turn ON THE AUCTION BLOCK
          as the THEME SONG wails its tragic crescendo, Django is brought up on
          the auction block. He.looks down at all the WHITE PEOPLE who want to
          buy Niggers, who look up to him.
          His heart fills with poison.

          BACK TO DJANGO

          /--" EXT - WOODS -- NIGHT

          It's night time and The Speck Brothers, astride HORSES, keep pushing
          their black skinned cargo forward.
          It's a very pitch black night, with only a few stars in the.sky to
          create a little top light. It's so dark, the Slavers use the creek.bed
          to keep from getting lost. Both Speck Brothers carry a lantern up on
          their horse, as. does Roy, the Slave in lead position on the chain gang.
          It's also a bitterly cold night, with the breath of the seven slaves,
          two slavers, and two horses creating clouds in the air. In fact the
          seven chained together Slaves, with the lead one holding a lantern, and
          all of them chugging out smoky breath, and. slightly moving in unison,
          resemble a human locomotive.
          The Slaves shiver from the cold on their shirtless backs, both Speck
          Brothers wear rawhide winter coats with white fur linings, and white
          fur collars.

          WHEN...
          .A SOUND and a SMALL LIGHT appears ahead of them on the road. This
          makes the Slave Traders stop their human live stock, and ready their
          rifles for possible trouble.

                         THE RIDER
          appears to be a tenderfoot, due to his style of dress. A long grey
          winter'coat, over a grey three piece business suit, and a grey bowler
          hat on his head.

          The Rider dressed in business grey pulls his horse to a stop in front
          of the two Slavers, and their Slaves, lifting the lantern up to his
          face. He speaks with a slight German accent.

          Good cold evening gentlemen.

          Good evening-I'm looking for a pair of

          Oh, I'm sorry. Please forgive me, it is a

          Hello you poor devils. Is there one among
          you, who was formerly a resident of
          The Carrucan Plantation?
          Since Roy in lead position is the one holding the lantern, the second
          half of the slave centipede falls off into darkness. In the darkness a
          VOICE rings out;

          DJANGO'S VOICE (OS)
          I'm from The Carrucan Plantation.
          Dr.Schultz moves Fritz forward towards the darkness, raises his
          lantern, illuminating our hero Django.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Splendid! And what's your name young, man?

                         DJANGO

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Wunderbar! You're exactly the one I'm looking
          for. So tell me Django - by the way that's a
          amazing name - during your time at the
          Carrucan Plantation, did you come to know
          three overseers by the name of The Brittle
          Brothers?
          Django nods his head, yes.
          Dr.Schultz is delighted.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Big John, Ellis, and little brother Raj?

          hear TWO DISTINCT CRACKING SOUNDS.:..
          Dicky lets out a bitch like scream.
          The Slaves watch all this. They've never seen a white man kill another
          white man before.
          Dicky is pinned down under his ole paint.
          Django watches in the dark, the German climb down off his horse,
          pick up Ace's discarded lantern, and walk over to the remaining Speck.

          But I didn't want you to do anything rash
          before you had a moment to come to your senses.
          Dr.Sch.ultz LIGHTS the lantern, illuminating himself, as he stands over
          Dicky's body.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          In this most helpful pamphlet that I picked
          up at The Greenville Slave Auction, it says
          that the going rate for African flesh'
          - in particularly a field nigger -_is sixty
          to eighty dollars. Now handsome no doubt as
          Django is, technically, he is a field. nigger.
          Which according to"this pamphlet here - and
          why would they lie - puts his price at
          eighty dollars. So in light of that, how
          bout a hundred and twenty five dollars for
          young Django here.
          Dr.Schultz removes his long billfold from his pocket, and takes out a
          one hundred dollar bill, two tens and a fiver.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          And since your late brother. won't be using
          it anymore, I'd like to purchase his nag.
          He removes a twenty dollar gold piece from his. pocket, and tosses it on
          Dicky's body. He bends down and, puts the paper money-.in the saddle bags
          on Dicky's dead horse. With.his hands in there, he roots around and
          finds the keys to-the leg irons. He unlocks Django's leg irons.
          Django is free.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          There you go Django,. Give your ankles a good
          rubbing, then get up on that horse.
          Also, if I was you, I'd take that winter
          coat the dear departed Speck left behind.
          Django removes the coat from the dead slaver. Puts on the warm jacket
          over his bare back, and climbs up on Ace Specks horse.
          Dr.Schultz turns to Dicky on the ground.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr.Speck, I am afraid I will require a
          bill of sale. Do you have one?
          Dicky just curses him.
          He says, removing a notebook from his pocket;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I thought not. No worries, I come prepared.
          (as he writes)
          This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.
          (he stops, then
          says to Django)
          Django is spelled with a silent "D",
          is it not?

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Why not..
          He writes it in his book with a silent "D", then stops to admire the
          way it looks.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, that does add a little character.
          The German dentist lowers himself by the Speck brother pinned down
          under his horse, and hands him the notebook and pen.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          If you'd be so kind Speck, as to make your
          mark here.
          The. Hillbilly spits in the German gentleman's face. The good doctor
          wipes his face with a handkerchief. Then takes out a pocket knife.
          And whispers something that can't be heard in the slavers ear.
          He signs the bill of sale.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr.Speck, I would like to say it was a
          pleasure doing business with you, but your
          customer service leaves a lot to be desired.
          The good doctor climbs back up on Fritz, and looks to the six Slaves, in
          leg irons.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Now as to you poor devils.
          He tosses to Pudgy Ralph the keys to the shackles.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So as I.see it, when it comes to the subject
          of what to do next, you gentlemen have two
          choices. One, once I'm gone, you lift that
          beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him
          to the nearest town. Which would be at least
          thirty-seven miles back the way you came.
          Or ...
          .Two, you unshackle yourselves, take that
          rifle over there. . .put a bullet in his head,
          bury the two of them deep, and make your way
          to a more enlightened area of the country.
          The choice is yours.
          He's just about ready to ride off, when the good doctor adds;

          He looks to Django, who doesn't know how to start his horse.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Just give him a little kick.
          Django does, and the horse responds by moving.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          See, it's not so difficult.

          The DAWN BREAKS on a western landscape. The two men ride their horses
          silently, horse hooves CLIP-CLOPPING among the rocks. Django wears
          Specks winter coat, with one of Dr.Schultz's white button down dress
          shirts underneath it. As they ride through the picturesque scene...
          Dr.Schultz breaks the silence.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well, technically, yes - Wait a minute -
          technically not. If it's my horse, I can
          give it to you, and as of now, I'm doing such.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So... . now that that's settled... . what do you
          intend to name it? Half the fun of having
          a horse is choosing his name. For instance
          my steed is named Fritz. He's stubborn,
          ornery, and prone to a bad disposition, but I
          couldn't do without him.
          (he pats Fritz's neck)
          Anyway, the name of one's steed, isn't
          something one does lightly. So once you've
          thought about it for awhile -

                         DJANGO
          - Tony.

          - I dunno, Tony the horse.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Oh, you mean you want to name your horse
          Tony?

                         DJANGO
          Yeah. That's what you jus' asked me, right?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          When you're right you're right, indeed I did.

          As they continue to converse, they start heading downhill toward a
          western town. They pass by a sign that says; "WELCOME TO DAUGHTREY,

          there's no reason you MUST tell me. In fact
          an air of mystery adds a dash of panache to
          any steed. And I do believe Tony wears it
          well. Good job Django, well done.

          EXT - THE WESTERN TOWN OF DAUGHTREY - MORNING
          As the citizens of Daughtrey wake up, Django and Dr.Schultz ride Fritz
          and Tony through the main street of town..Daughtrey looks like a
          million western towns we've seen before in movies. But to the
          TOWNSPEOPLE of Daughtrey, Django and the German don't look like a
          million other visitors.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          What's everybody staring at?

                         DJANGO
          They never seen a nigger on a horse before.

          You askin' me?
          Dr.Schultz stops Fritz in front of a saloon, and dismounts. Django has
          a little trouble both stopping Tony and getting off him, but it gets
          done. Dr.Schultz keeps bombarding The Slave with questions.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So what other archaic rituals are you people
          verboten to take part in?
          As per usual with this white man, Django thinks; "What"?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'm just trying to get a clear idea on what
          you can do, and what you can't do, and if
          you can't do it, why can't you do it?
          Like for instance, what if we were to walk
          in this saloon here, sit down at a table,
          order a drink, and drink it?
          Would the authorities frown on that?

          And I definitely can't be sharin' no drink,
          with no white man, in public.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So if you and I did those things, that would
          be considered enough of a infraction to make
          the saloon keeper go get the sheriff?

                         DJANGO
          You bet your sweet ass they get the sheriff.
          The good doctor extends his hand towards the saloon entrance.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well in that case Django, after you.

                         DJANGO
          Whoa - I ain't funnin, I can't go in there.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Django you're going to have to learn to trust
          me, and as the man said; "There's no time
          like the,present."

          When Dr.Schultz, sitting at a table with the young Django, calls;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Inn keeper! Remember, get the sheriff, not
          the marshall. This wouldn't be the marshalls
          jurisdiction.'This is just a infraction,
          on what I assume is a simple county ordinance,
          and that would fall under the domain of the
          Sheriff.
          The Saloon Keeper runs away.
          The two men sit by themselves in the empty saloon.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          It looks like we must act as our own bartender.
          The German stands up, and walks-behind the bar, and pours two beer's
          from the tap into mugs. Django remains seated, and after a beat, asks;

                         DJANGO
          What kinda dentist are you?
          This makes the doctor laugh, as he pours the beer's.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I haven't practiced dentistry in five years -
          Not to say once I know you better, I wouldn't

          Do you know what a Bounty Hunter is?
          The Black Man shakes his head, no.

          up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.
          That means we visit every plantation in
          Gatlinburg till we find them. And when we
          find them, you point them out, and I kill
          them. You do that, I agree to give you
          your freedom... . twenty-five dollars per
          Brittle brother - that's seventy-five
          dollars... . your horse, Tony even though
          I've already gave him to you -- but once the
          final Brittle brother lies dead in the
          dust, I'll buy you a new saddle, and a
          new suit of clothes, handsome cowboy hat
          included.
          Dr.Schultz's eyes go to the saloon window.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          And as if on cue... . here comes the sheriff.

          EXT - SALOON - MORNING
          We see the sheriff, BILL SHARP, walk towards the saloon cradling a
          Winchester. Some TOWNSPEOPLE (like the Saloon Keeper) stand around to
          watch. A. YOUNG BOY leads a herd of BABY GOATS through town.
          Sheriff Sharp stands in the middle of the street.

          Okay boys, fun's over, come on out.
          Both the doctor and Django stand up and walk to the front porch.

          people? You ain't got nothin' better to
          do, then to come into Bill Sharps town
          and show your ass -
          From his top step on the porch, Dr. King Schultz extends his hand
          toward the sheriff, as if to shake it... :.

          .THEN...
          A SMALL DERRINGER - POPS into Schultz's hand from a metal sliding
          apparatus concealed under his jacket sleeve. Once in hand, the dentist
          FIRES one tiny bullet into the belly of Bill Sharp.
          The tiny gun makes a tiny POP sound.
          The shocked Bill Sharp lets out a ugly groan, and doubles over in the
          dirt.
          The TOWNSPEOPLE are startled.
          As is Django.
          As Schultz walks down the porch steps, to the fallen sheriff, reloading
          his tiny pop shooter, a PEDESTRIAN yells out;

                         PEDESTRIAN
          What did you jus' do to our sheriff?
          Dr.Schultz answers him by putting another tiny bullet in the law man's
          skull, killing him dead.
          In the background, ONE WOMAN faints. The Boy and his Goats scatter.
          Dr.Schultz looks over at the Saloon Keeper, across the street.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

          player. A terrified Django, who's sure his new master is a lunatic
          who's going to get them both killed, peeks out the closed curtains
          on the window.
          Dr.Schultz's suit coat sits draped over a chair. All of his weapons,
          including his metal sliding rail Derringer contraption, lie on a table.

          who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit
          to elect as their sheriff, who went by
          the name of Bill Sharp, is actually a
          wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck,

          was elected sheriff sometime in the last
          two years. I know this because. three years

          The bad part about slavery being a business,
          is it's immoral. The good part about it being
          a business is, they keep records. Somewhere
          in Greenville there's a book with your wife's
          name in it, and the name of the customer who
          bought her, and more then likely their address.
          But then Schultz seems to get second thoughts.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Still, seventy-five dollars in your back
          pocket is a pretty nice grub steak, but it's
          not going to get you very far in Greenville.

          blue satin Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, as they enter the property of
          BENNETT MANOR, a plantation in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. Django leads a
          riderless horse, behind him and Tony.
          As the two men ride their horses up the road that leads to the front
          steps of Bennett Manor, alongside the cotton fields, all the SLAVES
          stop picking cotton, and straighten their bent backs up to stare in
          wonder at this sight.
          The patriarch of Bennett Manor, SPENCER "BIG DADDY" BENNETT, dressed in
          a fancy leisure suit of the day, emerges from the double doors of the
          mansion, and stands on the top steps, hands on hips, watching the white
          man and black man move from the background to the foreground.
          While there are plenty BLACK MALES out in the cotton fields, the
          majority of the slave population of Bennett Manor is pretty.BLACK
          FEMALES, fourteen to twenty-four, referred to as, "PONY'S".
          The biggest money making crop of this farm, after cotton.
          As Dr.Schultz and fancy pants Django, bring Fritz and Tony to a stop
          in front of Bennett Manor, they've drawn quite a crowd of SLAVES,
          BENNETT FAMILY MEMBERS, and WHITE WORKERS (OVERSEER'S).
          Spencer Bennett keeps on the top step so he won't be forced to look up
          at the darkee on the horse.

                         SPENCER BENNETT
          It's against the law for niggers to ride
          horses in this territory.

          This is my valet, and my valet doesn't walk.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          My good sir, perhaps we got off on the
          wrong boot. Allow me to unring this bell.
          My name is Dr.King Schultz, this is my
          valet, Django, and these are our horses,
          Fritz, and Tony.
          Fritz, does his head bow.
          This makes the pretty PONY'S surrounding Bennett, giggle.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr. Bennett, I've been lead to believe you
          are a gentleman, and a business man.
          And it is in these capacities that we've
          ridden from Texas to Tennessee to talk
          with you now.

          I'm afraid so.

          your fancy pants. nigger, and I wouldn't
          sell you a tinkers damn - what'cha gotta

          Maybe while we discuss business, you
          could provide one of your loveliest black

          Dr.Schultz lowers his voice, and says to the plantation owner;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Mr. Bennett, I must remind, you, Django is a
          free man. He cannot be treated like a slave.
          Within the bounds of good taste, he must be
          treated as an extension of myself.

          EXT - ANOTHER PART OF BENNETT MANOR - DAY
          Away from the big house, Betina gives Django a tour of the grounds.
          Her in her slave get up, complete with handkerchief on her head, and
          him in his satin baby blue Little Lord Fauntleroy outfit, are quite
          the pair. She eyeballs him disapprovingly up and down.

          EXT - BENNETT MANOR (BACK PORCH) - DAY
          Both Spencer Bennett and Dr.Schultz sit on the back porch drinking
          lemonade.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I've been'told by those who should know,
          the most exquisite African flesh in the
          state of Tennessee is bred right here on
          your land. And from the look of these
          black angels, my sources weren't wrong.

                         SPENCER
          Oh I got my share of, coal blacks, horse
          faces, and gummy mouth bitches out in the
          field. But the lion share of my lady
          niggers are real show pony's.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well that's what I'm looking for, a show
          pony for young Django. So the only
          question that remains is, do you have a
          nigger here worth five thousand dollars?

                         SPENCER
          Dr.Schultz, five thousand dollar nigger,
          is practically my middle name.

          BACK TO DJANGO AND BETINA
          Betina and Django walk by a big tree on the plantation grounds.
          The cotton fields and the SLAVES picking it, in the background.

                         DJANGO
          Betina, come over here, I need to ask
          you something.
          He moves her by the tree for more privacy. Betina thinks this fancy
          pants wants to get all lovey-dovey, and she couldn't be less interested.

          She points to the cotton field, at a OVERSEER on top of a horse, whip
          in hand, eyeing the blacks at his mercy.
          Django takes hold of a little bag slung over his shoulder opens it, and
          takes out a shiny brass SPYGLASS, the type a sea captain might use.
          Obviously a prop from Dr.Schultz. He slides it open, places it against
          his eye, and points it in the direction of a figure out in the cotton
          field landscape.

                         SPYGLASS POV:
          Astride his nag, the filthy hillbilly, who calls himself SHAFFER, but

          turns the corner to the stable, and stands behind them. They don't see
          him. Big John rears back to make the first WHIP LASH...

          WHEN ...
          .DJANGO'S VOICE, stops him;

                         DJANGO
          John Brittle!
          Big John breaks his whip stride, looks. up, and in a discarded full
          length broken mirror from the big house, laying abandoned against the
          stable wall, he see's DJANGO, dressed in his powder blue satin Little
          Lord Flauntleroy outfit, surrounded by his pack of little French
          Bulldogs.
          LITTLE JODY on her knees, tied to the dead tree stump, looks up see's
          the same thing in the mirror.
          LITTLE RAJ looks to his left at the sounds of the voice.
          BIG JOHN turns toward Django, who he still doesn't recognize.
          DJANGO just stares back.
          BIG JOHN smile disappears. He recognizes Django.
          So does Roger.

                         LITTLE RAJ
          Django?
          Django crosses toward Big John, raising up his arm like he's going to
          shake his hand ...

                         DJANGO
          Remember me?
          .Django extends his arm, and Dr.Schultz's Derringer arm
          contraption,. POPS the TINY GUN into his hand, and he FIRES a tiny
          bullet smack dab into BIG JOHN'S MERCILESS HEART.

          BIG JOHN FACE
          goes into shock... .he falls to his knees...he looks up, clutching his
          heart, at Django.

          LITTLE JODY can't believe what she's just seen.
          FOUR OTHER SLAVES who just happen to be walking in the background, see
          it.
          LITTLE RAJ is stunned ... . then comes to his senses, fumbling for the
          gun he wears on his hip, but since he's no gunman, in his haste, he
          gets it out of his holster, but drops it on the ground.
          It goes off... BANG.
          SHOOTING himself in the foot, he HOPS UP AND DOWN in pain.
          The Bulldogs scatter at the sound. of the BANG.
          DJANGO picks Big John's WHIP off the ground., and begins WHIPPING
          LITTLE RAJ across the face and chest.
          MORE SLAVES gather.

          DJANGO WHIPS HIM TO THE GROUND
          whips him on the ground, then throws the whip to the ground, picks
          Roger's pistol off the ground, and empties it (FIVE SHOTS) into Roger.
          To say the slaves are flabbergasted, is a understatement.
          Dr.Schultz rides his horse up quickly, rifle in his hand. He sees
          Django, and the two dead bodies.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Who are they?

                         DJANGO
          That's John Brittle, and that's his
          little brother Raj.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Where's Ellis?

                         DJANGO
          He's the one hightailin' it across that
          field right now.
          Ellis Brittle riding his horse full out through the cotton field trying
          to make an escape.

          BAM!
          The German picks the middle Brittle brother off his horse.
           The dead man WIPES OUT horribly in the thick cotton brush.
          RED BLOOD splashes on WHITE COTTON.
          The German and Django have the entire plantation's attention.
          Spencer Bennett (with his Winchester), his SONS and his OVERSEERS,
          and some HOUSE NIGGERS come around like a angry mob.
          The German tosses his rifle in the dirt, and raises his hands.
          Django does the same with his pistol.
          Dr.Schultz addresses the ANGRY MOB.

          Drï¿½. SCHULTZ
          I am Dr.King Schultz, a legal representative
          of the criminal justice system of the
          United States of America. The man to my
          left is Django Freeman, he's my. deputy.
          In my pocket is a warrant signed by circuit
          court judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin
          Texas, for the arrest and capture, dead or
          alive, of John Brittle, Ellis Brittle, and
          Roger Brittle --

                         DJANGO
          - They were goin by the name, Shaffer.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You know them by the name, Shaffer.
          But the butchers real names'were Brittle.
          These are wanted men. The law wants them
          for murder. I reiterate, this warrant
          states dead or alive. When Django and myself
          executed these men on sight, we were operating
          within our legal. boundaries. Now I realize
          passions are high. But I must warn you,
          the penalty for taking deadly force
          against a officer of the court in the
          performance of his duty is, you will be
          hung by the neck until you are dead.
          This does put a momentary pause in the lynch mob's blood lust.
          After his dramatic pause for effect...
          .Dr.Schultz says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          May I please remove the warrant from my
          pocket so you may examine it?
          Resting his Winchester over his shoulder, Bennett reaches for the
          paper.

                         SPENCER
          Gimmie.
          Dr.Schultz removes the warrant from his jacket pocket, and hands it to
          the plantation owner. Bennett reads it silently to himself, resigned to
          what it says.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Satisfied.
          Bennett eyes go from the warrant to the German.

          All three dead Brittle Brothers lie over the back of the extra horse
          the bounty hunters brought with them.
          Both Bounty Hunters are back in their saddles ready to leave.
          With all the eyes of the plantation on them, the white and black man
          start to ride out, when Spencer "Big Daddy" Bennett, steps in their way
          for one final threat.

                         BENNETT
          Ain't nobody gonna touch you and your Jimmie
          while you on my property. But for lettin' a
          nigger kill a white man, and especially for
          letting a nigger kill a white man in a
          audience of niggers, y'all ain't gonna make
          it out of the county alive. Mark my words
          Schultz, by tomorrow morning your niggers
          gonna be stripped and clipped and hangin'
          from my motherfuckin' gate.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          I'm fully aware Bennett, that you and your
          regulator playmates aren't shy about
          killing for what you believe in. But mark
          my words Big Daddy, if you make a move
          towards Django or myself, you better be
          prepared to die for it.
          The two men ride off.
          The Black and White Audience watch them go.

                         SPENCER'S POV:
          We see the camp by the lake that Dr.Schultz and Django have set up.
          Both wrapped up in bedrolls. The dead bodies of the Brittle Brothers
          lie by them in a pile. A campfire slowly dims.
          We Cut Back to Spencer Bennett lying on his belly with SIX OTHER RIFLE
          CARING MEN observing the camp, from over a grade.
          The Men sneak back down the hill the way they came...
          Where about TWENTY-FOUR REGULATORS are waiting for them ON HORSEBACK,
          all of the riders heads are covered by FLOUR SACKS with eyes and mouth
          holes cut out. Some carry TORCHES, all carry RIFLES or SHOTGUNS.
          Spencer mounts his horse. "Big Daddy" issues orders astride his
          steed..

          Now unless they start shootin' first,
          nobody shoot 'em. That's way too simple
          for these jokers. We're gonna whip that
          nigger lover to death. And I'm gonna
          personally, strip and clip that garboon
          myself.
          Having said his blood thirsty words, he puts the flour sack over his
          head. He tussles with the sack for a bit, then from inside the sack;

          I think we all think the bags was a nice
          idea. But, not pointing any fingers, they
          could of been done better. So how 'bout,

          EXT - LAKE - NIGHT
          The THIRTY RIDERS, all with SACKS OVER THEIR HEADS, come riding over
          the hill, hooting and hollerin. Since nobody can see they ride
          haphazard into each other.'Redfish falls off his horse hard on his fat
          ass. They surround the camp, and when the sleeping Schultz and Django
          don't react, they know something's up. But since nobody can see,
          everybody and everybody's horse is. confused.

          WE HEAR A GROUP OF LINES FROM CIRCLING COWBOYS ON HORSEBACK WITH BAGS
           OVER THEIR HEADS: "Where are they, I can't see" - "They tricked us" -
          "Did somebody fall" "Where the hell are they" "Y'all, Redfish fell
          off his horse-He's kinda hurt bad."

          INSIDE OF THE SMOKE
          pandemonium reigns. Horses and Men trip over bodies and pieces of
          bodies, of horses and men. Men with legs and arms blown off, yell
          bloody murder, hurt and scared Horses cry. Some struggle to get the
          sacks off their heads, while scared horses dance and buck in panic.
          Some are shot by the rifle fire. The rest of the men not blown up, and
          still on horseback, between the sacks and the smoke, still can't see
          worth a damn. And Men and Horses collide with one another, which causes
          more bucking and riders falling. About fifteen of the men who can still
          ride, high tail it the fuck out of there. Whipped and whimpering like
          dogs.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          But I'm serious son, Greenville is just too
          dangerous for you to go fucking around there.
          You're a freed, slave, you should be in New York.
          You shouldn't be in Greenville, you shouldn't
          even be forty miles on any side of Greenville.,
          You shouldn't be anywhere in Mississippi.

                         DJANGO

          where she went, then I gotta go. Now you
          were sayin' where I gotta go first?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          There'should be some sort of records office.
          You know when she was sold, you know where
          she came from, the Carrucan Plantation, and
          you know her name ... . what is her name?

                         DJANGO
          Broomhilda.

          Broomhilda?
          Django.nods his head yes.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Were her owners German?
          Now Django reacts, "How did he know that?

                         DJANGO
          Yeah, how did you know? She wasn't born on
          The Carrucan Plantation. She was raised by
          a German mistress, The Von Shafts. She can
          speak a little German too.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Your wife?

                         DJANGO
          Yeah, when she was little her mistress taught
          her so she'd have somebody to talk German with.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          So let me get this straight, your slave
          wife speaks German, and her name is
          Broomhilda Von Shaft...?

          To say the least.

          This looks like a very pretty place to have
          our picnic. What'd ya say, here?

                         TIME CUT

          EXT - PICNIC IN COUNTRY MEADOW - PRETTY DAY
          The two men sit on a blanket with a nice picnic spread spread out.
          Django eats a cucumber sandwich with the crust cut off, and drinks a
          cup of tea.

                         DJANGO
          How did you know Broomhilda's first masters
          were German?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Broomhilda is a German name. If they named
          her, it stands to reason they'd be German.

                         DJANGO
          Lotsa gals where you from named Broomhilda?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          No, not so much. Broomhilda is the name of
          a character in one of the most popular of
          all the German legends.

                         DJANGO
          Really? There's a story 'bout Broomhilda?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes there is.

                         DJANGO
          Do you know it?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Every German knows that story. Would you
          like me to tell you?
          Django nods his head, yes.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well Broomhilda was a princess. She was the
          daughter of Wotan, the god of all gods.
          Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

                         DJANGO

          I don't exactly remember. I think she disobeys
          him in some way. So at first he's just going to
          obliterate her -

                         DJANGO
          Obliterate... . what does that mean?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Like blow up.
          He pantomimes a explosion.

                         DJANGO
          Phew, that's pretty mad.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes it is, and like most fathers, given a
          little time, he calms down a bit. He's
          still mad at her. He still wants to punish her.
          Just not ... . blow her up. So instead what he
          does, is he puts her high on top of a mountain.

                         DJANGO
          Broomhilda's on a mountain?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          It's a German legend, there's always going
          to be a mountain in there somewhere. So, he
          puts her on top of the mountain and he puts a
          fire breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.
          And. then he surrounds her in circle of hellfire.
          And there Broomhilda shall remain, unless a hero
          arises brave enough to save her.

                         DJANGO
          Does a fella arise?
          From now on as Dr.Schultz talks, he's beginning to realize something he
          wasn't aware of when the conversation started.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes Django, as a matter he does. A fella
          named, Sigfried.

                         DJANGO
          Does Sigfried save her?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes he does, and quite spectacularly, so.
          Now true, he is assisted in his triumph by
          a truly, truly, remarkable sword, still, having
          said that, Sigfried triumphs over all of his
          obstacles not just due to his sword, but due to
          his courage. He scales the mountain, because he's
          not afraid of it. He defeats the dragon, because
          he's not afraid.of him.

          He pours Django and himself some more tea out of a fancy tea pot, as he
          thinks about what he's going to say next.
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Look Django, I don't doubt one day you will
          save your lady love. But I'm afraid I can't
          let you go to Greenville in a good conscious.
          Let me ask you a question, how do you like
          the bounty hunting business?

                         DJANGO
          Kill white folks, and they pay ya?

          I hafta admit, we make a good team.

                         DJANGO
          But I'thought you were mad at me for killin'
          Big John and Rodger?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Yes, on that occasion, you were a tad
          overzealous. But normally, that's a good
          thing. How'd you like to partner up for
          the winter?

                         DJANGO
          What'd ya mean partner up?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You be my deputy, for real this time. A lot
          of the big money is in outlaw gangs. Some
          of these fellas are worth fifteen hundred or
          three thousand a piece. With one man, anything
          over three men is a risk. But with a partner?
          Creating cross fire? It's fish in a. barrel.
          A lot of these gangs hold up in the'hills
          for the winter.

          till the snow melts. I give you a third
          of my bounties. And while we're together,
          I'll teach you a few things you're going
          to need to know.

          head bow thing that Fritz can do?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          That among other things. We make some
          money this winter, when the snow melts,
          I'll take you to Greenville myself, and
          we'll find where they sent your wife.
          I'm pretty good at finding people. Is it a deal?
          No white man has ever done anything for Django, just to him. So
          understandably, he's a little suspicious.

                         DJANGO
          Why you care what happens to me? Why you
          care if I find my wife?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Well frankly, I've never given anybody
          their freedom before. And now that I have,
          I feel vaguely responsible for you. You're
          just not ready to go off on your own, it's
          that simple. You're too green, you'll get hurt.
          Plus when a German meets a real life Sigfried,.
          it's kind of a big deal. As a German, I'm
          obliged to help you on your quest to
          rescue your beloved Broomhilda.
          Django accepts that response.
          What follows is a MONTAGE covering the five months that Django and
          Schultz partner up as bounty hunters. Schultz wears his normal
          ensemble. Django wears his cool looking Green Jacket, unless it's
          really cold, which a lot of this Montage is. Then he still wears Ace
          Specks raw hide winter coat over his cool clothes.

                         WE SEE
          A SCENE to be improvised (more or less), where Dr.Schultz teaches
          Django how to draw and shoot the pistol in the holster at his hip.
          By the end of the scene, after trial and error, we see Django's going
          to be good at this.

          EXT - HILLSIDE - SUNNY DAY
          We see Django and Dr.Schultz walking up a hill. Tony and Fritz have
          been left tied up downhill. Django leads a extra body HORSE (named
          PONCHO) behind him. Dr.Schultz carries his scope sight rifle in 'a long
          case. They get to the top of the hill. It overlooks a small farmhouse.

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          That little man pushing that plow, is Smitty Bacall.

                         DJANGO
          Smitty Bacall is a farmer?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          No. Smitty Bacall is a stagecoach robber
          who's hiding out as a farmer, because
          there's a seven thousand dollar bounty on
          his head.
          He hands Django the scope rifle case.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

          Django removes the folded up handbill from the pocket of his tan pants.

          It's now full on snowy winter in the hills.
          Django practices his quick draw against a SNOWMAN he's built. He sticks
          a BOTTLE in it, so the bottom of the bottle is where the snowman's
          heart would be.

          The snow encrusted bounty hunters come inside the lawmans office.
          They exchange pleasantries about the weather as the Sheriff pours them
          coffee. After the two frosty gentlemen have drunk some of the hot
          liquid, they get down to business. As Schultz and Gus discuss the
          bounties, Django reads the handbills aloud from off the wall. On the
          third one he reads, WARREN VANDERS, and a two thousand dollar bounty,
          "That one", Schultz says.
          Django RIPS IT off the wall.
          As the winter has progressed, we see they've become a genuine bounty
          hunting team. And Django, a genuine bounty hunter.

          He holds out his fist, opens his hand, the coins lay in his palm.
          All the coins have bullet holes dead in their center. He drops them on
          top of Django.

          Oh you're ready for Greenville.
          He lights a match, then lights the pipe, puffing as he says;

          What we also saw in the above montage is Django shake off a lifetime of
          slavery. Django, in his green jacket, in his cowboy hat, on top of his
          steed Tony, with his gun hanging from his hip, has become his own man.
          He's not a slave anymore. He's a bounty hunter.

          the mud,, down the main street of Greenville Mississippi. The buying and
          selling of slaves is what the whole town is built around.
          BLACK MEN, WOMEN, and CHILDREN in BONDAGE are everywhere you look.
          LINES OF CHAINED SLAVES being marched one way or the other, move
          through the muddy streets of Greenville. WHITE MEN on horses move them
          along.
          BUCKBOARDS filled with DOMESTIC SLAVES (HOUSE NIGGERS), and pretty
          PONYS, driven by WHITE MEN roll through the street.

          SLAVE CHILDREN through town. A SHEPHERD'S DOG, HELPS HIM OUT BY MOVING

          Dr.Schultz takes in this African flesh market, where human beings sell
          other human beings, with disgust and a little bit of shock.
          Django is neither disgusted or. shocked, he knows first hand how
          Greenville operates.
          As he rides Tony through town in his snappy duds, he looks'at the BLACK
          MEN half dressed: in chains. He REMEMBERS HIMSELF with his six Other
          Companions from earlier, being walked through the mud of Main Street by
          The Speck Brothers. On that day he might as well of been a steer.
          Today, with a gun on his hip, money in his pocket, in his snappy
          outfit, astride his steed Tony, he feels so different from these
          wretched half naked bastards it gives him a bit of a chill.
          Django sees the towns railroad depot, and across from it a huge SLAVE
          PEN, like a STEER CORRAL. At the moment there's no train in the depot.

          you can!
          The boxcar door is slid open, and a HUNDRED AND FIFTY BLACK MALES
          run full out from the train to the steer corral.
          We spot Django during the running.
          Once inside the corral, the gate is closed.
          COWBOYS with rifles act as prison guards.

          INSIDE THE CORRAL
          through the wooden posts, in the distance, Django watches them open up
          the boxcar holding the females. They do their run to their pen out of
          view.
          Django catches a quick glimpse of Broomhild.a running with the other

          Broomhilda, as before is walked by in the distance.
          Then, as before Django loses sight of her.

          EXT - MAIN STREET - GREENVILLE - DAY
          We follow in front of Broomhilda being lead out of the slave pen by TWO
          WHITE MALE SLAVERS. Her bare feet slosh in the Main Street mud, and
          the leg irons scrap her ankles.
          Up until now everything you've ever seen of Broomhilda, has only been
          in Django's Spaghetti Western Flashbacks. In other words, from his
          perspective, and memory. This is the,only time the story will shift to
          Broomhilda's perspective. The strong but frightened girl is led out on
          to the hustle and bustle, and wagon wheels and horse hoofs of Main
          Street.
          Broomhilda is not taken into that three story auction arena that Django
          was sold in at the beginning. Instead She's just lifted up on a parked
          buckboard wagon. Her SELLER (CLYDE) starts his pitch on the TWELVE or
          so BUYERS that watch this puny make shift auction.

          looks down into the crowd of twelve ugly white men, and holds her
          breath which one will buy her.
          Among the ugly white men we see Mr.HARMONY (MIKE), not quite as ugly as
          the rest. An older well dressed, classy gentleman. Next to him is his
          twenty four year old overweight awkward son SCOTTY HARMONY.

          back, revealing her whip marks. Then pointing out the runaway "r"
          branded in her cheek.
          Some of the crowd, including Scotty, react with repulsion at the sight
          of the whip marks. The Seller assures the crowd, that niggers don't
          feel pain like white folks, and it only makes the women more gentle.

          Mr.Harmony congratulates his son.
          From on top of the buckboard Broomhilda looks down at her new owners.
          Later they leave for the Harmony house. Scotty lifts Broomhilda up into
          the back of the buckboard. He hands her a little white bag.

          The buckboard makes its way down a country road. Broomhilda in the

          Scotty bought her, but he's too scared to talk to her.
          Broomhilda's muddy bare feet dangle off the wagon. She's beginning to
          realize the young master is the shy type.

          A nice two story southern house. Very nice, but hardly a plantation.
          The household's FOUR DOMESTIC SLAVES. Broomhilda will be the fifth. The
          buckboard pulls up to the front of the house.

          It would be.my pleasure, your first
          weekend at the club, to join me and my
          friends at my table.
          Broomhilda knows this is a man to be avoided.
          But Scotty is swept away being courted by somebody like Calvin Candie.
          She tries to imply they should stay where they are. He brushes her off
          with a, "Don't be silly."
          We see Calvin introduce his table of friends to the couple, and they
          join the party.
          Calvin Candie has his arm around a foxy Pony named SHEBA, whose dress
          is a little more revealing then the others.
          They drink and talk, and the White Men have a forced good time. But
          Calvin Candie can't hide his sinister side from Broomhilda, and it
          keeps her uncomfortable, until she excuses herself from the table to go
          to bed. Scotty's having such a good time with his fancy friends he opts
          to stay behind.'Broomhilda leaves in a bit of a huff, due to Scotty's
          disobedience. If these fancy.fucking white men weren't around making
          Scotty feel so puffy chested, he'd never dismiss her that way.
          We FOLLOW Broomhilda out of the club, across the street, to the hotel.

          her white dress dirty in the mud, but she
          didn't care, the night was ruined anyway.
          Some romantic weekend. Wait till she gets
          home and tells his mother how he ignored her.
          She'll fix his fat ass. Wait till he asks her

          Because when a man has one of the four
          biggest cotton plantations in Dixie, but
          the only thing that seems to ring his chimes
          is big sweaty black males, if WE want to get
          his attention, we better be talking about
          big sweaty black males. So my character is
          that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf, here
          in Greenville to buy my way into the mandingo
          fight game. And your character is the mandingo

          know nothin' 'about horses, you buy yourself
          a One-Eyed Charly who knows about horses.

          buddy, that's pretty fuckin low.

          The white men's ages range from early twenties to old men.
          The girls ages ranges from their twenties, to thirteen.
          The bill of fare is a combination of French cuisine, and hearty beef
          driven American dining.
          The dolled up, decked out'Ponys eat rich French cuisine complete with
          elaborate sauces, and take their knives to thick cuts of steak.
          The younger little girls, usually eat ice cream with hot fudge, banana
          splits, and cookies.
          While-all the men drink whiskey or wine, the girls all drink
          sarsaparilla.

           Inside is Calvin Candie, his bodyguard Bartholomew (still dressed in
          the ill fitting suit), and the lanky sexy Sheba.
          Also, at this moment, TWO MANDINGOS are having a bloody and savage
          fight to death in this closed room.
          An older European looking man, who's rooting for the mandingo that
          Calvin's not rooting for, is also in the room. His name is.AMERIGO

          Dr.Schultz steps up to get a better look at the savage fight.
          The bigger mandingo is really hurting the smaller one.
          Schultz has schooled Django on the importance of never BREAKING
          CHARACTER.' Well now the good doctor must practice what he preaches.
          Which means not only must he watch. the two men beat each other to
          death, he must appear to convincingly enjoy it.

          WERE THE MANDINGOS FROM Candyland that didn't sell at Greenville are
          walking back to Candyland, with their small bundle of personal
          possessions under their arms. These poor devil's know their fate is
          pretty dismal. Either they'll be sold to the LeQuint Dickey Mining

          not without difficulty.

          He didn't call her by name, but she's a
          young lady, whip marks on 'her back, and
          speaks German. Now while it's not wise to
          assume, in this instance, I think it's
          pretty safe.

                         DJANGO

          Calvin climbs down off of his horse, and walks to the captured runaway
          on the ground.

          But the fact remains, I pay five hundred
          dollars, I want five fights. So what
          about my five hundred dollars? You gonna
          reimburse me?
          The Whites (except for Schultz) laugh.
          This whole spectacle is making Dr.Schultz sick to his stomach.
          Not Django ... . he's seen this little drama play out many times before.
          The three returning mandingos, Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester,
          watch their fellow doomed servant pay the price for running away.
          The five new mandingos watch Calvin Candie's treatment of D'Artagnan to
          know what to expect from their new home.
          Bartholomew on the buckboard looks at the captured runaway like, poor
          bastard.

          All eyes turn to Dr.Schultz.
          Including Django's, whose eyes narrow at the doctor.
          Calvin Candie uses the occasion to perform a slow dramatic turn in the
          direction of the good German.

          Dr.Schultz realizes he's just done the one thing he's always preached

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Follow me.
          The whole caravan rides off as the dogs continue to tear D'Artagnan
          apart.

          EXT - THE GROUNDS OF CANDYLAND - DAY
          The caravan starts to approach Candyland. Calvin Candie and his sister
          own the fourth biggest cotton plantation in the state of Mississippi.
          As the parade gets closer we see fields of cotton, and fields of SLAVES
          picking it.
          The audience might of been expecting Candyland to be a hell on earth,
          Auschwitz, Andersonville, Yuma Prison, a Mexican prison in a Sergio
          Corbucci Spaghetti western ...
          INSTEAD ... . CANDYLAND is very beautiful. The fields of cotton, the way
          the trees hang green vines over everything. It's full of nature and
          natures vibrant colors, and a broiling hot sun to see it all in.
          One of the cottonpickers in the field, DOBIE, looks up, and sees Django
          in his cool green corduroy jacket, badass cowboy hat, on top of Tony.
          He taps the shoulder of another cotton picker (ORWELL), and points out
          Django.

          All of a sudden all the bent over backs in the field, straighten up to
          get a better look at the black riding a horse.
          Django looks back matching their stare.

          EXT - SLAVE VILLAGE - DAY
          The caravan rolls through the shack/cabin village the slaves live in.
          As the parade rolls through all the SLAVES snap to attention, and bow
          (very formally) as Monsieur Candie rides past. A KING among his SUBJECTS,
          a PATRON with his PEONS, a FATHER amongst his CHILDREN, a SHEPHERD
          among his SHEEP.
          KIDS playing in the dirt get up and run to Calvin on his horse.
          Candie calls the kids by name, takes out a bag of jelly beans, and
          begins tossing them about.
          The Kids scramble in the dirt for the bright colored candy.
          This is Calvin Candie in his element, at his happiest.

          THEN ...
          .DJANGO rides by.
          The CARAVAN moves from the slave village to the White Village the
          overseers and their family live in on the plantation grounds.
          Other then the switch of white faces for black, it's pretty much the
          same village.
          And they too see Django ... . WOW!
          The Caravan enters the road that leads to the front of the Plantation,
          or The Big House as everyone calls it.
          To the left of the Big House is big wooden ARENA built for his Friday
          night nigger fights.
          All the HOUSE SLAVES (the domestic slaves that work for the Candie
          family in the Big House), and WHITE WORKERS (overseers and stray farm
          hands) come out to greet the caravan.
          They all greet Monsieur Calvin Candie, who naturally leads the
          procession, as if he's Alexander The Great returning from the wars.
          As the caravan comes to a stop in front of the Big House, it creates a
          huge dust cloud behind it.
          Calvin's widowed sister LARA LEE CANDIE-FITZWILLY, an attractive
          ï¿½. fortyish, strawberry blonde southern belle, steps out on the porch of
          the Big House to greet her brother.

          steps...

                         STEPHEN
          eyeing Calvin and the approaching caravan.
          Who's STEPHEN? Stephen is a very old black man, who with his bald pate,
          and tufts of white curly hair on the sides, looks like a character out
          of Dickens - if Dickens wrote about House Niggers in the Antebellum
          South. -
          Stephen has been Calvin's slave since he was a little boy. And in
          (almost) every way is the 2nd most powerful person at Candyland.
          Like the characters Basil Rathbone would play in swashbucklers, evil,
          scheming, intriguing men, always trying to influence and manipulate power
          for their own self interest. Well that describes Stephen to a tee.
          The Basil Rathbone of House Niggers.
          The old Man watches the caravan and the trailing dust cloud approach.

          THEN...
          Out of the dust cloud ...EMERGE DJANGO and SCHULTZ... . on TONY and FRITZ.
          All the Candylanders see Django, dressed like he is, up on the horse,
          and for a moment don't know what to think.
          Lara Lee, like her brother, is both surprised and intrigued.
          As Stephen peers down from his perch at the nigger in the green jacket,
          it's hate at first sight. Stephen heads downstairs, he walks with a,
          limp.
          All the caravan riders are still up on their horses. Calvin sees
          Stephen limping towards them, and greets him with a big how do you do;

          CODY. While Ace is dressed for work on a farm, both Brown and Jingle
          Bells Cody are peacocks who wear cool cowboy outfits.

          WE DISSOLVE to later, as we see Dr.Schultz and Django explain what-
          they're doing there, who they're pretending to be, and what their plan
          is to Broomhilda. We hear a woman whistle a soft pretty tune on the
          soundtrack. It's not a happy tune.. .per se. But it's pretty, and
          vaguely optimistic ...
          WE DISSOLVE TO The SLAVE PEN
          The doomed men who didn't sell at Greenville, brooding Rodney and
          Chester and Chicken Charly, spend their last night at Candyland
          sleeping under the stars in The Slave Pen. The same whistling tune
          continues over this scene.
          Rodney sees, The whole slave selling and buying group, Django,
          Dr.Schultz, Candie, Bartholomew, Moguy, Ace Woody, Brown and Cody, and
          the Overseers, walk across the plantation grounds on their way to
          The Arena. Laughin' and joshin' all the way. The hatred Rodney feels
          for that group of men burns inside him like a red hot poker.
          A study in powerless fury.

          in the dining room of The Big House with its knives, spoons and forks.
          She's all by herself as she goes through this duty.
          The whistling tune we've been listening to has been coming from
          Broomhilda whistling as she sets the table.
          Suddenly out of the darkness of the background appears Stephen.

          INT - DINING ROOM (BIG HOUSE) - NIGHT
          Later that evening, Django and a lot of other white people (Calvin
          Candie, Lara Lee, Moguy, and Dr.Schultz) sat around the dinner table.
          They are being served by the black people we've come to know at
          Candyland (Stephen, Cora, and because Dr.Schultz likes her Broomhilda).
          Along with an army of DOMESTIC SLAVES acting as wait service.
          Knowing Django's a slaver, and for his dinner table privileges, the
          Domestic Slaves despise Django.
          Even Broomhilda will be shocked to hear him speak like a slaver, even
          though they obviously gave her a heads up on their masquerade.
          We pick up the conversation in mid-negotiation.

          specimens, no doubt about it. But the
          best three, by far, were Sampson, Goldie,
          and Eskimo Joe. - By the way, why's he

          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Irregardless, we all know Samson's your
          best, and you'll never sell him and I can
          see why, he's a champion.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          All three are champions.
          Django contradicts, as he chews his steak;

                         DJANGO
          Samson's the champion. The other two
          are pretty good.
          All the Domestic Slaves around the table STIFFEN at witnessing Django
          contradict Calvin Candie.
          Including Broomhilda, who's wielding the Gravy Boat. After Django says
          that, while in shock, she over pours beef gravy on Lara Lee's mashed
          potatoes.

                         LARA LEE
          Hildi!
          Broomhilda snaps back.
          Instead of getting angry, Candle seems to reflect on that analysis,
          then issues his own appraisal;

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Can Eskimo Joe whip Sampson, no. Can he
          take Goldie, probably not - Goldie's the
          best dirty fightin' nigger I ever saw. But as
          long as you don't put 'em up against those
          two., Eskimo Joe will whip any niggers ass.

          game, I do have a bit of a background in

          Georgia -- all goes well ...twenty to twenty
          one thousand dollars.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Precisely Bright Boy, good on ya. Any way
          you cut that cake, that spells profit.
          Not to, mention a years worth of action at
          the big table in a blood sport with a
          winner nigger. However let me reclarify
          how this whole negotiation came about.
          It wasn't me who came to you to sell a
          nigger, it was you who approached me to
          buy one. Now that nine thousand dollar
          figure Bright Boy was banding about,
          ain't too far off from right. And if I
          wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that, I
          could sell 'em any day of the week.
          But like you said in Greenville doctor,
          I don't wanna sell 'em. It was only your
          ridiculous offer of twelve thousand
          dollars that would make me consider it.
          Dr.Schultz considers'Calvin Candie's words, then suddenly says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          You know Monsieur Candie... . you do possess
          the power of persuasion.
          Candie smiles at that remark.
          Then SUDDENLY Schultz SLAPS the table hard with his hand, and says;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          Why not! Monsieur Candie, you have a deal,
          Eskimo Joe, twelve thousand dollars!
          The White people at the table get very happy.
          Dr.Schultz continues;
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          However, that is a tremendous amount of
          money. And the way you have your Mr.Moguy,
          I have a lawyer, a persnickety man named
          Tuttle. And I would need my man to draw
          up a legal contract before I would feel
          comfortable exchanging that amount of
          money for flesh. Not to mention having
          Eskimo Joe examined by a physician of my
          choosing. So say I return in about five
          days time with my Mr.Tuttle. And then my
          Mr.Tuttle and your Mr.Moguy can hash out
          the finer points between themselves.

          Stephen, time for dessert!
          Stephen, Cora, Broomhilda, and the other Domestics come out of the
          kitchen to clear away the dirty dishes.
          Broomhilda goes to Calvin.

          Can I take away your dishes, Monsieur Candle?

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Yes you may, Hildi.
          She begins gathering the dirty dishes.
          Candie looks up at her as she works.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          So Hildi, how you like servin at the big
          table in the big house?

                         BROOMHILDA
          I like it a lot Monsieur Candle.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          It's a lot better then sizzling in that
          hot box, or draggin' your ass through a
          bramble bush, ain't it?

                         BROOMHILDA
          Yes 'em.
          With Candie interrogating Broomhilda, Django tenses up.
          Stephen clocks this.
          Stephen decides to test Django's reaction.

                         STEPHEN
          You know Monsieur Candle, the doctor might
          be interested in seein' Hildi's "peeled"
          back. Seein' as he don't see many niggers
          where he from.

                         (TO SCHULTZ)
          When you was alone with Hildi here, didja
          just speak German, or did ya git her

          So you haven't seen her back?
          Dr.SCHULTZ
          No I haven't.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Then Stephen's right, you would probably
          find this interesting. Hildi, take off
          your dress, and show us your back.
          Django hears this.
          Broomhilda instinctively shoots a look to Django.
          Stephen clocks it.

                         LARA LEE
          Calvin, I just got her all dressed up
          and looking nice.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          But Lara Lee, Dr.Schultz is from Dusseldorf,
          they don't got niggers there. And he's a
          man of medicine. I'm sure it would
          fascinate him, the niggers endurance for
          pain. I mean Hildi got something like
          fifteen lashes on her back. Lara Lee get
          one, she'd lose her mind. These niggers
          are tough, no doubt about it.

                         LARA LEE
          Calvin, we are eating - dessert, no less.
          Ain't no one wanna see her whipped up back.
          Django continues to watching this play out.
          Stephen watches him.
          Candie folds.

                         CALVIN CANDIE
          Okay okay Lara. Maybe after dinner.
          During the brandies.
          Broomhilda - dismissed - takes Calvin's dishes and heads back into the
          kitchen.
          Stephen takes one more look at Django, and follows Broomhilda behind
          the kitchen door.

          Broomhilda turns around.

          Huh?
          Stephen approaches her, the other Domestics get quiet and watch.

          Things have become so tense and quiet in the kitchen, that the dinner

          Dr.Schultz prepare to proposition Candie for Broomhilda. Stephen knows
          these two jokers (Django and Schultz) are up to something, and now he's

          Dr.Schultz, you yourself said, "For the Right
          Nigger you'd be willing to pay what some would
          consider a ridiculous amount." To which, me
          myself said, "What is your definition of
          ridiculous?" To which you said, "Twelve
          thousand dollars."
          Now considering you two have ridden a whole
          lotta miles, went to a whole lotta trouble,
          and done spread a whole lotta bull, to
          purchase the lovely lady to my left, it would
          appear that Broomhilda is, "The Right Nigger."
          And if y'all wanna leave Candyland with
          Broomhilda, the price is twelve thousand dollars.
          Dr.SCHULTZ

          it style of negotiating.
          Candie continuing to hold the hammer continues.

          I figured you must be an admirer. You named
          your slave after that novel's lead character.

          Django, slightly..swaying to and fro from the rope, looks upside down
          at Ace Woody, all dressed up in a black suit with a string tie, which
          makes him look a bit like Wyatt Earp.

          So y'all bounty hunters,.huh?
          Django thinks, "How does he know?"

          I knew there was something fishy 'bout, y'all.
          We found your wanted posters and book of figures
          in your saddle bags. I gotta say, ain't never
          heard of no black bounty hunter before. A black
          boy paid to kill white men? How did ya like that
          line of work?
          Django retorts, upside down.

          Well, it turns out I was a natural.
          Ace woody laughs.

          Boy, people 'round here are cross wit you.
          Ace Woody pulls up a tiny milking stool, and sits down on it, a body
          length from the hanging man.

                         ACE WOODY
          See Boss Man was a rather beloved figure
          'round here. Now he's dead as fried chicken,
          everyone 'round here blames you.
          Ace Woody opens his black suit jacket, we see not only does he wear a
          gun and holster around his waist, he carries a HUGE BOWIE KNIFE ina
          shoulder holster. He removes the big blade from its sheath.

                         ACE WOODY
          Yep, Boss Man's gone. Poor Calvin. Poor
          goddamn Calvin. We're burnin' him in a few
          hours. At sunset. Should be real pretty.
          However ... . I don't think you're gonna be
          able to attend.
          Ace takes the Bowie Knife and THROWS IT...
          . IT LANDS stuck in the wooden barn yard floor, four inches from
          Django's face.
          Ace Woody slowly rises up from the tiny milking stool, and slowly walks
          the length of the floor between him and Django, pulls the blade out of
          the floor, and walks back to his stool, and sits back down.
          As he does this, he says;

          sunbitch the trouble maker. You just wanted
          to git your girl, and hightail your nigger
          asses outta here. Now I appreciate that.
          But grieving folks 'round here need someone
          to blame. And I guess they figure if you
          hadn't brought your black ass 'round here
          in the first place, Boss Man still be alive.
          And you know what, they got a point.
          He THROWS the knife again...
          .this time IT LANDS in the floor two inches from Django's face.
          He walks the same path from the knife and back to the tiny stool.
          As he does he says;

          the error of his ways, believe me when I.

          bust ass. But me... .I always found the best
          methods are, tried and true.
          He THROWS the knife again...
          Django JERKS his head back ...
          .and the knife LANDS in the floor, right where Django's head was.
          Ace Woody stands up, walks the floor to the Bowie, yanks it out of the
          wood., and straightens up, standing right beside the hanging upside down
          naked black man. Ace talks confidentially to the bound man at his

          Unlike a lot of movie hero's, Django doesn't take torture silently and
          stoically. This shit fucking hurts, so you best believe he screams his
          fucking ass off, and twists in agony when he gets touched by the orange

          cage.
           Jano does this, lifting two out of four bags filled with dynamite off
           the pack horse, and walking to the cage wagon, unlocking ' the cage door,
           and placing the bags inside. The Black Men in the cage don't like this

          wrapped around his waist.
          He locks eyes with the three men in the cage..
          He then moves towards the wagon, and unhooks the mine company beast,
          and climbs aboard him bareback.
          He leans over and snatches the RIFLE that Floyd kept on the wagon seat
          next to him.
          Grabbing a fistful of the horses mane, he digs his heels into the
          beast's side. The pack animals SPRINGS TO LIFE under the new rider. By
          now it should be apparent that Django brings the best out of horses, and
          horses bring the best out of Django.
          From his high horse Django looks down at The Three Caged Men...

          Using the rifle in a QUICK ONE HANDED MOVE he SHOOTS the lock on the

          Rodney grabs a saddle bag full of dynamite and tosses it to Django on

          your cards is different. Instead of chips they play with, "NIGGER EARS"

          EXT - TRACKER SHACK
          As the BARKING gets louder, WE SEE A CLOSE UP of The Axe in the
          chopping block, and Django's hand REMOVING IT.

          opens the bunkhouse door-he sees directly a hundred feet in front of

          After letting go of the axe handle, Django RUNS FULL SPEED toward Jake.
          Before the other three have really registered what's happening, Django
          has crossed the distance, and is YANKING The Axe out of JAKE'S FACE.
          And with AXE in hand, Django chases and fights with all three trackers,
          till after a point where he's CHOPPED DOWN TWO OF THEM, Lex, and Stew,
          and now there's only Mr.Stonesipher left.
          But Mr.Stonesipher has managed to draw his gigantic BUCK KNIFE, and is
          able to fight back against Django. You know Stonesipher's great with a
          knife, plus his fighting style is like one of his dogs, attack attack
          attack.
          Django uses the axe handle in a defensive position.
          The expert Mountain Boy begins SCORING BLADE CUTS on shirtless Django.
          The two men fight until they end up losing their weapons. Then it's
          just a fight of brute strength, and survival. Mr.Stonesipher is
          physically bigger then Django. But if Django's going to save Broomhilda,
          not to mention get revenge on all these Candyland motherfuckers, he has
          to take Stonesipher's ass out.
          This Black Man who has been under the yoke of white man's domination
          all his life, and this White Man who feeds black people to dogs, fight
          each other for their life.
          Django gets his arm around Stonesipher's neck in a headlock, but the
          mountain boy is big enough to lift Django. So like a rodeo rider
          holding onto bull for dear life, Django tightens his lock around his
          opponents neck. Django gets his hand on the HAMMER Jake was building
          the birdhouse with, and BRINGS IT CRASHING DOWN ON THE TOP OF

          STONESIPHER'S HEAD.
          That weakens Stonesipher.
          He HITS HIM AGAIN IN THE HEAD.
          That drops Stonesipher to his knees.
          He HITS HIM AGAIN WITH THE HAMMER ON THE HEAD.
          That puts the mountain man down on his back.
          He HITS HIM ONE MORE TIME WITH THE HAMMER TO keep him down for good.
          The Trackers are all dead.
          Only the dogs mad barking remains.

          INSERT: DJANGO stirring a big pot of BEEF STEW with a wooden spoon in
          the tracker shack.
          Timmy comes'in carrying a bunch of toadstools inside his shirt.
          Django takes the toadstools and Mr.Stonesipher's BUCK KNIFE and CHOPS
          the mushrooms into tiny pieces.
          He tosses the tiny bits of poisoned shrooms into the beefy sauce, and
          mixes it up with the spoon.

          EXT - MARSHA'S KENNEL - NIGHT
          Django throws the pot of poisoned beef stew over the top of the kennel.
          It lands on the ground with a PLOP.
          The Angry Dogs, are nevertheless', still dogs, and greedily scarf up
          the stew.
          Django watches them wolf down their ultimate agony with a smile.

                         DJANGO
          You bit your last nigger, bitch? Bite on that.
          Django lifts Timmy up on to the bare backed wagon horse.

          First things first, boy. Take me to my horse.

          TNT - STABLE-BLACKSMITH - NIGHT
          Timmy brings Django to the stable on the Candyland grounds. Django goes
          straight up to the stall housing Tony and says hello. Tony's happy to
          see him. Django feeds him an apple he picked along the way for him.
          He turns and sees the body of Dr.Schultz lying in a heap.
          And Schultz's horse Fritz in the stable.

                         DJANGO

          Now, boy!
          Timmy hops to work.
          Django bends down over the body of Dr.Schultz, he takes Broomhilda's
          bill of sale and freedom papers out of his back pocket. He also
          searches for and finds Schultz's hidden DERRINGER, he keeps it in a
          holster around his ankle.
          As Timmy saddles the horses, he asks;

                         TIMMY
          Do you feel bad for your friend?
          Django rises from the body of his friend.

                         DJANGO
          Yeah, "I do.
          As Timmy saddles the horses he says;

                         TIMMY
          I know just how ya feel. I lost a white
          friend once. He drowned in the lake.
          Django doesn't correct the difference between Dr.Schultz and a white
          friend, because there's nothing he could say to Timmy to make him
          understand.
          He goes over to his pile of clothes, which still lie next to the
          furnace. He Puts on his boots. His Green Jacket over his bare chest.
          And finally his hat.

          He exits the shack to go the outhouse, leaving Broomhilda alone.

          Django, she cries for herself...

          They enter the lawn in front of The Big House, and head for the front
          door.
          Broomhilda on Fritz and Timmy riding on Tony come along the side of the
          property by some shed. They see The Candie Family Unit, all dressed in

          The woman and little boy stop. But the group of enemies aren't looking

          starts coming to their senses. Nobody was killed, or even seriously
          hurt (unless you count eardrums), just stunned.
          As their minds try and grasp with what just happened, their eyes look
          up from the ground, and try and see through the smoke and dust.
          The'SMOKE and DUST thins a little, and we see inside the smoke the
          mansion has been obliterated, but The Big House front steps remain.

          rifle held casually in his left hand. His right hand held casually by

          It's now Django who gives the orders. They stand up quickly.

          ACE WOODY starts to go for the gun in his holster, and STEPHEN starts
          to raise his Derringer.
          But it's no contest.
          As soon as Django saw any movement from the six in front of him,
          Floyd's Pistol was QUICKSILVER FAST in. his right hand, as his left hand
          FANNED the Pistols Hammer, SHOOTING INSTANTLY all five White People (and
          Stephen) standing in front of him.
          They all fall to grass in different ways..
          It was never any contest, they and WE (the audience) just didn't know
          HOW GOOD DJANGO was.

          DJANGO showing off his incredible FAST DRAW and ACCURATE MARKSMANSHIP

          Dr.SCHULTZ

          BACK TO SHOWDOWN
          DJANGO stands on the top steps of what's left of'The Big House, looking
          down at The Candie Family Unit, who all lay dead or dying on the
          Candyland front lawn.
          The WITNESSES can't fathom what they'just witnessed.

          All the CANDIE FAMILY UNIT lies on the grass SHOT. But some are still
          alive. We HEAR MOANING coming from LARA LEE, CODY, and MOGUY.
          DJANGO sees this.
          The Black Man reaches behind him and comes out with a DYNAMITE STICK.
          He tosses it on the grass among the bodies.
          He takes aim with his pistol; and FIRES.
          It EXPLODES.
          Finishing off what was left of the Candie Family Unit, not to mention,
          blowing the limbs off of many of them.
          The LAWN is SILENT.
          DJANGO'S PISTOL goes back in its holster.
          Django walks down the front steps of The Big House, feeling tremendous
          satisfaction in the wrath he just wroth on Candie and Co.
          He removes Dr.Schultz's tiny Derringer from Stephen's dead hand,
          putting it in his pocket. Then heads over to where Broomhilda and Timmy
          wait for him with Fritz and Tony.
          As he,walks up to Broomhilda on Fritz, he says;

                         DJANGO
          Hey Little Trouble Maker.

                         BROOMHILDA

          Down, boy.
          Timmy hops off of Tony.
          Django climbs aboard Tony. He says to Broomhilda;

                         DJANGO
          Thanks for the help, boy.
          He reaches into his saddle bag, and pulls out an apple, and tosses it
          down to Timmy.

                         DJANGO
          That's for you. Good luck Tim.
          (he points to
          the Northern Sky)
          The North star, is that one.
          He looks to Broomhilda on Fritz.

                         DJANGO
          You gonna hafta keep up, ya know?

                         BROOMHILDA
          You won't wait for me.

                         DJANGO
          Better not.

                         BROOMHILDA
          You won't.

                         (SMILING)
          You won't.
          They kiss.
          Then, astride Tony, Django leaves Candyland having rescued his
          Broomhilda from her Mountain, her Ring of Hellfire, and all her
          Dragons.
