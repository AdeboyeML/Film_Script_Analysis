1   INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT                                     1

    CLOSE ON: KATE HANNAH -- late-20s, pretty and wholesome and,     *
    oh yeah, piss drunk. She stands on a tiny

    KARAOKE STAGE

    in the far corner of a half-empty dive bar.

    Kate holds a MICROPHONE and dances as she SINGS a bad karaoke
    version of "SONG TO BE DETERMINED." What Kate lacks in talent
    she more than makes up for with charm and enthusiasm.

    At a table near the stage is --

    -- CHARLIE HANNAH: Kate's husband, late-20's, scruffy but      *
    handsome, also pretty damn drunk. He enthusiastically claps
    and points to Kate, making up a cheering section along with --

    -- OWEN HANNAH -- Charlie's younger brother, early-20's --       *
    who sings along with --

    -- the small but energetic CROWD.

    Kate begins to ramble between verses -- and gleefully points
    to Charlie and Owen. For the moment, this drunk girl is the
    Queen of Karaoke.

                                                         2.


Kate finishes the song and drunkenly tumbles off the stage to
join Charlie and Owen.

                    CHARLIE
          That was so good, baby!

                       KATE
          Bullshit.

                    CHARLIE
          I'm serious. You sing like an angel
          -- a drunk angel.

Owen and Kate LAUGH.

                    KATE
          If you were writing about my
          performance for your blog, what
          would you say?

                    CHARLIE
          I'd say that, uh...my wife is the
          sexiest, most amazing woman alive.

                    KATE
          That would be such a shitty article
          -- nobody would read it.

Kate and Charlie laugh and kiss -- and then Kate glances at
Owen and makes a puppy dog face.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
              (to Owen)
          Aw...we need to find you a lady,

                    OWEN
          Yeah -- I've been trying to flirt
          with the bartender, but...I can't
          tell.

Owen motions to the --

                    KATE
          She's hot! What can't you tell?

                    OWEN
          She looks like she could kick my
          ass. No way would she go for a guy
          like me.
                                                         3.


                    KATE
          You're being a little girl -- just
          go talk to her.

                    OWEN
              (clearly shy)
          I don't know...forget about it.

                    KATE
              (not going to take "no"
               for an answer)
          I'll take point -- follow me.

Kate stumbles to the bar. Charlie and Owen follow. Kate puts
her arms around Owen and gets the attention of the bartender.

                     KATE (CONT'D)
          I want to buy a gimlet for me and a
          double-shot of whiskey for my
          brother-in-law `cause he's had a
          hard week.

                    FEMALE BARTENDER
          `Kay.

The bartender quickly pours the drinks.

                    FEMALE BARTENDER (CONT'D)
          That's fifteen.

                    KATE
          Wait -- don't you wanna know what
          happened to him?

The bartender rolls her eyes and checks around the bar to see
if there are other customers. It's pretty dead -- so she
listens.

                    FEMALE BARTENDER
              (unenthused)
          What happened?

                    KATE
          He just got back from England --
          because he went there for a girl! A
          preppy, bitchy girl. Diane
          Court...that was her name. He loved
          her so much that he went with her
          because she had a fellowship or
          something. He gave up being a
          kickboxer. A kickboxer!                               *
              (sad)
          And she dumped him.
                                                         4.


The bartender sizes up Owen. The trio waits with anticipation
to hear her response, which is --

                    FEMALE BARTENDER
              (to Owen)
          You kickbox?

                    OWEN
              (caught in the headlights)
          Yeah.

And...that's all Owen's got.

                    KATE
              (jumping in)
          And he teaches kids at the
          kickboxing studio. Oh, they're so
          cute!

The bartender glances back to Owen.

                     OWEN
              (finally)
          A lot of `em don't have parents --
          so...it's kinda more than just a
          teacher/student thing.
              (beat)
          I know it sounds silly, but I feel
          responsible for them -- like...
              (emotional)
          ...I could be their parent.

Kate slides down the bar to Charlie.

                    KATE
              (hushed)
          I think I got him laid.

                       CHARLIE
          Yeah?

                    KATE
          She seems totally game.

                    CHARLIE
          Sure she just didn't want to get
          into your pants?

Kate rolls her eyes.

                    KATE
          I think I'm done for the night.
                                                5.


                    CHARLIE

Owen wanders over, dejected.                         *

          She's seen "Say Anything."

          huh?
               (beat)
          Wanna drive us home?

                    KATE
          No -- he needs to keep working it!         *
          You guys stay here.

                     CHARLIE
          I don't want to watch my brother
          not score. I want to go to bed with
          you and...

               ear)
          ...you know.

                    KATE
          I'll be home when you get there. We
          can "you know" then.

                    OWEN
              (to Charlie)
          Yeah, man -- you don't have a job
          to wake up for in the morning or
          anything.

                    CHARLIE
          Writing is a job! Not having to
          report to an office only makes work
          harder.
              (to Kate)
          Baby, you drank a lot. I think Owen
          should take us home -- you're too
          drunk to drive.

                     KATE
          So's Owen.
              (suddenly focused)
          I'm not that drunk. Besides, you
          know I focus when I drive -- it
          sobers me up.

                    CHARLIE
          Tell that to the cops.
                                                             6.


    Kate kisses Charlie and hugs Owen.

                        KATE
                  (to Charlie)
              I love you, baby. I'll be waiting
              for you in a nice warm bed. You
              have exactly one mission: get your
              brother laid -- and don't talk to
              any other women.

    Beat.

                        CHARLIE
              That sounds like two missions.

                        KATE
              No, it's just one.

                        CHARLIE
                  (to Owen)
              It kinda sounded like two, right?

              It did.

    Kate grins and slowly backs away towards the door.

    Kate stumbles out of the bar and hears a GROAN. She glances
    over and sees:

    A drunk woman -- FREDA, 30s -- sitting on the curb. She MOANS
    again.

    Kate glances around the parking lot. Nobody else but her and

              My bitch sister just took off and
              left me here so she could hook up

              week where they sold 29 cent
              hamburgers, and another day where
              they had 39 cent cheeseburgers. My
              mom and me would go there and she'd
              get twenty burgers -- that was the
              limit, probably set up for folks
              just like us -- and then she'd put

              microwave `em for dinner throughout

     Kate sits across a desk from --

     -- PRINCIPAL BARNES: female, early 50's, stern, scattered,        *
     and clearly a softy at heart, she wears a pair of GLASSES         *

               Vice Principal Davies will be
               looking after your students for the
               rest of the day -- so you don't
               need to worry about that.
                                                        18.


                     KATE
          Oh, that's really good to know.
          I'll have to thank him.
              (beat)
          I just feel awful for getting sick
          in front of my students.

                     PRINCIPAL BARNES
          Oh, please -- they're troopers. I'm
          sure they've seen plenty worse.

          So -- how long have you been
          pregnant?

                    KATE
          Um...it's the first trimester.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          Well, it's very exciting. You must
          be thrilled.

                       KATE

          Uh-huh.


                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          Can I ask a...personal question?

                       KATE
          Okay.

                     PRINCIPAL BARNES
          How's it...
              (beat)
          ...going for you?

                       KATE
          Huh?

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          The pregnancy, I mean.

Kate's not sure how to respond.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D)
          Having kids wasn't in the cards for
          me. I came close, but...

Principal Barnes drifts off into thought for a moment, then
catches herself and quickly shifts gears.
                                                        19.


                    PRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D)

          couple hundred kids here --
              (forces a laugh)
          -- but...I don't fool myself. It's
          not the same.

                    KATE
              (considers her reply)
          Well...it's hard to explain.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          Of course...

                    KATE
          I wouldn't call it a burden, but --

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
          It's a responsibility.

Beat.

                    KATE
          Yeah. Exactly.

                     PRINCIPAL BARNES
              (nods)
          You're so lucky.

          Can I...touch it?

                    KATE
          Um, I don't...okay -- but it sleeps
          a lot.

                       PRINCIPAL BARNES
          Of course.

                    KATE
          Like...a lot.

Principal Barnes gets up and kneels next to Kate. She places
her hand on Kate's belly and closes her eyes.

                    PRINCIPAL BARNES
              (whispers)
          Hello in there. Can you hear me?
          You're a tiny miracle. Did you know
          that? A miracle.

Principal Barnes looks up at Kate and smiles -- with tears in
her eyes.
                                                                20.


16   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                       16

     Kate walks down the hall and comes to the door of her
     classroom. Through the glass she sees --

     -- Mr. Davies. He notices Kate and smiles (the concerned
     smile you give someone right after they've publicly
     embarrassed themselves).

     Kate mouths the words --

                          KATE
                   (silent)
               Thank you.

     -- and gestures "come here."

     Mr. Davies gestures   to the class that he'll be right back --
     before he walks out   to talk to Kate. He's got a slightly
     nervous demeanor --   somewhere between "I never became
     comfortable talking   to women" and Asperger's.

                         MR. DAVIES
               Is everything, um...okay, Mrs.
               Hannah?

                         KATE
               Yeah, well...I'm really embarrassed
               -- but I feel a lot better. And I
               just wanted to say thank you.

     Mr. Davies glances down the hall.

                         MR. DAVIES
               Look -- I'm not a fool.
                   (whispered)
               I know you were drinking this
               morning.

     Kate looks shocked.

                            MR. DAVIES (CONT'D)
               I saw you.

                         KATE
                   (taken aback)
               Oh, no, I...

                         MR. DAVIES
               Drinking when you're pregnant is
               really dangerous.
                                                             21.


                         KATE
               I know that! Oh, God, I...
                   (long beat)
               ...listen -- I'm not actually
               pregnant.

                         MR. DAVIES
               What?

                         KATE
               I'm just really hung over. The kids
               started asking me questions after I
               vomited and I panicked.

                         MR. DAVIES
               Oh. That's...not good.

                         KATE
               I know. I...please don't say
               anything.

     Mr. Davies looks torn, unsure how to respond.

                         MR. DAVIES
               Just...go home. Get some sleep.

     Before Kate can say a word, Mr. Davies heads back into the
     classroom.


17   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BATHROOM - DAY                      17

     and --

     -- TWO LITTLE GIRLS curiously watch.

     Kate and Charlie play POOL while splitting a PITCHER OF BEER.
     It's a bit early to be drinking, but hey -- why not?

                         KATE
               I had such a crappy morning.

                         CHARLIE
               Me too. I spent like three hours at
               the post office trying to buy
               stamps and stuff.

     Kate takes a long sip of beer.
                                                        22.


                    KATE
          I told my class I was pregnant.

Charlie looks up at Kate with a beaming smile. He leans over
and grabs her hand.

                    CHARLIE
              (excited and sort of
               confused)
          Oh, baby, that's --

                    KATE
          I'm not. Pregnant. So don't worry.

          `Course then I'd have to drink your
          beer...

                    KATE
          Well, it was a lie. I just lied to
          my class. After barfing in front of
          them.

                    CHARLIE

          Yeah, that's what they said.

          Listen...I can't do this anymore.

A look of complete terror and confusion passes over Charlie's
face.

          What do you mean?

                    KATE
          I dunno. I think I might...drink
          too much.

Charlie LAUGHS.

                    CHARLIE
          Oh. That. Yeah...you kinda do.

Charlie swigs his beer.
                                      23.


          KATE
I know I do -- I'm a fucking
mess...

          CHARLIE
Baby -- that's not true. You're
beautiful. And brilliant. And I
love you. I wouldn't be married to
a "mess."

          KATE
I left work after puking in front           *
of little kids. And...now I'm               *
drinking in the middle of the day.          *

           CHARLIE
Well, those things happen
sometimes.
    (beat)
I mean, they shouldn't happen all
the time, but...it's the price of,
uh, truly living life.

          KATE
Isn't that like a slogan for some
kind of beer or toothpaste or
something...?

           CHARLIE
No. And it's true -- you and me,
we're not just some boring couple
in the suburbs who don't sleep with
each other and have nothing to talk
about except whatever TV show
they're currently into.
    (beat)
We, like...still know how to party.

Yeah...

I'll help you.

I know, but...I might need more
help.

          CHARLIE
Yeah? Like a therapist?
                                                24.


                    KATE
          I don't know -- I just get stupid
          when I'm drunk, and I'm drunk a
          lot.

                    CHARLIE
          We just like to have a good time.

          WHAT?!

Some bar patrons glance at Kate and Charlie.

                    KATE
          After I left the bar, I, uh, picked
          up this drunk girl and...I don't
          really remember what came next, but
          I ended up smoking crack with her.

          Where?

          What?

                    KATE
          Well...she might be homeless. Or a

          Oh, my god...you smoked crack with

          Ughhh...

          Just playing Devil's advocate, but

Kate gives Charlie a dirty look.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          I'm just saying.

                     KATE
          The drinking led to the crack-
          smoking. The drinking leads to
          everything stupid I do.

remember. And can't.

          We'll chill out with the booze for

     Kate looks down but sees nothing.

                         KATE
               What crack?
                                                             27.


                         CHARLIE
               Oh, sorry -- I thought there was a
               crack there...
                   (grins)
               ...but you must have smoked it last
               night.

     Kate rolls her eyes -- and then jokingly swerves towards
     Charlie, trying to knock him over. He LAUGHS and speeds away.
     Kate chases after him.


20   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER           20

     While an old 70's R & B song plays on a RECORD PLAYER, which
     is next to STACKS AND STACKS OF RECORDS --

     -- Kate and Charlie drunkenly slow dance, drink WINE, and        *
     LAUGH at an AA PAMPHLET.

                         CHARLIE
               "Have you missed days of work or
               school because of drinking?"

                         KATE
               Absolutely.

                         CHARLIE
               "Do you envy people who can drink
               without getting into trouble?"

                         KATE
               Envy isn't exactly the right
               word...

                         CHARLIE
               "Do you have `blackouts'?"

                         KATE
               Yeah, but who doesn't?

                         CHARLIE
               "Has your drinking caused trouble
               at home?"

                         KATE
               No! We're great.

                         CHARLIE
               Yeah. Definitely. But we still had
               a lot of "yes" answers.
                   (refers to pamphlet)
               Yep...we still qualify as drunks.

               Yeah, right.

                         KATE
               No -- I'm serious! I'm gonna go.
               What time is it?

                         CHARLIE
               Eight.

     Kate gets up.

                         KATE
               See ya.

               Uh-huh...

     Kate takes a big sip of wine.

                   (quite serious)
               This is me: going.

     Charlie LAUGHS -- he doesn't buy it.

                         CHARLIE
               You've been boozing.

                         KATE
               So? You should come too!

     Charlie LAUGHS.

                          CHARLIE
               Yeah, right. You can't go to AA
               wasted. It's like a rule or
               something.

                         KATE
               Oh, yeah? Watch me!


21   INT. MEETING HALL - NIGHT                                  21

     An AA meeting is in progress.

     An OLDER WOMAN stands at the podium sharing her story.
                                                        29.


The room is filled with --

-- different groups of PEOPLE, all of whom sit with their
"own group," like a high school lunch room -- but the people
are adults. There are distinct groups of --

-- "PRETTY WOMEN" --

-- "OBSESSIVELY TATTOOED PEOPLE" --

-- "BUSINESSMEN" --

-- and "HIPSTERS."

As Kate -- who's slightly confused -- enters the building, a
hip looking man -- DONOVAN, 30's -- stops her, extending his
hand.

                    DONOVAN
              (whispers)
          Hey, I'm Donovan. Welcome.

                    KATE
          Hi Donovan -- I'm Kate!

Donovan "shushes" Kate.

                    DONOVAN
          You must be a newcomer, huh?

                       KATE
          A what?

                    DONOVAN
              (whispers)
          Um, I'm not really allowed to talk
          to new chicks, but there are lots
          of women here who can help you out.

                     KATE
              (confused)
          Okay.
              (beat)
          Do I just sit wherever?

                    DONOVAN
          The meeting already started so just
          try to find a spot anywhere.

Kate drunkenly stumbles to the back of the room, saying
things like "sorry" and "I like that jacket" as she takes a
seat next to two very CLEAN CUT WOMEN.
                                                        30.


As the woman at the podium continues to speak, the women next
to Kate quietly try to welcome her.

                    LILY                                        *
          Are you new?

                    KATE
          To this? Yeah. Why's everyone
          whispering?

                    SHANA                                       *
          It's hard, huh?

                     KATE
          I guess.

                    LILY                                        *
          Everything's going to be fine.
          You're home.

Kate doesn't respond -- just looks around with the fear
anyone would have if they felt they had just accidentally
joined Jim Jones' church.

LATER

The room is COMPLETELY FULL -- with over ONE-HUNDRED PEOPLE.

The tattooed man stands at the podium.

                    TATTOO MAN
          Not to embarrass anyone, but so
          that we may get to know you better -
          - is there anybody here in their
          first thirty days of recovery?

Several PEOPLE scattered throughout the room stand up and
introduce themselves as alcoholics.

Kate stands up.

                    KATE
          I'm Kate. I...I'm...I guess I'm a
          little drunk right now.

People burst into LAUGHTER.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          Do you want me to talk about my
          childhood or something?
                                                        31.


                    TATTOO MAN
              (painfully polite)
          You know, Kate, we actually ask
          that you don't share if you've had                  *
          a drink or any mind-altering
          substance in the past 24 hours.

                    KATE
              (not listening)
          I can -- I kinda hate my dad and
          don't talk to him. And my mom...oh,
          man...I don't even know where to
          start. She's, like, stuck in the
          80's and kind of a metalhead. Her
          last boyfriend called himself a
          drummer but really just gave drum
          lessons to little kids and --

                    TATTOO MAN
              (tries to shut Kate up)
          Welcome, Kate.
              (forces a smile)
          It gets better.

                    KATE
              (not picking up the hint)
          I like drinking is the thing. I
          mean, I don't want to say you guys
          are wrong or anything...

Kate nervously LAUGHS.

Some of the PEOPLE in the crowd look embarrassed for Kate.

                    TATTOO MAN
          Thank you -- we're all here to
          help. We do have to move on,
          though.

The woman next to Kate gets her to sit back down.

                    LILY                                      *
          Don't worry, sweetie -- there'll be
          plenty of time to tell your story.

A young woman -- AMBER, 22 -- approaches the podium.

                    AMBER
          Hey, I'm Amber, alcoholic. I can't
          really believe that it's been five
          years. I mean, my life was a mess
          back then. Now I'm back in school,
          I have an amazing man, I love my
          parents -- it's crazy...
                                                        32.


                    KATE
              (way too loud)
          How old is that girl?! Can she even
          go to bars?
              (to Amber)
          How old are you, Amber?

                    SHANA                                      *
          Be respectful.

Kate seems surprised at being chastised.

                    AMBER
              (gaining intensity)
          Um...okay? It's because I did the
          work. I got down on my knees and
          prayed every night! I went to a
          meeting everyday!

                      KATE
          Everyday?

                    AMBER
          It wasn't easy, but I've gotta say,
          I owe everything to AA. Well, AA --
          and God, of course!

The whole room APPLAUDS.

LATER

Everyone is standing, holding hands, and saying the SERENITY
PRAYER.

                    EVERYONE
          God grant me the serenity to accept
          the things I cannot change --
          courage to change the things I can -
          - and wisdom to know the
          difference.

                      KATE
          AMEN!

Everyone turns and looks at Kate.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
              (embarrassed)
          Okay...I think I'm good.

Kate quickly leaves the meeting as clumsily as she arrived.
                                                             33.


22   EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT               22

     Kate chugs frozen Margarita straight from a PITCHER.

                         KATE
               So much for that.

     Kate and Charlie stand in their backyard, which is criss-
     crossed by WHITE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS and has some old LAWN
     FURNITURE.

     They drunkenly play CROQUET.                                      *

                         CHARLIE
               Was it a bunch of old biker guys?

                         KATE
               No, it was...I don't know.
               Enthusiastic people. A lot of
               really ENTHUSIASTIC PEOPLE!

                         CHARLIE
               Yuck -- I hate enthusiasm. I'm
               sorry it wasn't cool.

     Charlie thinks for a moment.

                          CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               I can't really imagine never
               drinking. I guess I don't have to,
               though --
                   (beat)
               -- you're the one with the problem.

     Kate nods in agreement.                                           *

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               Hey -- I love you. I don't want you
               to have to drink.

                          KATE
               I don't have to drink.
                   (beat)
               I just really like to drink.                            *

               Good -- `cause you're my favorite
               person to drink with in the whole
               damn world.

     Charlie leans in to kiss Kate. They make out for a moment,
     and then Kate...
                                                             34.


     ...BITES Charlie's lip. Charlie pulls back, shocked. Kate
     grins mischievously.

                         CHARLIE (CONT'D)
               Oh, no you didn't!

     Charlie lunges at Kate, who dodges him and LAUGHS. Charlie
     dives and playfully tackles Kate. They begin to wrestle in
     the grass -- it's cute and loving but perhaps a little too
     intense.


23   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                23

     Kate and Charlie are making out on the bed. Kate starts to
     unbutton Charlie's shirt. As it turns out, Charlie's
     extremely drunk (and it's apparent in his movements and
     voice).

                         CHARLIE
               Are you trying to have some sex?

     Kate removes Charlie's pants and takes off her clothing. She
     climbs on top of him and --

     -- they start having sloppy, drunk sex.

     After a few beats, Kate notices that Charlie isn't moving.
     She looks down to discover that --

     -- he's passed out.

     Kate pauses for a moment...then continues to ride her
     unconscious husband.


24   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                24

     Kate drinks what's left in the TEQUILA BOTTLE as she
     drunkenly searches the fridge, counter, and cupboard for more
     booze. She finds a few sips here and there at the bottom of a
     couple BEER BOTTLES -- but she seems frustrated that there
     isn't more alcohol in the house.

     A FEW MOMENTS LATER

     Kate puts on her slippers, robe and --


25   EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                          25

     Kate drunkenly rides a BICYCLE down the street (still in her
     robe and slippers).
                                                                35.


26   INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT                               26

     Kate tries to open the LOCKED glass fridge where the BEER is
     kept. After several attempts, she gives up and grabs TWO
     BOTTLES OF WINE from a shelf.

     Kate sets the bottles on the counter.                             *

     The CLERK -- a tired looking man in his 30's -- looks at Kate
     with pity.

                         CLERK
               You know I can't sell you this,
               Kate.

     An ELDERLY MAN -- shopping for frozen food -- glances over at
     Kate.                                                             *

               on -- I'm in here all the time. You
               know me.

                         CLERK
               Yes, I do, Kate. And I know you're
               old enough -- but it's too late.

     The clerk holds up his WATCH (which reads 2:45).

                         KATE
               C'mon -- we can just pretend it's
               before two...

     Kate reaches down and tries to rewind the clerk's watch.

               a sip if you want.

                    KATE
          Why don't you give it to me, then?
          That wouldn't hurt anything. A gift
          -- because we're friends.

                    CLERK
          I could lose my job.

Kate doesn't have anything to say back -- so she glances at
the Elderly Man in the frozen food section.                   *

The elderly man puts up his hands, not wanting any part of
it.

                    CLERK

     Kate runs down the aisle and tries to open the bathroom door -
     - but it's locked. She hides from view, and then squats down
     and begins to pull up her robe.

     The clerk clearly isn't going to budge. Kate nods, resigned,

     ...grabs a BOTTLE OF WINE and dashes out the door.

     Kate is passed out on the concrete bank of the Los Angeles
     River. The empty bottle of (screw top) wine is next to her.

     Kate's bicycle lays in some weeds nearby.

     A bird SQUAWKS.

     Kate slowly wakes up, confused, and in a zombie-like state
     she gets up and trudges home, wheeling along her bike.


28   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING              28

     Kate is awakened by the deafeningly loud ALARM CLOCK and the
     sound of a news radio ANNOUNCER. She looks at the clock and
     realizes that --

     -- it's 7:30.

     She jumps out of bed in a panic.

                          KATE

Half-asleep, Charlie rolls over onto the pee-soaked part of
the bed.

          Come back to bed, baby.

                    KATE

Kate then glances down and notices --

She pauses, slightly alarmed, but continues getting ready.

     CHAIRS IN A CIRCLE.

     Kate looks around the room, scoping out the people, who're
     very different from the crowd at the previous night's meeting
     --

     COOKIES.

                         MR. DAVIES
               This is a little more my speed. No
               one here is the slightest bit hip.

               Does everybody just...kinda, you
               know -- talk here?

                         MR. DAVIES
               Pretty much. Someone leads -- tells
               their story. And then everyone else
               shares -- talks.

                         KATE
               So since you're taking me here does

Kate looks around the room at everyone taking their seats.

                (takes a deep breath; to
                 Mr. Davies)
            I can't believe I'm really here.

                      MR. DAVIES
            It gets better. Weirder, maybe --
            but better.

Kate leans in towards Mr. Davies and whispers --

          I think the break is just about
          over. This meeting is the kind

               My first three months were such
               hell. I think I'm only sober today

          only like a minute of the movie and

      Kate and Charlie are parked in front of a --

      -- HOUSE. Small. A little run-down. Sort of a vague ski cabin
      look. There's some dirty lawn furniture in the front yard as
      well as a DOZEN LAWN-GNOMES.

                          CHARLIE
                Ah...the lawn-gnomes. I missed
                those guys.

      Kate playfully punches Charlie in the shoulder.

49    EXT. KATE'S MOTHER'S HOME - DAY                              49

      Kate and Charlie walk to the front door.

                No. Definitely not that.

      They get to the door. Charlie looks at Kate -- who seems like
      she'd be okay if they ran back to the car.

The door opens, revealing --

-- ROCHELLE: late-50's, wears an old shredded heavy metal
band T-shirt and tight ripped-up jeans, looks like she enjoys
an afternoon drink or three.

                    ROCHELLE
              (surprised)
          Katie!

Rochelle wraps her arms around Kate.

          What're you doing here?

                    KATE
          I left you a message, mom.

          Oh, you know I don't check that
          thing.

               flirty)

              (beat)
          ...what a lovely surprise -- you
          two came to visit. Hell has frozen
          over.

     Rochelle LAUGHS as she leads the way. Kate glances at Charlie
     -- she already seems slightly annoyed.


50   INT. KATE'S MOTHER'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY             50

     Kate and Charlie sit down.

     The place is a MESS. Magazines and junkmail everywhere. Too
     much furniture thrown together in a chaotic manner. The walls
     are covered with framed HEAVY METAL BAND POSTERS -- and there
     are ASHTRAYS everywhere, filled to the brim with cigarette
     butts.

                         ROCHELLE (O.S.)
               ...you wouldn't believe how much
               the neighborhood's changed! After
               Mr. Baker passed away and the kids
               put Mrs. Baker in a home, the
               people that moved in, oof!

     Rochelle walks in holding a tray with THREE GIN AND TONICS.

                         ROCHELLE (CONT'D)
               It's like they don't even
               understand the concept of birth
               control in their country!

     Rochelle hands Charlie a glass and then goes to Kate and puts
     a drink on the table in front of her.

                          ROCHELLE (CONT'D)
                   (confides)
               If you ask me, I think it's a meth

               They've always got those little
               five year old twins "playing" in
               the yard, but I'm pretty sure
               they're the lookouts.

                         KATE
               That's pretty wild, mom.

                         ROCHELLE
               Right?
                   (notices that Kate hasn't
                    touched her drink)
               What's wrong, honey? Think I forgot
               how to mix `em?

                         KATE
               I told you I just wanted water.
                                                           62.

          I stopped drinking.

joking.

              (quickly serious)
          Are you telling me I'm going to be
          a grandma?

Rochelle tears up with joy.

                    ROCHELLE (CONT'D)
          Oh -- that's so exciting! I'm gonna
          be a grandma!
              (to Charlie)
          And you know that "no drinking when
          you're pregnant" thing is just a
          myth. I drank plenty when I was
          pregnant with Kate -- and look how
          she turned out!

Beat.

               Oh...I'm sorry -- I'm not being a
               good hostess, am I?

     Rochelle gets up, takes the drink away from Kate, and chugs
     it.

51   EXT. LAKE ARROWHEAD - SANTA'S VILLAGE - DAY                 51

     Kate and Charlie wander around Santa's Village --

     -- an abandoned Christmas-themed amusement park (with giant
     ginger bread houses, plastic Christmas trees, etc.) in the
     middle of the woods. Creepy and nostalgic at the same time.
     Looks like the set of a Christmas horror film.

     Kate holds Charlie's hand as she leads him around.

                         KATE
               This place shut down a decade ago
               and then there was a fire and now
               it's basically abandoned.

     Charlie seems totally impressed by the weirdness of the
     place.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          And then I worked here in high
          school -- selling hot chocolate.
          And they had real reindeer, too.
          They kept `em over there.

Kate points at the remains of a PEN.

                    KATE (CONT'D)
          My mom worked here when she was
          younger. I think everyone who grew                  *
          up around here worked at Santa's
          Village at some point.

Charlie just nods and listens -- he's in awe of this place.

          This is what I think of when I

          She just can't handle her liquor.

Kate and Charlie look in each other's eyes. Seem to have a
moment. And then Charlie asks --

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Did you ever hook up with guys when

          Huh?

               you I'd totally want to hook up
               with you here. Like...in the ginger

               You were probably the coolest girl

               I'll call Mr. Davies. He has dreams
               about me.

     The bartender takes a long look at Kate -- as though he's
     trying to size up if she's insane.

                         BARTENDER
               Hope that works out for you.

          sleep. You're really wasted.

                    KATE
          I don't wanna sleep. I wanna fuck.

Kate pulls Charlie -- who struggles -- down to the
couch...and straddles him.

          Please, will you stop?

Charlie calmly tries to move Kate off of him.

                    CHARLIE
          Really. This is weird.

                    KATE

off.

          What? What? What do I need? I can't
          drink because I'm crazy or
          something and I can't stay sober
          because of you!

                    CHARLIE
          You're blaming other people for
          your problems.

Kate picks the tequila bottle back up, takes a sip, then --

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Stop it! You're acting like a
          freak!

Kate rips Charlie's SHIRT --

as if she's about to hit him with it.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          No! What's wrong with you?

Kate holds the bottle in the air and looks hard at Charlie.
She begins to weep.

                    KATE
          I can't be sober and be with you.

Kate gets a flash of anger again and just as it seems like
she's about to hit Charlie with the bottle, she --

-- upturns the bottle and begins to chug the tequila.

Charlie tries to yank the bottle away, but Kate holds on
tight. With the bottle at Kate's lips -- and tequila pouring
down her chin -- the couple wrestles for control of the
bottle.

                          KATE
             Stop it.

                       CHARLIE
             Okay. Fine.

Beat.

                       KATE
             You could've been killed.

                       CHARLIE
                 (confused)
             What?

                       KATE
             Riding your bike -- drunk.
                                                   107.


                    CHARLIE
          But I wasn't.

                    KATE
          But is that really the point?

                    CHARLIE
          What are trying to say?

                     KATE
              (beat)
          I worry about you.

                     CHARLIE
              (laughs)
          Yeah, I can understand that. I used
          to worry about you. But now I know
          you're okay.
              (beat)
          That makes me happy...I mean, it
          fucking sucks that you're better
          off without me but I'm glad you're
          doing well.

No reply from Kate.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Would you move back in if I came to
          meetings?

                    KATE
          You should go for yourself, not to
          make me happy.

                    CHARLIE
          But, would you?

                    KATE
          I'm not moving back in.

That wasn't the response Charlie wanted to hear.

                     KATE (CONT'D)
          Listen, I should go. It's gonna get
          dark soon.

                    CHARLIE
          We can always turn the lights on.

                    KATE
          I don't know...

Beat.
                                                         108.


                    CHARLIE
          So, would you at least...let me
          take you out on a date?

Kate says nothing.

                       CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Maybe...?

Kate shakes her head.

Charlie seems hurt -- but still determined.

                    CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          Okay...fine. 0 for 2.
              (new direction)
          Last question: can we just...play
          one more game?

Kate doesn't answer.

                     CHARLIE (CONT'D)
          C'mon...you keep kicking my ass.
          It's embarrassing. You've gotta
          give me a chance to redeem myself.
              (soft)
          Please.

Kate thinks about it for a long beat, and doesn't say yes...

...but she also doesn't say no.

There's a look of hope in Charlie's eyes.

                                               CUT TO BLACK.

                       THE END
