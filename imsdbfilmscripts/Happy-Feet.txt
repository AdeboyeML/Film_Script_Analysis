THE DARKNESS

Wind comes shreiking across the ice shelf to where THOUSANDS

Before him, a wasteland of discoloured ice covered with
broken eggs and bits of feather. There are very few penguins
here and the ones he can see are all, frankly, weird.

A Penguin walks in an endless figure of eight muttering to
himself. Another has his flippers wrapped tightly around
himself like a straightjacket. A troubled Penguin sings
angrily..."There's no business like show business.

The murderous creature comes at him, jaws open, baring rows
of sharp TEETH and MUMBLE swims for his life.

The LEOPARD SEAL is relentless, barging through smaller
floes, powering around larger ones.

Mumble just CAN'T SHAKE HIM OFF. Desperate, he shoots up into

his weight.

angled ceiling forcing him down, deeper into the BLACKNESS.

The Leopard Seal opens its mouth. Its GAPING JAWS are about

a little SPECK OF LIGHT appears in the ceiling of ice. Mumble
makes a speedy sharp turn, climbing steeply.

He is in a FUNNEL OF ICE...getting narrower and narrower as it
rises to the surface. The Leopard Seal is CLOSING fast.
MUMBLE shoots THROUGH the hole in the ice and into the air...

UNDERWATER

Mumble keeps sinking, down down down into a great cathedral-
like space, lit by eerie shards of underwater light.

                        MUMBLE
             ....stuff down there beyond my wildest
             imagining.

Imbedded in the base of the glacier, the rusting remains of,
An OLD YELLOW EXCAVATOR projecting out of the glacier.

It hangs there, inscrutable, like a great yellow totem.

Mumble, dwarfed by it, contemplates it for a while, then
ventures inside, into the body of the BEAST.

INSIDE THE BULLDOZER

A rusting steering column, a perforated dashboard.

He pecks at the metal, trying to taste it, listening to the
sound it makes.

OUTSIDE THE BULLDOZER

In the shimmering space outside the bulldozer, the ADELIES
congregate.

                        THE ADELIES
             ... You sure he went in there?
             ...Mumble!
             ...Done go near it, looks like it can
             bite

One of them smims closer to the great jaws

                         ADELIES
             Ramos!

Mumble pops his head out from between the jaws

                       MUMBLE
             Oh! There you are

Terrified the Adelies scatter and shoot to the surface like
missiles.

                         MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             Guys!    I want to speak to you.

THE ICE SHELF

The Adelies are heading back to their colony as fast as their
little legs will carry then. Mumble Hippity hops after them

                    ADELIES
          ...Forget it

          ...Maybe its got a brother still alive.


                    MUMBLE
          But that's what we have to find out.
          Don't you see. Things like that could be
          eating the fish.

The idea is so stunningly original it stops them in their
tracks.

                    ADELIES
          Okay. Okay. Here's the plan: we go and
          ask the revered one.

                     MUMBLE
          The who?

LOVEDAY'S MOUND

MUMBLE and the ADELIE AMIGOS are bunched together, near the
head of a LONG QUEUE of Adelies each with a stone or in their
beak.

At the head of this queue stands LOVEDAY - guardian of a huge
pile of pebbles. His head pokes through one of the rings a
PLASTIC SIX-PACK CAN HOLDER festooned with seaweed like a
HOLY MANTLE.

WHITE-OUT. The Penguins have to shout to make themselves

huddle nearby.

Suddenly the ICE SHELF CRACKS OPEN and the KILLER WHALE soars
right over the top of them

on out to sea. The Penguins have no time to reflect on their
good fortune.

see a vast BLACK SHAPE, a hundred feet high, coming at them

THE OPEN SEA

MUMBLE PLOUGHS THROUGH a rolling sea: towering waves block
everything from view but on the crests he catches sight of...

THREE BLACK SHIPS, far ahead, but stationary, as if waiting
for him.

LATER

He's getting closer. The ships are only half a mile away when
Something rises from the deep, threatening to engulf him: a
HUGE NET, TEEMING WITH FISH.

Mumble shoots out of the way, just avoiding being caught as.

UP AHEAD The great NET FULL OF FISH breaks the surface of the
water and is winched on board.

As if in response the ship's ENGINES START UP again and the
sea around him erupts in churning foam.

Swamped by the wake, Mumble goes under. When he resurfaces,
THE SHIP is already on its way.

He takes a deep breath and resumes his pursuit.

OPEN OCEAN

The SEAS are MOUNTAINOUS. There is no sign of the ship now,
nor of land.

MUMBLE swims up the side of each wave, over its foaming crest
and down into the deep dark valley below.

LATER

The air is full of spray. Choking, MUMBLE ducks under the
water.

UNDERWATER

Its peaceful here. Then something moves beside him and turns
with a start to see: A MASSIVE EYE!!

A BLUE WHALE entirely fills his field of vision. It sings a
few booming Wagnerian notes. Its voice is almost deafening.

                         MUMBLE
             Too loud.

A VOICE calls to him from above. Mumble looks up. An
ALBATROSS hovers overhead.

             He's looking for a mate, mate. And these
             days, I tell you they're few and far

From the ALBATROSS' aerial view, Mumble looks tiny next to
the MASSIVE BULK of the Blue Whale.

The Blue Whale responds with a long mournful "NO-O-O-O" which
the Albatross does not need to translate.

          No way mate, he won't go anywhere near
          `em. And neither should you.

Mumble hesitates, bobbing on the water, weighing the
warnings.

He makes up his mind and strikes out again swimming towards
the convergence.

The Albatross, hovering on the wing, watches.

                    ALBATROSS (CONT'D)
          Don't say I didn't warn you

The ALBATROSS wheels away.

As MUMBLE fights on through the huge choppy waves, the
Whale's Wagnerian song booms out, EERIE and FORLORN.

THE CONVERGENCE

We see from above, the BLUE WHALE turning as well, changing
course to avoid a change in the texture and colour of the
water stretching in a line, as far as the eye can see. MUMBLE
swims RIGHT ACROSS THE LINE.

A VAST OCEAN

MUMBLE is a mere DOT now as the GREAT CURRENTS capture him
and sweep him away.

We pull back through the clouds until the very CURVATURE OF
THE EARTH is visible: a blue horizon with no land in sight.

SMALL POLLUTED BEACH

On the HIGH-WATER MARK, amongst the rubbish and the oil
slick, we see what looks like a dead animal. It is MUMBLE.

A creature in RED GUMBOOTS approaches. Its small hand reaches
down and nudges him with a stick. MUMBLE moans and the
gumboots RUN AWAY, shouting something unintelligible.

With great difficulty, Mumble raises his head to try to see
more. Sunlight flares, bleaching to white, as he LOSES
CONSCIOUSNESS.
                                                            72.


A WHITE ROOM

Scientific books and specimens of birds in large bottles on
shelves line the walls.

MUMBLE, eyes closed, is lying on a stainless steel table. He
opens his eyes to the brilliant glare of an examination lamp.

There is movement around him. Voices whispering in an alien
tongue. A FIGURE IN WHITE bends over him cleaning the oil
from his feathers with detergent. MUMBLE squawks.

contents in the air.

LATER

Mumble approaches the two sentries. The colony is much
diminished: only small groups scattered here and there.

                     MUMBLE
           Hi, where is everybody!?

Other penguins are gathering to scrutinise the stranger.

             ... So Who's this?
             ...Kinda small for an emperor.

Then a female penguin bursts out of the crowd.

They listen. Above the wind   faint electronic BEEPING SOUND.

She turns him around to reveal some kind of circuit board
glued to his back: a small aerial, winking red lights. A
TRANSMITTER.

A gasp of fear and astonishment from the penguins. Caruso is
momentarily speechless.

He starts tap dancing. The penguins are torn, between
Caruso's instructions and Mumbles.

          Its what they understand. They can't

          their feet. Do it.

A few adventurous souls begin to copy him, out of fear if
nothing else.

As they do so, the sky begins to darken. A strange whirling
wind starts whipping the snow around them. The very earth
seems to be shaking under them.
