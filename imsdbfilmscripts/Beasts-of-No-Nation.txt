          booms than thunder. Panting breath. Pattering feet.

          Agu runs with his Father, Big Brother, and Grandfather down
          the middle of town.
                         
          Just behind them a contingent of 20 PLF REBELS descend on
          foot. Bullets zip by.
                         
          Agu and his family find a SMALL GROUP of civilians waiting on
          the ground, pinned down by gunfire. Some of the MEN from the
          Church with clubs and machetes.
                         
          Father nods to them, points in one direction. They shake
          their heads. He points in the other direction. They shake
          their heads no again.
                         
          They ALL slip between the stairs of the same building,
          assessing their situation. Rebels spread out on the hill
          overlooking the town.
                         
          There is no where to go. Father looks at his children,
          knowing it was a mistake not to get them out of town.
          Beckoned by a village man, the family runs across the road,
          Grandfather on Big Brother's back, into a building where
          other villagers are hiding.

          Water leaks from the ceiling onto the group of TEN MEN and

          squeezed looking and sometimes avoiding each other's gaze --
          exposing their fear and expectation.

          Outside, the SOUNDS of battle come from all directions. It is
          an invisible looming threat heralded by a cacophony of high
          pitched projectiles, ground shaking explosions, and CRIES of
          the wounded.
                         
          BANG. Father looks out a small slit. He sees an NRC SOLDIER
          FALL from a sniper hit. The soldiers move for cover,
          seemingly held at bay by the nearby shooter.
                         
          He looks back at all the faces in the room with him. Fearful.

          and sauce from the back of a hut to Hope and his NDF Small

          lets it drop.
                         
          Agu dives for it. He runs to where the cook was dispersing
          food but there is none left. The DOG, the Cook's pet, licks
          the rest.
                         
          Despondent, he uses his hands to gather what little is left

                    It is Iroko. These other trees I am
                    not knowing, but I am calling them
                    children of the forest because they

                    It is even having a root like a
                    cassava, but if you eat it, it will
                    kill you with its poison.

                    small boy soldiers, too, who can
                    kill before they can even speak.

          Agu notices the sudden stillness of everything, the only
          movement a swarm of mosquitoes descending upon them, he tries
          to beat them away. Then he feels breathing on his neck and

          Strika motions, signaling him to focus down the road. The air
          wafts in translucent tendrils over the pavement. Then he sees
          it, rounding a bend, the dust cloud of a CONVOY of TRUCKS and
          LIGHT ARMORED VEHICLES rolling in their direction.

          Three trucks becomes FOUR TRUCKS, then FIVE. Large Caliber

          GOVERNMENT TROOPS who look out into the green margins of the
          road with distrust.

          A SQUAD of SBU-NDF SOLDIERS scurry across the road like a

          BOOM. The first truck's engine compartment shatters in a hail
          storm of shrapnel, fire and smoke into the cabin.
                         
          Hope signals aggressively. The SBU rushes onto the road
          dragging SPIKE STRIPS, RPGs and GPMGs. They ensure no
          retreat.

          KPWAP! Agu flinches and ducks. Someone in the bush sprays the
          truck, bullets ricochet off of the metal door of the middle
          truck, a windshield is shattered. Then all the NDF soldiers
          open fire. It is a quick and effective slaughter.
                         
          Agu holds his ears. It all happened so quickly he didn't see
          the full carnage, but when he gets up, the trucks are chewed
          up and the men inside are dead.

          kick away the weapons and yank off their clothes.
                         
          Commandant, his ENTOURAGE, and CONTROLLER, emerge from the

          Upon seeing him, NDF SQUADS move up the road to secure the
          front and down the road to secure their tail.
                         
          The SBU moves to join the CENTER. Agu walks past a few trucks
          and stripped soldiers with necks strained towards death.

          Agu looks disdainfully at the man quivering on the ground
          beneath Commandant, blabbering incomprehensibly, shaking his
          head at Agu. Agu's nerves fire off.
                         
          Out of the corner of his eye, ONE GOVERNMENT SOLDIER runs for
          the bush. He is nearly naked, his body glistens with his
          comrades' blood.
                         
          No one seems to mind. Then, MUZZLE FLASHES out of the bushes
          at the end of the road. KWAP, KWAP-KWAP. Flesh explodes from
          the man's thigh and scatters to the ground. He falls without

          blood suspend in the air and sparkle.
                         
          Anger, memories of his father and his brother, gunned down in
          the street fueling anger he didn't know he could muster

          understanding, mutual blame, between them.
                         
          Agu wipes the blood from his face, the NDF Soldiers
          celebrate, firing into the air, SING and dance around the

          A BULLET zips past and ricochets off the wall next to Agu.

          Agu looks around. He notices the smashed bullet at his feet.
          Just as he bends over to pick it up, where his head would
          have been, a bullet smashes into the wall. No one seems
          interested.

          Two-I-C and his forward operation team are hunkered down
          behind a building facing a PLF stronghold -- TWO MACHINE GUN

          hearts.
                         
          When it's Strika's turn to look, Commandant interrupts his
          try by asking him if he has heart for battle. Conflicted
          between wanting to try out the scope and the call for battle,
          he affirms he is ready to fight while the "toy" is put away
          by the Aide.

          The bullets whistle by angrily. Then, a tidal wave of wind
          and fire is laid down on them, tearing up a building's wall
          and wooden kiosks around them. The men do not flinch, they
          believe they cannot be hit, although some MEN do go down, the
          majority continues the advance.
                         
          Agu is astonished, but because everyone else keeps moving, so
          does he. To his left, Commandant smiles at him, loving the

          attention is on the PLF, who seem to be moving in from all
          directions now.

          yelling at the tops of their lungs as they go forward towards

          Commandant stands over the bodies of SEVEN DEAD NDF SOLDIERS,
          amongst them, RAMBO. Commandant looks like he feels great
          remorse. Preacher, bandaged but alive, says a prayer.
                         
          ONE LIVE REBEL in underwear, arms tied behind his back, is
          being prodded by Chicken Legs and begging for his life.
          Chicken Legs shoots him in the hip. He falls, twitching.
          Chicken Legs enjoys his catch and takes his time finishing
          him off.
                         
          Agu notices that some of the RPG's are made of WOOD, as if
          they were theatrical props, he kicks one. Solid and dense.
                         
          BOOM. Chicken Legs shoots the PLF prisoner again. He turns
          over, his life slowly draining from him.
                         
          Agu sees ANOTHER BODY laying face down and quickly starts
          searching his pockets. He takes the bandoliers, smells the
          water bottle, looks in his pack, brown-brown in a foil
          envelope, batteries, and a small ball of cloth tied up with
          string.

          bites it.
                         
          BOOM. Preacher finishes off the naked prisoner. His brains
          splattered on the pavement. No one seems to take note, by now
          a common practice.

          Strika shakes his head and motions to follow him. Agu sighs
          as he obliges.
                         
          They salute and pass Commandant's body guard and enter an
          abandoned post office. Strika leaves Agu behind at the
          doorway of Commandant's room, motioning for him to go in.

          Agu listens as Commandant speaks via radio to SUPREME
          COMMANDER Dada Goodblood on the other end. It's a close
          conversation. Strategy. Something mentioned about an
          intersection of highways. Cut offs to the Capital. And
          Commandant being promoted, soon, to General.
                         
          His silhouette paces around in the lantern light. Maps are
          laid out on the floor. He kneels down, studying them.
                         
          Agu coughs, to call attention to himself.

          He points to his cot across the room. Agu enters, careful not
          to step on any of the maps spread out on the ground.
                         
          Agu places the WAD WITH THE GOLD NUGGETS on Commandant's
          table, then obediently waits next to the cot, watching
          Commandant studying the map.
                         
          Commandant stops, notices the wad, curious, opens it, drops
          its contents in his hands. He looks up at Agu, impressed.

          Commandant lays out a line of brown-brown. He snorts it and
          beckons Agu to do the same. Agu, having seen others do this,
          knows how, but has never experienced it. He sniffs eagerly.
          The Brown-brown going straight to his head.

                      That is good, Agu, because there is
                      no learning to be leading. Some men
                      is born to leading, other is born

                      No, Agu. You are different. You are
                      reminding me of me when I was a
                      little boy, and this means you are
                      borning to be leader. But even the
                      best leader Agu, must first be
                      learning to be good follower.

                      following the Supreme Commander, if

          Commandant points at the map. Lines of two highways intersect
          near the bottom center. He points at it.

          Agu nods. It is hard for him to think of her without feeling
          emotions, and he doesn't want to show Commandant these
          childish emotions.

          is fit for battle or not. He takes a knife and cuts a slice
          along Agu's temple. Agu winces in even more pain as Hope

          conditioned van.
                         
          The WOMAN locks eyes with him, but instead of sympathy Agu
          sees fear in her face. This immediately angers him even if he
          doesn't know why he is feeling angry.
                         
          At the same time, a photographer in the back seat snaps

          SINGLE ARMED GUARD in fatigues sleeps in the room. Deputy
          clears his throat.
                         
                                             DEPUTY (CONT'D)
                    You will wait here.
                         
          Commandant looks around the room, unimpressed.
                         
                                             COMMANDANT
                    You will bring something to drink
                    for us. Water.

                    Certainly.
                                                                  82.
                         
                         
          They sit. Collapsing with their field clothes into squeaky
          and odd civilian spaces. Their weapons dangle on their sides.
          Two of the BODY GUARDS light a joint. Agu tugs on their
          shirts.
                         
          He notices the distant look on Commandant's face.
                         
                              AGU (V.O.)
                    I am looking at him, and I am
                    seeing he is not happy to be
                    waiting.
                         
          Agu gets a hit of the joint. He too collapses against the
          floor, watching the clock, an analog mid-century clock with
          hands that slowly rotate around its face.
                         
                              AGU (V.O.)
                    And I am seeing these people
                    entering with more than they are
                    having when they are leaving and I
                    am wondering why they are leaving
                    their things behind and if I should
                    be telling them.
                         
          We see CHINESE BUSINESS MEN enter the office, and then leave,
          and then Commandant readying himself as if it were their
          turn, but then the Deputy apologizes, and leads in a group of
          LEBANESE BUSINESS MEN who enter with brief cases and then
          exit without.
                         
                              AGU (V.O.)
                    And with every person that is
                    coming, and every person that is
                    going, I am seeing anger on
                    Commandant's face grow.
                         
          And as the clock moves faster, Commandant slams the arms of
          his chair, BAM, waking the room, and the sleeping ARMED
          GUARD.
                         
          Just then the Deputy enters.

                    me.
                         
          The men stand, stretching the stiff muscles. And go through
          the doors into another, slightly more pleasant, waiting room.

                       room. Where is our water?
                         
          Agu raises his rifle at the Armed Guard.
                         
                                                AGU

          Commandant's Bodyguard's smile, as does Strika, the Armed
          Guard runs down the hall to oblige.

          They sip water from plastic bags. An air conditioner hums.
          Commandant sits deep in thought.

          The Deputy can see this will not satisfy Commandant, who
          looks like he could squeeze the life out of this functionary.

          They walk down a pleasant hallway, as if they were on a
          museum tour, Strika and Agu are dazzled by the cleanliness of
          it all.
                                                                  84.

          They spill out into a foyer flanked by a dining room and an
          office with chairs arranged for long, circuitous
          conversations.
                         
          Commandant takes a seat, the rest of the entourage hold back
          uncomfortably, along the edge of the room.
                         
          The Deputy enters a door on the opposite side of the room
          where UHF radio chatter links Goodblood to his commanders and
          fighters across the country. There, an elder statesman like
          intellectual appears in the doorway, DADA GOODBLOOD, followed
          by the deputy.
                         
          EVERYONE stands and salutes. Agu strains to finally see the
          man they have all spoken about. He wears a fine combination
          of clothes, and looks smart, even in his morning slippers,
          newspaper in hand, Deputy holds his coffee. He sits on the
          smaller chair, near to Commandant.

          Commandant doesn't hide his frustration.

          He looks at the entourage watching them, in particular the
          boys.
                         
                                             GOODBLOOD (CONT'D)

                    talk. Unless you are hungry, too?
                         
          Goodblood looks at Deputy, who quickly realizes he must usher
          the men to the adjoining room that offers Commandant and
          Goodblood more privacy.

          The Deputy nods dutifully.
                         
          In the dining room a table of European style food is quickly
          sacked by the men. Strika and Agu stuff croissants into their
          pockets and sit on the floor, rolling slices of meat and
          stuffing them in their mouths.
                         
          Agu keeps one eye on the meeting, where the Commandant and
          Goodblood share weighted stares. Goodblood reading
          Commandant's emotional weariness, Commandant reading
          Goodblood's ill intentions. Two-I-C is paralyzed between
          them.

                    brute force, but now it is survival
                    of the wittiest and the decisions

          He moves, it moves. He walks, it follows. Around him, the men
          have created smaller mini-indentations to protect themselves
          from the rain of shrapnel.
