          FADE IN:

          INT. BACHELOR APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

          A modest city bedroom. Suitcases and half-unpacked boxes
          sit on one side of the room. Sc_-orLe's -moving in.
          In his bathrobe, PHIL FOSTER, a good looking guy in his
          mid-20's, hums to himself as he looks through stacks of
          WEDDING PICTURES organized all over the bed. Just as he
          finishes up a pile and starts another, beautiful CLARA
          FOSTER, in a bathrobe too, jumps across his lap.

                         PHIL
          Hey, hey! Careful Clara! You were the
          one who told me not to mess up the
          precious picture piles!
          he gives him a long, slow kiss.

          PHIL (CONT ' D )
          Minty fresh.

                         CLARA
          That was nice.

                         PHIL
          It was nice.

                         CLARA
          Hey from now on when you change the
          toilet paper, could you just make sure it
          is out?

                         PHIL

                         (CHUCKLES)
          Wow! She moves in and the honeymoon's
          over!

                         CLARA
          Oh, believe me, we're just getting
          started, Phil.

                         PHIL
          (reaches into picture pile)
          Look at this one of your Mom with me. I
          mean that woman can't contain her 'Love!

          ON the wedding picture: RUTH, Clara's,mother, stands
          stiffly next to Phil with an expression like she's ankle
          deep in a manure bin.

                         CLARA

                         (LAUGHS)
          She just takes a while to warm up. You
          guys are gonna be best buddies. You
          picked a favorite of us yet?  

                         

          2.
          Phil finds the picture, handing it to Clara.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          That's exactly the one I picked!

          Clara leans the photo on the night stand next to the bed.
          It's a PORTRAIT OF THEM FROM THEIR WEDDING. They look
          joyous, excited. A young couple with the world in front
          of them.

                         PHIL
          Man, I wish I was them.
          Phil kisses the back of Clara's neck, but her smile fades
          as she stares at the picture. He notices.

                         PHIL (CONT'D)

                         WHAT IS

                         CLARA
          I just... when I was growing up my Mom
          and Dad had a picture just like this.
          Now they can't even acknowledge each
          other.
          Phil sympathetically gives her a squeeze.

                         CLARA (CONT'D)
          Let's always remember to have some time
          that's just for the two of us. No matter
          what else comes up in our lives - if it's
          work or friends or when we have kids-

                         PHIL
          We're having kids? With an "S"?

                         (CLARA LAUGHS)
          OK fine. But I promise you it's never
          gonna happen to us.

                         CLARA
          Yeah, we'll see if you'll be saying that
          when I'm long in the tooth.

                         PHIL
          You'll be even hotter long toothed.
          Right now to be honest Clara they're a
          little stumpy.

                         CZ

                         (GIGGLES
          Oh really?
          As Phil climbs on top and kisses her, he reaches over and
          turns off the light. Suddenly, we hear the piles of
          pictures SLIDE OFF THE BED and hit the ground. Beat.

          wasn't the pictures.

                         CLARA
          You know how long that took?

                         PHIL
          We'll fix the picture piles, Clara.
          We've got all the time in the world.
          From now on everything's gonna be just
          about us.
          Suddenly, a YOUNG VOICE breaks through the darkness.

          INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM 7 YEARS LATER - MORNING

          Next to the framed wedding picture of Phil and Clara, an
          ALARM CLOCK on a side table reads 6:45 am.

          OLLIE (O.S.)
          Mo-om!
          It's SEVEN YEARS LATER as Phil and Clara stir .-id groan
          in bed. Clara has the comforter WRAPPED ALL HER
          while Phil lies uncovered next to her in his boxers and a
          T-shirt. Without saying a word, they rise out of each
          side of their beds and sleepily march in opposite
          directions across their suburban bedroom- Clara down the
          hall and Phil to the bathroom.

          OLLIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Mom! Mom! Mom!

                         CLARA
          I'm coming, Ollie!

          INT. OLLIE'S ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

          As the Talking Heads song continues, Clara makes Ollie's
          bed while OLLIE, 5, plays with LEGOs on the floor. Phil
          showered and dressed in a suit, walks quickly past the
          doorway carrying a briefcase, his eyes glued to a stack
          of PAPERS in his hand.

                         CLARA
          Uh Phil?

          Yep?

                         CLARA
          I need to switch. I've got an open
          house.
          Phil obviously doesn't want to be bothered right now, but
          contains it.

                         PHIL
          Really?

                         CLARA
          Yeah. Really.
          As Clara walks quickly past him, Phil claps his hands
          together.

                         PHIL
          OK, so I say today we go for the slacker
          look - cool yet approachable.

                         OLLIE
          Yeah, well Mom says that.
          Ollie points to a PREPPIE OUTFIT laid out on a chair.

                         PHIL
          Oh. Well... that's cool too!

          INT. PHIL AND CLARA'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - SAME

          The Talking Heads song continues as Clara walks quickly
          through the bedroom. She lets out a YELP as her shin
          SMASHES INTO PHIL'S DRESSER DRAWER - he's left them open.
          She kicks them closed and limps to the bathroom, then
          stops in the doorway. WATER covers the floor. Grabbing
          a towel, she tosses it down and shimmies to the mirror.
          As she picks up her toothbrush, she notices it's WET as
          well.

                         CLARA
          Ech. Mine.
          She re-rolls the toothpaste from the bottom up and starts
          brushing when she sees the sink - a Jackson Pollock of
          razor hairs and bits of toothpaste.
          Disgusted, Clara reaches for the Kleenex box, only to
          discover it's EMPTY. She tosses the box in the trash and
          shimmies on the towel to get some toilet paper.

          holder, turns it around and puts it back so it ROLLS OUT.
          As the CREDITS END, the Talking Heads song fad

          NT. KITCHEN
          Phil, pen in hand, is focused again on his papers as
          Ollie, now in the preppie outfit, watches him and waits
          at the table. Phil finally notices.

                         PHIL

          Oh. Yeah, sorry. Your Dad's a boob
          today. What's it gonna be?
          Ollie peers down the hallway to see if there's any sign
          of his tom.

                         OLLIE
          How about... some Captain Crunch?
          Phil gets an idea and writes zickly.

          Phil grabs the Captain Crunch cereal box out
          cupboard and starts toward the table when Clara, dressed
          in a suit, comes into the room and spots it.

                         CLARA
          Ah ah ah... what's that Ollie? You had a

          Clara, eyebrows raised, eyes the Captain Crunch already
          in Phil's hand. Phil shakes the carton at Ollie.

          As Phil takes out some Special K and pours milk for Ollie
          and a glass for himself, he finishes the carton. Peeking
          back over his shoulder, he sees Clara's dialing with the
          phone to her ear as she readies Ollie's lunch. He
          stealthily pours the TINIEST BIT of milk back, quickly

          Phil kisses her on the cheek and Clara absently wipes it
          off. He looks at her strangely. Noticing, Clara quickly
          kisses Phil on the cheek.

          He heads out. With a sigh, Clara spots Phil's left his 1ï¿½1
          dirty glass on the counter. She cleans it in the sink,
          then gets the carton out of the fridge to put some milk
          in her own coffee. A DRIBBLE comes out. Shaking her
          head, she tosses the carton in the trash.

          EXT. FRONT OF FOSTER' S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          As Phil exits the front door and heads to the carport
          next to the house, his overly cheery neighbor CHAZ picks
          a newspaper off his lawn.

          ike you say to me every morning.
          Reaching the carport, Phil scoots between his car and
          Clara's. He tries to open his driver's door, but Clara'
          car is parked TOO CLOSE and the door only opens a few
          inches. He tries to SQ'L'-Z- IN, but ends up GETTING
          STUCK halfway.

          Shaking his head, Phil crosses to his car's passenger
          side. OPEN HOUSE BANNERS piled in the garage block the

          out of this and call my Mom then.
          As Clara heads into the closet, Phil looks after her,
          feeling terrible. About to leave, he notices that around
          the room, Clara's SET UP CANDLES in anticipation of their
          romantic night. He looks down again at the papers in his
          hand and sucks in, conflicted.

          her, humming to himself. She looks over to see him
          choosing a tie and jacket from his side. Clara looks
          him, still unsure.

          11 minutes late. That's just one minute
          later than the grace on the grace.

          I'm sorry sir, but management
          specifically said no grace on the grace
          on the grace. After ten minutes, we send
          a host around calling your name and if
          there's no answer, we give the table
          away. Sorry.

          Well, let's see...
          Phil looks on as the Supermodel Hostess runs her finger
          down a LONG LIST OF WRITE-IN NAMES. As she turns to the

          INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Even the bathroom has sweeping views of Chicago. As
          Clara leaves a bathroom stall, she notices a NERVOUS
          YOUNG WOMAN washing her face over and over.
          A knock and a SLICK LOOKING MAN quickly peeks his head in
          the Women's room.

          Man. Clara looks after them a second, then washes her
          hands.

          They wouldn't care, Clara. If they call
          your name at the bar and you don't
          answer, they give your table away. So
          how about a nut?
          A YOUNG HOST (not the Hostess) mills around the bar.

          Clara sighs, frustrated.

          I mean, did you try something like
          telling her it was our anniversary, or my
          birthday, or slipping her some money-

                         PHIL
          Oh, I see. Lying and graft were the
          answer!
          Clara shakes her head, then notices the YOUNG HOST
          searching for the party and starts focusing on him
          instead of Phil as she thinks.

          Through the window, we see Holbrooke, Phil, and Clara

          Holbrooke uses a KEYCARD on his keychain with a flourish
          to enter the rear of the building, then leads Phil and
          Clara through the doors. Suddenly he stops and Phil and
          Clara FREEZE behind them.
          At the other end of the hallway, an FBI UNIT in
          bulletproof gear trains their weapons on the three of
          them. AGENT #1 in the center, obviously the agent in

          Now you can say shit.
          Phil looks around - they're in the middle of the bridge
          with no place to run. Then he notices the lit up PARTY
          BOAT coming out the other side of the bridge beneath
          them.

          blows out her hair at the mirror. An ATTRACTIVE THIN
          WOMAN walks behind her toward the showers and they smile
          at each other in the mirror. As the THIN WOMAN
          disappears behind the shower glass, Clara makes a MAD
          DASH for the lockers.

          A DARK SUIT undresses, getting ready to work out. As the
          man is about to lock his locker, Phil rushes up to him,
          excitedly telling him something and pointing outside.
          The man, confused, exits, and Phil MOVES IN, quickly
          undressing.

          - OUTSIDE THE GYM, Phil, looking slick in a colored shirt
          and black suit, walks quickly around the corner, then

          blown out and in a tight fitting RED FLAPPER DRESS with â¢

          to me, OK?!? I know what I'm-
          SMASH! - they HIT something head-on, SHATTERING the
          windshield.
           Shaking glass off himself, Phil peers forward. They're
          face to face - nose to nose - with another broken
          windshield. In the driver's seat of a SOUPED UP HONDA
          h fiber-optic colored lights, a YOUNG BLACK DUDE â¢
          stares at them in shock.

          Phil throws the car into reverse, but his tires just
          screech smoke, the wheels spinning in place.
          Looking out his window toward the front, Phil sees that

          Shit.
          Thinking fast, Phil jumps out of his car and hops into
          the Black Dude's souped up Honda.

          Hey! HEY! What do you think you're
          doing?
          The Black Dude chases after him, trying the driver's
          door, but Phil's LOCKED it. Phil yells to Clara.

          Freaked, Clara hops to the driver's seat and switches to
          reverse, and guns it. At the same moment, Phil steps on
          the gas.
          The Black Dude, hanging onto the driver's door, SCREAMS
          as he's THROWN ONTO THE HOOD. The conjoined cars SHIMMY
          SHAMMY BACKWARD, just in time to dodge the Towncar. The
          Black Dude scrambles for his life through the windshield
          into the passenger's seat next to Phil.

          Mumbling angrily, Clara puts her car in drive and steps
          on it. Their cars lurch then burn asphalt as the wheels
          smoke and speed up in the OTHER DIRECTION. They race
          past Frank again, who angrily whips the Towncar around in
          pursuit.
          Looking over his shoulder, Phil tries to steer their
          conjoined cars down the middle of the street, but he and
          Clara are out of sync and their attached cars veer :ildly

          Phil looks behind - the Towncar's got them closed in.
          The Black Dude peeks back as well, then turns to Phil.

          Sucking in a breath, Phil hands control of the car back
          to the Black Dude. As the conjoined cars zoom toward the
          drawbridge, Phil CRAWLS ON THE ATTACHED HOODS FROM ONE

          reverse UP ONE SIDE OF THE DIAGONAL DRAWBRIDGE...

          OTHER SIDE, causing AIR BAGS to deploy all around Phil
          and Clara.
          The Black Dude spins his steering wheel, jack-knifing his
          Honda across the road, and PUTS ON HIS SEAT BELT. Frank
          and Harry's eyes go wide as Frank jams on his brakes, but
          the Towncar CRASHES right into the Honda.
          ugh his broken window, the Black Dude grins at Frank

          Yeah, yeah. I know all about you, buddy.
          With a smile Phil and Clara get up, disconnecting the
          WIRES under their clothing. Seeing them hand over the
          wires to Holbrooke, it hits Mayor Diggs what he's just
          revealed.

          Aw fuck.

          Makes you feel any better, I wasn't gonna

          EXT. FRONT OF PHIL AND CLARA'S HOUSE - MORNING

          As Holbrooke drops Phil and Clara off in front of their
          house, his BLACKBERRY buzzes and he checks it.

                         Â¢ CLARA
          Everything OK?

                         HOLBROOKE
          Yeah. They just need me downtown in half
          an hour for a news conference with the
          Deputy Mayor. Want it for the morning
          shows.

                         PHIL
          Don't think they're going to be calling
          you the IT guy any-more.

                         HOLBROOKE
          Listen guys, I feel weird about not even
          acknowledging you two.

                         CLARA
          Don't.

                         HOLBROOKE
          But you should be up there with me. You
          handed this whole case to me.

                         PHIL
          (smiles, winks)
          Yeah, well-, that's how we roll.
          They get out of the car and start up the driveway.

          As Clara opens the front door, Phil slowly bends down,
          picking up the morning paper.

          Phil looks over to see his overly cheery neighbor Chaz in

                         PHIL
          Yep. We sure are.
          As he joins Clara on the doorstep, they take each other
          in.

          like that.
          For the first time the whole night, THEY KISS.
          Interlocking fingers, they head inside, closing their
