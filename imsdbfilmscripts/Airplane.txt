          EXT. SKY - JUST ABOVE CLOUDS - NIGHT
          
          OMINOUS, THREATENING MUSIC. The upper tail fin of a jet
          plane emerges through the cloud layer and PASSES THROUGH the
          FRAME like a shark's fin through water. It passes by again
          in the opposite direction. MUSIC BUILDS as the fin comes
          straight TOWARD the CAMERA, MUSIC SWELLS to CRESCENDO as
          entire jet plane lifts out of clouds and passes overhead.
          TITLE SLASHES ACROSS SCREEN, "AIRPLANE!"
          
          CREDITS and MUSIC continue over following.

                   The white zone is for immediate loading
                   and unloading of passengers only. There is
                   no stopping in the red zone.

                   The red zone is for immediate loading and
                   unloading of passengers. There is no
                   stopping in the white zone.
          
                                  P.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.)
                   No. The white zone is for loading and
                   unloading, and there is no stopping in the
                   red zone.

                   The red zone has always been for loading
                   and unloading, and there is never stopping
                   in a white zone.

                   Don't tell me which zone is for stopping
                   and which zone is for loading.

                   Listen, Betty. Don't start up with your
                   white zone shit again!

          Elaine is approached by a religious ZEALOT #1.
          
                                  ZEALOT #1
                   Hello, we'd like you to have this flower
                   from the Religious Consciousness Church.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   No, but thank you very much.

          She checks her watch and walks past Security Check area.
          CAMERA STAYS with a middle-aged couple, SHIRLEY and JACK,
          waiting to pass through Security Check. Behind them is sign
          reading: WARNING, HIJACKING IS A FEDERAL OFFENSE, etc.
          
                                  SHIRLEY
                   Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there
                   in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our
                   flight to Chicago.
          
                                  JACK
                   Yeah, I think he is.
                        (waves)
                   Hey, Fred!
          
          FRED recognizes Jack.
          
                                  FRED 
                        (yelling)
                   Hi, Jack!!!
          
          A swarm of police and airport security men descend on Fred
          and take him away.
          
          EXT. AIRPORT - PASSENGER LOADING ZONE - NIGHT
          
          A limousine arrives. Two colorfully dressed BLACK DUDES
          emerge. An extra pesters them. Two HARE KRISHNA'S arrive on
          foot and walk toward terminal.

                   There's just no stopping in the white
                   zone.
          
                                  P.A. SYSTEM (male v.o.)
                   Christ, you're as bad as your mother!
          
                                  P.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.)
                   Oh, really, Vernon! Why pretend? We both
                   know perfectly well what it is you're
                   talking about. You want me to have an
                   abortion.
          
                                  P.A. SYSTEM (male v.o.)
                   It's really the only sensible thing to do.
                   If it's done properly, therapeutically,
                   there's no danger involved.
          
                                  P.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.)
                   Have you considered that what's inside me
                   is a human being; that it's alive. We made
                   love. It's us -- you and me.
          
                                  P.A. SYSTER (male v.o.)
                   That isn't true. A fetus at this stage is
                   not a human being, nor is it a person.
          
          Krishnas enter terminal building.
          
          INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - NIGHT

                                  ZEALOT #2
                   Hello, we'd like you to have this flower
                   from the Church of Consciousness. Would
                   you like to make a donation?
          
                                  KRISHNA 
                        (shakes his head) 
                   No, we gave at the office.
          
          INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          A voluptuous BLONDE saunters through the airport, clears her
          throat loudly, and spits on the wall.
          
          She walks past an ELDERLY WOMAN standing outside a men's
          room door. She turns and sticks her head in the door.
          
                                  ELDERLY WOMAN
                   Go, O.J., go!!

                   Please put your metal objects on this
                   tray.
          
          He puts his watch, keys on the tray. Then removes his metal
          arm and metal leg.
          
          EXT. TERMINAL BUILDING - PASSENGER LOADING AREA - NIGHT

          The Hammens walk toward terminal past a BUSINESSMAN.
          
                                  BUSINESSMAN
                   Taxi!
          
          A taxi cab skids to a stop in front of him. The Businessman
          gets in as the driver, TED STRIKER, drops the flag and
          rushes out.
          
                                  STRIKER

          Striker enters, looking around as if searching for someone.
          People are rolling down the conveyor belt of a baggage
          carousel, banging into each other like luggage. The luggage
          is standing around the conveyor belt, waiting for the people
          to come off.
          
          INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - ANOTHER AREA - NIGHT
          
          Striker, walking briskly, is approached by Zealot #3 who
          tries to pin a flower on his jacket. Striker keeps walking
          but the Zealot is persistent. Finally, Striker slips out of
          his jacket leaving the Zealot with the coat.

                                  GROUND CREWMAN #1
                   The forklift? It's over there by the
                   baggage loader.
          
          He points to the left with his flashlights. Flight 733
          follows flashlights and CRASHES into terminal.

          Striker catches up to Elaine.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Elaine!
          
                                  ELAINE
                        (surprised)
                   Ted!
          
                                  STRIKER
                   I came home early and found your note. I
                   guess you meant for me to read it later.
                   Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   I just don't want to go over it any more.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   I know things haven't been right for a
                   long time, but it'll be different. If
                   you'll just be patient, I can work things
                   out.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   I have been patient and I've tried to
                   help, but you wouldn't even let me do
                   that.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Don't you feel anything for me at all any
                   more?
          
                                  ELAINE
                   It takes so many things to make love last.
                   Most of all it takes respect. And I can't
                   live with a man I don't respect!
          
          She leaves.
          
                                  STRIKER
                        (to CAMERA)

                   This is Doctor Turnansky at the Mayo
                   Clinic.
          
          INT. DR. TURNANSKY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
          
          DR. TURNANSKY is seated at desk. Behind him are shelves
          filled with mayonnaise jars.
          
                                  TURNANSKY
                   There's a passenger on your Chicago flight
                   two-oh-niner, a little girl named Lisa
                   Davis -- en route to Minneapolis. She's
                   scheduled for a heart transplant and we'd
                   like you to tell her mother that we found
                   a donor an hour ago.
          
          On his desk is a beaker containing a beating heart.
          
                                  TURNANSKY
                   We have the heart here ready for surgery
                   and we must have the recipient on the
                   operating table within six hours.
          
          The heart jumps out of the beaker, across the desk and falls
          off the edge.
          
                                  TURNANSKY
                   I want you to make sure she is kept in a
                   reclined position and that a continuous
                   watch is kept on her I.V.

                   Also, it's important that...
          
                                  OPERATOR (v.o.)
                   Excuse me. This is the Operator, Captain
                   Oveur, I have an emergency call for you on
                   line five trom a Mister Hamm.
          
                                  OVEUR
                   All right. Give me Hamm on five, hold the

          INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Elaine and Striker are walking together.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow
                   night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   I won't be back. I've requested the
                   Atlanta run.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really
                   can change.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Then why don't you take the job that Louie
                   Netz offered you at Boeing?
          
          In the b.g. an airline PORTER is transporting an ELDERLY
          COUPLE in an electric cart. They round the corner too fast
          and the woman falls out. Husband doesn't notice.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   You know I haven't been able to get near
                   an airplane since the war. And even if I
                   could, they wouldn't hire me because of my
                   war record.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Your war record? You're the only one
                   keeping that alive. For everyone else it's
                   ancient history.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   You expect me to believe that?
          
          In the b.g. the Elderly Woman staggers to her feet and is
          immediately run over by another electric cart.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   It's the truth. What's hurt you the most
                   is your record since the war. Different
                   cities, different jobs, and not one of
                   them shows you can accept any real
                   responsibility.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   But if you'll just give me...
          
                                  ELAINE
                   It's too late, Ted. When I get back to
                   Chicago, I'm going to start my life all
                   over again. I'm sorry.
          
          She walks off. Dramatic MUSIC as Striker glares with
          determination. The religious Zealot tries to pin a flower on
          his lapel.
          
                                  ZEALOT #3
                   Hello, we'd like you to have this...
          
          Without looking, Striker decks the Zealot with one punch. He
          walks after Elaine.
          
          INT. COCKPIT - FLIGHT 209 - NIGHT
          
          Clarence Oveur is in the pilot's seat. VICTOR BASTA is
          seated at engineer's console. There is a St. Christopher's
          statue on the dashboard.
          
                                  BASTA
                   Any word on that storm lifting over Salt
                   Lake, Clarence?
          
          TEXACO SERVICE MAN is cleaning windshield.
          
                                  OVEUR
                   Unlikely, Victor. I just reviewed the Area
                   Report for 1609 hours through 2400 hours.
                   That's an occluded front stalled over the
                   Dakotas -- backed up all the way to Utah.
          
          Texaco Service Man opens hood and checks dipstick.
          
                                  BASTA
                   If it decides to push over into the Great
                   Lakes it could get plenty soupy. How about
                   the southern route, around Tulsa?
          
                                  OVEUR
                   I double checked the terminal forecast and
                   winds aloft. IFR ceilings all the way.
          
          Oveur gives charge card to Texaco Man.
          
                                  BASTA
                   Where do they top out?
          
                                  OVEUR
                   Well, there's some light scattered cover
                   at twenty thousand with icing around
                   eighteen.
          
                                  BASTA
                   Looks like the original flight plan over
                   Denver is still the best bet.
          
          Oveur signs charge form and gives it to Texaco Man.
          
                                  OVEUR
                   Denver it is.
          
          ROGER MURDOCK enters. He is played by a famous athlete.

                   Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard.
                   Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
          
                                  BASTA
                   How do you do, Roger?
          
          Texaco Man hands receipt to Oveur.

                   But suddenly there she was.
          
          STRIKER'S POV
          
          Elaine dancing with grizzly looking cutthroat.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   I was captivated, entranced.
          
          BACK TO STRIKER
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   It hit me like a thunderbolt. I had to ask
                   the guy next to me to pinch me to make
                   sure I wasn't dreaming.
          
          Striker asks the burly LONGSHOREMAN next to him to to pinch
          him. Longshoreman gives him a look and moves away
          cautiously.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   I was afraid to approach her, but that
                   night, fate was on my side.
          
          Elaine's dancing partner is stabbed in the back and falls to
          the grould. No one notices but Striker who eagerly fills in.
          They make a perfect disco couple. The other dancers make a
          circle around them.
          
          They begin with fancy disco steps, move on to flips and
          seemingly impossible acrobatics, finally ending with
          incredible stunts: Striker, jumping through flaming hoops
          and Elaine, hanging from a chandelier by her teeth and
          twirling.

          Bar is closing, chairs on tables, bartender sweeping floor,
          Elaine and Striker dancing slowly in center of room. One
          final Girl Scout flies into FRAME and falls in a lifeless
          heap at their feet.

                   We laughed, we talked, we danced, I never
                   wanted it to end and I guess I still
                   don't. But enough about me. I hope this
                   hasn't been boring for you.

                                  STRIKER
                   It's just that when I start to talk about
                   Elaine, I get so carried away -- I lose
                   all track of time -- not unlike Oliver in

                   I happened to be passing, and I thought
                   you might like some corfee.

                   Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You
                   see, I'm a teacher in the New York City
                   school system, and I was attending a

                   No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a

                   Yes. Steak for Joey and my wife and I will
                   have the fish.

                   Well, I think that the pilots are too busy
                   flying the plane for that, Joey.

          Striker and Elaine are running. She falls down at the
          water's edge, exhausted. Striker drops to his knees and they
          embrace passionately. A huge wave washes over them covering
          them completely. When the wave recedes, they're still locked
          in the same embrace. They are covered with seaweed. Fish are
          flopping around in the sand.

                   These past few months have been wonderful.

                   This is Captain Oveur. Mister Murdock and

                   Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd

                   I'm sorry, son, but you must have me
                   confused with someone else. My name is
                   Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.

                   Ah, Victor, why don't you get the
                   coordinates on the altitude vector and
                   find out the ratio of direct velocity over
                   engine speed?
          
          Victor is puzzled.

                        (to Oveur)
                   Ah, Clarence, according to my
                   calculations, with this tailwind we ought
                   to be able to make up an additional
                   fifteen minutes over the Rockies.

                   I think you're the greatest. But my Dad
                   says you don't work hard enough on
                   defense.

                   buns every night.
          
          Murdock realizes he has given himself away. He quickly looks
          to see if Oveur is listening. Oveur is busy checking
          instruments. Murdock grabs Joey by the collar and whispers
          angrily.
          
                                  MURDOCK
                   Listen, kid, I've been hearing that crap
                   ever since I was at UCLA. Tell your old
                   man to drag Unseld and Lanier up and down
                   the court for forty-eight minutes.

                   Elaine, just hear me out. I know things
                   haven't been right for a long time. But it
                   will be different...like it was in the
                   beginning. Remember?
          
                                  ELAINE
                   I remember everything. All I have are
                   memories.
          
          Soft MUSIC begins.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Mostly I remember...the nights when we
                   were together. I remember how you used to
                   hold me...and how I used to sit on your
                   face and wriggle...and then afterwards how
                   we'd watch until the sun came up. When it
                   did, it was almost like...like each new
                   day was created...only for us.
          
                                  STRIKER

                   It's a big building where the generals
                   meet. But that's not important right now.
                   They've cleared you of any blame for what
                   happened on that raid. Isn't that good

          Stewardesses and passengers notice the singer and peer
          around corners and over seat backs. A man's head peers
          upside down from the TOP OF THE FRAME.

          As singing continues, Shirley and Jack look at each other
          with saccherine smiles, the Hammens do the same, then the

                   again.'

                   one sea.'
          
          Randy, in her growing enthusiasm, swings her guitar,
          knocking the I.V. connection tube from Lisa's arm. The I.V.
          squirts, and Lisa turns pale and hollow­cheeked. No one else
          notices.

                   the Father, we are the son.'
          
          Randy again knocks I.V. from Lisa's arm with guitar as the
          passengers start to get into the music.

          react. Mrs. Davis pounds Lisa's chest.

                                  MURDOCK
                   Not so good. We've got some heavy stuff
                   ahead of us. It might get rough again
                   unless we can climb on top. But our

                   ten knots.

                   After the war, I just wanted to get as far
                   away from things as possible. So Elaine
                   and I joined the Peace Corps. We were
                   assigned to an isolated tribe, the
                   Molombos.

          Striker and Elaine are being escorted to the chief's hut by
          two GUARDS. We hear Jungle Animal SOUNDS. The chief is
          standing in front of his hut surrounded by several TRIBESMEN
          who are making the jungle animal sounds.

                   They had never seen Americans before.
          
          When Striker and Elaine arrive, the CHIEF holds up his hands
          and the sounds stop.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   At first, they didn't know what to think
                   of us; but soon we gained their trust.
          
          The Chief extends his right hand for conventional handshake.
          Striker shows him power grip. When the Chief is pleased,
          Striker gives him five. The Chief pauses then decks Striker.

                   lid keeps hotdog buns fresh for days and

                   You must understand that these people had
                   been completely isolated from
                   civilization.
          
          Striker demonstrates a two-handed set shot to natives. He
          misses.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   No one had ever outlined a physical
                   fitness program for them and they had no
                   athletic equipment.
          
          Native examines basketball for first time. After two slow
          dribbles, he gracefully feints lefts, then, dribbling
          through his legs, sinks a two-hand, over-the-head, reverse
          dunk shot.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   We also emphasized nutrition and taught
                   them to watch their diets.

                   The exercise improved their physical
                   fitness and condition.
          
          One shot after another swishes through the basketball rim.

                   My working with them seemed to reinforce
                   our objectives of group cooperation and
                   controlled-competitive activity.

                   for us to go back home -- to the plans we
                   made before the war.

                   I guess it was at that moment that I first
                   realized Elaine had doubts about our
                   relationship. And that as much as anything
                   else led to my drinking problem.
          
          Striker has a problem drinking. He raises his glass of
          Gator-Ade, then suddenly pours it on his forehead.

          pokes her stomach with his hand.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   Pain there?
          
          She winces and nods.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   May I see your tongue, please?
          
          She sticks her tongue out. Rumack pulls on it until it is
          obviously too long. He continues to pull, and the tongue
          becomes multi-colored magician's scarves. Then he pulls out
          a bouquet of flowers followed by a white dove.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   I'll be back in a minute.
          
          Rumack takes Elaine aside.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   You'd better tell the Captain. We've got
                   to land as soon as we can. This woman has
                   to be gotten to a hospital.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   A hospital? What is it?
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   It's a big building with patients. But
                   that's not important right now. Tell the
                   Captain I must speak to him.

          takes shape in seat with hands on wheel. His uniform and cap
          are painted on, and he has an alert "leave the driving to
          us" expression on his face. The plane immediately regains
          level flight, and Elaine and Rumack sigh in relief.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   I'll get back to the passengers.
          
          Rumack exits.
          
                                  McCROSKEY (v.o.)
                        (over radio)
                   Come in two-zero-niner. This is Chicago.
                   Flight two-zero-niner, come in, please.
          
          Elaine picks up mike while still standing.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   This is Elaine Dickinson. I'm the
                   stewardess. Captain Oveur is passed out on
                   the floor, and we've lost the co-pilot and
                   navigator, too. We're in terrible trouble.
                   Over.
          
                                  OVEUR (o.s.)
                   Groan!
          
                                  McCROSKEY (v.o.)
                   Elaine! Roger, Roger! I read you. This is
                   Steve McCroskey at Chicago Air Control.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Hi, Steve!
          
                                  McCROSKEY (v.o.)
                   Now listen carefully. Is the automatic
                   pilot on? Over.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Yes. Yes, it is. Over.
          
                                  OVEUR (o.s.)
                   Huh?
          
                                  McCROSKEY (v.o.)
                   Very good. Now, Elaine, where are you?
                   Over.
          
                                  ELAINE

                        (into mike)
                   All right, Elaine. Just hold on. We'll be
                   back to you in a minute.
          
          CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal dispatch is a beehive of
          activity. The Chief Dispatcher, STEVE McCROSKEY, is barking
          orders to AIR CONTROLLER #1.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Hold all takeoffs. I don't want another
                   plane in the air. When the 508 reports,
                   bring it straight in.
          
          Air Controller #1 exits quickly. McCroskey picks up phone.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Put out a general bulletin to suspend all
                   meal service on flights out of Los
                   Angeles.
          
          He hangs up phone and talks to AIR CONTROLLER #2.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Tell all dispatchers to remain at their
                   posts. It's going to be a long night.
          
          Air Controller #2 exits. McCroskey notices he is out of
          coffee and turns to AIR CONTROLLER HINSHAW.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   And how about some coffee, Johnny?
          
                                  HINSHAW
                   No thanks.
          
          AIR CONTROLLER #3 enters.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   I want the weather on every landing field
                   on this side of the Rockies, no matter
                   what the size.
          
          Air Controller #3 exits. AIR CONTROLLER #4 enters.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Do you understand?
          
          Air Controller #4 exits. AIR CONTROLLER #5 enters.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Any place where there's a chance to land
                   this plane.
          
          Air Controller #5 exits. SIAMESE TWINS enter.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Stan, go upstairs to the tower and get a
                   runway diagram. Terry, check down on the
                   field for emergency equipment.
          
          Siamese Twins leave. In the b.g. we see them trying to walk
          in opposite directions. Air Controller #1 enters.
          
                                  AIR CONTROLLER #1
                   Chief, there's fog down to the deck
                   everywhere east of the Rockies. There's no
                   possible place they can land. They'll have
                   to come through to Chicago.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit
                   smoking.
          
          He lights up a cigarette. McCroskey walks toward a table and
          leans on his hands.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   I want the best available man on this. A
                   man who knows this plane inside and out
                   and won't crack under pressure.
          
                                  HINSHAW
                   How about Sal Mineo?
          
                                  McCROSKEY

          Elaine is in the pilot's seat and the inflated automatic
          pilot is in co-pilot's seat.
          
                                  McCROSKEY (v.o.)
                   Now, Elaine, right next to the throttle is
                   the air speed gauge. What speed does it
                   indicate?
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Three hundred twenty miles per hour.

          BACK TO SCENE
          
          We see, but Elaine does not notice, the automatic pilot very
          slowly beginning to deflate.
          
                                  McCROSKEY (v.o.)
                   Good. Now check your altitude. That's the
                   dial just below and to the right of the
                   air speed indicator.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Thirty-five thousand feet.

          BACK TO SCENE
          
                                  ELAINE
                   No, wait. Now it says thirty-four thousand
                   feet. It's dropping! It's dropping fast!
                   Why is it doing that?
          
          By now the automatic pilot is really slumped over as it is
          quite deflated. It is staring at her with a half smile.
          Elaine notices it.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Oh, my God! The automatic pilot! It's
                   deflating!
          
                                  McCROSKEY (v.o.)
                   All right, Elaine, don't worry. We have an
                   auxiliary inflation system. Just follow my
                   instructions.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Okay, but please hurry! We're dropping
                   fast!

                                  McCROSKEY (v.o.)
                   Now, Elaine, don't panic. On the belt line
                   of the automatie pilot there is a hollow
                   tube. Can you see that?
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Yes. Yes, I can see it.
          
                                  McCROSKEY (v.o.)
                   Good. Now that's the manual inflation
                   nozzle. Pull it out and blow it up like a
                   balloon.
          
          Elaine kneels over automatic pilot's crotch, puts tube in
          her mouth and blows. Automatic pilot inflates. Rumack bursts
          into cockpit.

                   All right. Unless I can get all these
                   people to a hospital quickly, I can't even
                   be sure of saving their lives. Now, is

                   I think you ought to know what our chances
                   are. The life of everyone on board depends
                   on just one thing: finding someone back
                   there who not only can fly this plane, but
                   who didn't have fish for dinner.

                   This is due to periodic air pockets we
                   encounter. There is no reason to become
                   alarmed, and we hope you enjoy the rest of
                   your flight. By the way, is there anyone
                   on ­board who knows how to fly a plane?

                   Well, to tell the truth, they really
                   didn't fill me in on many of the details.
                   Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.

                   Something about a plane with no pilot?
          
          Carey begins to lose battle with the dog, while trying to
          remain polite.
          
                                  CAREY
                   Yeah, something like that, but as I say,
                   they didn't have time to tell me very
                   much.
          
                                  MRS. KRAMER
                   Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting
                   things happen all the time down there.
          
          Shep is growling and Carey's arm is locked firmly in his
          Jaws.
          
                                  CAREY
                   Well...the airline business...does have...
                   its moments...
          
          Shep pins Carey against the wall, ripping his sleeve.
          
                                  CAREY
                   ...but after...awhile...you begin to...
                        (gasp)
                   ...get used to it.
          
                                  MRS. KRAMER
                   Shep, no! He gets so excited when new
                   people are here.
          
          We hear a THUD and loud growling.
          
                                  MRS. KRAMER
                   Are you a pilot yourself?
          
          Carey is on the floor desperately fighting off the dog,
          which is on top of him.
          
                                  CAREY
                   I'm...in a...argh...navigator training
                   program.
          
          KRAMER enters, buttoning his coat.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   It's unbelievable! How many times have I
                   warned those people about food inspection?
          
          Kramer is tying his tie in the mirror. In the corner of the
          mirror, Carey is being thrashed by the dog.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   The airport management, the F.A.A., and
                   the airlines, they're all cheats and
                   liars! All right, let's get out of here.

                   Sorry to bother you. We were just looking

          Striker is sitting next to a MAN FROM INDIA in a business
          suit and turban.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   You see, the day we left the village it
                   was raining, so we had to take a special
                   jeep to the main road...
          
          The Indian is dousing himself with a can of gasoline. In
          b.g. Randy is talking to passengers.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   In fact, we were lucky to even get a jeep
                   since just the day before the only one we
                   had broke down -- it had a bad axle...
          
          The Indian lights a match to immolate himself. Randy
          approaches.
          
                                  RANDY
                   Excuse me, sir. There's been a little
                   problem in the cockpit and I was
                   wondering...
          
                                  STRIKER
                   The cockpit? What is it?
          
                                  RANDY
                   It's the little room at the front of the
                   plane where the pilots sit. But that's not
                   important right now. The first officer is
                   ill and the Captain would like someone
                   with flying experience to help him with
                   the radio. Do you know anything about
                   planes?
          
          The Indian holds the match, awaiting the outcome.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Well, I flew in the war, but that was a
                   long time ago. I wouldn't know anything
                   about it.
          
                                  RANDY
                   Would you go up, please?
          
          He has a moment of indecision. The Indian encourages Striker
          with an adamant nod. Striker gets up to leave. The Indian,
          relieved, blows out the match.

          Jack is sitting across the aisle from a 65-year-old
          con­servatively dressed SPINSTER. He pulls a flask from his
          coat pocket and takes a swig. She eyes him dis­approvingly.

                   Can you fly this airplane and land it?
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Surely you can't be serious.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   I am serious, and don't call me Shirley!
                   What flying experience have you had?
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the
                   Air Force, but this plane has four
                   engines. It's an entirely different kind
                   of flying...all together!!!
          
                                  RANDY/RUMACK
                        (all together)
                   It's an entirely different kind of flying.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Besides, I haven't touched any ­kind of
                   plane in six years.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   Mister Striker. I know nothing about
                   flying. All I know is this: you're the
                   only person on this plane who can possibly
                   fly it. You're the only chance we've got.

                   No, we can't do that; the risk of a
                   flameout is too great. Keep him 24,000.
                   No, feet!
          
          He hangs up phone.

                   that plane.
          
                                  CAREY
                   Is that possible?
          
                                  KRAMER
                   Possible, but it's a hundred to one shot.
                   Thousand to one. I know this guy.
          
                                  CAREY
                   You do? Who is it?
          
          We hear A THUNK. REAR PROJECTION shows he has run oyer a
          bicyclist, who stands and gives the finger.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   His name is Ted Striker. I flew with him
                   during the war. And that won't make my job
                   any easier tonight.
          
          REAR PROJECTION SPEEDS UP to obvious FAST MOTION.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   Ted Striker was a crack flight leader up
                   to a point. But he was one of those men
                   who, well, let's just say he felt too much
                   inside. Maybe you know the kind.
          
          Now REAR PROJECTION indicates car is turning and then
          weaving, but Kramer does not move wheel.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   It takes a certain type to perform under
                   pressure. Striker didn't have it.
          
          By now REAR PROJECTION is cowboys and Indians on horseback
          chasing and shooting at Kramer's car.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   Ate his heart out over every name on the
                   casualty lists. The upshot of it is that
                   he went all to pieces on one particular
                   mission. Let's just hope it doesn't happen
                   again tonight.

                                  STRIKER
                   That's what I've been trying to tell these
                   people.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently,
                   so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on
                   this plane is in a desperate situation.
                   Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the
                   thrust, this must turn on the landing
                   lights.

                                  McCROSKEY
                   Well, that's the whole story, Rex,
                   everything we know.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   All right, Steve, let's face a few facts.
          
          Kramer whips off his sunglasses. Underneath is another pair
          of sunglasses.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   As you know, I flew with this man,
                   Striker, during the war. He'll have enough
                   on his mind without remembering those days
                   when -- well, when things weren't so good.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Well, right now things aren't so good. And
                   while we're talking there are a hundred
                   and thirty-eight lives waiting on us for a
                   decision.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   Let me tell you something, Steve. Striker
                   was a top-notch squadron leader -- a long
                   time ago...
          
          A spear slams into the wall behind Kramer.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   ...but my feeling is that when the going
                   gets rough upstairs tonight, Ted Striker's
                   gonna fold up.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Look, Rex -- I want you to get on the horn
                   and talk this guy down! You're going to
                   have to let him get the feel of this
                   airplane on the way; you'll have to talk
                   him onto the approach; and so help me,
                   you'll have to talk him right down to the
                   ground!
          
          A watermelon falls from TOP OF FRAME, splattering on the

                                  KRAMER
                   Very well then. Put Striker on the
                   speaker.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Okay, you can use the radio over there.

                                  KRAMER
                   All right. It's obvious you remember me.
          
          The Air Controller is scratching his behind.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   So what do you say you and I just forget

                   now?
          
          The Air Controller is now scratching his crotch.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   You and I are going to bring this plane in
                   together.
          
          The Air Controller's hand is now inside his pants
          straightening out his underwear.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   Before we start, I'd like to say
                   something. I know that right now things
                   must look pretty rough up there.
          
          The Air Controller is now hopping around with both hands
          inside his pants.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   But if you do what I tell you, when I tell
                   you to do it, there's no reason you can't
                   bring that plane in.

                   I've never flown a bucket like this. I'm

                   The one hope we have is to build this man
                   up. I've got to give him all the
                   confidence I can.
                        (into microphone)
                   All right, Striker, have you ever flown a
                   multi-engine plane before?
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   No. Never.

                   This is a goddamn waste of time. There's
                   no way he can land this plane! Route 'em
                   into Lake Michigan and at least avoid

                        (into mike)
                   All right, Striker, now you listen to me
                   and you listen close. Flying is no
                   different than riding a bicycle...it just
                   happens to be a lot harder to put baseball
                   cards in the spokes. Now, if you just
                   follow my instructions...

                                  KRAMER (v.o.)
                   ...there's no reason why you shouldn't
                   have complete confidence in your chances
                   to come out of this thing alive and in one
                   piece.

                   First, I want you to familiarize yourself
                   with the controls. Later we'll run through
                   the landing procedure.
          
          Kramer takes a last drag on his cigarette and tosses it out
          the window. McCroskey plugs his ears with his fingers and
          ducks as though Kramer had thrown a grenade. There is an
          EXPLOSION O.S.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   All right. Now I'd like you to disengage
                   the automatic pilot. But watch any violent
                   movement of the controls, like you used to
                   make in Spitfires and Phantoms.

                   Okay, I'm going to unlock the automatic
                   pilot.
          
          Striker switches off automatic pilot button. Automatic pilot
          shoots upward out of the seat. Elaine is thrown to the
          floor. Striker struggles desperately to control the plane.

                   heavy compared to a fighter.
          
          Striker is fighting the wheel and the autopilot which is
          drifting in his way. Finally, he throws the autopilot to the
          rear of the cockpit.

                   Don't worry about that. It's perfectly
                   normal. You must watch your airspeed
                   closely. Don't let it fall below 520. Both
                   your rudder pedals and elevator trim will
                   have additional play due to increased
                   drag, but you can compensate by lowering
                   manifold pressure below 154. Now there's
                   one other thing. Have you someone up there
                   who can work the radio and leave you free
                   for flying?
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Yes! The stewardess is here with me!
          
          Elaine rises. The autopilot is on her back, its hands
          clinging to her breasts. She removes it and seats it at
          engineer's console.
          
                                  KRAMER (v.o.)
                   Have her take the co-pilot's seat.
          
          Elaine takes her seat as Striker regains control of the
          plane. He hands Elaine the mike.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   The radio's all yours now. And keep an eye
                   on that number three engine. It's running
                   a little hot.

                   up there?

                   How's it handling?
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.

                   All right, Striker, you're doing just
                   fine.

                   I'm sorry. I don't understand.
          
          MRS. SCHIFF, a middle-aged woman, is seated behind the Black
          Dudes.
          
                                  MRS. SCHIFF
                   Oh, stewardess, I can speak jive. He said
                   he's in great pain and wants to know if
                   you can help him.

                   Here.
          
          He reaches up and opens the overhead air nozzle. Air rushes
          out with hurricane force. As Jack struggles to turn off
          nozzle, Shirley is blown about, an adjacent passenger's
          papers go flying from a briefcase, a Hari Krishna's toga
          flies up revealing polka dot boxer shorts. An extra's toupe
          flies off.

                                  MILTON
                   After my wife died, I felt like a fifth
                   wheel. You know, so many years being with
                   one person -- a very wonderful person --
                   makes you always think of yourself as part
                   of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was
                   lost. I couldn't function socially and I
                   couldn't function in business.
          
                                  BERNICE
                   Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't
                   be expected to.
          
                                  MILTON
                   But I think it's time we stopped talking
                   about me. A woman like you -- why haven't
                   you ever married?
          
                                  BERNICE
                   Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's
                   all too easy to answer.
          
                                  MILTON
                   I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman
                   like you became so involved in your work,
                   you didn't have time for marriage.
          
                                  BERNICE
                   I wish I could fool myself into believing
                   that that's the reason. The truth of the
                   matter is, nobody ever asked me.
          
                                  MILTON
                   You know, here we are having coffee
                   together, and discussing education and
                   business and economy...and we don't even
                   know each other's names...full names I
                   mean.

                   I'd be glad to.
          
          Randy hands a large bottle of Coca Cola wrapped in a baby
          blanket to Ms. Schiff, who cradles it in her arms.
          
                                  MRS. SCHIFF
                   Ooooh, such a nice soft drink.

          The Dispatcher attempts to remove the message, but it is
          stuck in the cartridge. He yanks on it, but the paper
          stretches out like rubber. The scene now becomes like a
          cartoon. He lodges his feet against the typewriter and pulls
          until the paper stretches to his face. He grumbles in Donald
          Duck voice. The typewriter snaps back and hits him.

                   Randy, are you all right?
          
                                  RANDY
                   Doctor Rumack, I'm scared. I've never been
                   so scared. And besides, I'm twenty-six and
                   I'm not married.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK

                   to believe that.

                   be landing?
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   It will be pretty soon. How are you
                   bearing up?
          
                                  MRS. HAMMEN
                   Well, to be honest, I'm very scared. But
                   at least I've got a husband.

                                  McCROSKEY
                   Rex, I've decided that the best thing to
                   do is to foam the runway -- let him do a
                   wheels-up landing. It'd be a lot simpler.
          
          Kramer throws cup into wastebasket. McCroskey drinks.

                        (filling up another cup)
                   No, the risk of fire is too great. If she
                   starts burning, you write off all those
                   people who can't get out of there on their
                   own power.
          
          McCroskey throws cup into wastebasket. Kramer drinks.

                        (filling up another cup)
                   Well that's better than writing them all
                   off? Are you going to play God with a
                   hundred and 38 lives?
          
          Kramer throws cup into wastebasket as McCroskey drinks.

                        (filling up another cup)
                   No. A belly landing isn't all that simple.
                   It takes a good pilot to keep from
                   smearin' himself all over the runway.
          
          McCroskey throws cup into wastebasket as Kramer drinks.

                        (filling up another cup)
                   If Striker has the guts to try this, he
                   deserves the best shot we can give him.
                   We've gotta foam that runway.
          
          Kramer throws cup into wastebasket as McCroskey drinks.

                        (taking another cup)
                   His only shot's with the wheels down. I've
                   seen foam tear a man's guts out.
          
          McCroskey throws cup into wastebasket. Kramer throws cup
          into wastebasket.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   And if Striker goes to pieces?
          
                                  KRAMER
                        (taking another cup)
                   That's a risk we'll just have to take.
          
          Kramer throws cup into wastebasket. McCroskey throws cup

                   No. I haven't a thing to say. You've done
                   the best you could. You really have. The
                   best you could. I guess we can't expect to
                   win 'em all. I want to tell you something
                   I've kept to myself for years. I was in
                   the war myself -- the Medical Corps. I was
                   on duty late one night when a badly
                   wounded pilot was brought in from a raid.
                   He could barely talk, but he looked at me
                   and he said, "Doc. The odds were against
                   us up there but we went in anyway, and I'm
                   glad we did. The captain made the right
                   decision." The pilot's name was George
                   Zipp.
          
          Striker looks up. Notre Dame Fight Song is heard in b.g.

                                  DR. RUMACK
                   And the last thing he said to me, "Doc,"
                   he said, "Sometime when the crew is up
                   against it and the breaks are beating the
                   boys, tell them to go out there with all
                   they've got and win just one for the
                   Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then,
                   Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too
                   good. That's for sure."

                   All right, you'd better stay up there for

          She turns to face him. A dramatic moment. Striker enters

                   put down full flap, bring your air speed

                   If that doesn't stop you...
          
          Kramer is suddenly aware of what Mrs. Oveur is doing. He
          gives her a look and she removes her hands.
