1   EXT. LOWER MANHATTAN SKYLINE - BROOKLYN BRIDGE - MORNING    1
    RUSH HOUR

    ON a pair of black Dexter penny loafers diligently
    pedaling an old Schwinn mountain bike. ADJUST ANGLE now
    to meet the bicyclist...

    He's African-American. Anywhere from 33 to 40. Wears
    wire-rim glasses, a fresh white oxford shirt, creased
    slacks and a solid green tie. An unobtrusive figure, at
    once familiar and yet undiscerning. The type you'd pass
    on a sidewalk and never even notice. He's TREVOR GARFIELD.

    ADJUST ANGLE FURTHER now to reveal the upper promenade
    bike path and a dramatic view of Lower Manhattan behind
    him. Morning sun glimmers off the Trade Center towers.

    Trevor's shadow skitters along the wooden path, 160 ft.
    above the East River.

    A fat briefcase, strapped to the back of his bike, rocks
    back and forth as he pumps the pedals.

    FROM ABOVE now a sweeping view of Trevor, alone on the
    bike path, a speck, suspended above a sea of rush hour
    traffic on the bridge below.


2   EXT. ATLANTIC AVENUE (BEDFORD STUYVESANT) - MORNING         2

    A wrought-iron train trestle covered with graffiti shakes
    as an "EL" TRAIN ROARS overhead. Trevor races parallel
    with it along Atlantic Avenue. Every city block becomes
    more and more rundown.


3   EXT. ROOSEVELT WHITNEY HIGH SCHOOL (BEDFORD                 3
    STUYVESANT) - MORNING

    A cyclone fence frames the stalwart face of the old
    three-story administration building. Ubiquitous gray
    patches of paint fail to cover where taggers have most
    recently left their marks. The ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL, a
    black man with a booming voice, barks at late-comers who
    are about to be tardy...

                            ASSISTANT PRINCIPAL
                     (clapping his hands)
              ... Let's go, people! Tardy lock-
              out starts in one minute! Get
              your butts in gear! One minute,
              people! Move it!

                                                  (CONTINUED)

     1   8   7 - Rev. 7/10/96                                  2.

     SUPERIMPOSE:    ROOSEVELT WHITNEY HIGH SCHOOL -
                     OCTOBER 1994

     The Assistant Principal, attention diverted, doesn't even
     notice Trevor as he enters on his bike and races down the
     sidewalk in front of the school. With all the prompting,
     students still don't seem to be in much of a hurry.

5    INT. RWHS "A" BUILDING - MAIN ENTRANCE                          5

     ... as Trevor squeezes through the doorway past students
     being processed through card readers and metal detectors
     and turns down the main hall.


6    INT. RWHS - MAIN FLOOR                                          6

     With a glance over his shoulder, Trevor hops back onto
     his bike and pedals it down the middle of the corridor.
     STRAGGLING STUDENTS either ignore him or look at him
     like he's insane.

                                STRAGGLING STUDENT
                         (as Trevor passes)
                  ... No ridin' bikes in 'a hallway,
                  stoo-pit.


6A   INT. STAIRWELL                                                  6A

     As Trevor reaches the end of the main corridor... and
     steers his bike down the stairs.


7    INT. RWHS - BOTTOM FLOOR                                        7

     Trevor coasts skillfully down the stairs and emerges
     onto the bottom floor of the school. He pedals away
     toward the other end of the corridor.


7A   EXT. TREVOR'S CLASSROOM                                         7A

     A crowd of 10th graders loiter outside Trevor's room.
     Seeing him coming, they stir to life with a flurry of
     taunts. Trevor chooses to face all dissension with a
     smile.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

7A   CONTINUED:                                                  7A

     As Trevor hops off his bike and unlocks the classroom
     door, he notices two lovers making out in the hallway...

                                VOICE IN CROWD
                  ... Yuh late, Garfield.

                                TREVOR
                         (catching his breath)
                  ... No, bell hasn't rung yet.
                  Okay, let's get inside. C'mon.
                         (as they file
                          into the room)
                  ... Morning, morning. Rise and
                  shine.

     TWO STUDENTS make passing comments...

                                AUGGIE
                         (shaking his head)
                  ... You one crazy-ass nigga, G.

                                TYWAN
                         (a quarter stuck
                          in one ear)
                  ... Damn skippy.

                                TREVOR
                  Thank you for sharing, Auggie.

                                TYWAN
                         (provoking Auggie)
                  ... Auggie doggie.

                                AUGGIE (O.S.)
                  Fuck you, Tywan. Yer mama's a
                  gangsta-rapper.

     Trevor offers a pleasant greeting to the two lovers.

                                TREVOR
                  'Scuse me, you two... this isn't
                  the Playboy Channel.

     Trevor enters the room, but ducks his head back into
     the hall.

                                TREVOR
                  'Morning, Juanita.

8    INT. RWHS - TREVOR'S CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION          8

     Walls are covered with assorted science posters.
     Styrofoam nuclei dangle from the ceiling. Trevor
     unstraps the fat briefcase from his bicycle and sets
     it on a metal stool next to his desk...
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                                   4.

                               TREVOR
                        (enthusiastically)
                 Let's get started. August and
                 Tywan, you pass out the books.
                 Thank you, gentlemen.

    Auggie and Tywan don't budge.

                                TYWAN
                 Whas up wit' your car, G?   Yer
                 Pinto blow up?

    The majority of students aren't even paying attention.          A
    group in the back is already starting a card game.

                               TREVOR
                        (good-natured smile)
                 No, I don't own a Pinto, Tywan.
                        (addressing the class)
                 Okay, can I have everyone's
                 attention?

    No response, but it doesn't phase Trevor.         He removes
    the front wheels from his bike.

                               TREVOR
                 The purpose of the bicycle is to
                 demonstrate the principle of
                 centripetal force. That's the
                 opposite of the force we studied
                 yesterday, which was...

                                 VOICE IN THE CROWD
                 Magnum force.

    Hoots and laughter.

                               TREVOR
                 Centrifugal force... Centripetal
                 force is where the acceleration of
                 a body moving in circular motion
                 is directed toward its center by an
                 opposing force, thus creating
                 momentum that constrains the body to
                 its circular path. Like a gyroscope.
                        (sees nothing
                         but yawns)
                 It's better if I show you. Here,
                 Tywan, you be my helper.

    Tywan and Auggie are busy talking in the corner.        They
    still haven't passed out the books.

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                              5.

8   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               8

                                TREVOR
                 Tywan?   Come on.

    Tywan, solidly built like a Rodin bronze, saunters over.

                               TYWAN
                 Whad-up, G?
                        (to rest of class)
                 Hey, shut up! Y'all too damn
                 loud, man!

    Class quiets but only marginally.

                               TREVOR
                 I need you to demonstrate
                 centripetal force.
                        (removes briefcase
                         from stool)
                 Here, have a seat.

    Tywan sits and Trevor hands him the upside-down bicycle.

                               TREVOR
                 Okay, hold the bike steady with
                 your knees. That's it. Seat
                 positioned against your chest.

    Tywan glances over at Auggie and starts to laugh.

                               TYWAN
                        (to Auggie)
                 Shut up, foo.

                               TREVOR
                 Okay, now crank the pedals and get
                 that back wheel spinning about
                 180 R.P.M.

                               TYWAN
                 Whas up wit' dat?

                               TREVOR
                        (coaxing him along)
                 You'll see. Be patient.

    A skeptical Tywan starts to crank the pedals, but he's
    not pedaling hard enough.

                               TREVOR
                 ... Put some muscle into it.

    Tywan cranks the pedals harder now. Trevor back-pedals
    over to the textbook shelf and randomly selects a
    physical science book (but doesn't open it).

                                                      (CONTINUED)

    1   8   7 - Rev. 7/10/96                                6.

                               TREVOR
                 ... Keep pedaling. Harder.

    A paper airplane sails past an oblivious Tywan. He
    cranks harder and harder until he's sweating ham juice.
    Now, he impales Trevor with a befuddled squint.

                               TYWAN
                        (incredulous)
                 Whas up? I tol' you you was
                 crazy, man.

    A thin smile of confidence from Trevor now...

                               TREVOR
                 Now tilt the wheel to your right.

    Tywan does and immediately the wheel pulls him to the
    right, causing the stool to slowly spin on its axis.

                               TYWAN
                        (eyes wide like
                         a little kid)
                 Aw, damn. I'm spinnin'.   Lookit
                 me, Auggie!

    Trevor flickers a smile as Tywan's spinning starts to
    draw the attention of the rest of the class.

    Now Trevor refers to the physical science book in his
    hand. Smile on his face immediately fades.

    INSERT: Physical science textbook. In magic marker.
    The large number 187 has been scrawled across every
    page. Trevor flips through the book. He checks the
    front page to see who it belongs to.

    Juxtaposed to Trevor's distracted state, the class is now
    focused on Tywan's achievement...

                               CLASS
                        (attempting unison)
                 ... Tywan, Tywan, Tywan.

    PERIOD

    One of the fluorescent lights overhead flickers. The
    place is deserted except for a custodian who pushes a
    cresting wave of trash ahead of his broom. Now Trevor
    heads up the north stairwell at the far end of the
    corridor. He clutches the desecrated physical science
    book. A student slides down the banister past him.

                                                            7.

11   INT. COUNSELING OFFICES - WAITING AREA                       11

     A PUERTO RICAN WOMAN prods a group of gangbanger wanna-
     bes. Two of the teens hover over a Sony Walkman, sharing
     the earphones.

                             SECRETARY
               Okay, fellas, off the table. Put
               the Walkman away. I said put it
               away...

     A 10th grade counselor's office opens and a student
     emerges. Trevor walks directly in.

                             TREVOR
               Walter, I need to speak with you.

     WALTER (Anglo; 52) is a disheveled middle-aged counselor.
     A lifer. He chews on an empty smoking pipe as he glances
     through a student "cum" (cue-mm).

                             WALTER
                      (preoccupied)
               I'm pretty busy right now,
               Garfield. What is it?

     Trevor sets the book down on Walter's desk and nervously
     adjusts his glasses.

                             TREVOR
               Could you open it, please?

     Walter opens the book.

                             WALTER
                      (a weary look
                       of disgust)
               Don't suppose this kid cares about
               our budget crisis?
                      (shuts the book)
               Have the textbook room charge him
               for the book.

     Walter snaps the book shut and looks up at Trevor.
     That's all?

                             TREVOR
               One-Eight-Seven is a penal code
               number for murder, Walter.
               Means the same thing as T-O-S.
               'Terminate On the Spot.'

                                 WALTER
                         (piqued)
                  For chrissake, I know what it
                  stands for. Look, kid probably
                  heard it in a rap song. Doesn't
                  mean anything.

                                TREVOR
                  ... The book belongs to Dennis
                  Broadway. He's a known gangster,
                  Walter -- a 'Five Percenter.'

                                WALTER
                  Garfield, if I had a dollar for
                  every time a student threatened
                  faculty... Don't you think you're
                  overreacting a little?

                                TREVOR
                         (suppressing
                          trepidation)
                  Did you tell Dennis Broadway he
                  was getting a fail from me?

                                WALTER
                         (stymied)
                  I have legal access to those
                  files.

                                TREVOR
                  He's a transfer from Nixon High
                  School, isn't he?

                                WALTER
                         (becoming defensive)
                  Look, I'm not obligated to track
                  you down every time a transfer
                  student comes through here. You
                  want confidential information
                  like that, come look it up in his
                  cum (cue-mm).

     Trevor exhales a sigh of resignation.

                                TREVOR
                  Do you have him on a contract?

                                WALTER
                  If he gets through the semester
                  without a fail then he gets to go
                  back to Nixon, so what?

                                TREVOR
                  ... and be with his homeboys.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                              9.

11   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             11

     Walter's caught between a rock and a hard place.   His
     instincts lean toward self-preservation.

                                WALTER
                  So he blew his opportunity. Now
                  he has to learn to live with the
                  consequences.

                                TREVOR
                  I don't think this kid's ready to
                  deal with the consequences. I
                  think he wants me dead.

                                WALTER
                  Relax, has nothin' to do with you.

                                TREVOR
                  I should have been told, Walter.

                                WALTER
                  Hey, I'm on your side, Garfield,
                  but my hands are tied. Kid has a
                  right to his privacy... Know what
                  your problem is? You're an
                  idealist.

                                TREVOR
                  What's wrong with that?

                                WALTER
                  You only see what you wanna see,
                  that's what's wrong. On one hand
                  you think someone's trying to kill
                  you. On the other hand you
                  actually believe kids are paying
                  attention in your classes.

     Trevor resigns himself to the fact that he's come to
     the wrong person for support.

                                TREVOR
                         (collecting himself)
                  Never mind. It's not a problem.

                                WALTER
                         (an empty promise)
                  Tell you what, as soon as I get a
                  chance I'll summons the kid.
                  Promise.

     Trevor's bemusement holds us.

12   INT. RWHS "A" BUILDING - MAIN CORRIDOR - MORNING            12

     Trevor retraces his steps back up the empty corridor as
     the passing BELL RINGS. Within seconds the corridor is
     teeming with teenagers.

     Into SLOW MOTION now. MANEUVERING THROUGH the crowd to
     DISCOVER DENNIS BROADWAY (16). About ten paces behind.
     His Snoop-Dogg Afro frames a gold earring and a pair of
     deep-set eyes filled with vitriol. Oblivious of Dennis,
     Trevor presses on toward the north stairwell.

     VARIOUS SHOTS OVERHEAD and THROUGH crowd as the gap
     between Dennis and Trevor narrows. Every facial
     expression, every blink of an eye, all magnified a
     hundred times.

     Broadway's right hand is wrapped in a dirty white
     handkerchief as he reaches into the front pocket of his
     baggie Solos and pulls out a block of wood with a
     ten-penny nail imbedded in it.


13   INT. RWHS - AT NORTH STAIRWELL                              13

     Trevor's heavy eyelids blink as he slowly glances up into
     a parabolic mirror on the wall. A silent, paroxysmal
     terror registers on his face.

     In a parabolic mirror, the blurred image of Dennis
     Broadway, pushing hard toward a conclusion now.

     BACK TO SPEED as Dennis explodes forward, body blocking
     Trevor from behind, pinning him against a wall and
     sending the "187" textbook flying.

     He rams his weapon into Trevor's back.

     In a SERIES OF RAPID-FIRE CUTS, filtered sunlight
     shimmers off the sharpened nail as it slashes downward.
     A barrage of stabbing motions, tearing at cloth and
     flesh. Trevor's backward flailing arms are ineffective
     in blocking the frenzied stabfest. Downward slashing,
     again and again... 10 times.

     Aftermath. As quickly as it began it's over. Dennis
     Broadway slams open an exit door and is gone. Students
     scatter like cockroaches. An eerie stillness lingers.

     Trevor Garfield is lying on his back now in a pool of
     blood; black plastic framed glasses in pieces on the
     floor; lifeless arms spread out at his sides.   His
     rheumy, unblinking eyes stare upward into infinite space.
     Breathing is the major focus of his concentration now as
     we SLOWLY MOVE IN ON his face. HOLD and now...

                                                               11.

     SUPERIMPOSE: LOS ANGELES - SAN FERNANDO VALLEY,
     SEVENTEEN MONTHS LATER

     It's a tiny one bedroom house in the East San Fernando
     Valley. A chain-link fence surrounds the perimeter and a
     large olive tree shades the neatly-mowed front lawn.
     And in the back there's a wooden tool shed that borders
     a narrow alley.


15   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM                               15

     In the predawn light a terra cotta angel stands guard
     over a bookshelf.


16   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - BEDROOM                                   16

     Stillness. Now the PHONE RINGS. A shape in the bed
     stirs. A desk lamp flickers on, illuminating the phone.
     Trevor's hand reaches for the receiver.

                                 TREVOR
                   Morning...

                                 SUB UNIT (V.O.)
                   'Morning, Mr. Garfield. This is
                   the Sub Unit. Are you available
                   for work?

                   There's a science class in the
                   Valley at John Quincy Adams. It's
                   a four day assignment. Teacher's
                   name is Eskander.


17   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - TREVOR'S PRAYER - SERIES OF SHOTS         17

     We hear what God hears over the following...

     A)   IN SHOWER

          Trevor hangs his head under a torrent of soothing
          water.

     B)   TREVOR

          Ceremoniously, he irons a shirt... and polishes his
          shoes, a broad scar shows across the back of his hand.

      C)   ANOTHER ANGLE

           His pressed slacks and tie hang meticulously over a
           chair as he gets dressed.

      D)   CRUCIFIX

           Now Jesus Christ looks down on Trevor from his crucifix
           on the bedroom wall.

                                 TREVOR (V.O.)
                          (kneeling bedside)
                   ... If you're listening, God,
                   please help me today. All I ask
                   is a chance to do my job... t'do

                          (prayerfully now)
                   Please help me accept those things
                   I cannot change... and give me
                   strength to change those things I
                   can.
                          (beat)
                   ... This is me, Trevor, God.
                   Amen.


18    EXT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS H.S. (SAN FERNANDO VALLEY) -             18
      "A" BUILDING - MORNING

      Traffic bottle-necks as students cross in front of cars,
      and big yellow L.A.U.S.D. buses pull in. The green lawn
      is scattered with students (about 65% Hispanic).
      Compared to the scarred, institutional look of Roosevelt
      Whitney, the face of John Quincy Adams is unblemished.
      (This is your own backyard, not the inner city)

      Sagging pants (Dickies, Ben Davis) and oversized jackets
      (County Bens, Duke, Georgetown) are represented. The
      different socio-economic and ethnic groups stick with
      their own kind; the IHPs (Individual Honors Program), the
      taggers, the Gangbangers, the Asians, the Armenians...


18A   EXT. JQA PARKING LOT                                            18A

      Anglo boy, Stevie Littleton, gets out of his mom's Lexus
      in the school parking lot and walks towards school.

      Trevor sits behind the wheel of his Rambler.      Watches a
      passing parade of students with detachment.

20   INT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS - "A" BUILDING ENTRANCE - FEW           20
     MINUTES LATER

     Trevor, fat briefcase in hand, crosses the front lawn.
     He's not the same Trevor we met back in Bedford-
     Stuvyesant. Withdrawn, guarded, he manufactures a
     cautious smile at students in passing.

     Trevor now approaches VICTOR SIFUENTES, a young plain-
     clothes narc, who intermittently wands students with a
     metal detector at the front doors. FAVOR a kid now who
     wears a baseball cap with an emblem on the crown that
     says "Fucd."

                               VICTOR
                 ... Baseball cap, give it up.

     The kid grudgingly reciprocates, handing over his cap.

                               VICTOR
                        (stopping Trevor now)
                 Hold it, please.

     Trevor produces his blue employee card.

                               TREVOR
                 I'm a substitute.

                               VICTOR
                        (pointing)
                 Okay, you want the Main Office,
                 straight ahead. Check in with
                 Mrs. Ford.


21   INT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS - "A" BUILDING/MAIN CORRIDOR -          21
     BEFORE FIRST PERIOD

     Trevor wanders up the crowded corridor. Along with his
     briefcase he now carries a sub folder that contains a
     homeroom roster, lesson plans and seating charts.

     A sporadic row of teachers, like weary sentinels, stand
     outside their classrooms.

     TEACHER #1 is an insipid woman in her mid-forties.   She's
     overweight and wears too much make-up.

                               TREVOR
                 ... 'Scuse me. I'm lost. I'm
                 looking for Bungalow...
                        (checks homeroom roster)
                 ... eighty-six.

                         (pointing)
                  All the way out, next to the
                  parking lot. Last bungalow on the
                  left.

                                   TREVOR
                  ... Thank you.

                                TEACHER #1
                         (fatalistic)
                  Good luck.

     Her comment weighs on him as he resumes his winding path
     through the bustle of students headed for first period.

     TREVOR'S POV

     Glancing through open doorways. Observing the inner life
     of various classrooms in passing... sees students watch-
     ing TV, teacher ignores them.

     INTERCUT WITH:


23   INT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS - CLASSROOM #2                             23

     ANGLO MALE, 39, slouching behind his desk, attempting to
     read a newspaper but distracted by an offstage commotion.

                                CLASSROOM #2 TEACHER (ANGLO MALE)
                         (erupting)
                  ... Sit down. I come back there
                  and you're gonna be sorry.

     INTERCUT WITH:


24   INT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS - CLASSROOM #3/COMPUTER LAB                24

     On the opposite side of the corridor... we can hear
     Ellen Henry's voice before reaching her doorway. All
     brightness and light, full of enthusiasm...

                                   ELLEN (O.S.)
                         (like,    a buzzer;
                          times    up)
                  ... EEEEgghh!     Wrong. William,
                  you know this.     C'mon, how do you
                  find the pound    sign? What's the
                  fastest way?

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                            15.

24   CONTINUED:                                                   24

     Now we see her through the doorway. ELLEN HENRY (TEACHER
     #3). She's thirty, Anglo, and non-tenured. At the front
     of the class ten students stand linked together, arm-in-
     arm, in a human chain. WILLIAM (15) sits behind a computer
     in the front row struggling to decipher the problem...

                                ELLEN
                         (playfully)
                  You're not thinking.
                         (a major clue)
                  How 'bout Binary search.

     William remains puzzled. The chain of students delight
     in chiding him. "C'mon, Beavis!"...

                                ELLEN
                         (the answer)
                  You split them!

     Ellen attempts to bisect the impulsive chain of students
     with a double-handed karate chop. Fickle chain that they
     are, they resist.

                                ELLEN
                         (amused)
                  ... Very funny.

     Now a SLOW MOTION fleeting moment as she catches Trevor's
     passing gaze and openly smiles at him.

     Trevor rinses his face at the sink as Victor Sifuentes'
     head speaks to him from above one of the heavily
     graffitied stalls in b.g.

                                VICTOR
                  So who yuh here for?

                                TREVOR
                  Eskander.

                                VICTOR
                         (zipping up,
                          exiting)
                  Aw, man, you got bungalow
                  duty.


26   EXT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS - BUNGALOWS - MORNING                 26

     On a MEANDERING COURSE, MERGING with Trevor now.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                16.

     Increasing evidence of tagging, and bands of wandering
     students, indicate a higher degree of disorder the
     further one gets from the Main Office.

     FROM ABOVE NOW, like Algernon and his maze, Trevor
     negotiates his own path deeper and deeper into the
     configuration of bungalows.

     ... And Trevor's trepidation. Eyes discerning every
     passerby. His PULSE AUDIBLY RACES, senses heightened.

     SHIFTING INTO SLOW MOTION AGAIN... And the reverberating
     SOUND of a SPRAY PAINT MARBLE as Trevor rounds a corner
     and comes face to face with three tag-bangers concealing
     spray paint cans inside their oversized jackets. One of
     the taggers locks eyes with Trevor as he passes, a slow
     premonitory burn. The tagger has a "skin tight" (pelon)
     hair cut and a string of black rosary beads around his
     neck. A barcode tattoo on the back of his neck identi-
     fies BENNY.


27   EXT. UTILITY SHED AND VICINITY - MORNING                         27

     ... Behind the bungalows, adjacent the delivery gate.
     Meet DAVE CHILDRESS, a forty-something ditto-head.
     The residual effects of a hangover linger as he sneaks a
     cigarette before first period. He wears a faded Hawaiian
     shirt and Huarache sandals. An old military tattoo
     emblazons his left forearm. As he crushes out his
     cigarette, something catches his eye.


28   EXT. UTILITY SHED                                                28

     ... Thru a chain-link fence we see a handful of cholo-
     types loitering around the shed.

     Childress investigates.    As he approaches the fence...

                                CHILDRESS
                         ... Hey, ese(s)?!

     Homeboys scatter in all directions, some hop the chain-
     link fence, others scurry out a narrow gate behind the
     shed. Childress weighs an amused smirk. Now out of
     nowhere a gangbanger lurches from the shed, buttoning
     his sagging Dickies and tripping over his own feet. He
     scrambles out the back gate and is gone.

     Childress, curiosity piqued, now enters the compound
     through a tear in the fence.

29   INT. UTILITY SHED - MOMENTS LATER                              29

     As Childress pokes his head inside he discovers...

     Rita Nartinez, seventeen... braless. A niobium belly-
     ring piercing her navel. She pulls a dark blue sweat
     shirt on over her head. Glances up at Childress. Masks
     her shame with a defiant smirk.

     (Behind the heavy eyeliner and baggy pants of a chola,
     Rita's really nothing more than a little lost girl.)

                               CHILDRESS
                        (knowing full well)
                 What the hell's going on here,
                 lil' sister?


30   INT. BUNGALOW "84" - MORNING                                   30

     Trevor flicks on the lights, exposing bare, colorless
     walls and closed venetian blinds. His breathing's
     slightly labored as he sets down his briefcase. His back
     faces the mob of students that trickle in now as he takes
     a surreptitious hit off an inhaler. Almost instantly his
     breathing returns to normal.

     Now he shuts his eyes and prepares to conjure up the
     dormant enthusiasm he used to have. Takes a deep
     cathartic breath. Now he digs a file folder out of his
     briefcase, opens it, selects a dispatch and approaches
     the blackboard.

     BELL RINGS as he picks up a piece of chalk... and begins.
     First he writes his name in the corner of the blackboard.
     Now he moves to the center of the blackboard and begins
     to write per the file folder in his hand...

     "GLIS WAS VERY FRAPPER.    SHE HAD DENARPEN FARFIE'S
     MARDSEN..."

     No one pays much attention.    Back still facing the
     class...

                               TREVOR
                 ... Before taking roll, I'd like
                 to prove a point.

     Now one or two students begin to notice the
     indecipherable gibberish he is writing on the board...

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                               18.

                         (Armenian; a disparaging
                          laugh)
                  'Farfie?'
                         (cholo-like)
                  Whad up, Farfie?

     Trevor mentally blocks out the salvo of grunts, groans
     and expletives. With each subsequent stroke of the chalk
     he is exorcising his demons...

                                TREVOR
                  ... It's not important what... or
                  who... 'Farfie' is.

     Turning to face the class now...

                                TREVOR
                  Yuh wanna play, yuh gotta stay.
                  Have a seat, please.

     A handful of students take their seats.

                                TREVOR
                         (pacing now)
                  The point I'd like to make is
                  this... Anyone here can be a
                  scientist.

     ... a grudging buzz of confusion.

                                ASIAN GIRL
                         (sotto; puzzled)
                  ... What's he talking about?

                                 TREVOR
                  ... A scientist is like a
                  detective. He investigates data.
                  He scratches the surface of things
                  he doesn't understand to see
                  what's underneath.
                         (pointing to blackboard)
                  ... Things like this. Okay, who
                  wants to read?

     Barsek (the class clown) breaks in...

                                BARSEK
                         (standing up)
                  I'll do it.

     Trevor quiets a harmless barrage of, "Bart," "sit down"
     and "Armenian Power sucks"...

                  Let 'im do it.
                         (to Barsek)
                  What's your name?

                                   BARSEK
                  Barsek.

     A wisp of gratification flickers at the corner of
     Trevor's mouth.

                                   TREVOR
                  Okay, Barsek.     Read.

     (The following is read in fits and starts and accompanied
     by diminishing laughter and ridicule.)

                                BARSEK
                  ... Glis was very frapper. She
                  had denarpen Farfie's Mardsen.
                  She couldn't galp a giberter for
                  Farfie. Instead she wharked to
                  plimp a mardsen binky for him.

                                TREVOR
                  Okay, anyone know what Barsek just
                  said?

     ... A unanimous "No." Trevor can see the light at the
     end of the tunnel now. He's back in the zone.

                                TREVOR
                  That's alright. You don't need to
                  understand something to answer a
                  few simple questions about it.
                  Every one of you is capable of
                  decoding data. Watch.

     Trevor writes question #1 on the board...

              1. WHY WAS GLIS FRAPPER?

                                TREVOR
                  ... Why was Glis Frapper?   Can
                  anyone tell me?

     The Asian Girl, into it now, tentatively raises her hand.

                         (reactions all around)
                  Let's try another.

     Trevor reads and writes question #2 on the board...

              2. WHAT DID GLIS PLIMP?

                                TREVOR
                  ... What did Glis plimp?

     Before Trevor can finish writing the question, an
     unidentified voice blurts out, "He plimped a Ho."
     Scattered laughter. Trevor grimaces, shakes his head.
     Now attempts to add the question mark at the end of the
     sentence but the chalk breaks, causing dissension.

                                 TREVOR
                         (searching blackboard
                          ledge)
                  ... Hold on, hold on. Where's
                  your teacher keep the chalk?

                                ASIAN GIRL
                  ... In the desk.

     Trevor hastily rifles through the teacher's drawers.     A
     startling discovery abruptly halts his search...

     CLOSER now INTO a brown paper bag Trevor has opened.
     Inside the bag is a .357 Magnum.

     OFF Trevor's narrowing gaze, an offstage voice
     interrupts...

                                CHILDRESS (O.S.)
                  ... Can I help you?

     Trevor lifts his head to see Dave Childress standing in
     the doorway of the bungalow. Trevor shuts the desk
     drawer. You can hear a pin drop.

     Childress piston-chews a wad of gum as he approaches
     Trevor.

     Childress weighs a shit-eating grin as he glances at
     Trevor's name on the board.

                               CHILDRESS
                 No. This is Dave Childress,
                 American History.

     Some students brave a laugh at Trevor's expense.

                               CHILDRESS
                 ... Don't know how to break it to

                 ... Garfield... but this is
                 bungalow 84.

     Childress now places a patronizing hand on Trevor's
     shoulder and steers him toward the window blinds.

                               CHILDRESS
                 See, you zigged when you shoulda

                 off my door. Keep askin' Garcia
                 to fix it but all I get is 'nada.'

     Childress draws the blinds on one of the windows exposing
     another bungalow across the way.


31   INT. BUNGALOW #86 - THROUGH WINDOW PANE                      31

     ... In complete disarray. Students clutter the doorway
     as wads of paper intermittently zing past them.

32   INT. BUNGALOW #86 - MORNING                                     32

     The bungalow was originally designed for lab science:
     glass-encased cupboards, a caged white lab rat on a side
     counter, an 8' by 3' counter top (island) at the front of
     the room, including a built-in sink and butane gas valve.

     Students crowd the opened windows on the far side of the
     room. The chaotic atmosphere centers around one
     student... Benny Chacon (18), the tagger we met earlier.

     Trevor's back to square one. He struggles with
     trepidation as he steps into the doorway of the bungalow
     and hesitates.

     A young black girl, LAKESIA STEWART (16), stands near the
     doorway. She cradles a realistic looking E.N.A.B.L. baby
     (Education Now And Babies Later).

                                LAKESIA
                 You our sub?

     Trevor takes a peek at the doll.

                               LAKESIA
                 It's not real. We're studying
                 teen parenting in home-ec.' It's
                 computerized, so it cries and shit.

     Crowd at the windows begins to disperse now, finding
     their seats, except for Benny who doesn't budge. Trevor
     approaches, gazes out the window, eyes sizing up the
     situation.

     Class erupts with laughter.      A wad of paper sails past
     Trevor and out the window.

                                BENNY
                  You speak Spanish, Mister... Whas
                  yer name?

                  ... You speak Spanish, Mister G?
                         (as Trevor ignores
                           the question)
                  Eh, G... know what dat means when
                  a homeboy calls you 'G'? Dat means
                  gangster, homes. You a gangster,
                  maestro?

                                TREVOR
                  No, I'm not a gangster.
                         (beat)
                  Would you please do me a favor and
                  pick up the books?

                                 BENNY
                         (righteous
                          indignation)
                  Andate a la mierda.
                         (more laughs)
                  I ain't pickin' dat shit up.   You
                  go pick it up.

     Benny now finds a seat.      Trevor follows him.

                                TREVOR
                  What's your name?

                  Cesar Chavez.    Don't you recognize
                  me?

     Class laughs. Trevor refers to the seating chart (inside
     the sub folder) in his hand but Benny's not sitting in
     his proper seat. Benny indicates a 2" by 3" monitoring
     device strapped to his ankle...

                                BENNY
                  See dis? I'm already on house
                  arrest, homes. Ain't nothin' more

     Suddenly three students across from Benny (the other
     three taggers we saw earlier, Cesar Sanchez, Stevie
     Littleton and Paco) stand with bold impunity. All are
     17. Cesar has a buzz-cut, Stevie's an Anglo speed freak
     with a runny nose and a bleached one-clip haircut (roots
     showing) and Paco, a Latino.

                                TREVOR
                  Sit down, please.

     Cesar, Stevie and Paco ignore Trevor and walk out of the
     bungalow. Their departure is accompanied by a tumultuous
     outburst of catcalls and whistles.

                                 LAKESIA
                          (peeking Benny's
                           hold card)

                  out aren't even in here this
                  period.
                          (pointing to Benny)
                  And this fool's name is Benny
                  Chacon.

                                BENNY
                         (whirls in his seat)

                  Okay, Benny.   That's enough.

     Benny turns his wrath on Trevor now.

                                BENNY
                  Hey, you ain't no real teacher.
                  Fool, you're nothin' but a sub.
                  T'ink yer so cool... You mus' be
                  'Mr. culo.'

     Scattered laughter. Trevor closes the sub folder and
     just looks at Benny.

                                TREVOR
                         (a cool curiosity)

                  you jus' go sit down and read yer

     Trevor just stands there, studies Benny.       A palpable
     beat.

                                  TREVOR
                  Are you done?

     There is dead silence as Benny stares Trevor straight in
     the eye. Trevor stares right back.

                                BENNY
                  Jus' gimme a referral.    Shit.

     Trevor turns and calmly walks back to the island counter,
     searches and finds a referral slip in one of the drawers,
     fills it out...

                                 TREVOR

                         (walks back
                           to Benny)
                  ... hopefully in an atmosphere of
                  mutual respect. This classroom is
                  our sanctuary, yours and mine.
                  Respect it.
                         (handing Benny
                           the referral)
                  For your information, I am a real
                  teacher.

                                BENNY
                  Whatever you say, Opie.

     Benny has a smirk on his face as he sashays past Trevor
     with the referral slip.

                                TREVOR
                  Okay, who would like to help me
                  pick up the books?

     Benny, a self-aggrandized exit, crumbles the referral
     slip and tosses it at Trevor, hitting him square in the
     back.

     Like a reflex, Trevor whirls and ducks.        Students laugh
     at his heightened reaction.

      Trevor sits by himself, lost in stirring a bowl of soup.
      He observes a talkative clique of teachers at the far end
      of the table, including Teacher #1.

      Now Dave Childress sits down, disrupting Trevor's
      solitude.

                                CHILDRESS
                  How goes the battle, Garfield?

      Dave bites into a messy sandwich as he skims the front
      page of a newspaper that someone left behind.

                  D'juh get that binky marsden farfied?

      Trevor doesn't say a word. Just keeps stirring his soup
      ... Now notices Ellen Henry as she enters and joins the
      food line.

                                CHILDRESS
                  Know what I think? I think that

                  Eskander doesn't know how to lock

      TREVOR'S POV - ELLEN AND CASHIER

      The cashier (Armenian girl, 15) is one of Ellen's
      students. As Ellen pays for a sandwich...

                                ELLEN
                  ... Come by the lab after school,

                  haven't been in a classroom in ten
                  years. They don't know shit. I

     Trevor shakes his head as Ellen Henry takes the empty
     seat at the end of the table, smiles at Trevor.

                  checked by the rules... then new

                                TREVOR
                  So why do you still teach?

                  Same reason as you, Garfield -- for
                  the paycheck.

     The windows and blinds are shut now.


37   INT. BUNGALOW #86 - CLOCK ON WALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION            37

     is inching toward the top of the hour.

     Closing their books and loading their knapsacks, the
     students talk and pay more attention to the inexorable
     march of time than to Trevor writing on an overhead
     projector.

                                TREVOR
                  Okay, someone tell me the
                  difference between the central
                  nervous system and the lymphatic
                  system?

     Rita Nartinez (the chola from the "utility" shed) sits
     near the front of the class. She wears her usual heavy
     eyeliner and a new nose ring.

                                RITA
                         (obscenely)
                  Mr. G, you gotta nice butt.

     Class erupts. Rita enjoys the attention.        Trevor turns
     and looks at her squarely.

                                TREVOR
                  You seem to be an expert on
                  anatomy, Miss --
                         (checks roster)
                  -- Nartinez. Central nervous
                  system and lymphatic system.
                  What's the difference?

                                RITA
                  ... Uh...

     Trevor doesn't expect anything remotely close to the
     right answer.

                                RITA
                  It's like the central nervous
                  system, that's your brain and
                  spinal cord, and the lymphatic
                  system, that's the stuff in your
                  blood that fights diseases.

     A beat.   Trevor looks up at her.

                                TREVOR
                  Very good.

     Trevor notices Cesar Sanchez writing on his desk.      Stevie
     cranes his neck to observe. Paco snoozes.

                                TREVOR
                  Cesar.

     Cesar throws back his head and jerks both hands from his
     desk top. Trevor walks up the aisle.

                                TREVOR
                  You writing on your desk?

                                CESAR
                         (coolly)
                  You see anything in my hands?
                         (displaying his
                          empty palms)
                  I don't think so.

     Trevor looks down at the tagging on Cesar's desktop. In
     one corner are the letters K-O-S, and below that the word
     "cartoon."

                                TREVOR
                  K-O-S, what's that? That a
                  tagging crew?

     Cesar shrugs with a big grin.

                                TREVOR
                  Cartoon... Is that you, Cesar?
                         (off no response)
                  'K-O-S' has something to do with
                  your friend Benny?

                                CESAR
                  ... Dawg. You're a sucker. K-O-S
                  stands for 'Kappin' Off Suckers.'
                  Don't disrespect my homeboy, Benny.
                  He don't like it. He don't like
                  you.

     Trevor dismisses Cesar's comments.

                                TREVOR
                  Do me a favor, Cesar. Go get a
                  paper towel from the counter and
                  wipe off your desk.
                         (beat)
                  And Mr. Littleton, please oblige
                  me and turn that tagger shirt
                  inside-out.

     Stevie wears a fusion T-shirt emblazoned with a giant
     spray can.

                                STEVIE
                         (refusing)
                  Hyland said it was okay, Sucker.

     Neither of them budge. Momentous deliberation. Now the
     BELL RINGS and the classroom empties in a matter of
     seconds. Cesar stares daggers at Trevor as he exits.

     Rita hangs back, the last one to leave.      She doesn't want
     anyone to see her talking to Trevor.

                  ... Apology accepted.

                  God forbid anyone should think
                  that.

     Rita flickers an awkward smile, turns and exits. The
     class empties and Trevor is left staring at the empty desks
     where Benny and Cesar sat... WHACK -- Trevor's reverie is
     broken by a BASKETBALL smashing against the side of the
     bungalow.


     POV - OUT THE WINDOW

     A group of boys grin mischieviously at the reaction they
     get from Trevor... continue smashing the ball against
     bungalows.


     TREVOR

     shifts his gaze from them to the venetian blinds framing
     the window... to the clock over his desk.

     as they open -- revealing the clock -- and just as
     suddenly close. TILT DOWN to find Trevor working the
     cords to the blinds he's rigged over the timeplace.

     A FAINT KNOCK breaks his spell as he glances up to
     discover Ellen Henry standing in the open doorway.

                                   ELLEN
                  May I come in?

                  Trevor.

     He sees her looking quizzically at the blinds he's rigged
     over the clock.

                                TREVOR
                         (explaining)
                  I'm making time a reward instead
                  of a distraction.

     Impressed, Ellen peruses the room now with a benign gaze.

                                ELLEN
                  Clever... Listen, I wanted to
                  apologize for jumping up like I
                  did at lunch. I was just feeling
                  a little weird...

                                   TREVOR
                  It's alright.

                  For what it's worth, Dave
                  Childress thinks you walk on
                  water.

                                TREVOR
                  Is that a good thing?

     Ellen flickers a grin, point taken.

                                ELLEN
                  I think it takes a lot of
                  courage to go back into a
                  classroom after something like
                  that.

                                TREVOR
                  Not if the only thing you ever
                  wanted to do was teach.

                                ELLEN
                         (smiles)

     WHACK -- the noise pulls Ellen's attention out the
     window where the boys play a rough game of BASKETBALL.

                                ELLEN
                  I assume you've met Benny Chacon?

                                TREVOR
                  I have.

                                ELLEN
                         (absently)
                  Last week Benny and his tagging
                  crew had Ms. Eskander pinned in
                  the corner over there.
                         (pointing)
                  ... She's seven months pregnant
                  and he's tormenting her with a
                  broom handle... Can I help you
                  with those?

     Trevor is trying to put some books on an upper shelf,
     but he's having trouble raising his arm high enough.
     Ellen sees he's in pain.

                                TREVOR
                  No thanks.

     She watches him struggle, then breaks the awkwardness.

                                ELLEN
                  So anyway, Gloria kicks Benny...
                  and if the district construes it
                  as assault and battery on a
                  student, she's gone.

                                TREVOR
                  They'd do that?

                                 ELLEN
                  In a heart beat. She's non-
                  tenured, they don't want to get
                  sued...
                          (with resignation)
                  Don't be surprised if she files
                  for stress leave by the end of
                  the week. Too bad, too. She's a
                  good teacher.

     WHACK... WHACK... Outside, the kids continue to play.
     The late sun makes their violent shadows swarm over Ellen.

                                ELLEN
                  Can I ask you a personal question?

                         (tentatively now)

                                TREVOR
                  Because I flunked him.

                                ELLEN
                         (sobered)
                  Is there any way you can see

                  When they say they wanna kill you,
                  you'd best take it serious. This
                  kid was an O.T. -- Opportunity
                  Transfer -- but nobody told me
                  until it was too late.

     A beat.

                                ELLEN
                  Did you know Benny's an O.T.?...
                  In less than a year he's been
                  convicted of felony assault and
                  suspended twice. I even testified
                  against him as a character witness.
                  Now I get to see him every day in
                  homeroom. I'm stuck with him.
                  Condition of his probation is
                  that he stay in school.

                                TREVOR
                  You talk to the principal?

                                ELLEN
                  Many times... Three weeks ago,
                  Garcia calls Benny's mother in for
                  a conference, but she refuses to
                  show up. She's afraid they'll
                  deport her because she's illegal.
                  So she contacts the A.C.L.U. and
                  some attorney tells her she
                  doesn't have to come in.
                         (still can't
                          believe)
                  Garcia got cold feet and dropped
                  the whole thing.
                         (fear building)
                  This kid's threatening me and all
                  he's worried about is a lawsuit.

                  What'd Benny say to you?

     Tears involuntarily well up in Ellen's eyes.     HOLD for
     an awkward moment as she collects herself.

                                ELLEN
                  That he wanted to hurt me.   Real
                  bad.

                                TREVOR
                  Does he know where you live?

                                ELLEN
                  I think so. Someone's been phoning
                  me at night and hanging up... Two
                  weeks ago, my car was broken into...
                  And last Friday, I think he was
                  inside my house... But I can't
                  prove it.

     The shadows of the basketball players rage inside the
     bungalow.

                                ELLEN
                         (bottom lip quivers)
                  ... I don't know what to do.

                                  TREVOR
                  You can quit.

                                  ELLEN
                  You didn't.

     OFF Trevor's severe gaze...


39   EXT. LA RIVER OVERPASS - NIGHT                                    39

     ... Trace the cold underbelly of the overpass. The glare
     of oncoming headlights flash overhead as we DISCOVER a
     tagging wall.

     CLOSER now...

     ... The wall is completely covered with graffiti. The
     centerpiece of the wall is a 5' by 10' multi-color
     "placa" that reads...

                                      K.O.S.

     ANGLING TO DISCOVER an Anglo tagger now as he defaces
     the "S" in K-O-S, covering it with his own piece.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

     Suddenly the lone tagger feels a presence at his back.
     He freezes. Now slowly turns to see...

     ... Benny, Cesar and Paco.

     Merely shadows. Benny lights a blunt, illuminating his
     face. Passes it to Cesar...

                                   TAGGER
                  Do I know you?

                                BENNY
                         (indicates tagging)
                  You should. You're fuckin' with
                  my piece, puto.

                                TAGGER
                         (nervously)
                  ... You from K.O.S.? No shit?

     Cesar and Paco burst into hysterical laughter which
     only manages to get Benny piqued.

                                TAGGER
                         (panicking)
                  Look, I didn't mean nothin'. Lemme
                  fix it. I can fix it. Okay?

     Cesar and Paco laugh harder.

                                BENNY
                         (to Cesar)
                  Eh, shut up, mojado!
                         (to Tagger now)
                  Don't mess wit' me, whiteboy.    I'll
                  cap yer ass.

     He pulls a .380 or a .25 automatic out of his pocket.
     Brandishes it at Cesar and Paco...

                                BENNY
                  I said shut up! Shut the fuck up!

     A BEEPER hooked on Benny's pants pocket BEEPS. Benny
     shuts it off. The Tagger sees his opportunity and makes
     a break for it. Without a second thought, Benny SHOOTS
     him in the leg. Tagger crumbles to the ground. Benny's
     really pissed now. Checks his beeper's glow-in-the-dark
     face for the message.

                                BENNY
                         (reacting to message)
                  I don't have no time to put up
                  wit' 'dis shit!

     Cesar and Paco attempt to subdue their laughter but
     fail...

                                BENNY
                  You think it's funny?!

     Benny lifts a pant leg.    Indicates his ankle monitor with
     the barrel of his gun.

                                BENNY
                  I don't call my P.O. in 15
                  minutes, I'm fucked.

     Venting rage, Benny walks up the wounded Tagger and
     STARTS SHOOTING (one hand high near his face, shooting
     downward). Now he kisses the crucifix on his rosary like
     a sick, distorted affectation.

                                BENNY
                  Dis is K.O.S.' neighborhood.

     Cesar and Paco laugh even harder now, falling all
     over each other. Benny storms off. He marches past a
     street lamp and is swallowed up by the night.


40   EXT. L.A. RIVER - NIGHT                                       40

     SUBJECT CAMERA FOLLOWING Benny. Oblivious that he's
     being followed, Benny walks at a steady pace. As we
     continue gaining ground on him, a SOUND UPCUT of
     TREVOR CALLING ROLL transports us to...


41   INT. BUNGALOW #86 - ON BENNY'S EMPTY DESK - NEXT MORNING      41

     Amid unresponsive cross talk:

                                TREVOR (O.S.)

     Trevor gazes opaquely at Benny's empty seat.

                                LAKESIA
                  I think he went AWOL, Mr. G.

42   EXT. VACANT DIRT LOT - AFTERNOON                              42

     An eight-year-old Hispanic kid pulls a red Flexi-Flyer
     wagon (laden with pop bottles and aluminum cans) across
     weeds and cracked earth.

     He suddenly stops and stares at something in the weeds.
     Snatches it up, studies it, and tosses it with everything
     else.

     SLOWLY MOVING IN ON the wagon now...

     ... thru a thin shroud of dust as it bangs and bumps
     along.

     Even CLOSER now on the last retrieved article... It's
     Benny's ankle monitor.


43   INT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS - "A" BUILDING - MAIN CORRIDOR -       43
     DAY (FIFTH PERIOD)

     Trevor emerges from Assistant Principal Ford's office and
     walks up the empty corridor, without breaking stride.

                                ELLEN (O.S.)
                      (muted)
               ... Trevor.

     Trevor retraces his steps back to the door of Ellen's
     plant-filled, personalized computer lab. Over the
     CLACKING of COMPUTER KEYS...

                             TREVOR
                      (quietly)
               Eskander filed for stress leave.
               They want me to finish out the
               semester.

                             ELLEN
               That's great...

                             TREVOR
                      (with humility)
               It's only 'til the end of the
               year.

                             ELLEN
               Listen, I never thanked you
               for letting me cry on your
               shoulder.

     Trevor flickers a conciliatory nod, now he averts his
     eyes.

                  That's okay.

                         (digressing now)
                  Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
                         (as Trevor shrugs)
                  Ford told me he hasn't phoned
                  his P.O. in four days.
                         (weighs guilt;
                          whispering)
                  You know what they say. Be
                  careful what you pray for. Don't
                  get me wrong, Benny's made my life
                  a living hell. I even moved back
                  in with my mother because of him.
                  I love my mother, but if I eat one
                  more dinner off a TV tray or watch
                  one more rerun of 'Wheel of
                  Fortune,' I think I'll lose my
                  fucking mind.

     Now an EGG TIMER RINGS O.S. on Ellen's desk.      Back into
     the classroom...

                                ELLEN
                         (to class)
                  Time's up. Everyone stop working.

     Realizing now that all the CLACKING COMPUTER KEYS have
     stopped moments ago. All eyes are fixed on Ellen and
     Trevor.

     ... Big knowing grins all around.

     Trevor, tie loosened. Ellen, in nylon stocking feet,
     leaning back against a couch. On the coffee table before
     them are dirty dishes and half-full wine glasses.
     Trevor's lost in a thin introspective smile.

                                ELLEN
                         (breaks the silence)
                  ... So you have a wife hiding in a
                  closet somewhere?

                          (smile widens)
                  No.   No wife.

                                ELLEN
                  Don't you ever get lonely?

     Trevor considers the question.

                                TREVOR
                         (genuinely)
                  Sometimes. There's this passage
                  in God's Lonely Man by Thomas
                  Wolfe where he says, '... The
                  whole conviction of my life rests
                  upon the belief that loneliness is
                  the central and inevitable fact of
                  human existence.' I believe that.

                                ELLEN
                  God that's depressing.

     They both laugh.

                  Especially after spending a year
                  in and out of a hospital, I
                  would guess.

     A beat.

                                TREVOR
                  Actually, that wasn't the toughest
                  part -- it's the robbery that's
                  been hardest to recover from.

                                ELLEN

     He offers a smile.        Ellen returns it.

                  They're still there. Everybody
                  around me seems to have given up.
                  They're all so beaten down. But
                  you're different. You refuse to
                  be beaten.

     Kindred souls.      Ellen fills her glass.

                  Remember the last time a student

                  ... That would have to be Daniel
                  Terrazas. This was last year
                  sometime. Kid was failing miserably
                  ... But he was the best Salsa dancer

                               ELLEN
                  No, no. He was a perfect
                  gentleman.

                                 TREVOR
                         (dryly)
                  Male teachers can't do things like
                  that. They get arrested.

                                ELLEN
                  Yep, double standard... By the way,
                  did you know Cesar Sanchez was
                  Special Ed?
                         (as Trevor shakes
                          his head)
                  Yep, he never should've been
                  mainstreamed. His I.E.P. says he's
                  L.H. but he acts more like S.E.D.

                                TREVOR
                  Severely Emotionally Disturbed...
                  that's great.

     A beat. Then Ellen gets up, wine glass balanced in her
     left hand.

                                ELLEN
                  Come on, Garfield -- on your feet.
                  Lemme teach you how to Salsa.

                                TREVOR
                         (resisting)
                  No, no, I'm no good at that.

     Ellen spins the tuner on the STEREO to a LATIN STATION
     and practically yanks Trevor to his feet.

                                 ELLEN
                  Let's go.   Don't play shy with me,
                  homeboy.

     Trevor grimaces, awkwardly relinquishes, as Ellen walks
     him through it.

                                 ELLEN
                         (still holding wine
                          glass)
                  That's it... Okay, follow me. It
                  starts on the one. Step forward
                  with your left foot... One. Change
                  weight on, two.

                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)
                  And three, feet
                  back together... Now do the same
                  in reverse, starting with your
                  right foot.
                         (talks their way
                           through)
                  One, two, three... One, two
                  three...

     Trevor concentrates. Up to speed now. Technically he's
     got it, he just needs to loosen up. Ellen suppresses a
     gleeful snicker. Now, Trevor attempts to cut loose.
     He spins Ellen once, into a tango step, one-two-three.
     Now an awkward dip, causing her glass to spill wine down
     the back of his shirt...

                                ELLEN
                         (horrified,
                          giggling)
                  Oh, my God... your shirt.   Oh, no,
                  I'm so sorry.

                                TREVOR
                         (self-conscious)
                  It's alright.

     He dashes toward the hallway bathroom.

                                ELLEN
                  Can I help?

                                TREVOR (O.S.)
                  Grab the baking soda outta the
                  fridge.

     In a flurry, Ellen rushes into the kitchen. Flips on the
     kitchen light, jerks open the refrigerator and locates
     the baking soda.

     FOLLOWING now, as she MOVES STEADILY FROM the kitchen TO
     the hallway bathroom...

48   INT. TREVOR'S - HALLWAY/BATHROOM                              48

     as Ellen steps into the doorway and lets out a startled
     gasp, dropping the box of baking soda.

     Trevor is bent over, scrubbing his shirt in the sink.
     His bare back and shoulders are scattered with brutal
     knife scars.

                                                             45.

49   EXT. MOTHER HENRY'S - AFTER MIDNIGHT                          49

     A tract house in the central San Fernando Valley.
     Trevor's Rambler is parked at the curb. The house is dark
     except for a porch light.

     Trevor and Ellen are greeted by Ellen's golden retriever
     Jack, who's chained to the front porch. JACK WHIMPERS,
     ready to bark.

                             ELLEN
               Don't start barking, Jack.

                             TREVOR
                      (petting him)
               Hey there, boy. You're a good
               dog. Yes, you are.

     Jack nuzzles up to Trevor, tail wagging furiously, no
     barking. Now Trevor stands and faces Ellen...

                             ELLEN
               Sorry for reacting the way I did
               back there.

                             TREVOR
               Don't apologize. That's how most
               people react.

                             ELLEN
               Didn't scare me. It just
               surprised me.

                             ELLEN
               ... Thanks for dinner.   I had a
               good time.

                             TREVOR
               You're welcome.

     Awkward silence. Trevor struggles with the urge to kiss
     her good night. They look at each other timidly for a
     moment. Now he moves to kiss her and she inadvertently
     adjusts her stance. The result is a kiss that doesn't
     quite hit her mouth. It's an awkward moment. Ellen
     feels horrible for him, desperately picks up a strange
     little plant by her feet.

                             ELLEN
               Here... you need a little life in
               that place of yours.

     Trevor takes it, smiles "thanks"...

                             TREVOR
               ... Good night.

50    INT. TREVOR'S BEDROOM - AROUND 2 AM                               50

      In the moonlit darkness. Trevor's abandoned bed. The
      sheets are twisted and damp. We TILT UP to see a digital
      clock at bedside reading 2:49 AM, and Trevor's sweat-
      panted figure moving down the hall in b.g.


51    EXT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - LOW ANGLE - TREVOR - NIGHT                  51

      madly pedaling TOWARD us on a bike. He wears running
      shoes, shorts and a Morehouse College sweat shirt and his
      face is contorted from the effort. He wipes sweat from
      his head, takes a gasping hit from his inhaler as CAMERA
      CRANES UP to reveal Trevor on a stationary bike in the
      back yard of his house, rapidly going nowhere.


52    INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE                                               52

      His sleepless night continues. Planted at his desk.
      Trevor corrects a stack of science papers, like a fervent
      prayer. Sun peeks through the window above his desk.

                                                        CUT TO:

53    INT. TREVOR'S BUNGALOW - DAY                                      53

      It's sweltering.    A single fan stirs the air.

      Amidst growing disorder, Trevor stands behind the front
      counter. AGENDA is written on the overhead as he
      flips through pages of a physical science text book.

      Rita's out of her seat, feeding the caged, white lab rat.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

     Cesar, with sunglasses and typical disregard, holds court
     in the back of the room. He and Stevie are high.

     Trevor eyes them, finds what he was looking for in the
     book...

                                TREVOR
                         (addressing class)
                  Since some of you seem to have an
                  interest in anesthetics, I've
                  prepared a little demonstration.

     Glances over at Rita now.    Checks the wall clock.

                                TREVOR
                  Rita, bring your friend in the
                  cage over here, please.

     Bringing the cage over...

                                RITA
                  His name's Snowball. Like 'dat

                         (snapping a look)
                  Shut up, Cesar.

                                TREVOR
                  You read Animal Farm, Cesar?

                                CESAR
                  No, but I fucked a sheep.

     Stevie and Paco love it.

                                 TREVOR
                  Cesar, come up here.
                         (gesturing)
                  I want you to have a front row
                  seat for this.

     Surprisingly, Cesar does what he's told as Trevor removes
     an old pocket watch from his briefcase and sets it next
     to Snowball's cage...

                                TREVOR
                  And remove the 'lokes.'

     Cesar removes his dark glasses.       His eyes are bloodshot
     and vapid.

                                TREVOR
                  Why your eyes so red?

                                 CESAR
                         (lying)
                  Mus' be pink-eye, sir.

                         (eyes Trevor's pocket
                          watch)
                  Nice watch, homes. Can I have it?

     Disregarding Cesar, Trevor opens a drawer and removes two
     latex surgical gloves from a cardboard box. He puts on
     the gloves and selects a petri dish from another drawer.

                                TREVOR
                         (pointing)
                  Rita, would you bring me a sugar
                  cube from the shelf over there?

     She does. Trevor now removes a small amber bottle
     (with an eye-dropper top) from his briefcase. The
     class starts to settle down now as Trevor pre-measures
     water in a pipette and adds it to the petri dish.

                                TREVOR
                         (referring to text)
                  Cesar, read Young's rule for us.
                  Page 564. At the top.

                         (like it's above him)

                  Rita, give Cesar your book.    Let
                  'im read.

     Rita places her book on Cesar's desk.

                                CESAR
                  Forget it.

     Jeers from the class, "Come on, read".       "Hurry up,
     Cesar."

                  'Young's rule...' Go on.

     Rita points to the passage in the book.        Cesar slaps her
     hand.

                  answer to me personally.

     Rita knits her eyebrows at Trevor.        Cesar laughs.

                                CESAR
                  You like her, Mr. G?

     Class erupts.

                  get along. C'mon, Cesar, read.
                  Please.

     At first Cesar doesn't budge.         Now grudgingly he looks

     Cesar heaves the book across the room: Class erupts,
     "Refer 'im," "Send 'im tuh Hyland." Trevor walks over
     and picks up the book. Class now settles. Watches
     Trevor closely to see what he's going to do. Trevor
     gazes at Cesar...

                  ... I say everyone deserves another
                  chance. Whadda you say, Cesar?

     Cesar knits his eyebrows, puzzled. Now Trevor walks over
     and sets the textbook down in front of Rita...

                                TREVOR
                  Rita, would you please read Young's
                  rule for me?

                                RITA
                         (hesitates and...)
                  ... 'Young's rule formulates
                  proper dosage levels for children
                  and adolescents.'

                                TREVOR
                  Thank you.

     Resume the lesson now.     Trevor indicates the amber bottle...

                                TREVOR
                  ... In the brown bottle I have a
                  prescription for liquid Demeral.

                                STEVIE
                  Where'd that come from, sir?

                                TREVOR
                  A doctor.

     Cesar grudgingly watches as Trevor places a measured drop
     of the liquid demeral into the petri dish and stirs the
     solution.

                                TREVOR
                  Demeral is a morphine sulphate...
                  and is soluble in water.

     Using the pipette, Trevor administers two drops of the
     demeral and water solution to the sugar cube, which he
     has placed inside Snowball's cage. As Snowball eats the
     sugar cube...

                                TREVOR
                  Young's rule says, divide the age
                  of the patient by the patient's
                  age plus twelve, giving us the
                  fraction of the adult dosage
                  suitable for the patient.

                  In Snowball's case, I've
                  calculated the dosage necessary
                  to tranquilize a one-year-old
                  child... then further divided
                  that fraction by 30, based on his
                  weight, to arrive at .002
                  milligrams.

     Having eaten most of the sugar cube, Snowball is rendered
     unconscious.

                                TREVOR
                  ... Don't worry, he'll be back to
                  normal in exactly 10 minutes.

     Trevor peers at his pocket watch.


54   INSERT - FULL SCREEN - TREVOR'S POCKET WATCH                   54

     The hour and minute hands read 2:40.    HOLD as we...

55   INT. BUNGALOW #86 - TEN MINUTES LATER                          55

     Trevor's pocket watch now reads 2:50...

                                RITA
                  ... He shoulda woke up by now?

     Snowball isn't moving. HOLD for an uncomfortably long
     moment ON the class, clustered around Trevor's desk.

     The class, for once, is completely silent. Beads of
     perspiration form on Trevor's upper lip as he
     resolutely watches the sleeping rat.

                                CESAR
                         (accusatory)
                  You just caught a murder case,
                  homes.

     Now Snowball begins to stir and the class reacts with
     scattered applause. A thin smile flickers across
     Trevor's face. As the BELL RINGS....

                                TREVOR
                  Okay, anyone who didn't finish
                  answering the questions on 246,
                  finish them for homework.

     As students head for the doors, he pulls off his latex
     gloves and looks for his pocket watch... but it's gone.

                                TREVOR
                  Hold it, Cesar.

     Cesar and Stevie are almost out the door.

                                TREVOR
                  Where's my watch?

                                CESAR
                         (urgently)
                  Hey, I gotta go. I ain't got no
                  watch.

                                TREVOR
                  Empty your pockets, both of you.

                                CESAR
                  Want me to break it down to you?
                  I gotta catch a bus.

     Cesar heads out the door.


56   EXT. BUNGALOW #86 - MOMENTS LATER                              56

     Trevor locks bungalow #86, picks up his briefcase, and
     along with the rest of the foot traffic, heads in the
     direction of the "A" building.


57   EXT. JQA - ON EDGE OF BUNGALOWS                                57

     As Trevor rounds a corner and runs smack into Ellen on
     the opposite side of a chain link fence.

                                TREVOR
                         (making excuses)
                  Sorry. I'm trying to catch Hyland
                  before he leaves.

     Trevor keeps moving.

                                TREVOR
                  I've been meaning to come by your
                  room.

                                ELLEN
                         (keeping it light)
                  ... It's almost been a week.   My
                  guess is you're avoiding me.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

     Trevor's tongue-tied. Now he removes the Proventil
     inhaler from his pocket, take an innocuous hit.

                                ELLEN
                  You okay?

     Trevor nods, sustains an awkward smile.

                                TREVOR
                  Has nothing to do with you, Ellen.
                  It's... hard for me...

     A struggle, fighting against his true feelings...

                                TREVOR
                  Pretty much been like that
                  since... you know, my accident.
                  Has nothing to do with you.

                                ELLEN
                  Is it because I'm white?

                                TREVOR
                  No.

     Trevor stares into her eyes, a soulful, searching gaze.
     Now he averts a self-conscious look.

                                ELLEN
                  We can still be friends.   Just don't
                  pull away.

     Trevor just looks at her.    Nods, somewhat bewildered.

                                ELLEN
                         (back to lighter note)
                  Now, can I ask you a favor? After
                  you're done with Hyland, can you
                  give me a ride to my car? It's at
                  the mechanics, about five or six
                  blocks up Lankershim. If you can't,
                  it's okay, I can walk.

                                TREVOR
                         (a little embarrassed)
                  ... I think I can manage that.

     Victor Sifuentes approaches now.

                                ELLEN
                  Que paso, Victor?

                  Mr. Garcia would like to speak
                  with you in his office.

     OFF Trevor's puzzled look...

59   INT. PRINCIPAL GARCIA'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON                      59

     A wall air conditioner...

     blows on Stevie and Cesar's sweaty backs. Trevor enters,
     shirt equally drenched in sweat. The dead silence is
     like that of a courtroom. MR. GARCIA, late forties,
     drawn, sits behind his desk...

     MR. HYLAND, stands in the outer office behind a glass
     partition, head lowered. Hyland flashes Trevor a
     defeated smile as we...

     Trevor coolly deciphers the situation.

     Garcia reaches down, switches on a portable tape recorder.

                                MR. GARCIA
                  You don't mind if I tape record
                  our conversation. Matter of
                  record. You understand.
                         (indicating
                          Mr. Hyland)
                  Of course, you know Mr. Hyland.

     Trevor weighs the situation.    Nods.

                                TREVOR
                  Am I being questioned?

                                MR. GARCIA
                         (beat)
                  Mr. Sanchez and Mr. Littleton tell
                  me you've accused them of stealing
                  your watch. If that's the case, I
                  need to address the accusation.

                  ... For the record, I primarily
                  suspect Mr. Sanchez. Although I
                  wouldn't be surprised if Stevie
                  was an accomplice.

                          Cesar and Stevie)
                  Beginning of sixth period, Cesar
                  admired the watch. I believe his
                  exact words were, 'Can I have it?'
                         (looks back to Garcia)
                  Either way, I'd like my watch back.

                                   MR. GARCIA
                  Anything else?

                                TREVOR
                  When I asked him to empty his
                  pockets, Cesar refused.

                                MR. GARCIA
                  Is that true, Mr. Sanchez?

                                CESAR
                  No way. He never asked me nothin'
                  like that! I don't go 'round
                  taxing no teachers...

                                 MR. GARCIA
                  Okay.   Calm down.

     With fervor now, Cesar turns his pockets inside out,
     emptying the contents (house keys and two dollars in
     change) onto Garcia's desk.

                                CESAR
                  ... I ain't got no watch, man.

                                MR. GARCIA
                  Mr. Littleton, may we see your
                  pockets too?

     Stevie empties his pockets now. Nothing but a twenty
     dollar bill and an empty pack of Marlboros.

     Trevor just stares at him.

                                TREVOR
                         (last try)

                  You're excused, gentlemen.   Take
                  your things. Thank you.

     The boys collect their belongings off Garcia's desk and
     shoot looks at Trevor as they exit. Now Garcia turns
     back to Trevor...

                         (unflinching pragmatism)
                  ... Let me try and explain
                  something. I try and think of
                  our students here at John Quincy
                  Adams like they're my clients.
                  I can't accuse anybody just on
                  your hunches. I need more than
                  that. I need facts.

                  couldn't afford on new clothes for
                  her son. Unfortunately we
                  considered the clothing gang
                  attire and sent the boy home.
                  That cost the district a quarter
                  of a million dollars.
                         (beat)
                  So I want you to be straight with
                  me, Mr. Garfield. Did you
                  physically see Cesar take your
                  watch?

                                TREVOR
                  No, I didn't...

                                MR. GARCIA
                  Do you have any witnesses who saw
                  him take it?

                                      TREVOR
                            (pause)
                  ... No.

                                MR. GARCIA
                  Unless there's reasonable cause to
                  show that Cesar, or Mr. Littleton
                  took your watch then I can't
                  authorize a locker search. I'm
                  sorry. Any concerns regarding my
                  decision, you can look up in the
                  handbook. It's section 628.1 of
                  the Education Code.

                  That was my grandfather's watch.
                  Can't you see what they're doing?
                  Weren't you ever a teacher?

                                MR. GARCIA
                  Afraid I never had the privilege.
                  Teaching and being a principal
                  don't necessarily go hand in hand,
                  Mr. Garfield.

     OFF Trevor's defeated gaze...


60   EXT. GARCIA'S OFFICE - MAIN CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON                60

     As Trevor and Hyland emerge from Garcia's office and walk
     steadily up the empty corridor...

                                 HYLAND
                         (sotto)
                  Is it me or is Garcia a real
                  asshole?

     Trevor doesn't respond, lost in thought.

                                TREVOR
                  I've been thinking about
                  videotaping my classes.

                                HYLAND
                  ... Yeah, well, here's some free
                  advice. Cover your ass.

     Trevor slides him a glance. They stop in front of
     Hyland's office door. He unlocks the door with a key...

                                HYLAND
                  If Garcia asks, your main purpose
                  is to observe you, not the
                  students. Excuse me, I mean his
                  `clients.'

     PHONE RINGS as they enter...


61   INT. HYLAND'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON                                61

                                HYLAND
                  Some gangbanger might think we're
                  violating his civil rights...

     Trevor weighs it as Hyland picks up the phone...

                  ... Yeah?

     Signals Trevor to take a seat.

                                HYLAND
                         (into phone)
                  Sorry, Iris. Completely forgot.

     INTERCUT Trevor as his eyes idly fix on an index card
     box (on Hyland's desk) labeled, "LOCKER COMBINATIONS."

     Hyland hangs up.

                                HYLAND
                         (to Trevor)
                  Yuh have a minute? Wanna talk to
                  you about our discipline committee.
                  Gotta run up to the office real
                  quick first.

     Trevor shifts his gaze back to Hyland.

                                TREVOR
                  Yeah, fine, go ahead.   I'll wait.

     Hyland rushes out and Trevor glances back at the index
     box. Momentous deliberation. Now he reaches over and
     carefully opens the small tin box. Methodically now, he
     flips through the file cards until he finds Cesar
     Sanchez's locker combination. Trevor's eyes scanning
     the information on the locker combination card. LOCKER
     #204. Combination sequence...08-24-53.


62   EXT. TRAFFIC SIGNAL - AFTERNOON                                  62

     Trevor's Rambler, with Ellen in the passenger seat, stops
     at a large intersection.

     As Trevor gets distracted by something he sees...

                                TREVOR
                  Never been to San Francisco.


64   EXT. RITA'S BUS STOP - TREVOR'S POV                         64

     At a right angle to Lankershim, down Magnolia Blvd., Rita
     Nartinez sits alone on a bus stop bench.

                                ELLEN (V.O.)
                  Oh, you should go sometime,
                  Trevor. I think you'd like it.
                  Really. It's only an hour by air.
                  Maybe five or six by car.
                  Completely different attitude
                  from L.A. Much more like a real
                  city... like Chicago or New
                  York...

     As Ellen continues talking we see a lowered blue Nissan
     mini-truck (with matching shell) pull up next to the bus
     stop. A cholo from the utility shed hangs out the
     passenger window and taunts Rita. Rita immediately
     stands and walks back down Magnolia.

     The mini-truck follows her in reverse. Rita halts and
     begins ranting at the cholo, waving her arms all around.
     Now she stomps away and the mini-truck drives away with a
     lurch.

                                ELLEN (V.O.)
                  ... Only problem is I hate to
                  leave Jack with my mother for any
                  extended period of time. I'm
                  afraid she'll forget to feed him
                  and he'll starve to death.


65   INT. TREVOR'S RAMBLER                                       65

     INTERCUT Trevor's distracted gaze.

                                TREVOR
                  If you want, I'll take care of
                  Jack.

                                ELLEN
                  I can't ask you to do that.

                                TREVOR
                         (straight at Ellen now)
                  Sure you can.

                                                              60.

66   INT. BUNGALOW #86 - AFTERNOON (NEXT DAY; FIFTH PERIOD)         66

     Trevor's conference period. He stands atop a ladder in
     the front of the room, drilling holes in the wall for a
     jerry-rigged camera mount. As he climbs down, Rita
     enters. Paces back and forth, wringing a clenched spiral
     notebook, English Comp. essay tucked inside...

                               TREVOR
                        (continues working)
                 ... Aren't you supposed to be at
                 P.E. fifth period?

                               RITA
                        (rants; kicks a desk)
                 ... Sunland Boyz gettin' crazy,
                 ol lady's... fucked up. Fuck dis
                 being down shit. I wanna do
                 somethin' wit' my life.

     A POLAROID PHOTO drops out of her notebook.     Trevor
     reaches down and scoops it up.


     INSERT - POLAROID PHOTO/DEAD GANG MEMBER IN CASKET

     Puppet... a young 16-year-old cholo, dressed in gang
     colors, laid out in an open casket.


     ON TREVOR

     Now as he hands the photo back to Rita.

                               TREVOR
                 ... You know this guy?

     Rita takes the photo back.    She doesn't want to talk
     about it.

                               RITA
                        (unravels now;
                         begins to cry)

     Rita collapses into a desk.

                                  TREVOR
                  Who's Quinn?    What's she teach?

                                  RITA
                  English Comp.    She's failin' me.

     Trevor tentatively picks up Rita's essay (branded with a
     big red "F") and begins reading it.

                                RITA
                  'Bitch say I don't talk right.

     Trevor scrutinizes her with a glance.        Now back to Rita's
     essay.

                                  RITA
                  She hates me.    She's racist
                  against me.

     Trevor sets the essay down on Rita's desk.        Regards her
     with genuine candor...

                                TREVOR
                  Just cause you're a Latina doesn't
                  mean everyone's racist against
                  you.

                         (prideful)
                  Hey, I'm a La Raza, prof-eh.

                                TREVOR
                  Okay... just stop blaming everyone
                  else. You're too smart for that.
                         (as Rita's rocked
                          back)
                  And every mistake in that essay is
                  fixable, okay? So relax, it's not
                  the end of the world.

     Rita collects herself, wipes the streaks of mascara
     running down her cheeks with her sleeve. Trevor studies
     her for a moment.

                                TREVOR

     counter.

                  You don't need it.

     She grabs a handful of tissues, dabs at her smeared
     mascara. Now her hair falls forward, exposing the back
     of her neck... and a tattoo that reads "Puppet" in
     a scrawling signature. She tosses her hair back and it
     disappears.

                         (shaking her head)
                  ... Somebody could see us.

                                TREVOR
                  All right then, I'll come to your
                  house.

                                RITA
                         (spontaneous and
                          decisive)
                  No... No way.

                                 TREVOR
                  Where then?   You name the place.

     The passing BELL for 6th period RINGS.       OFF Rita's torn
     gaze.


67   INT. BUNGALOW #86 - ON VIDEO CAMERA - SHORT WHILE LATER          67
     (6TH PERIOD)

     ... fully mounted now on the wall above the blackboard.


     NEW ANGLE

     Every eye in the class is riveted on the camera. SETTLE
     ON Cesar and Stevie seated in the back of the bungalow.
     OFF their malignant stares...

                                CESAR
                         (grumbling)
                  Dog, you invadin' my privacy.
                  Bitch.

                                 TREVOR
                          (remaining calm)
                  Cesar, would you come up here
                  please?

     Leveling a hard look, Cesar swaggers up to the island
     counter.

     Rita watches, a bated gaze, from her seat.

     Trevor motions for him to come around behind the counter.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

67   CONTINUED:                                                      67

     Now Trevor removes his grandfather's pocket watch from
     his briefcase and furtively dangles it for Cesar to
     see.

                                TREVOR
                         (calmly)
                  Since you were so concerned, I
                  though you might like to know... I
                  found my watch.

     Cesar glares at the watch, looks up at the video
     camera.

                                CESAR
                  ... You broke into my locker.
                  Dat's a serious felony, prof-eh.
                  You caught a case for sure now.

                                TREVOR
                  Whadda yuh propose to do, Cesar?
                  Tell Garcia?
                         (as Cesar weighs it)
                  Whadda yuh gonna tell 'im? That I
                  broke into your locker to steal
                  back the watch you denied taking?
                  I don't think so. I'd say we're
                  even now, wouldn't you, Cesar?

                                CESAR
                  No, I'd say we're just getting
                  started, ese.

     Cesar walks out. Trevor smiles innocuously. At a
     stalemate now. You can hear a pin drop. Suddenly
     the CRIES of an E.N.A.B.L. BABY break the palpable
     tension...


68   EXT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - 4 P.M.                                    68

     ... Trevor's Rambler is parked out front.


69   INT. TREVOR'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION                   69

     A stilted Rita, planted on the couch.    Wearing less
     makeup than usual.

     Her notebook and pens are laid out on the coffee table
     along with an old English grammar textbook. Trevor
     stands in the kitchen doorway...

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                         (self-consciously)
                  ... Coke's awright.

     OFF Trevor's mollifying nod...


70   INT. TREVOR'S KITCHEN - TREVOR                                     70

     A moment of self-examination as he pours a glass of Coke
     for Rita...

                                TREVOR
                         (to Rita offstage)
                  'Want you to know, you're not the
                  only one risking a reputation
                  here. Normally I don't tutor
                  students at my house.
                         (adds ice cubes)
                  Rita, maybe you can clear
                  something up. Can you explain
                  to me what machismo is all about?
                  Cuz this whole respect/code of
                  honor thing baffles me.


71   INT. TREVOR'S LIVING ROOM                                          71

     as Trevor approaches the couch, eyes focused on Rita's
     soda.

                                TREVOR
                         (preoccupied)
                  Ask yourself this question. Is
                  pride really that important?

     Now he looks up and freezes.    Quickly turns away.

     Rita, lying on the couch, completely naked.        Not sexual in
     the least. More like a distorted offering.         Or a patient,
     placidly waiting for her doctor.

                                TREVOR
                         (plainly)
                  Put your clothes on, Rita.

     An awkward moment. Chagrin becomes repressed sobs as
     Rita picks up her pile of clothes off the floor and gets
     dressed. This is one fucked-up little girl.

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                         (affected)
                  No harm done... Don't cry now.

     Fully dressed again, remotely staring, Rita holds back
     tears. Trevor sits down on the couch next to her. Opens
     textbook.

                                TREVOR
                  Why don't you go ahead and copy
                  the first rule there for the verb
                  'to be.' Can you do that for me?

                                RITA
                         (hiccups a sob)
                  I jus' wan'ed to thank you.

                                TREVOR
                  You don't have to thank me, I'm
                  your teacher.

     Rita opens her notebook and begins to copy the rule. She
     wipes at the tears with the sleeve of her baggy sweat
     shirt. Trevor resists the urge to comfort her.

                                TREVOR
                  ... From now on I think the best
                  thing for us to do is meet in the
                  library.


72   INT. TREVOR'S BEDROOM - THAT EVENING (MAGIC HOUR)              72

     Trevor kneels at the foot of his bed. Fully dressed,
     shirt and loosened tie. Glimpses up at the crucifix on
     the wall. Bows his head again...

                                TREVOR

     BOOMING DOWN FROM the Blythe St. sign...

     A cement barricade covered in graffiti chokes off street
     traffic.

     ... Crack dealers and gangbangers freely wander the rows
     of clapboard tenements, kids throwing sneakers, bangers
     drinking from glass bottles.

     Now apartment 105 (Cesar Sanchez's).

     MOVING IN ON the MUTED sounds of an ARGUMENT (in Spanish).


74   INT. APARTMENT 105 - CONTINUOUS ACTION                       74

     Dingy. Yellowing walls. Cesar and his mother continue
     their arguing as Cesar watches first the "Animaniacs" and
     switches channels to "The Deer Hunter," while his BABY
     SISTER CRIES in her high chair.

     MRS. SANCHEZ is older looking than her thirty-four years.
     Clutching her purse...

                 MRS. SANCHEZ                                          *

     Cesar yells at his SISTER to stop CRYING...

     In a rage, Cesar digs into his pocket and throws twenty
     dollars in his mother's face. She cowers.

                 CESAR                  (subtitlesHere, I don't

     They're interrupted by a KNOCK at the front door.

                                CESAR
                         (indicating door)

     Cesar plops down on an old worn out recliner and goes
     back to watching "Animaniacs" on the TELEVISION.
     ROSILLO STOPS her CRYING and Mrs. Sanchez carefully
     gathers the money scattered at her feet.


75   INT. APARTMENT 105 - FRONT DOOR                                    75

     Behind the screen door, a silhouette fills the doorway.

     MOVING IN ON CESAR.

     He can faintly hear the O.S. conversation as he watches
     TV.

                 MRS. SANCHEZ                                                *

     SANCHEZ

     PIVOTING now to see Trevor enter the front door.

     Cesar glares with flint-hard eyes at Trevor.

                                  TREVOR
                  Hello, Cesar.

     Breaking his unrelenting stare, Cesar now squeezes past
     Trevor and out the screen door, slamming it behind him.

     Mrs. Sanchez cradles Rosillo in her lap.

                 MRS. SANCHEZ                                              *

     ROSILLO begins to CRY again...

                  MRS. SANCHEZ           (subtitlesGod, but there          *

     Suppressing her emotions, she comforts her baby. Trevor
     weighs a vacuous stare. Now he notices a bruise under Mrs.
     Sanchez's hairline, above her left eye.

                  TREVOR

     Overcome with shame, she attempts to cover the bruise.

                 Nada... es nada.


78   EXT. BLYTHE STREET PROJECTS - EVENING                            78

     Steadfast and unflinching, Trevor beats a path back to
     his car, parked outside the barricade. Cesar now appears
     from nowhere. Carries a '40 ouncer' in a paper bag.
     He's been drinking.

                               CESAR
                        (venting rage)
                 Puto! You lied to Benny. You
                 said you don't speak no Spanish!

                 No I didn't.

                               CESAR
                 'At's bullshit!

                               TREVOR
                 Enjoy hitting your mother, Cesar?
                 You must be proud of yourself.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

     A handful of gangbangers, drinking and loitering
     around Trevor's car, sharpen their stares and listen
     intently. Cesar grows nervous.

                                CESAR
                         (to gangbangers)
                  ... He's lyin', man.
                         (at Trevor)
                  Fuckin' liar! Homeboy don't
                  never disrespec' his mother.
                  Never. You hear me, joto?!

                                TREVOR
                  Whatever you say, Cesar.

     Trevor steps around the gangbangers and climbs into
     his car...

                                 CESAR
                  I'll find out where you stay.
                  Trucha, homes!

     As the Rambler drives away Cesar heaves his 40 ouncer at
     it. Shatters all over the pavement.

                                CESAR
                  Valla ala chingada!

     Cesar stands in the middle of the street, throwing hand
     signs.


79   EXT. PARKING LOT/BUNGALOW #86 - NEXT MORNING                   79

     Trevor approaches, via the parking lot, through a gate in
     a chain-link fence. ADJUST the ANGLE now to discover
     first period students mobbing the open doorway of
     Bungalow #86.

                                TREVOR
                         (pushing through)
                  'Scuse me. What's going on?
                         (and)
                  Lakesia, who opened the door?

                                LAKESIA
                  It was like that when I got here.


80   INT. BUNGALOW #86 - CONTINUOUS ACTION                          80

     Trevor squeezes through the doorway to find Dave Childress
     pacing the bungalow, assessing the damage. VIDEO CAMERA
     (AND HOUSING) are scattered in pieces all over the floor.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                               71.

     One of the windows is smashed-in. A serpentine trail of
     BLACK SPRAY PAINT encircles the entire room. Provocative
     epithets tag the walls... "Pinche madre", "Puto" and "Fuck
     you G!"

                                CHILDRESS
                  Whoever did this is gonna pay!
                  Better believe it, ese(s).

     A curious stream of students fill the room now.     Childress
     vents his anger at them...

                                CHILDRESS
                         (crazed now)
                  Get the hell outta here!

                  Barsek, don't touch anything,
                  okay?

                                  CHILDRESS
                  Get out!!

     And now Snowball... as Barsek discovers him... Lifeless.
     Impaled by a pair of scissors on the front counter.

                                BARSEK
                         (an incredulous,
                          sickened laugh)
                  Oh, damn. Lookit the rat.

     OFF Trevor's stricken gaze...

     Childress snaps. He grabs Barsek by the throat. The
     crowd scatters, students tripping over each other to get
     out of the bungalow.

                                CHILDRESS
                  Think it's funny?! Huh?!       Yuh
                  little fuck!

     Trevor attempts to separate Childress from Barsek...

                                  TREVOR
                  Dave!   No!   Let go of 'im!

                            (choking)
                  Nooo...

     Trevor pries them apart. Barsek crumbles to the floor,
     gulping for air and scurrying out of the bungalow on his
     hands and knees.

                                TREVOR
                  He didn't do anything.    He's a
                  good kid.


81   EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD - MORNING (NUTRITION PERIOD)                81

     ESTABLISHING the different student factions.

     MUSIC, playing over a PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM, fills the
     quad.

     Trevor, now an interloper, crossing the senior lawn,
     openly searching for Cesar.

     Tag-bangers, a clique of eight or nine K.O.S. wanna-be(s).
     Feature PACO (16) as they take quick hits off a blunt.

     Now Cesar extinguishes the blunt with his fingertips and
     hides it as Trevor wanders into their midst.

                                TREVOR
                         (glances around;
                          sniffs)
                  Been smokin' the chronic, Cesar?

                                CESAR
                         (a smirk)
                  I'm hooked on phonics... not
                  'hooked on chronic.'

     Laughs all around.

                                TREVOR
                         (not amused)
                  You wouldn't happen t'know who
                  vandalized bungalow eighty-six
                  last night?

                                CESAR
                         (feigning ignorance)
                  You guys know anything about that?

                  Sorry, maestro... nada.

                  Garcia may not think there's
                  enough here to prove anything.
                  But you and I both know who's
                  responsible. Don't we?

                                 CESAR
                  Whadda you, a narc? Seriously, I
                  don't know what the fuck you're
                  talkin' about.

     Trevor maintains his fervent demeanor. Now he notices
     the ring on Cesar's right index finger.


     INSERT - CESAR'S RING

     emblazoned with a green marijuana leaf.

                                TREVOR
                         (pointing)
                  The ring, Cesar... lemme have it.

     Cesar dramatically jerks back his finger.

                                CESAR
                  Watch it, eh... that's my trigger
                  finger.

     As Cesar, with purpose, aims an invisible gun at Trevor...

                                TREVOR
                  It's inappropriate attire...

                                CESAR
                  ... Bang.

                                TREVOR
                         (momentous
                          deliberation)
                  ... Are you finished?

     Cesar starts to laugh.    A crowd begins to gather.

                                CESAR
                  What? Finished with what?   Don't
                  get crazy on me, dude.

     The boisterous crowd escalates... hoots and hollers.

     After weighing the situation, Trevor exchanges palpable
     looks with Cesar.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                74.

     Now he reluctantly back-pedals, squeezing his way past
     the wall of bodies pressed in behind him.

     His departure across an empty lawn is accompanied by a
     hail of "boos" and taunts.

                         (flirtatious)

                         (baffled)
                  Trevor...

     The light changes to green. An impatient young man in
     the car behind them BEEPS his HORN. Lays it on a little
     too long.

     Trevor snaps.


85   EXT. INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT                      85

                  Can't you see I'm talking to the

                  Here, boy... here, Jack.   Come to
                  Mommy, sweetheart.

     The glare of the flashlight fixes on the trunk of the
     olive tree.

     Jack's chain stretching tautly toward the back alley.

     Trevor and Ellen, propelled now toward the alley, hearts
     pounding, frantically rushing toward the conclusion as
     the flashlight traces the length of the chain...

     The chain disappears over the top of the alley wall.
     Trevor kicks open the alley gate and freezes.

     Trevor holds her back. She unleashes her torment, punching
     and kicking until fully spent, crumbling to her knees now,
     sobbing hysterically.

                                ELLEN
                  ... Jack.

     HOLD ON her fitful sobs, and...

                                                       CUT TO:


92   EXT. TREVOR'S HOUSE - IN ALLEY - THAT NIGHT                       92
     (APPROXIMATELY AN HOUR LATER)

     Trevor, a beaten hypnotic gaze, watches as an ANIMAL
     REGULATIONS OFFICER fatefully slams the cargo door of his truck.

                                ANIMAL REGULATIONS OFFICER
                  Don't beat yourself up too much.
                  It was an accident. He was probably
                  after a cat... or someone walked
                  past back here in the alley.
                  Whatever it was, he jumped over the
                  fence. What can you do?

     Ellen watches Trevor's house; behind a screen door.


93   INT. TREVOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     93

     Ellen sits on Trevor's bed, fighting back tears.

     Trevor enters with a glass of water and a pill.     Sits
     down on the edge of the bed.

                                TREVOR
                         (offering pill)
                  It's aspirin...

                                ELLEN
                         (refuses it)
                  ... I can't talk to you right now,
                  Trevor. Please. I'm so upset I
                  can't even drive. I just need some
                  time alone.

     Trevor acquiesces. Steps over to his desk and sets the
     glass of water down. A key protrudes from one of the desk
     drawers. He leans over, removes the key and plays with it
     for a moment.

                         (beat)
                  I know about what's not fair. I
                  left part of my lung in a damn
                  hospital because some gangbanger
                  didn't like the grade I gave him.

                  your taxes. Things still go bad.
                         (eyes flicker)
                  I'm so sorry, Ellen.

     Ellen shuts her heavy eyelids now.    Shuts out the world.


94   EXT. ALLEY BEHIND TREVOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT                      94

     A thorough investigation now at the foot of Jack's
     wall...

     ... Trevor's flashlight fixes on a faint set of shoe prints
     in the dirt.

     Waffle-soled Doc Martens.    He follows their trail, down
     the alley.

     Hesitating at the wall again. He now focuses his
     flashlight beam on a smattering of graffiti... and
     discovers a fresh tag...

     In black spray paint, the letters K.O.S. Trevor reaches
     out and touches a coagulated trickle of paint. As he
     inspects the faint residue on his fingertip...

96   EXT. FREEWAY UNDERPASS - LATER THAT NIGHT                     96

     About 2 a.m.    The street's empty.

     Cesar's darkened apartment is tucked away in the
     distance. Now a lone figure emerges and beats a path
     through the projects... CLOSER now... it's Cesar. White
     T-shirt, sagging gray dickies...

     FOLLOWING HIM now... as he crosses the edge of a dirt
     lot. FOCUSING ON his Doc Marten boots and their waffle-
     soled print...

97   EXT. FREEWAY UNDERPASS - NIGHT                               97

     Merging with Cesar as he slinks down the dark alley
     corridor. Lighting a blunt off his Zippo lighter...

98   FURTHER DOWN                                                 98

     Cesar spray paints a wall with a can of black enamel paint.
     He takes another hit. Chokes down a shit-eating grin. And
     admires his work... a goofy dog smoking a blunt.

     ... below the dog he scrawls the word, "CARTOON." Above
     it, "K.O.S. As he slips the spray can into his front
     pocket, he senses a presence..

                               CESAR
                 ... 'At you, Stevie?

     Profound silence. Grin dissolves. Riveted, Cesar takes
     another slow hit off his blunt. Suddenly a coyote darts
     past him.

                               CESAR
                        (startled)
                 ... Hells, man. Stupit dog.

     His sick smirk returns. But only momentarily. Now a
     premonitory flicker registers on his face. He blinks as
     a Masai arrow splits the darkness and pierces his left
     pectoral muscle.

     Exhaling a stunned breath, Cesar looks down at the arrow.
     An incredulous, stupefied laugh escapes him as he pulls
     the arrow out of his chest and studies it...

     The normal length of the arrow's been shortened by half
     and the tip has been fitted with a modified hypodermic
     needle. (The needle extends from a rubber stopper which has
     retracted into the hypodermic casing, causing the
     solution in the hypo to jettison through the needle and
     into Cesar).

                               CESAR
                 ... Mutha fuck.

     Now back-pedaling, stumbling, dropping the arrow, he
     turns and runs off.


99   EXT. FREEWAY UNDERPASS                                       99

     Cesar collapses onto a pile of garbage bags. MOVING IN.
     His eyes fixed and dilated. Forehead beaded with
     perspiration. Fighting against the effects of the
     injection...

     Now blackness...

      1   8   7 - Rev. 7/10/96                                     80.

100   INT. TREVOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (3 AM)                               100

      Ellen awakens with a start.

      She glances about, momentarily disoriented.      Now she
      remembers where she is and what happened.

                                 ELLEN
                   Trevor?

      No response.    Choking back emotions.


101   INT. TREVOR'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                  101

      TV SET ON.    Ellen enters, glances around.     No Trevor.

                                 ELLEN
                   Trevor?


102   INT. TREVOR'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER                              102

      As Ellen returns. She notices the glass of water on the
      desk. Bravely collects herself. Crosses over to the
      desk and sits down.

                                 ELLEN
                   ... Where'd you put the aspirin?

      Like an involuntary reflex she tugs on the center drawer
      of the desk, but it's locked. Now she pulls on one of
      the side drawers and it slides open. Ellen stops at what
      she sees...

      ... a treasure-trove of homemade shivs, Bic lighters,
      Walkmen, pagers... and Benny Chacon's black rosary beads.

      BACK TO Ellen and her curious, sobered look.      Now she slowly
      shuts the drawer.

103   INT. TREVOR'S FOYER - A SHORT WHILE LATER                          103

      Fumbling in her purse for her keys, Ellen makes a hasty
      departure.

      Almost six AM. Encroaching sunlight creeps toward the
      horizon. A vapid stillness. Not a soul stirs.

      Eyes feverish, registering pain. His head throbs. He
      begins to move and discovers a pounding in his right
      hand...

      ... Lifting his hand up in front of his face.    Cesar's
      ring index finger has been severed clean off.    Blood is
      everywhere.

      Cesar emotes a silent panic-stricken scream. Reduced to
      a snot-sobbing wreck, he frantically searches the ground
      on his hands and knees...

                                CESAR
                   My finger. Please, somebody help

      Cesar now in a wheelchair, right hand completely wrapped
      in gauze. He pleads with two police DETECTIVES...

                   then chopped off your finger.
                   Come on, you can do better than

      Picks up the envelope and reads the name typed across the
      face of it... CESAR SANCHEZ... narrowing her gaze as she
      opens the envelope.

      In the envelope, Cesar's severed finger, nesting in a
      clump of newspaper.

      Appears to be something tattooed across the side of it
      but we can't quite make it out.

      The Nurse gasps and drops the envelope, spilling the

                           fingers now)
                   ... And don't forget the phalanges.

      Fingers shoot up and wiggle on cue...

                                 CLASS
                          (in unison)
                   Phalanges, phalanges, phalanges...

      Scattered laughter and groans at this embarrassing
      routine...

      Cesar's beaten gaze remains riveted to his book. Now he
      slides a look at the "R-U-DUN" tatt on his right index
      finger. The severed finger has been sewn back on,
      supported by a finger brace.

      Stevie openly stares at the back of Trevor's head as
      Trevor passes by in the aisle.

      Ellen sits behind her computer, lost in a grading
      program...

      Trevor now enters.    Damp hair and shoulders.

                                    TREVOR
                   May I come in?

      Ellen stops what she's working on.

                          (reticently)

                                 ELLEN
                   I was going to ask you the same
                   thing.

                                 TREVOR
                   ... I went for a run.

                   ... Can't tonight. Maybe another
                   time.

                   better. Today, for the first time
                   since I took over for Eskander, he
                   actually did his work.

      A tacit satisfaction that all is well...

                                 TREVOR
                   ... I really am sorry about Jack.

      He exits now leaving Ellen alone with her thoughts.


112   INT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS SCHOOL LIBRARY - MORNING                 112

      Before school tutoring session. The minute hand on the
      wall clock jerks ahead one minute... 7:23 AM.

      Trevor and Rita at a table near the back of the library.
      Trevor gazes blankly at Rita's essay. Rita revises one
      of the pages.

      INTERCUT Dave Childress at the front counter as the
      librarian (late fifties) photocopies a page from a
      history book for him. Childress scrutinizes Trevor and
      Rita as he waits.

      Satisfied now, Rita slides the page to Trevor...

                                   RITA
                   ... Finished.

      Trevor blinks himself back to reality...

                                 TREVOR
                   ... Let's hava look..

      He adjusts his glasses.      Pores over the paper...

                                 TREVOR
                   ... Good.
                          (deliberating)
                   ... I was just thinking, since
                   your essay's about gangs and
                   getting away from their influence,
                   you probably could've left some of
                   those double negatives you like so
                   well.

                                 RITA
                          (confused)
                   So now you wan' me to use bad
                   grammar.

                          (explaining)
                   Only if it suits your topic.

                                 RITA
                   I know. We're all products of our
                   environment 'n' shit.

                                 TREVOR
                   No, I think that's just an excuse.
                          (beat)
                   I say if we're strong, we can rise
                   above adversity.
                          (lets it sink in)
                   But it's like rap or hip-hop...
                   Correct all the grammar and it
                   loses its impact.

                                 RITA
                   So you like hip-hop, Mr. G?

                                  TREVOR
                          (shakes his head)
                   ... I hate it.

                                 RITA
                          (reacting)
                   What kinda black man are you?

      Trevor bursts forth a laugh.

      Childress perks up at the front counter.

      Trevor's laugh evokes a smile from Rita.      Now she pries
      a little further...

                                 RITA
                   Why you here anyways? Don't you
                   got nothin' better t'do?

                                 TREVOR
                   ... Everything I wanna do is right
                   here.
                          (back on track now)
                   It's a good essay, Rita. You put
                   a lot of effort into it, it shows.

                                 RITA
                          (a laconic grin)
                   Comes from the heart, maestro.
                   I'm a writer... not a fighter.

      Trevor returns a cognitive flicker.

                   fronna all those people and make
                   a fool outta myself.

                                  TREVOR
                   Why not?   It'd be a Pyrrhic
                   victory.

      OFF Rita's reluctance...


113   EXT. LOS ANGELES RIVER/SEPULVEDA DAM BASIN - AFTERNOON         113

      A churning fist of muddy water cuts a path along the
      perimeter of a golf course and jogging trail.

      TRACING jogging trail, KEEPING PACE now with a die-hard
      runner. Something registers in the runner's eyes, pace
      slowing, now stopping. Not fully comprehending what he
      is looking at...

      FOLLOWING HIS GAZE... THROUGH a curtain of rain and tall
      swamp grass... along the riverbank... TO the base of the
      Burbank Boulevard Overpass.

      SLOWING ANGLE to discover precariously jutting out of the

                                 ELLEN
                   ... Before getting side-tracked
                   with viruses and T-S-R programs,
                   we were talking yesterday about
                   E-Mail.

      INTERCUT Stevie. Ellen passes Stevie's computer as
      he shares cryptic information with a kid sitting next
      to him.

      Ellen approaches her computer console on wheels at
      the front of the class.

                                 ELLEN
                   If you click-on the mail icon in
                   your tray, you'll be ready to
                   send and receive mail. My
                   computer's already set-up.
                   Everyone go ahead and click the
                   white envelope in the lower...

      Ellen's interrupted by her own computer. A little white
      envelope icon in the lower left hand tray flashes and
      BEEPS. Now a COMPUTER VOICE announces: "You've got mail."

      Ellen's taken aback.    Class titters.   Now she grins.

                                 ELLEN
                   Looks like someone's way ahead of
                   me. Alright.
                          (adapts and
                           demonstrates)
                   To retrieve your mail simply double
                   click the top item in your mail
                   list.
                          (as she does)
                   Since we're all a part of the
                   same network, we share mail... so
                   go ahead and do that.

      The message read:    TEACHER FUCKS NIGGERS

      Class is dumbstruck. Ellen's riveted. Now she turns.
      Without losing her temper, she scours the class with
      a narrow gaze.

      Class starts to buzz.    Now a clicking frenzy to retrieve
      the same message.

      The anonymous message pops up on computer screens all
      around the classroom.

      Ellen's POV of students (and Stevie). Deciphering
      reactions. LINGERING ON Stevie's poker face.

                   Whoever sent that message isn't
                   as anonymous as they think.

      Ellen turns to her console, clicks the REPLY button.    A
      new mail message window opens up. It's addressed to
      the anonymous sender, STUDENT #00. Ellen types in:

                                 GO TO THE OFFICE

      All the while anticipation builds on Stevie's face.    He
      glances around, starting to get nervous.

      Ellen now clicks the SEND button...

      Stevie's COMPUTER BEEPS...    COMPUTER VOICE:   "You've got
      mail..."

      ... A window opens in the middle of Stevie's monitor
      revealing Ellen's return message.

      Class erupts and Stevie springs out of his seat...

                                 STEVIE
                   'Dat's bullshit, man!

      He rushes up to the front of the class.

                                 STEVIE
                   You best step off, Ms. H. Cuz
                   you can't prove nuthin'. And I
                   know you can't afford to lose
                   'dis minimum wage job 'a yers.

                   You're right, Stevie. I can't
                   afford to live in a big house
                   south of the boulevard. Like
                   you do.

      Class erupts again, coming down on Stevie and his wanna-be
      poor boy from the streets image. They're laughing at him
      now, not with him. In a rage, Stevie kicks open the
      hallway door and exits the classroom.

                                    ELLEN
                             (reacting)
                   Sue me.

      Teacher #1 exits in a flurry. Ellen now glances to her
      right. Seated there in rigid silence is BENNY CHACON'S
      MOTHER (51).

                                 IRIS
                          (offers; sotto)
                   Benny Chacon's mother. Told
                   'er Garcia had to leave early
                   today but she jus' sits there.
                   She been saying some pretty
                   crazy things.

      Mrs. Chacon begins speaking Spanish in plaintive spurts.
      Ellen can't decipher what she is saying...

                                 ELLEN
                          (to Mrs. Chacon)
                   ... Espanol, muy poquito, senora.
                          (beat)
                   Mrs. Chacon... you have to slow down.
                          (back to Iris)
                   What's she saying?

      Hesitating.    Now with apprehension...

                                 IRIS
                   You heard 'bout that body they foun'
                   in the L.A. River... She says she
                   thinks it's Benny.

      OFF Ellen's unblinking gaze...


116   EXT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY CORONER'S OFFICE (DOWNTOWN) -          116
      EVENING

      A concrete fortress... Ellen and Mrs. Chacon approach.

                                                               92.

118   INT. ASSISTANT CORONER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION            118

      Ellen and Mrs. Chacon sit stiffly in front of the
      ASSISTANT CORONER (mid-forties). Desk cluttered. Half-
      eaten sandwich in front of him. He nurses a Styrofoam
      cup of coffee as he flips through a John Doe folder.

                              ASST. CORONER
                You say he's been missing
                approximately four weeks?

                              ELLEN
                ... Four, almost five weeks.

                              ASST. CORONER
                That's a long time. Lots a
                things happen to a body after
                four or five weeks. Makes it
                difficult to I.D.

      A faint, incongruous smile.

                              ELLEN
                       (indicating John Doe)
                So he just sits here?

                              ASST. CORONER
                We keep 'um up to thirty days.
                Lady, we get 80, sometimes 90 Does
                a month. Floaters, gangbangers,
                illegals, junkies. Most of 'um
                cheap homicides. Nobody's even
                lookin' for 'em.
                       (indicating folder)
                This guy here, has a dent in his
                head. Could be post-mortem
                trauma. Probably hit a retaining
                wall on his way down river after
                that rain we had. Who knows.
                       (beat)
                Yuh ask me, this kid was dead
                before he got his head caved in.
                Overdose by morphine. That's what
                it looks like t'me.

      Ellen weighs it. Assistant Coroner now refers to some
      sort of questionnaire.

                              ASST. CORONER
                On the phone you said the mother
                mentioned some identifying marks.

      Ellen refocuses a far-off, introspective gaze.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                93.

118   CONTINUED:                                                      118

                                 ELLEN
                          (affirmative)
                   She said he has some pockmarks on
                   his chest; from a bad case of
                   chicken pox. And there's a bar-
                   code tattoo on his neck.

      A cognitive flicker now as the Assistant Coroner sets
      down his coffee...


119   INT. AUTOPSY ROOM - EVENING                                     119

      The acrid fecal smell causes Ellen to flinch. Averting
      her eyes, she holds onto Mrs. Chacon's arm as they stand
      next to the autopsy table. A plastic diaphanous sheet
      covers the body.

      Now the Assistant Coroner raises the sheet...

      Mrs. Chacon's traumatic gaze confirms her worst fears.
      She raises a hand to her mouth. Now the tears come...

                                 MRS. CHACON
                   ... Benito.

      As she comforts Mrs. Chacon...

                                  ELLEN
                          (to Assistant Coroner;
                           sotto)
                   Did you find any rosary beads with
                   the body?

                                 ASSISTANT CORONER
                   No.


120   INT. TREVOR'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT                        120

      ... The digital clock next to Trevor's bed reads:
      2:14 a.m.

      Trevor sleeps. HOLD for a portentous moment. Now the
      stillness is broken by a CLATTER at the front door.
      Someone enters the house. Trevor awakens. Jolts out of
      bed. Disoriented a beat.


121   INT. TREVOR'S HALLWAY                                           121

      In boxer shorts and a T-shirt, adjusting his glasses,
      Trevor ventures through darkness...

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                               94.

121   CONTINUED:                                                     121

                                 TREVOR
                   ... Who's there?

      A light flickers on in the living room.

                                 ELLEN (O.S.)
                   You should keep your door locked.

      ADJUSTING the ANGLE now as the living room comes INTO
      VIEW...

      Ellen paces back and forth, consumed by what's troubling
      her.

                                 TREVOR
                          (still half asleep)
                   What's the matter?

      Ellen ignores his question.

                                  ELLEN
                          (impaling him with
                            a look)
                   I just want you to tell me one
                   thing...

      Now something she sees stops her pacing...

      ... The black rosary beads on the dinner table.

                                  TREVOR
                           (off Ellen's
                            puzzled look)
                   What?

      Following her gaze, he picks up the rosary beads.    As he
      places them in a drawer in the credenza.

                                  TREVOR
                   What is it?

      Ellen's confused.     Lost in a fixated gaze.

                                 ELLEN
                   ... If you had any idea what I've
                   been thinking lately... you'd
                   think I was crazy.
                          (running it through
                           her mind)
                   ... Remember that John Doe they
                   found in the L.A. River. Turned
                   out it was Benny.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                                 95.

121   CONTINUED:                                                       121

                          (impacted)
                   Who told you that?

                                 ELLEN
                   ... Benny's mother identified the
                   body.

      Trevor just looks at her, a bated pause.       Now he blinks.

                                 TREVOR
                   Benny was no saint, Ellen. This
                   is a kid who terrorized hald the
                   school. He even broke into your
                   house. Maybe we should think
                   about that 'fore we shed any tears.

      Ellen just looks at him.

                                 TREVOR
                   ... Maybe he's better off.

                                 ELLEN
                   That's a horrible thing to say.

      Trevor accepts that it is.

                                  TREVOR
                   Do you believe for every troubled
                   kid like Benny there's one or two
                   others just waiting to take his
                   place? Like Cesar... or his
                   friend Stevie.

      An awkward moment of silence...

                                 ELLEN
                   You don't know anything about
                   Cesar's finger, do you, Trevor?

                                 TREVOR
                   Sometimes a person just runs out
                   of bad choices. Then he's gotta
                   pay a price. What happened to
                   Cesar was inevitable.

      Ellen flickers a terrified smile.

                                 ELLEN
                   You're scaring me.

                   We make choices in life and we
                   live by 'em. You and I chose to
                   be teachers, to stand on
                   principle. Benny and Cesar,
                   they're takers. They want what
                   they want, and they want it now.

                   I'm sorry but everyone can't
                   always get what they want.
                   Sometimes you gotta take
                   responsibility for your actions.
                   Have you ever been ready to die
                   for a fundamental principle? They
                   haven't. You think those punks
                   would die protecting your Civil
                   Rights?

                                    ELLEN
                   Trevor, don't.

                   Did you know Cesar hits his
                   mother? Steals money from her
                   purse? Did you know that?

      Ellen blanches.

                                 TREVOR
                   Did you know he was here that
                   night? In the alley?

                          (confused)

                                 TREVOR
                   Cesar. Jack was provoked.     It
                   wasn't an accident, Ellen.    Cesar
                   killed him.

      Ellen just stares at him.       Traumatized...

122   INT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS - MEN'S BATHROOM - AFTER SCHOOL          122

      ... Cinco de Mayo. The sounds of a QUEBRADITA waft in
      from outside in the quad.

      At the same time, Steve follows him into the rest room.
      They're all alone.

                                 STEVIE
                  Eh, Mr. G?

      Bracing himself with a fixed, straight-ahead look.

                                STEVIE
                         (boldly)
                  I'm talkin' ta you, Garfield.
                         (beat)
                  Know what you did to Cesar.
                         (wild notion)
                  ... I'm thinkin' maybe you did
                  Benny, too.
                         (incredulously)
                  That possible? You crush my
                  friend's skull? Fuck 'im up wit'
                  a two-by-four, maybe a baseball
                  bat?

      No response.   As Trevor starts to leave, Stevie blocks
      his path.

      Trevor steps to one side to go around... but Stevie
      blocks his path again.

                                TREVOR
                         (trying to maintain)
                  Please, step out of the way.

                                STEVIE
                  ... You kill my friend?   Huh?

      Trevor's head begins to swim. His life's falling apart.
      Like a trapped animal, he back-pedals a step to escape...
      but then suddenly snaps.

      He explodes into Stevie, crushing him against the bath-
      room wall.

      Trevor impales Stevie with a look that says it all.

      Stevie immediately shrinks. Trevor now blinks. Cooling
      himself down. Slowing his breathing. Stevie slips out
      from under his hold and bolts for the exit.

123   EXT. STUDENT QUAD/QUEBRADITA - CONTINUOUS ACTION             123

      Cesar and his tag-bangers... Cesar holds court, drowned
      out by the MUSIC. Now Stevie arrives. Out of breath.
      Urgent to tell his story.

      Rita... Makeup subdued, wearing a cotton button-down blouse.
      She watches the Quebradita from behind a tree. A desire
      to be part of it, she moves a little closer...

      ... as Cesar notices her. His head races from Stevie's
      news. Eyes penetrating. Now galvanized. On a rampage,
      he shoves his way through the crowd.

      Victor Sifuentes... on the opposite side of the patio,
      snapping a look, spotting Cesar moving in for the kill.
      With a start, Victor barks something into his walkie-
      talkie and squeezes his way into the Quebradita crowd...

      Cesar shoves Rita to the ground.

                                CESAR
                  School girl bitch!

      Rita gets to her feet immediately...

                                 RITA
                          (shaken)
                   You gotta problem?!

                                 CESAR
                   Yer fuckin' maestro, 'at's my
                   problem!

                                 RITA
                   I don't know what yer talkin'
                   'bout!

                                 CESAR
                   Garfield killed Benny!

      Rita looks at him like he's insane.    Cesar's entourage
      gathers around them.

                                 RITA
                   Yer crazy.

      She turns her back and starts to leave.       Cesar grabs
      her again...

                                 CESAR
                   Don't turn yer back on me when
                   I'm talkin' t'you, bitch. You
                   think yer better than everybody
                   else. Well you ain't! You ain't
                   nuthin' but a whore!

                                 RITA
                   Fuck you, asshole!

                                 CESAR
                   What? You forget about the time
                   in the bungalows? We all had our
                   turn wit you, man!

                                 RITA
                   Shut up!

                                 CESAR
                          (gets in her face)
                   What the fuck you been fuckin'
                   a nigger for? Huh? You think
                   he's gonna protec' you? Stop
                   me from doin' whatever I want
                   wit' you? Stop any of us from
                   doin' what we want wit' you?!

      Rita just stands there, destroyed and sobbing now.

                                                         (CONTINUED)

                   Fuck you, Cesar.

                                   CESAR
                   No, fuck you!

      He grabs her blouse and rips it wide open. His eyes
      glisten with fervor now as he punches Rita (with his
      good hand) square in the face. She crumbles to the
      ground as Victor bursts through the crowd and
      restrains Cesar.

      As Rita gets to her feet and flees into the Quebradita
      crowd...

                                 CESAR
                   Garfield better watch his back!

125   INT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS AUDITORIUM - NIGHT                        125

      Standing room only.    An impassioned crowd.

                                 ANGLO WOMAN
                   ... I wanna know if this boy was
                   killed and whether it was gang-
                   related.

      The audience erupts in unanimous support...

                                 ANGLO WOMAN
                          (playing to crowd now)
                   As a mother and a taxpayer, I have
                   a right to know. And if it was
                   gang-related then I want tighter
                   security...

      At this point she's drowned out by the crowd.

      On stage the discipline committee, including Trevor,
      Childress, Hyland and Quinn sit at the dais. Garcia
      stands at the podium, waiting for silence. MRS. FORD,
      the assistant principal, a full-figured black woman in
      her mid-fifties, stands alongside him, gesturing for
      the crowd to settle down.

                                 MR. GARCIA
                   The death...
                          (too noisy)
                   The death of Benito Chacon is not
                   gang-related.

                                 MR. GARCIA (CONT'D)
                   That's something you heard on
                   the news. It's wrong. It's
                   misinformation.

                           (shouting out)
                   Who says? How can you be so sure?
                   You're talking about my kid's
                   safety.

                                 MRS. FORD
                   Please, everyone just calm down.

      Audience settles.

                                  MR. GARCIA
                   Thank you, Mrs. Ford.
                           (now)
                   ... The police at this point
                   aren't even sure if it's a case of
                   murder. The reason we're having
                   this meeting tonight is to quash
                   all the rumors floating around out
                   there. Okay. Here's what we do
                   know. Benny Chacon ultimately died
                   from a drug overdose, technically
                   it was morphine.
                           (volume rising again)
                   Which is what heroin breaks down
                   into...

                                 STEVIE (O.S.)
                   ... Dat's bullshit! Benny was no
                   junkie! I know who did it!

      Heads turn...

      ... Ellen quietly enters now and stands just inside
      one of the doors at the back of the hall...

      Up at the dais, Trevor notices her.

                                 STEVIE
                   It's not the gangbangers y'gotta
                   worry about. It's the teachers!

                                 MR. GARCIA
                   That's exactly the type of rumor
                   we don't need, Mr. Littleton.

      Stevie deliberately stands and points at Trevor with
      vitriol in his eyes...

                                 STEVIE
                   ... It was Garfield.

      The audience grows silent.

                                 MR. GARCIA
                          (losing his patience)
                   Say one more word and you're
                   suspended.

                                 MRS. FORD
                   ... Sit down, Stevie.

      Trevor doesn't even flinch.       Childress scrutinizes him
      with a glance.

                                 STEVIE
                          (ranting)
                   You're a fuckin' murderer,
                   Garfield!

                                    MR. GARCIA
                             (calling for assistance)
                   Victor?

                                 STEVIE
                   ... Maybe I can't prove it but I
                   know he did it. He fucked up
                   Cesar and he killed Benny.
                          (to crowd)
                   Ast 'im!

      As Victor and another plainclothes cop attempt to remove
      Stevie...

                                 STEVIE
                   Touch me and I'll sue yer ass!
                          (as Victor backs off;
                           now to Trevor)
                   Yer dead, G! Yer a dead man!

      With that Stevie shoves Victor aside and bolts for the
      door.

      Garcia attempts to regain his composure...

      Trevor glances back to the spot where Ellen was
      standing... but now she's gone.

      Trevor maintains a steady pace, one hopeful eye scouring
      the parking lot for Ellen...

                                 CHILDRESS
                   ... Don't let that Littleton punk

                   Lil' bastard's a tweaker. He's a
                   speed freak. You didn't know that?

      At Trevor's car now.    Hesitating.    Turning to
      Childress...

                          (testing his patience)
                   What is it, Dave? How can I help
                   you?

      Unintentionally in Trevor's face...

                                 CHILDRESS
                   How 'bout a ride?
                          (taking a step back)
                   ... The wife wouldn't let me drive
                   my own car. Ain't that a bitch?

      Childress is pitiful. Wears a grease-stained tie with
      his wrinkled Hawaiian shirt and a Windbreaker.

                                 TREVOR
                          (with resignation)
                   ... You smell like beer.

                   I only had two. That's all.
                   Swear ta Christ.

      Raising his palms. Surrendering.       Trevor studies him
      with a sad grimace.

                                 CHILDRESS
                   I live right up here off Chandler.

      At the end of a gravel driveway, behind a darkened house.
      Garage door open.

      Childress chain smokes and drinks beer as he leans
      against the dented fender of his '66 Lincoln Continental.
      Trevor nurses a Diet Coke...

                                 CHILDRESS
                   ... I had the same situation
                   'round the time of that 'Night

                   Whole city was scared shitless.
                   My wife was convinced the frickin'
                   mailman was the 'Stalker' for
                   about a week there.
                          (a tubercular chuckle)
                   Some mental giant in my 4th period
                   starts this rumor, see. Childress
                   is the 'Night Stalker.' Right?
                          (chug-a-lugs)
                   ... Idiots. Even after they

                   got the wrong guy. Childress is
                   the Stalker, ese.'

      He finishes beer.    Crumples it.

      Trevor studies him, without expression. Now he notices
      something stapled to the tar paper wall...

      Trevor's POV of the "Certificate of Excellence in
      Teaching," yellowed and dogeared, hanging obliquely by
      one staple.

      ... as Childress opens another beer.

      Childress unlocks a particle board cabinet against the
      garage wall.

      A watery glint in his bloodshot eyes. Cabinet door
      swings wide now, revealing a mini arsenal of handguns...

                   Ta-dah... Huh?

      Trevor's eyes remain expressionless.

      Childress rhapsodizes as he removes and handles some of
      the guns...

                                 CHILDRESS
                   ... This one's from

                          (and next)
                   Now this one's special. A Glock
                   21. Lightest gun in the world.
                   The barrel and firing pin are
                   metal. See. Everything else on
                   it's plastic.
                          (handing it to Trevor)
                   Here, feel that.

      Trevor takes it, reluctantly weighs it in the palm of his
      hand. Sets it down.

      Now Childress removes a gun from a holster in the small
      of his back, under his Windbreaker...

      Childress laughs and chokes on his cigarette. Now he
      gazes at the .380 in his hand. Lost in a stupid,

      Smiles to himself now. Thinks he's funny...

      All traces of a smile fade from Dave's face.      Trevor

      Awkward glint of admiration in Childress's eye.     Leans
      forward, hangs a hand on Trevor's shoulder.

      Trevor turns and exits the garage. PULLING BACK FROM
      Childress's dull anesthetized gaze. Deep down inside
      Childress knows he's a pathetic piece of shit...

      Trevor pulls into his driveway, right up to the garage
      door. He SHUTS OFF the IGNITION and narrows a gaze out
      the front windshield...

       A clip from "Sally Jessy Rafael" or "Jerry Springer."
       One of those Sturm und Drang moments. Everyone points
       the finger at everyone else. No one willing to take
       responsibility for themselves.

       Only partially watching the television. His eyes are
       fixed on a point somewhere in his own mind, lost to the
       world.

       Into a parabolic mirror above the library doors...

       ... an empty corridor stretches forever.

       Trevor, now unshaven, looking like he hasn't slept, sits
       amidst total silence in his regular spot. No sign of
       Rita. He checks his wristwatch.


       WALL CLOCK

       reads... 7:10 AM.

      BACK TO SCENE

      Trevor catches his breath and blinks...

      ... Back to reality.    The mirror is empty.

      He removes his Proventil inhaler from his shirt pocket.
      Suppressing gasps, he takes two hits.

      Two girls at the magazine racks whisper to each other,
      eyes firmly fixed on Trevor.

      Suddenly there's a presence at Trevor's side...

      Strictly low rent district. The small dirt yard in front
      is contained within a cinder block wall.

      Rita, back to her chola look, heavy makeup, black (right)
      eye where Cesar punched her, watches her two younger
      brothers as they fight over a toy truck. Her
      three-year-old baby sister, Maricella (too big to be
      carried) straddles her hip as Rita yells at the boys...

                                 TREVOR
                   That's not true. You're so smart,
                   Rita. Don't you know that? You
                   have an opportunity here to change
                   your life. Please don't throw
                   away everything we've worked for.

      Trevor just stares at her, incredulously.

      Rita lowers her gaze, unable to look him in the eye.
      Momentous deliberation, and now...

                                 TREVOR
                   I know what happened with Childress.

                   Doesn't matter.

                                 RITA
                   He ain't never touched me no ways.
                   What's he sayin'? He say he
                   fucked me?! He say dat?!
                          (off Trevor's look)
                   He's a damn liar!
                          (erupting again;

                   You made a mistake.    Dat's all.

      With that Rita scoops up Maricella and exits.


132   INT. MR. GARCIA'S OFFICE - SAME DAY (LUNCH PERIOD)                132

      Trevor sits transfixed in front of Garcia.       Still hasn't
      shaven.

                                 MR. GARCIA
                   See these?

      Garcia holds up a handful of phone messages.

                                 MR. GARCIA
                   They're phone calls about you.
                   Good ones.

                                  MR. GARCIA (CONT'D)
                   Cesar's mother told me how you
                   tried to help him. You're evidently
                   a good teacher. You should be
                   commended on your efforts. However...
                          (pause)
                   I'm going to have to let you go.

      Trevor blinks.

                                 MR. GARCIA
                          (beat)
                   As much as I'd like to have you
                   stay until the end of the year, I
                   can't overlook the seriousness of
                   certain accusations.

      Mr. Garcia waits for a response but none is forthcoming.

                                 MR. GARCIA
                          (for example)
                   ... Is it true you had meetings with
                   a female student at your house?

                                 TREVOR
                   I was trying to help her.

                                  MR. GARCIA
                   The implications are still there,
                   Mr. Garfield. I can't afford to
                   open the door for another lawsuit.
                   Sure you can appreciate my position.
                          (pause)
                   You can stay until Friday. I hope
                   that will be sufficient.

      This part registers only minimally with Trevor.


133   EXT. BUNGALOW 86 - AFTER SCHOOL (SAME DAY)                      133

      A VAPID SILENCE HOLDS us. The bungalow is awash in a
      sun-soaked pool of light...

      Trevor makes his way toward the parking lot with his
      briefcase and a cardboard box of personal belongings.


134   INT. JOHN QUINCY ADAMS - "A" BLDG. - MAIN CORRIDOR/             134

      Plagued with doubts, Ellen lingers in the doorway,
      confiding with Hyland...

                                  HYLAND
                   You're not being an alarmist.
                           (minimizing her
                            concerns)
                   He gets a little overzealous at
                   times... like some other people
                   I know.
                           (beat)
                   I don't think the rosary adds up
                   to much either, frankly.

                                 ELLEN
                   Why?

                                 HYLAND
                   It's probably his.
                          (beat)
                   Look, when I received my first
                   Holy Communion all the boys got
                   black rosaries and the girls got
                   white. Trust me, there must be
                   millions of black rosaries filed
                   away in desk drawers from here to
                   the Vatican.

      Ellen flickers a sad indecisive smile.

                                 HYLAND
                   This guy's been through a lot,
                   Ellen. The system failed him.
                   I don't think any of us can really
                   appreciate what he's been through.
                          (beat)
                   I say we give the man a break.

      Ellen acquiesces a pensive nod.

      ... a bold 187 has been "keyed" into the paint.

      TREVOR

      Rivetted. Now he slides the cardboard box, along with
      his briefcase onto the front seat.

      Suddenly, as if out of nowhere, Ellen pulls up in her
      Cherokee.

      She deciphers Trevor with mixed emotions.        Trevor adjusts
      his stance, covering the "187."

      Ellen now tentatively rolls her window down halfway...
      TAILPIPE SPUTTERS, a portentous idle.

                                 ELLEN
                          (stilted)
                   ... I'd like to apologize for
                   the other night.

      Trevor stands there transfixed for a moment.       Now he
      looks into her eyes. A soulful gaze.

                                 TREVOR
                   Shouldn't listen to me.    I was
                   half asleep.

      His eyes become damp.    Trevor smiles bravely.

                                 ELLEN
                   We really need to talk.

                                 TREVOR
                   ... Not tonight. Have to finish

                   Tomorrow then?     It's important
                   to me.

                          (far off now)

       checks a 7 round clip and a 39 Smith and Wesson. And
       Paco plays with a .38 caliber revolver that he hides in
       the deep front pocket of is County-Bens.

       The interior of the Buick snaps with the hard sound of
       gun metal... cocking hammers, loading cartridges and
       spinning cylinder chambers...

       ... As the gun preparations systematically stop. Cesar
       now flicks ON an ELECTRIC HAIR CLIPPER, sets it on 'NO
       CLIP,' and passes it back to Paco. Paco runs the clipper
       over his head. Hair tumbles off in chunks. Stevie
       fidgets, picks up a naked one-eyed doll off the floor,
       raises it INTO VIEW...

                  I'm in here, Cesar.

      Cesar, Paco, and Stevie enter the bedroom, guns drawn.

                                CESAR
                  Dont' move, mutha fucka!

      Stevie flips on a light. Paco SHOOTS out the TV set in
      the living room -- an act of intimidation. Cesar jams
      his .357 under Trevor's chin. Gets in his face.

                                CESAR
                  You killed Benny. And you cut off
                  my finger... Say it.

      Trevor stares right into Cesar's eyes, unflinching.

                                   TREVOR
                  Yeah.   I did.

                                   STEVIE
                  Told yuh.     Fuckin' A, man.

                                   PACO
                  Lemme do 'im.

                                 CESAR
                  No.   This nigga's mine.

      Cesar sticks the gun barrel right between Trevor's eyes
      ... and squeezes the trigger. Click. An empty sound.

      Trevor blinks. Cesar exhales a malicious laugh.     Opens a
      fist to reveal six bullets.

                                CESAR
                  Ever seen The Deerhunter, ese?

      ANOTHER ANGLE

      In the middle of the dark house -- Trevor's dining room
      table. Trevor on one side, Cesar/Paco/Stevie on the
      other. Cesar's seated, loading one of the six bullets
      into a cylinder chamber. He shoves the gun toward Trevor
      as Stevie and Paco train their pistols on him.

                                 CESAR
                   You gon' do yourself, mayate.
                   Put it to your head and pull the
                   trigger.

      Trevor grabs the pistol without hesitation, puts it to
      his head and squeezes off TWO ROUNDS without incident.
      He slams the gun down in front of Cesar without a blink.
      A crazed, watery glint in his eye.

                                 TREVOR
                   That macho enough for you, Cesar?
                   Huh? That make me a man?

                                 CESAR
                   Take more'n that.

                                 TREVOR
                   Then you do it.

      All three tag-bangers are taken aback.

                                 TREVOR
                   C'mon, show me what you got.    Mano
                   a mano.

                                 STEVIE
                   He's playin' with yer head.

                                    PACO
                   Vato's scared.     He tryin' to twist
                   outta it.

                                 TREVOR
                   I gotta be a fool to prove you're
                   a fool? -- okay.

      Trevor picks up the gun again, puts it to his head and
      pulls the trigger... click. Slams the gun down.

                                    TREVOR
                   C'mon.

                                 CESAR

                   Why -- you too chickenshit to play
                   yer own game? Got no cojones?

      Paco lashes out and hits Trevor with his pistol drawing
      blood.

                                  PACO
                   Shut up!

      Cesar stares at him.

                                 TREVOR
                   You gonna let your homies defend

                   C'mon, be a man! Get some respect
                   back! Do it!

      Cesar takes the gun and raises it toward his head.

                                 PACO
                   Whatcho doin', homie?

      He grabs Cesar's arm, but Cesar pushes him away.

      Cesar puts the .357 to his temple again...

                   Don't do it!

      They are mesmerized into inaction as Cesar grits his teeth
      and pulls the trigger. Click.

      Trevor looks at Cesar in disgust as he takes another
      bullet and blindly loads it into the cylinder chamber.

                                 CESAR
                   Yer turn.

      He spins the cylinder and slams the gun on the table.

                                 TREVOR
                   You think you got respect now?
                   Your kinda respect is bullshit.
                   Only thing you honor is stupidity.
                   You ready to die for stupidity,
                   Cesar? I am, if it'll teach you
                   somethin'. See you can't kill me,
                   homeboy. Yeah, my body... but
                   what I am, who I was? That's
                   been dead for over a year. And

                   matter how many of you I get rid
                   of. I realize that now...

                   ... I was a teacher! I wanted to
                   help you!...

      He snatches up the gun, puts it to his head and pulls the
      trigger again... click. Trevor slams it back down on the
      table.

                                 TREVOR
                   You can't kill me... and you can't
                   scare me.

      Cesar's sweating now, glancing between Trevor and the gun
      on the table. Stevie and Paco shift uneasily.

                                 PACO
                   Don't do it, homie.

                                 STEVIE
                   He's crazy.

                                 TREVOR
                   Yeah, but isn't that what you
                   respect? Bein' loco? Don't listen
                   to 'em, Cesar. If you gonna live
                   stupid don't do it half-assed --
                   take it all the way. Take your
                   turn. Pull the trigger.

      Caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place,
      Cesar's hand inches toward the gun. Suddenly Trevor is
      screaming at him.

                    Well then, I'll take your turn for

       Bleachers now as guests and family members fan themselves
       against the searing heat. A banner strung across the top
       row of seats reads...

                       CONGRATULATIONS CLASS OF '97

       Faculty members are seated in the first two rows down
       on the field. In front of a sea of mortar boards.

       Dave Childress now enters, his usual shabby attire,
       nursing another hangover. He takes a seat away from the
       other teachers.


168B   EXT. ATHLETIC FIELD - PODIUM - SHORT WHILE LATER                168B

       As the first speaker approaches the podium...

       ON two inch high heels, an occasional wobble as the white
       high heels make their way up to the podium. ANGLE RISING
       now, LINGERING ON a clinging powder blue dress and mani-
       cured fingernails. HOLD ON her clenched essay. Now
       CONTINUE UP to reveal Rita Nartinez.

       She wears lipstick... and only a moderate amount of eye
       shadow. She wears a slightly nervous, preoccupied look.
       Now...

       Rita at the podium, as she adjusts the microphone, a
       nervous reflex. Places her essay on the podium. Stares
       down at it...

                                  RITA
                    ... The title of my essay is,
                    'Mi Vida Loca'... 'My Crazy Life'...

       Rita hesitates.    Now she gazes out at the graduating
       class.

       side of him.

       Ms. Quinn (45) hesitates, now acquiesces with
       uncertainty...

                    ... Pyrrhus defeated the Romans
                    on two occasions. But those two
                    victories lost him a large part
                    of his army. Now whenever people
                    say something's a Pyrrhic victory
                    they mean it's a victory gained
                    at too great a cost.

       Childress stares off into space, flickers a pathetic smirk.

       And now Stevie seated amongst the graduates. Glancing
       up from under his mortar board cap. He adjusts
       a gaze into the bleachers.

                                                                 126.

       Early forties, upper-middle class. Stevie's mother

       she mouth the words, "Were... So... Proud... Of... You."

       END ON Ellen standing obliquely in the doorway. Brief-
       case in hand, files and papers tucked under one arm. Her
       face, a solemn vacuous gaze.

       Now she drops something into the trash can, shuts off the
       lights, and leaves. As the door slowly closes...

       MOVE IN ON the trash can...

       ... and Ellen's crumpled teaching credential.   Add another
