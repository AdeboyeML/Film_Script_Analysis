                                     NARRATOR

                         No one would have believed in the early 
                         years of the21st century, that our world 
                         was being watched by intelligences greater 
                         than our own. That as men busied themselves 
                         about their various concerns, they observed 
                         and studied. Like the way a man with 
                         a microscope might scrutinize the creatures 
                         that swarm and multiply in a drop of 
                         water. With infinite complacency men 
                         went to and fro about the globe, confident 
                         of our empire over this world. Yet, 
                         across the gulf of space, intellects, 
                         vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded 
                         our plant with envious eyes. And slowly 
                         and surely, drew their plans against 
                         us.

 
               EXT. DOCK - CARGO BAY - DAWN


               Ray (in his 30s, short hair, rough groomed, almost always wears 
               his New York baseball cap, raggedly dressed, looks like he hasn't 
               slept in days) is moving cargo boxes from the ship to ground 
               loading brackets. Shots show him inside the control room operating 
               the levers. As the last car is loaded, he is seen walking down 
               the stairs.

 
                                     SAL

                         Ray!! Ferrier! Whoa!


               Ray turns away and laughs because he already knows what he is 
               going to say.

 
                                     SAL

                         I need you back at 4:00 instead of 12:00 
                         I got half of Korea coming in.

 
                                     RAY

                         No, no, no I can't. I'm on a 12 hour 
                         blow! Call Tadesko. 

 
               Camera follows them walking down the street.


                                     SAL

                         Tadesko can't move 40 containers in 
                         an hour. I need somebody who can do 
                         double picks.

 
                                     RAY

                         I wish I could help you Sal. God damn 
                         union regulations.

 
                                     SAL

                         (getting angry) Come on, I'm in a position 
                         here!

 
                                     RAY

                         Come on, you remember the union regulations, 
                         Sal.
 
                                     SAL

                         (angrily) You know what your problem 
                         is?

 
               Sal stops on one side of the street while Ray continues walking.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         (joking) I can think of a couple of 
                         women who'd be happy to tell you. 

 
                         
               EXT. RAY'S CAR - DRIVEWAY - DAWN


               Ray gets out and takes the last can of trash to the street as 
               Tim (in his 30s, wearing expensive clothes, slicked sharp hair, 
               extremely well groomed, looks like (and is) rich) and Ray's ex-wife 
               Mary Ann (in her 30s, pregnant with maternity clothes on, hair 
               hanging loose and rather unkempt) stand at their new car. Robbie 
               (15, ragged, tough look, long hair, partially groomed, worn clothes 
               (but looks in style), hip side pack with misc. objects in it.) 
               and Rachel (10, still dressed in Barbie color scheme clothing, 
               long unkempt hair in pigtails) are in the car.

 
                                     RAY

                         Is it 8:30? We say that?


                                     MARY ANN

                         We said 8:00.


                                     RAY

                         (changing subject) Hey, this is one 
                         safe looking vehicle you got yourself 
                         here Tim. Congratulations.

 
                                     TIM

                         Thank You.


                                     RAY

                         8 o'clock huh?


                                     MARY ANN

                         Um-Huh. We'll be back by 9:30 on Sunday, 
                         depending on the traffic.

 
               Robbie gets out of the car, carelessly banging the door on the 
               electrical pole. He is listening to his MP3 player at a loud 
               enough volume for the camera (10' away to hear).

 
                                     RAY

                         There he is! You got a hug?


               Robbie ignores him as if he was not there and heads up to the 
               front door of the house.

 
                                     RAY

                         (continues) Confusing handshake? (joking) 
                         Kick in the teeth? The door's locked. 
                         (to Mary Ann): Still working on those 
                         manners?

 
               Mary Ann nods "yes" as Rachel gets out of the car.


                                     RACHEL

                         Hello dad.


                                     RAY

                         Hello, Rachel!


               Rachel gives him a hug and goes back to the car to retrieve her 
               bag. She struggles and Mary Ann, Tim, and Ray try to help which 
               results in a small bicker argument. (Ray, Tim, and Mary Ann add 
               lib.)

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (during bickering, at the front door) 
                         The door's locked.

 
                                     MARY ANN

                         (suit case in hand) I'll just get it 
                         in the door.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         It's got rollers, just roll it.


                                     MARY ANN

                         Well we can't roll it up the stairs 
                         now can we?

 
                                     RAY

                         Really, I got it from here, okay?

 
                         
               INT. RAY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAWN


               Mary Ann, Rachel, Ray, and Tim walk into the kitchen as Robbie 
               heads straight upstairs to his room. Mary Ann sees a car engine 
               next to the kitchen table and looks at Ray in disgust. 

 
                                     RAY

                         (to Tim) It's a 302 V8. It's gonna be 
                         out of here next week.

 
               Mary Ann walks over to the refrigerator to check for the basic 
               food supplies. Ray gets frustrated that she is going through 
               HIS stuff.

 
                                     RAY

                         (trying to get her to leave) You better 
                         get going if you want to beat the traffic, 
                         don't you think?

 
               Mary Ann ignores his comment as she opens the refrigerator which 
               is almost empty. 

 
                                     MARY ANN

                         You're out of milk. (smells it) And 
                         everything else.

 
               Shot of Rachel, intensely listening from the stairs.


                                     RAY

                         (mad) Would you close the door please? 
                         Now that that's my refrigerator.

 
                         
                                     TIM

                         I'm gonna go wait outside. (to Rachel) 
                         I love you sweetheart (hugs her) see 
                         you in a few days.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Bye Tim.


                                     MARY ANN

                         I'd better get this upstairs.


               Ray tries to further rid of her but she continues.


                                     RACHEL

                         (trying to get her bag form Mary Ann) 
                         Mom, Mom!

 
                                     RAY

                         Mary Ann, let me get this.


                                     MARY ANN

                         I can get it.


                                     RAY

                         (rushes to close his bedroom door, as 
                         if hiding something) Excuse me.

 
               Ray gets his door closed as Mary Ann goes into Rachel and Robbie's 
               room.

 
               INT. RAY'S HOUSE - RACHEL AND ROBBIE'S ROOM - DAWN


               Mary Ann and Ray go into the room where Robbie is laying on his 
               bed listening to his MP3 player. Rachel sits down on her bed.

 
               
                                     MARY ANN

                         A little old to still be sharing aren't 
                         they?

 
                                     RAY

                         I don't hear any complaints.


                                     MARY ANN

                         No, I do.


               Mary Ann walks over to Robbie on his bed and grabs his MP3 player. 
               She un-plugs the headphones and the music stops. Ray sits down 
               on a desk chair.

 
                                     MARY ANN

                         Robbie's got a paper... (looks at Robbie 
                         to make sure he's listening) ...on the 
                         French occupation of Algeria due Monday 
                         which he's yet to begin. It would be 
                         nice if he were done by the time we 
                         got back so we don't have to keep him 
                         up all night on Sunday.

 
               Mary Ann looks at Robbie who promptly says...


                                     ROBBIE

                         I just got to type it up. (makes typing 
                         motion)

 
                                     MARY ANN

                         No, you just got to start writing it 
                         first.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (interrupts her) I love you mom!


               Mary Ann kisses him.


                                     MARY ANN

                         I love you. (begins walking over to 
                         Rachel) Listen to your father.

 
               Mary Ann hugs Rachel and promptly notices...


                                     MARY ANN

                         Oh, no shoes on the bed.


               INT Ray's House - Walking Down Stairs - Dawn


                                     MARY ANN

                         We'll be at my parent's house in Boston 
                         but don't call the house line, because 
                         you know. Well the point is I've got 
                         my cell phone. So if anything comes 
                         up, or if you have any questions just 
                         call.

 
                                     RAY

                         Believe it or not, I can handle it.

 
                         
                                     MARY ANN

                         I'll leave the phone on.


                                     RAY

                         Mary Ann? (beat) It's a good look for 
                         you.

 
               Mary Ann opens door and proceeds to walk out the door. She stops 
               to say...

 
                                     MARY ANN

                         You think?


                                     RAY

                         Yeah.


                                     MARY ANN

                         Take care of our kids.


                                     RAY

                         Mary Ann, you got nothing to worry about. 
                         Listen, you tell your mother that Ray 
                         sends his love and kisses.

                         (laughs) She'll love that.


               Mary Ann leaves.


               INT Ray's House - Rachel and Robbie's Room - Dawn


               Robbie is watching the TV stories about lighting storms in other 
               parts of the world. Channel changes ever few seconds. Ray turns 
               off the TV and throws Robbie's baseball mitt at him. He catches 
               it and says...

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Baseball season's over.


                                     RAY

                         Five minutes. It's not going to kill 
                         you.

 
               EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAWN


                                     RAY

                         There he is. (Robbie puts on his new 
                         cap) Boston? (hesitating) That's how 
                         it is? (no response from Robbie) That's 
                         how it's gonna be?

 
               Robbie throws ball at Ray unexpectedly who catches it just barely 
               and comments...

 
                                     RAY

                         Careful with that throw.


                                     ROBBIE

                         Whatever Ray!


                                     RAY

                         Your mom says you've got a report due 
                         on Monday, so you are going to work 
                         on that when you're done here.

 
               During next lines (until noted) they throw the ball back and 
               fourth.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Yeah, I'm almost finished, I just got 
                         to type it up.

 
                                     RAY

                         Yeah, bullshit!


                                     ROBBIE

                         Yeah, and what do you know Ray?


                                     RAY

                         Everything. Haven't you heard? Between 
                         me and my brother, we know everything.

 
                         
                                     RACHEL

                         What's the capital of Australia?


                                     RAY

                         That's one my brother knows.


                                     ROBBIE

                         Is it okay with you if I just laugh 
                         the first 500 times you tell that one.

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Just do your report. We don't send you 
                         to school so you can flunk out.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         You don't pay for it, Tim does.


               Ray throws the ball at Robbie hard enough to knock dust off his 
               mitt. Robbie shakes his hand in his mitt and grits his teeth 
               in pain.

 
                                     RAY

                         That's half of what I've got.


                                     ROBBIE

                         You're an asshole. I hate coming here.

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         That why you act like such a dick?

 
                         
               Ray throws the ball and Robbie purposely misses, shattering a 
               window behind him. Robbie turns his hat backwards and walks up 
               the stairs back into the house. Ray stares at Rachel who stares 
               back.

 
                                     RAY

                         What?


                                     RACHEL

                         That's not how you're going to get through 
                         to him. You want him to listen to you...

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         (interrupts her) What are you? Your 
                         mother or mine?

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Where are you going?


                                     RAY

                         To sleep. I work for a living.


                                     RACHEL

                         What are we supposed to eat?


                                     RAY

                         You know, order.


               INT. RAY'S HOUSE - RAY'S ROOM - DAWN


               Ray takes off his shirt, seems to loose his cap with it, and 
               takes off his boots as he gets in his bed and goes to sleep. 
               

 
               INT Ray's House - Living room -  Day


               Rachel is flipping TV channels as Ray walks down the hall after 
               his nap. He sits down and sees Rachel picking at a splinter. 
               Rachel has his hard hat on.

 
                                     RAY

                         What's the matter?


                                     RACHEL

                         I got a splinter.


                                     RAY

                         Where'd you get it. Come here.


                                     RACHEL

                         On your porch railing.


                                     RAY

                         What, you want me to... (beat) You want 
                         me to take that out for you?

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Absolutely not!


                                     RAY

                         Well, come here let me see it.


               Rachel shows him but doesn't let him touch it for fear he may 
               pull it out. Rachel and Ray ad lib as she stops moving it and 
               he looks at it.

 
                                     RAY

                         It's gonna get infected.


                                     RACHEL

                         No it wont.


                                     RAY

                         Yes, it's gonna get infected.


                                     RACHEL

                         No, it won't. When it's ready, my body 
                         will just push it out. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Push it out?


                                     RACHEL

                         I read that. (as she sits back down) 
                         You should get TiVo. Tim got it for 
                         my room. It's awesome. I can watch all 
                         my shows after homework.

 
                                     RAY

                         Yeah, I'll just put that on my platinum 
                         card. Robbie? (no response) Robbie?

 
                         
               Ray takes a bite of the food sitting on the coffee table in front 
               of him, having no idea what it is.

 
                                     RAY

                         (with the disgusting food in his mouth) 
                         What is that?

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Hummus.


                                     RAY

                         Hummus?


                                     RACHEL

                         From the health food place. I kept one 
                         of their menus last time we were here. 
                         

 
               Ray gives Rachel a "this is gross" look and she gawks at him.

 
               
                                     RACHEL

                         Uh, you said order!


                                     RAY

                         (laughs) I meant order food! Where is 
                         Robbie?

 
                                     RACHEL

                         He went out.


                                     RAY

                         Out where?


                                     RACHEL

                         I don't know. He just took your car 
                         and left.

 
               EXT Ray's House - Front Driveway - Day


               He glances at his open garage door with the car that should have 
               been in it. He runs across the street to search for his car. 
               As he sees everyone else looking at the sky, he looks himself 
               to find a large black cloud with a white hole in the middle of 
               it. The cloud is swirling as if it was being artificially turned.

                         (scratching his chin) In the springtime 
                         maybe. Not this time of year. Come on, 
                         we can see better from the back yard.

 
                         
               (continuous) EXT Ray's House - Back Yard - Day


               Ray runs by the fence to his back yard. As he runs, the wind 
               starts to pick up. 30-40 mph. 

 
                                     RAY

                         That is so weird.

                         The wind is blowing toward the storm.

               Winds pick up faster. 40-50 mph.

                         Rachel, wanna see something cool?

 

                Rachel rushes down the stairs to his side and hugs him in fear. 
                Pan up to view the 'storm' that appears to be lighting up with 
                multiple colored lights. Wide angle shot of clothes blowing in
                the wind. Suddenly the wind dies down to nothing. Lightning hits
                the pavement about 300 feet away.


                                     RAY

                         It's okay.


                                     RACHEL

                         I want to go inside.


                                     RAY

                         It's okay.

                         I want to go inside.


                                     RAY

                         Okay, you go ahead.


               The friend's baby starts to cry...

                         That's enough weather for me. (begins 
                         walking inside)

                         I don't want to go by myself.


               BAM!! BAM!! BAM!!! LIGHTNING hits the ground more rapidly and 
               louder now. Rachel and Ray run towards the eves of the house. 
               BAM! The lighting continues. BAM!

 
                                     RAY

                         Kind of fun, ain't it?

                         No.

                         Oh, Come on. It's like the fourth of 
                         July.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         No it's not.


               Ray begins singing as... BAM!! The LIGHTNING gets even louder 
               and scares the both of them enough to hightail it for the house. 
               BAM!!! Half the car alarms go off in a 10 block radius. BAM!! 
               Another few car alarms go off. BAM!!! Louder and louder the LIGHTNING 
               continues.

 
               INT Ray's House - Kitchen - Day


               Ray and Rachel are running as fast as they can up the stairs 
               into the kitchen. BAM!! The lighting continues again and makes 
               Rachel scream.

 
                                     RAY

                         It's okay. You're fine.


                                     RACHEL

                         It hit right behind our house.


                                     RAY

                         Yeah, well it's not gonna hit there 
                         again because lighting doesn't strike 
                         twice in the same place.

 
               BAM!! It hits again and makes Ray jump.


                                     RAY

                         Oh, SHIT!


               They both get under the table for safety as the LIGHTING continues. 
               They both begin panicking. BAM!! BAM!! BAM!! The LIGHTNING goes 
               on with no apparent end. Ray and Rachel both scurry on the floor 
               under the table as the lighting goes on.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Where's Robbie?


                                     RAY

                         I don't know.


                                     RACHEL

                         Is Robbie okay? (no response) Are you 
                         okay?

 
               BAM! The lighting continues.


                                     RAY

                         Where's the thunder?


                                     RACHEL

                         Why won't it stop?


               Pan out from under the table as the lightning subsides and all 
               is silent.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (with hesitation) Is it over?


               Ray remains speechless as he is fixated on the area where the 
               lightening came from. Ray climbs out from under the table to 
               get an idea of what just happened.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Where are you going?


                                     RAY

                         Just checking things out. Just wait, 
                         wait there.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Are we going to be okay?


                                     RAY

                         I don't know.


                                     RACHEL

                         You don't know.


                                     RAY

                         No. I meant... Rachel, please, just 
                         stop asking so many questions. Just 
                         wait here.

 
               Ray walks around to various parts of the kitchen to see if everything 
               is okay. The power is off. After saying "just wait here" he then 
               walks into the living room. Nothing in the living room has power. 
               He checks his phone which doesn't work. He tries his cell phone 
               which also appears to not work at all. He sees his watch which 
               has also stopped working. 

 
               EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - BACK YARD AREA - EVENING


               Pan left to see the storm cloud still lighting up in some spots. 
               

 
               EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - FRONT STREET - EVENING


               Ray walks down the stairs to see that nobody else has power and 
               for some reason all the cars seem to have just stopped working. 
               By now we get the picture (EMP). He walks out onto the sidewalk 
               where he is joined by his friend.

 
                                     FRIEND 2

                         You believe this Ray? Every single car.

 
                         
               Ray walks past her onto the street where he sees ROBBIE walking 
               up the street towards him. Ray begins running towards him.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         (worried) Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. 


                                     ROBBIE

                         The car just stopped and...


                                     RAY

                         (interrupts him) You're okay? Are you 
                         okay?

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         ... and the lighting started hitting 
                         about a block away over and over again. 
                         And me and this other guy we...

 
                                     RAY

                         (getting angry) Where the hell'd you 
                         go?

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Over on Lincoln Avenue. (break) ... 
                         by the church.

 
                                     RAY

                         Did you see it? Did you... Were you 
                         near it?

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Yeah. 26 times we counted! Over and 
                         over the lighting started hitting. It 
                         opened up this hole or something...

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         26 times?


                                     ROBBIE

                         Yeah.


                                     RAY

                         Okay, well, you're okay?


                                     ROBBIE

                         Yeah.


                                     RAY

                         Good, because your sister is in the 
                         house, I want you to go in that house 
                         and I want you to stay with her. Okay? 
                         (break, as he starts running down the 
                         street) And the next time you take my 
                         car with no driver's license and no 
                         permission, I call the cops. You better 
                         be there when I get back. 

 
               Robbie doesn't move in fear. Ray gets angry that he is not going. 
               

 
                                     RAY

                         Robbie. (snaps his hands together)

 
                         
               Ray begins walking down the street to the auto shop a few yards 
               away.

 
                                     RAY

                         Manny! Manny! Hey Manny. What is it, 
                         dead?

 
                                     MANNY

                         All of them, everything, look at this... 
                         (taps the starter motor) starter's fried. 
                         

 
                                     RAY

                         Lightning hit it? 


                                     MANNY

                         Not even close. I thought if I changed 
                         it... you got any idea what's going 
                         on?

 
                                     RAY

                         I'm on my way to find out. Try umm... 
                         try changing the solenoids.

 
                                     MANNY

                         Right, (to accompanying mechanic) Right 
                         see, I told you that, the solenoids.

 
                         
               Everyone who's car is fried is checking their car to see what 
               went wrong. Ray joins about 30 people walking down to where the 
               lightning started hitting. Ray's friends join him. Cops walk 
               by.

 
                                     COP 1

                         Let us through. Let us through here.

 
                         
                                     FRIEND 3

                         Hey, what up, Ray?


                                     RAY

                         (joking) I should of known you two were 
                         behind this.

 
                                     FRIEND 3

                         Hey, god's pissed off at the Neibor 
                         hood 

 
                                     RAY

                         Can you blame him?


                                     FRIEND 4

                         You see it?


                                     RAY

                         Yep, you got power where you are?

 
                         
                                     FRIEND 3

                         Nope, nothing.


                                     RAY

                         It's the cars though. That's the thing.

 
                         
                                     FRIEND 4

                         Solar Flare, that's what this guy told 
                         me. 

 
                                     RAY

                         A solar flare?


                                     FRIEND 4

                         Yeah, the sun shoots off blobs of plasma, 
                         they turn into solar flare flashes. 
                         It's the only thing that can kill all 
                         of the electronic stuff.

 
                                     FRIEND 3

                         Can I say something?


                                     FRIEND 4

                         What bro?


                                     FRIEND 3

                         The sun does not cause lightning, okay?

 
                         
                                     FRIEND 4

                         Bro, I'm just telling you what that 
                         guy said he heard.

 
                                     FRIEND 3

                         I know but it just sounds dumb saying 
                         that...

 
               Ray and his friends walk up to this hole in the ground where 
               everyone else is gathered around. 

 
                                     COP 1

                         I never seen anything like this before. 
                         That many strikes of lighting in one 
                         spot.

 
               The cops start ushering people to stay back away from the hole.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         Is this the only place?


               Ray picks up a stone that is white next to all the black asphalt 
               crumbs. He switches it from hand to hand because it is too cold 
               to hold in one hand.

 
                                     FRIEND 4

                         Is it hot?


                                     RAY

                         No. It's freezing.


               The police officers and the other people gathered around feel 
               a vibration under their feet.

 
                                     COP 2

                         What is that?


                                     RAY

                         You feel that?


                                     FRIEND 3

                         Yeah, I feel that.


                                     FRIEND 4

                         What is it the subway?


                                     COP 1

                         There's no subway here.


                                     FRIEND 4

                         PATH Train maybe?


                                     COP 1

                         That can't be the water main. 


                                     COP 2

                         There's nothing else down there.


                                     COP 1

                         The water main doesn't run through here.

 
                         
                                     COP 2

                         Well, there's something down there and 
                         it's moving.

 
               The pavement starts to crack into a wider circle. People start 
               running away from the crack as it gets bigger and bigger. Windows 
               start to crack under pressure as the pavement separates even 
               more. Entire sheets of road split into pieces causing everyone 
               on the road to loose their balance. Shots of more shattering 
               windows. Busting pipes. The church starts cracking apart and 
               moving with a GIANT CIRCLE of pavement that moves. The pavement 
               lurches up and then caves down. A few cars go tumbling in. Something 
               throws the last car that tumbled in back out flying through the 
               air as a leg of the robot makes a lurch out of the hole. The 
               police continue trying to move people away. The engines of the 
               ship start coming out as they power up. The entire ship comes 
               out and begins dusting it's self off. Ray and his friends hide 
               behind a building. 

 
                                     FRIEND 4

                         Oh my god.


               Ray begins walking out from behind the building.


                                     FRIEND 4

                         Ray, no, stay man.


               The machine makes a large vibrating noise as if calling out to 
               other robots. It arms it's disintegrator beams and opens fire. 
               People can be seen to disintegrate as they are struck with the 
               beam. The beams, when fired make a zap sound. People start exploding 
               into dust and their clothes are blown away. Ray misses numerous 
               beams by a foot or two as he goes into a convenience store. Again 
               Ray runs out the back door and misses another beam by inches. 
               He runs his ass off trying to escape the robot. Disintegrator 
               beams strike off rooftops to clear a walking path. Ray hides 
               behind a building as the machine walks by.

 
               EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - PORCH -  EVENING


               Ray walks into the house where he is met by Rachel's gawking 
               eyes out the window. Robbie stands in the background looking 
               at the doorway. Ray walks past Rachel then Robbie toward the 
               kitchen. Rachel and Robbie follow him into the kitchen. With 
               anxious eyes, Robbie begins to say...

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         What happened?


               Ray sits down against the wall of the island countertop in the 
               kitchen, not responding.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         What's going on?


               Robbie squats down next to Ray as Rachel rests her elbows on 
               the stool at the island.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Dad, what's the matter?


                                     ROBBIE

                         What's all that stuff all over you?

 
                         
               Ray seems to be delirious as he slurs his head towards Robbie.

                         Rachel reaches through a leg of the 
                         island to pull at Ray's hood on his 
                         shirt. BAM! Ray jumps and jerks his 
                         head toward Rachel fast enough to make 
                         some of the white powder poof off as 
                         if jerked back into reality. Robbie 
                         jumps as well in fright.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         What's all the stuff?


                                     ROBBIE

                         Hello? Ray?


               Ray looks at his arms which are coated in the white powder. He 
               gets up and begins heading for the bathroom. Still unresponsive 
               to the questions he was just asked. He looks in the mirror to 
               see that he is covered in the whit powder (human ash). He quickly 
               does his best to wash it off realizing what it is. After washing 
               it off, he begins mentally planning what to do.

 
               Walking back into the kitchen...


                                     RAY

                         We're leaving this house in 60 seconds.

 
                         
               Ray grabs an old Penzoil box and dumps the tools out of it. He 
               shoves the box into Robbie who grasps it as to not fall over 
               at the force Ray used.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (questioning) What? Wait. I have no 
                         idea what's going on...

 
                                     RAY

                         (while Robbie asks) ... all the food 
                         from the refrigerator and the cupboard, 
                         put it in here.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         I think we are having a bit of a shock 
                         here...what's going on, just tell me...

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Just do it.


               Ray runs toward the table, grabs a flashlight and begins to try 
               to get it to work.

 
                                     RAY

                         Rachel, sweetheart... 


                                     RACHEL

                         Dad, you're really scaring me.


                                     RAY

                         I need you to get your suitcase...

 
                         
                                     RACHEL

                         Dad. (break) Dad!


                                     RAY

                         The one that you brought, bring it to 
                         me, okay?

 
               Ray shoves cereal boxes aside to get to the cabinet over the 
               refrigerator for batteries. Hastily grabbing the package, he 
               realizes they are probably dead due to the EMP.

 
                                     RAY

                         Can you do that for me, darling?


               INT. RAY'S HOUSE - RAY'S ROOM - EVENING


               Ray runs into his room while Rachel and Robbie are downstairs. 
               He hastily enters the combination to a metal box that contains 
               a hand gun. He tucks the gun into his belt on his back and folds 
               his shirts over it.

 
               Street Sidewalk - Evening


               Ray, Rachel, and Robbie are walking at a very fast pace down 
               the sidewalk with about 20 other people around them. Rachel is 
               clutching Ray's hand and Robbie is carrying the box of food. 
               

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         What's happening?


                                     RAY

                         Shh, Shh, I can't tell you now. We... 
                         We've only got about another minute.

 
                         
               Ray sees the car that Manny was working on just as Manny's Apprentice 
               closes the hood. Ray mutters...

 
                                     RAY

                         Please, Please, Please.


               People are seen rushing down the street in the intersecting direction. 
               Ray, Robbie and Rachel approach the car.

 
                                     RAY

                         Just keep it down.


                                     ROBBIE

                         Ray, I'm standing right beside you. 
                         Can you please answer me?

 
               Ray does not respond as he looks in the ignition and finds keys.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         Just get in the front seat Robbie.

 
                         
               Ray loads Rachel in the middle row of seats as Robbie gets in 
               the passenger seat.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Who's car is this?


                                     RAY

                         Just get in.


                                     RACHEL

                         Who's car is this?


               Ray throws Rachel's bag in the row of seats behind her, slams 
               the door and starts walking to the driver side of the car. He 
               is caught by Manny walking.

 
                                     MANNY

                         Hey, Hey, Ray! You were absolutely right. 
                         I had to change the sole... Ray?

 
                         
               Manny sees Ray has loaded his whole family into the car.


                                     MANNY

                         Hey Ray? Ray? What? 


               Manny walks over to the passenger side as Ray and Robbie watch 
               him.

 
                                     MANNY

                         Ray. Open up.


               Ray, who did no such thing sits there. Robbie looks at ray wondering 
               what he's going to do.

 
                                     MANNY

                         Open the door, come on! OPEN THE DOOR 
                         RAY!

 
               Ray reaches over Robbie and opens the door.


                                     MANNY

                         What are you...


                                     RAY

                         (interrupts him) Get in.


                                     MANNY

                         That's funny, you gotta get out of the 
                         car. You can't take it.

 
               Ray tries to get Manny to calm down from the panic he is in...

 
               
                                     MANNY

                         It's not my car. It's not your car. 
                         Where you going? Daddy's acting crazy 
                         kids. Guy's gonna come back...

 
                                     RAY

                         (interrupts him) I don't have time to 
                         expl....

 
                                     MANNY

                         (interrupts him) You're busting my chops. 
                         I got a shop to run. You know how many 
                         people...

 
                                     RAY

                         (interrupts him) Get in!


                                     MANNY

                         No, RAY GET OUT OF THE...


                                     RAY

                         GET IN MANNY OR YOU'RE GONNA DIE!

 
                         
               Rachel begins crying as she says...


                                     RACHEL

                         What do you mean?


               A dead silent pause falls on everyone. Robbie stares at Ray in 
               fright as Ray and Manny stare at each other.

 
                                     MANNY

                         All right, get out of the truck! I'm 
                         not kidding now. GET OUT OF THE CAR 
                         RAY!

 
               Rachel cries more as a view of an approaching robot shoots flame 
               at a nearby tree. Ray and Manny continue as Rachel looks at the 
               flaming tree.

 
                                     MANNY

                         I'm not fooling around, I got a busy 
                         day ahead of me...

 
                                     RAY

                         (to Robbie) Close the door! CLOSE IT!

 
                         
               Ray helps Robbie close the door on Manny as they begin speeding 
               away.

 
                                     MANNY

                         RAY! BRING THE CAR BACK RAY! IT'S NOT 
                         MY CAR!

 
               Manny just finishes his line as he is zapped by a disintegrator 
               beam. Camera shows the auto shop zapped by the beam and exploding 
               to smithereens. 

 
               INT. CAR - DUSK


               Trying to outrun the beams...


                                     RAY

                         GET DOWN! GET DOWN! GET DOWN!


                                     RACHEL

                         Is this the terrorists?!?!


                                     RAY

                         JUST GET DOWN. GET DOWN!


               Ray grabs Robbie's collar of his jacket and shoves him toward 
               the floor.

 
                                     RAY

                         GET DOWN!


                                     ROBBIE

                         HOLY SHIT!


               High shot shows the bridge behind Ray's house being blasted away. 
               The expressway gets hit by the beams and overturns into the houses 
               below. One of them Ray's. An explosion is seen as a fuel tanker 
               falls on Ray's house that obliterates 4 houses. Flaming debris 
               flies all over behind the van.

 
               The van has now made it on to the freeway where hundreds of cars 
               are scattered all over the road broken down. The van speeds by 
               them honking the horn every few cars.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Where are we going?!?!?!


                                     RAY

                         We gotta go! We got to be the only working 
                         car around here. I'm not stopping until 
                         we are clear. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         CLEAR OF WHAT?!?! 


                                     RAY

                         We gotta go.


                                     ROBBIE

                         WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON!?!?!?


                                     RAY

                         YOU SAW! WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!!


               Rachel begins frantically crying. After a few seconds, she begins 
               hyperventilating. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         BY WHO? WHO IS ATTACKING US?!?!


                                     RAY

                         Rachel... Rachel you've got to keep 
                         it down Rachel!

 
               After honking his horn a few more times, she has only gotten 
               worse.

 
                                     RAY

                         Rachel! SHUT UP RACHEL! I CAN'T THINK!

 
                         
                                     ROBBIE

                         (with a vein driven face) YOU ARE FREAKING 
                         HER OUT!!

 
                                     RAY

                         WELL, LOOK, I'M DRIVING, DO SOMETHING!!!

 
                         
               Robbie turns to the back seat as an attempt to calm Rachel. He 
               thinks of an old technique he was taught.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Okay, (slapping his arms together on 
                         top of each other, demonstrating) Put 
                         em' up Rache.

 
               Rachel makes his demonstrated arm formation.


                                     ROBBIE

                         Make the arms. (he grabs her elbows 
                         so she holds the position. He begins 
                         to calm her down) This space right here, 
                         this is yours.

 
               Robbie stares directly into her eyes. She takes deep breaths 
               to regain control. She is able to open her eyes and stare back 
               into his eyes to maintain contact.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         ... This belongs to you, right? 


                                     RACHEL

                         (panting, but keeping eye contact) Yes...

 
                         
                                     ROBBIE

                         (reassuring her) You're safe in your 
                         space. 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (keeping eye contact) I'm safe in my 
                         space.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (reassuring her) You're safe in your 
                         space. Nothing is going to happen to 
                         you in your space. 

 
               Ray looks back into the back seat in amazement at Robbie able 
               to do what he's doing.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I'm really scared.


                                     ROBBIE

                         I'm gonna go to the front seat to talk 
                         to dad...

 
                                     RACHEL

                         No....


                                     ROBBIE

                         (reassuring her) I will be two feet 
                         away. Okay.

 
               Rachel breaks eye contact and starts controlling her breathing 
               while Robbie grabs her hand as reassurance.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Will you hold my hand?


                                     RACHEL

                         Yes.


                                     ROBBIE

                         Are you gonna be okay?


                                     RACHEL

                         (relatively calm) Yes.


               Robbie grabs her hand and they both lean forward toward the front. 
               

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (taking a breath to calm himself) I 
                         want to know everything you know.

 
                         
               Ray looks into Robbie's eyes who is looking straight forward 
               on the road.

 
                                     RAY

                         This thing, this machine, it crawled 
                         out of the ground and started torching 
                         everything, just killing everybody.

 
                         
                                     ROBBIE

                         What is it? (break) Is it terrorists?

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         No, this came from some place else.

 
                         
                                     ROBBIE

                         You mean like Europe?


                                     RAY

                         NO ROBBIE!! NOT LIKE EUROPE!!!


               Ray swerves to miss a car as the camera cranes around to the 
               driver's side.

 
                                     RAY

                         That machine, it was already buried. 
                          

 
               Ray looks into the sky. What for is unknown.


                                     RAY

                         Maybe it came down in the lightning 
                         storm. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Wait a minute... you just said it was 
                         buried.

 
                                     RAY

                         No, the machine I'm talking about was 
                         buried. But, what came down in the lighting 
                         storm, what operates it. That's the... 
                         that's the.... You know. The....

 
                         
               Robbie jumps back into the passenger's seat as Rachel scoots 
               forward in the back seat. Robbie is looking toward the sky. 

 
               
                                     RACHEL

                         The what?


                                     ROBBIE

                         Why aren't there any helicopters or 
                         airplanes?

 
                                     RAY

                         Hey Rache. How you doing there girl? 
                         (to Robbie) How she doing?

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         How you doing?


                                     RACHEL

                         I'm fine.


                                     ROBBIE

                         (to Ray) She's good.


                                     RAY

                         Good.  Hey, what was that thing you 
                         did with her?

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Works sometimes. She gets claustrophobic. 
                         

 
                                     RAY

                         Hey Rachel


                                     RACHEL

                         I want mom.


                                     RAY

                         I know. You feel better?


                                     RACHEL

                         I want mom.


                                     RAY

                         Yeah, tell me about it, you know?

 
                         
                                     RACHEL

                         Take me to Mom's!


                                     RAY

                         Listen, I just need you to hold it together 
                         for me, okay?

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I WANT MOM!!!


                                     RAY

                         When you start screaming like that, 
                         you know, I can't really...

 
                                     RACHEL

                         TAKE ME TO MOM!!!


               Robbie gets back into the back seat to repeat the "arms" process 
               with her to calm her again.

 
                                     RAY

                         I know...


                                     RACHEL

                         TAKE ME TO MOM'S!!!


                                     RAY

                         That's where we're going right now.

 
                         
                                     RACHEL

                         TAKE ME TO MOM'S!!!


                                     RAY

                         I KNOW!!


               EXT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - DUSK


               Still in the car...


                                     RACHEL

                         Come on, hurry up Dad...


               As soon as the van stops, Robbie gets out and opens the door 
               for Rachel.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Robbie, get the door.... (she knocks 
                         on it)

 
               Robbie grabs the keys off his belt loop as Rachel begins running 
               up to the front door.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (begins, and continues once in the house) 
                         MOM! TIM!!

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (begins, and continues once in the house) 
                         MOM!! TIM!!

 
               Ray remains in the car realizing how unimportant he really is 
               (kids are shouting for Tim).

 
               INT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - ENTRY - DUSK


               Rachel and Robbie are shouting for "mom" and "Tim" as Ray walks 
               through the door. Rachel and Robbie meet Ray in the entry from 
               different parts of the house in their search. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         They're gone.


                                     RACHEL

                         Is she dead??


                                     RAY

                         She's not dead. All right? She's just 
                         no here. Okay? They're never here.

 
                         
                                     ROBBIE

                         How do you know?


                                     RAY

                         Because they are on their way to Boston....

 
                         
               The camera goes to the phone which is briskly picked up by Robbie. 
               Then the camera views into the new family vacation portrait next 
               to the phone. It has Ray missing who is replaced by Tim.

 
                                     RAY

                         ... and so they just kept on going, 
                         they're probably up to your grandma's 
                         house by now.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (dialing the phone) I'm gonna call her.

 
                         
                                     RACHEL

                         How come the lights are on here and 
                         not at your place?

 
                                     RAY

                         Umm.... Because nothing bad happened 
                         here. Okay?

 
               Robbie is having no luck and is only getting error tones out 
               of the phone.

 
                                     RAY

                         So, were safe here. All Right?


               Remembering Robbie's calming "arm" technique...


                                     RAY

                         Okay, Rachel? This is your area. Okay, 
                         you are safe in your area...

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Dad. That's not how it goes.


                                     RAY

                         Okay, well, you hungry, huh? I'll get 
                         you some food. I'm gonna feed you. Get 
                         something to eat.  (digs into the box) 
                         What do we have here??

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         .. Busy signals, one of the fast ones.... 
                         You think all the circuits are down?

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         (continues) Ketchup, Mustard, Ahh, Tabasco, 
                         Barbeque Sauce. This is really good 
                         Robbie. Vinaigrette. I said pack food. 
                         What... What the hell is this?

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         That's all that was in your kitchen.

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Okay. No, it's all right, it's all right. 
                         

 
               Robbie takes his hat off and sits down as Ray searches the box 
               for food. He finds peanut butter. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Uh, food... Uh, bread... (getting the 
                         bread) okay, we're gonna have... umm.... 
                         We'll just get some sandwiches.

 
               Ray takes the twist tie off the bread bag and dumps the whole 
               loaf on the counter. He taps his hands together to try to calm 
               Rachel and Robbie.

 
                                     RAY

                         You ever see me deal? Wanna see me deal? 
                         Okay, there's two for you, two for Robbie, 
                         two for me, (he has one extra in his 
                         hand) ...one for the house. (laughs) 
                         

 
               Ray opens the peanut butter and grabs a wooden spoon from the 
               cooking utensil holder on the counter.

 
                                     RAY

                         Maybe after we get done eating, I will 
                         take you down, teach you how to play 
                         some poker. A little five card stud... 
                         a little blackjack...

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I'm allergic to peanut butter.


                                     RAY

                         (laughs) Since when?


                                     RACHEL

                         (with a snotty look) Birth!


               Robbie shakes his head yes to her statement. 


                                     RAY

                         Okay, well, umm, here (hands her two 
                         pieces of bread) You can eat the bread. 
                         Okay?

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I'm not hungry.


                                     RAY

                         Okay, well. Robbie and I are going to 
                         be eating peanut butter sandwiches. 
                         (to Robbie) You want jelly on this sandwich?

 
                         
                                     ROBBIE

                         I'm not hungry either.


                                     RAY

                         You're not hungry either? Well, that's 
                         fine.

 
               Ray picks up the bread pieces and throws them at the sink window. 
               One with peanut butter sticks on the window and slowly slides 
               off.

 
                                     RAY

                         Everybody just relax, okay? Because 
                         we are here now and we're safe, and 
                         we're gonna stay.  And in the morning 
                         your mom and Tim are going to be here 
                         and everything's gonna be fine. Okay? 
                         (no responses) Okay.

 
               INT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DUSK


               Rachel and Ray are running down the stars carrying their own 
               pillows and blankets. Robbie follows slightly behind them carrying 
               his own and a few extra pillows and blankets. 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         to sleep in the basement. We've got 
                         perfectly good beds. 

 
                                     RAY

                         It's like a slumber party.

                         to us?

                         (walks over to the weight room corner 
                         of the basement) Nice basement.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I want to sleep in my bed. I've got 
                         back problems.

 
                                     RAY

                         Okay. You know on the Weather Channel 
                         when there's a tornado, and they tell 
                         you to go to the basement for safety? 
                         It's like that.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         There's gonna be tornadoes?

                         Rachel, no more talking.


               Robbie puts his hat on Rachel's head and ushers her over to the 
               spot under the stairs where blankets are laid out. Ray walks 
               over to the chair about five feet away from the bed.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Could you be a little nicer to me. God!

 
                         
               Rachel and Robbie are heard in the background...


                                     ROBBIE

                         Wanna stay here?


                                     RACHEL

                         Yeah. Good night, love you.


                                     ROBBIE

                         Love you, Rache.


               Ray takes out his gun and puts it under a pillow of the sofa 
               as he sits down. So Robbie and Rachel wont notice.

 
               INT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT


               Bushes are heard rattling against the window. They become louder 
               and louder against the window. Eventually they become just shy 
               of loud enough to wake Ray up. FLASH! A strike of lighting gets 
               Ray's eyes to roll back around and open. BAM! The second flash 
               is loud enough to get Robbie (who is now in the seat next to 
               Ray) to jump up next to him. A few more flashes and the lightening 
               starts like the first time. BAM! BAM! Every strike of lighting 
               lights up the entire downstairs. Rachel gets up and looks thought 
               the stairs.

 
               A close up shot of Robbie. With every lightening strike, his 
               breathing becomes more erratic.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Is the lighting back?


                                     RAY

                         No, this is something else...


               Just as ray finishes, an ear piercing noise from a jet engine 
               begins. The howl rattles things off of shelves on the walls. 
               Robbie and Ray wince at the pain in their ears. Rachel runs up 
               to Robbie and hugs him in security. Things fall off of shelves 
               everywhere. 

 
               A shot of the incredibly bright window as the noise grows even 
               louder.

                         IS IT THEM!!! IS IT THEM!!!


               The lighting grows more intense as does the sound.


                                     RAY

                         WE GOTTA GO!! WHERE DO WE GO??? ROBBIE, 
                         THIS IS YOUR HOUSE, WHERE DO WE GO??

 
                         
               Robbie opens the door to the furnace room and shows Rachel down 
               the stairs who runs. Robbie goes back to get Ray.

 
               Ray realizes he has forgotten his gun.


                                     RAY

                         WAIT!! WAIT!! WAIT!! WAIT!! 


               Ray and Robbie run to the door just as a fireball bursts through 
               the windows. Flaming debris follows after. Ray gets the first 
               door closed but the fire blasts through the wooden one. He manages, 
               after a struggle, to get the metal one closed on the inside of 
               the furnace room. 

 
               The door closes and the room is completely black. In the dark, 
               you can hear the debris being thrown around everywhere around 
               them.

               INT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - FURNACE ROOM - DAWN


               Ray is looking out the window at the top of the room. He is holding 
               on to the metal wire conduit. Seeing hardly anything, he judges 
               it to be safe to go outside the furnace room. 

 
               He walks by Rachel who is sleeping in Robbie's arms who is sleeping 
               against some copper piping. Holding his slightly burned arm in 
               pain, Ray exit's the room through the charred doors and finds 
               most of the basement in ruins. The ground floor is now the top 
               floor because the second floor was completely torn off. 

 
               The camera pans out to find a winding down, burning airplane 
               engine. Panning out further we can see ray walking through the 
               remains of different sections of an airplane. 

 
               EXT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - YARD - DAWN


               Ray sees the fuselage with one surviving person hauling a blue 
               cart through the aisle.

 
                                     RAY

               The man continues hauling the cart.


                                     RAY

                         Were you on this plane? Are you a passenger?

 
                         
               The cart comes flying down the fuselage doorway as the man creeps 
               down the floor to the ground.

               van in the background.

                         Out there in the pine barrens. We were

                         83rd Mechanized. They moved to one of 
                         those things around midnight. They've 
                         got some kind of shield around them. 
                         We can't see it, but everything we fire 
                         at them detonates too early before we 
                         can get close enough to cause any damage. 
                         When they flash that thing, everything

               She slows the footage down so he can get a good look. She advances 
               it slowly. She points out an alien capsule like object running 
               down the lighting bolt. 

 
                                     RAY

                         What is that?


                                     REPORTER

                         That is them. They come down in capsules, 
                         riding the lighting into the ground 
                         into the machines right?

 
               A vibration noise is heard by an approaching robot. They both 
               jump at the noise.

 
                                     DRIVER

                         You hear that? We're getting the hell 
                         out of here.

 
               The camera man has his hands full of meals as he loads into the 
               van.

 
                                     DRIVER

                         Come on! Get in! Get in! Get in!


               The door almost closes on Ray as she stops and opens it again.

 
               
                                     REPORTER

                         Hey. Were you on that plane?


               Ray shakes his head no.


                                     REPORTER

                         Oh, that's too bad, it would have been 
                         a really great story. 

 
               She closes the door on him. 


               Black blend to:


               INT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAWN


               Ray is talking to Rachel...


                                     RAY

                         Look at me. Look at me. 


               Rachel and Ray are putting on their coats.


                                     RAY

                         You keep your eyes only on me, you understand?

 
                         
               Rachel has her big eyes on him as she nods yes.


                                     RAY

                         Don't look down, don't look around me. 
                         I'm taking you to the car and you're 
                         gonna want to look around. But you are 
                         not going to, are you?

 
               She shakes her head and whispers "no".


               INT. (BUT DUE TO CRASH IT IS NOW EXT.) MARY ANN'S HOUSE - DEBRIS 
               FIELD - DAWN

 
               Ray is carrying Rachel to the van. Robbie is walking along behind 
               them looking at the devastation.

 
                                     RAY

                         You're doing good. You're doing good. 
                         Keep your eyes on me. We'll go right 
                         to Boston, and we're gonna see your 
                         mom. 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I'm not gonna look, dad.


                                     RAY

                         That's a girl. That's my girl.  Okay, 
                         listen, I want you to close your eyes. 
                         Got them closed? 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Um-Huh. 


                                     RAY

                         There you go. Keep em' closed for me.

 
                         
               Camera follows Robbie who puts his hands on his head in amassment 
               of the devastation. Ray starts the car and turns it around to 
               pull out. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Robbie, get in. 


               Robbie does not react at all. Ray becomes agitated. 


                                     RAY

                         ROBBIE!! GET IN!!!


                                     RACHEL

                         Why are you yelling?


               Ray gives him a mean look as Robbie realizes that they must go.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         (to Rachel) It's okay. (to Robbie) Get 
                         in!

 
               They pull away from the wreckage and continue on their journey.

 
               
               EXT. VAN - DAY


               Ray is reading the map while Robbie looks out the window. They 
               are taking back roads that have nothing but farmlands on them. 
               

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Why the hell aren't we on the turnpike?

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Because I don't want everybody to see 
                         we've got a working car. (going over 
                         the plan) We'll stay along the Hudson 
                         until we find an open bridge or ferry, 
                         then we're gonna cross the Hudson. Then 
                         take the back roads across Connecticut 
                         all the way to Boston. 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Where is everybody?


                                     RAY

                         I don't know. Running, hiding, hiding 
                         in their basements. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         If we had any balls, we'd go back there 
                         and find one of those things and kill 
                         it. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Yeah, well, why don't you just let me 
                         make the big decisions, okay?

 
               Ray shoves the map on the floorboard as he becomes more angry 
               at Robbie.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Which would be when? Never Ray? Never's 
                         about your speed.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Okay, enough Robbie!


                                     RAY

                         (angrily) Okay! Enough with the Ray 
                         shit!! It's dad, sir, or if you want 
                         Mr. Ferrier. That sounds a little weird 
                         to me but you decide.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Dad?!?!


                                     RAY

                         Yes, Rachel.


                                     RACHEL

                         I have to go to the bathroom.


                                     RAY

                         Really?


               Rachel shakes her head "yes" as he pulls the car over.


               Ray grabs Robbie by the shirt arm and holds him in the car. He 
               glares at Rachel mean enough to make her freeze in her seat.

 
               
                                     ROBBIE

                         Come on. (tugs at his shirt sleeve which 
                         Ray has a hold of) I gotta go!

 
                                     RAY

                         Not so fast, not so fast, all right? 
                         Now, there are two things we have to 
                         watch out for, and the second is people 
                         who might want our car. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         There's nobody around!


                                     RACHEL

                         I gotta go.


               Robbie breaks free of Ray's grasp on his sleeve. Robbie and Rachel 
               both get out of the car. Ray follows the both of them to supervise 
               the whole event from the van.

 
                                     RAY

                         (displeased) Rachel! Rachel, that's 
                         good right there. (points to a spot 
                         20' away)

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I'M NOT GOING IN FRONT OF YOU GUYS!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         All right, then just go where I can 
                         see you!

 
                                     RACHEL

                         ARE YOU CRAZY?? DON'T LOOK!!


                                     RAY

                         I'm not gonna look! JUST STAY IN SIGHT!!

 
                         
                                     RACHEL

                         THAT'S LOOKING!!


               Rachel is about 200 feet away entering a patch of bushes. Robbie 
               has already found a spot about 10' away next to the stream under 
               the road. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Listen. Every time you don't listen 
                         to me, I'm telling your mother, okay? 
                         I'm making a list. (reinforcing) I'm 
                         making a list!

 
               Rachel is entering the wooded area next to the stream looking 
               for a half way decent spot. She sees the river and looks at it 
               in beauty just as she sees a body floating down it. MORE BODIES 
               start coming at a huge rate. 20,30,40,50 bodies floating down 
               the river. Rachel begins to hyperventilate again as Ray comes 
               up from behind her and throws his hands over her eyes and grabs 
               her. 

 
                                     RAY

                         I told you to stay where I could see 
                         you!

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I'm sorry!


               Ray grabs her into his arms and begins walking back to the van.

 
               
               Army trucks can be heard crossing by the van. Robbie, who's only 
               interest is killing one of the robots sees this as an opportunity 
               to do so. Robbie runs toward the trucks and begins shouting....

 
               
                                     ROBBIE

                         STOP!! DO YOU HAVE ROOM??? STOP!!!

 
                         
               Some trucks pass by as the soldiers in them look at him blankly.

 
               
                                     ROBBIE

                         WAIT, STOP!!! LET ME ON!!! LET ME ON!!! 
                         GIVE ME A HAND!!!

 
               Robbie is getting soaked as the tank's tracks roll over the large 
               puddles of water. Robbie is not giving up hope that one may let 
               him on. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         WAIT!!! STOP!!! GIVE ME A HAND!!! YOU 
                         HAVE ROOM!!!

 
                                     SOLDIER

                         Watch it, kid! YOU'RE GONNA GET YOURSLELF 
                         RUN OVER!!!

 
               Ray sees Robbie trying to get on with them. He has had enough 
               of Robbie and goes up to him to tell him....

 
                                     RAY

                         WHAT!?!?!  ROBBIE, YOU WANT TO GO IN 
                         THAT DIRECTION?

 
               Robbie, who ignores him is still shouting for them to stop.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         THERE'S NOTHING LIVING IN THAT DIRECTION, 
                         ROBBIE!!!

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         WHAT DO YOU CARE?!?!? YOU NEVER GAVE 
                         A SHIT BEFORE!!! YOU NEVER GAVE A SHIT!!!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         OKAY, HARD ASS, WHAT'S YOUR PLAN? YOU'RE 
                         IN CHARGE NOW, YOU TELL ME WHAT WE'RE

                                     ROBBIE

                         WE CATCH UP WITH THESE SOLDIERS, WE 
                         PICK UP WHOEVER ELSE ISN'T DEAD AND

                         THEM!! THAT'S WHAT WE DO!!!

 
                                     RAY

                         WELL, NOW LET'S TRY ONE THAT DOSEN'T 
                         INVOLVE YOUR TEN YEAR OLD SISTER JOINING 
                         THE ARMY! YOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT???

 
                         
               Ray and Robbie are about ready to start throwing punches at each 
               other as the tanks continue rolling by.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL US THE TRUTH???

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         YOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT!


                                     ROBBIE

                         YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHICH WAY TO GO!!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         YOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT?!?!?!

 
                         
                                     ROBBIE

                         YOU WANNA COME OFF ALL WISE AND SHIT!! 
                         YOU ONLY CHOSE BOSTON BECAUSE YOU HOPE 
                         MOM IS THERE AND IF SHE'S THERE, YOU 
                         CAN DUMP US ON HER!!! YOU CAN DUMP US 
                         ON HER THEN YOU'LL ONLY HAVE TO CARE

                         WAY YOU LIKE IT!!!

 
               Robbie is shivering in the cold of his wet clothes but his adrenaline 
               keeps him fighting at Ray. They both can be seen with the air 
               from their nostrils flaring like a bull. Rachel rushes in as 
               an attempt to get Robbie to realize what he's doing.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         ROBBIE!!! WHERE ARE YOU TRYING TO GO?!?! 
                         WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?!?!

 
               Rachel begins to cry as Robbie looks at her in sorrow. 


                                     RACHEL

                         WHOE'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF ME IF YOU 
                         GO!!!

 
               Rachel's last line almost brings Robbie to tears as he picks 
               her up and starts walking over to the van. Ray stands next to 
               the still rolling army vehicles and begins to realize how this 
               brother and sister have come to rely on each other during the 
               divorce of their parents.

 
               INT. VAN - DAY


               Robbie is staring out the window in the exact opposite direction 
               of Ray. The radio is broadcasting the emergency alert test. Ray 
               turns off the radio and says...

 
                                     RAY

                         If I close my eyes, why don't you drive 
                         for a bit.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         I don't have a license.


                                     RAY

                         Since when has that stopped you?


               INT. VAN - DUSK


               Robbie is driving into a city. Ray is sleeping in the passenger 
               seat. The streets are crowded with people walking. Robbie gets 
               worried and gets Ray to drive. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Ray. (no response) Ray. (no response) 
                         Dad!

 
               Ray wakes up and Robbie tries to get him to take the wheel.

 
               
                                     ROBBIE

                         You think you could.... You think you 
                         could...

 
                                     RAY

                         Don't stop... don't take your foot off... 
                         Okay. I got it... I got it....

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Where's everybody going?


                                     RAY

                         I don't know Rach. 


                                     RACHEL

                         But we do right?


                                     RAY

                         Yeah, we do.


               They continue driving through the crowd as they become more and 
               more mad at Ray for not letting them on. They begin banging on 
               the glass. 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Why'd he do that?


               The man continues hitting the windshield.


                                     RACHEL

                         Why is he doing that?


                                     RAY

                         He wants a ride. Everybody just wants 
                         a ride.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Can we give him one?


                                     RAY

                         Just sit back and put on your seatbelt. 
                         Robbie, put on your seatbelt. 

 
               Rachel is busy looking at all the people who are now begging 
               for a ride.

 
                                     RAY

                         Put on your seatbelt Rachel.


               The three of them fasten their seatbelts.


                                     ROBBIE

                         Be careful.


               People bang on the windows louder as they shout "give me a ride".

 
               
                                     RAY

                         I'm sorry, I can't. Please get away 
                         from the car.

 
               A police man jumps on the hood and bangs on the window.


                                     RAY

                         HEY!!


                                     POLICE MAN 3

                         Stop the car!!


                                     RAY AND ROBBIE TOGETHER

                         GET OFF THE CAR!!! GET OFF THE CAR!!!

 
                         
                                     POLICE MAN 3

                         You could carry 20 people in there! 
                         STOP THE CAR!!!

 
               Rachel is panicking and starts to do the "arms" process to stay 
               calm. 

 
                                     RAY AND ROBBIE TOGETHER

                         GET OFF THE CAR!!! GET OFF THE CAR!!!

 
                         
               Ray hit's the gas pedal as the police man falls off the side 
               of the van. Ray speeds away now and gains some speed just as 
               someone throws debris into the windshield which breaks it. Rachel 
               screams in panic.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (screams) AHHHH!!


                                     RAY

                         Oh hold on!!


               Robbie and Ray see a woman standing dead in their way holding 
               a baby. They swerve to miss her.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Look out! Look out!


                                     RAY

                         (seeing a telephone pole) Oh, GOD!

 
                         
               The van smashes into the telephone pole and the pole lurches 
               about 20 feet. The transformer on the top of the pole begins 
               to arc and spark. The crowd is now rocking the van from side 
               to side shouting at about a riot level. 

 
               INT. VAN - DUSK


                                     RAY

                         Are you okay?


               Rachel has no time to respond before the back windshield is busted 
               open by a crowd member. The driver and passenger side windows 
               are then promptly busted. Robbie ducks to avoid the flying glass. 
               A man jumps on the hood and starts ripping glass away from the 
               hole in the front windshield. He is so desperate to get in the 
               van he rips his hands to shreds. A crowd member suggests to "push 
               it". He does so and the glass falls through.

 
               The passenger side door is opened and Robbie is pulled out by 
               the rioting crowd. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         (screams) AHHHHH!!!! RAY!!!


                                     RAY

                         ROBBIE?!?! ROBBIE?!?!?


               Ray then screams to the rioting crowd who are now pulling him 
               out of the driver's side window.

 
                                     RAY

                         NO, JUST WAIT!!! WAIT!! STOP!!! JUST 
                         STOP!!!

 
                                     RACHEL

                         DADDY!!!!


               A man from the crowd runs up to Rachel's window, breaks it, and 
               tries to grab Rachel. Ray pulls the man out and throws him back 
               into the crowd. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Rachel!! (grabs guy) GET OUT OF THERE!!!

 
                         
               Ray is pushed by the man he just threw and hit's the driver's 
               side door. Ray kicks the guy square in the gut which gets him 
               back into the crowd.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         DADDY!!!


               Ray wrestles another man trying to grab Rachel. The man gets 
               tossed to the ground. Just as Ray stands up... WHAM!!! Ray is 
               hit in the back of the head by a man with a baseball bat. The 
               blow was not severe enough to cause life threatening damage to 
               Ray. 

 
                                     RAY

                         (grasping his head in pain) AHHH!!!

 
                         
               Another man grabs Ray to try to fight him. Women in the crowd 
               yell to "stop them" but nobody does so. The man who is strangling 
               Ray yells to "get in the car". Robbie fought off the men who 
               pulled him out of the car, comes over to Ray's side, and begins 
               choking the man who is choking Ray. Robbie hit's the man's head 
               against the car. The man releases his grip on Ray, the man and 
               Robbie are drug into the rioting crowd beyond frame view. 

 
               
               A man gets into the driver's seat and tries to start the car.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         (through a choking grip) Rachel, get 
                         out of the car! GET OUT OF THE CAR RACHEL!!!

 
                         
               Ray just barely finishes as he is drug off into the crowd beyond 
               frame. 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         DADDY!!!


               Rachel tries to get out, but there is an overflow of people barreling 
               into the car through the windows. She is surrounded by people 
               in the car. Robbie and Ray are getting beat in the crowd.

 
               
               Ray manages to pull out his gun. He fires off two rounds into 
               the air. The crowd instantly moves away from him. One man yells 
               "take it easy!" No sign of Robbie. 

 
                                     RAY

                         (pointing the gun at the people on the 
                         roof of the car) GET OFF THE CAR!! GET 
                         OFF!!!

 
               Men start getting off the car to avoid the gun threatening Ray. 
               

 
                                     RAY

                         (continues) GET OFF THE CAR!! Move!! 
                         Move!!

 
               Realizing Robbie is nowhere in sight....


                                     RAY

                         Where's my son?!?!


                                     RIOT MAN 1

                         You don't need that, Man!


                                     RAY

                         WHERE'S MY SON?!?! ROBBIE!!    .... 
                           ROBBIE!!

 
                                     RIOT MAN 2

                         Put the gun down, man. It's not me!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         (still determined to find Robbie) ROBBIE!!!

 
                         
               Ray is able to pull Robbie out from the crowd. Robbie has a running 
               bloody nose and a badly bruised stomach. He is fighting to catch 
               his breath because he had it knocked out of him.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         DAD!!!


               The camera moves from Robbie to Ray, then pivots on his face 
               to reveal a man holding another gun at Ray's head.

 
                                     RIOT MAN 3

                         Okay, man, now listen. Put down the 
                         gun. I'm taking the car. 

 
                                     RAY

                         My daughter's in the car...


                                     RIOT MAN 3

                         (shaking the gun nervously) Put down 
                         the gun, I'm taking the car.

 
                                     RAY

                         All I want is my daughter....


                                     RIOT MAN 3

                         PUT DOWN THE GOD DAMN GUN!!!


               Ray is scared into dropping his gun on the street. Ray then puts 
               his hands near his head to avoid being shot. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Please, all I want is my daughter. 

 
                         
                                     RIOT MAN 3

                         (surprisingly calm) I'm taking the car.

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         I just want my daughter. Please just 
                         let me take my daughter, can I.... All 
                         I want is my daughter. 

 
                                     RIOT MAN 3

                         Yeah. Okay, go ahead, take her, take 
                         her, yeah, yeah....

 
               Ray grabs Rachel out of the car as the riot man gets in the driver's 
               seat and closes the door. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Robbie!!


               Robbie, who has managed to get to his feet, hunched over, walks 
               over to Ray. Ray, with Rachel in his arms, and Robbie walk to 
               the diner on the street. The man backs up the car just as the 
               camera pans down to see a man who sees the gun on the street. 
               The man picks up Ray's gun and looks at the man in the van.

 
               
               INT. DINER - DUSK


               The three of them are walking to a booth in the diner. Ray, with 
               Rachel in his arms, is beginning to bleed from his head wound. 
               He walks with a slight limp. Rachel is panic stricken. Robbie 
               lets go of his bloody nose and, with both hands, clenches his 
               chest in pain. He is still fighting to catch his breath. They 
               are all soaked from the rain. 

 
               They all sit down at the booth. The power is flickering on and 
               off. As they begin to relax from the ordeal they just had, gunshots 
               are heard. BAM!! BAM!! Ray jumps and catches his head in his 
               hands as it throbs. Robbie jumps and flails his arms in pain 
               as the jump tightened muscles in his stomach. Robbie turns around 
               to see the man with Ray's gun firing at Riot Man 3. BAM! One 
               more gunshot is heard. Rachel scurries over to Robbie who, despite 
               his pain, grabs Rachel and they hug each other seeking comfort. 
               The van drives away.

 
               Rachel sobs as Ray also starts crying because nobody knows what 
               to do from here. Robbie looks at Ray for some comfort. He has 
               none.

 
               Walking Down the Street - Dusk


               They are walking in a crowd of about 300. Some men share their 
               stories of assumption. One man says... "Europe's got it the worst...." 
               while another man says "We've got it the worst......" while some 
               people "don't give a shit who it is....."

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Looks like the power's still on here.

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Yeah, power's still on because nothing 
                         bad has come up from under the ground.

 
                         
               A rail road crossing guard stick comes down as the bells and 
               lights start going off. The people stand behind the guard just 
               like cars. They wait. 

 
               A train approaches and is blowing off fireballs from an encounter 
               with a robot. The entire train is flaming and burning. The train, 
               as it whisks by is releasing pieces of red hot ash. The bars 
               go up as the train completes it's crossing. The people continue 
               walking.

 
               EXT. FERRY DOCK - DUSK


               Random, pointless music is playing over the PA system as people 
               are being herded by soldiers onto a ferry boat. A blood bank 
               woman says over a megaphone... 

 
                                     WOMAN

                         Unless you are O-positive and Rh negative, 
                         thank you but we already have more blood 
                         than we can use. Again... (repeats message)

 
                         
               Shots of the herded people boarding the ferry.


               Solders are heard and seen saying "this way" and "keep it moving 
               folks".

 
                                     HARBOR MASTER

                         Please move forward calmly, the boat 
                         can make more than one trip. Please 
                         move forward calmly, take your time, 
                         don't rush. (repeats)

 
                                     SHERYL

                         Ray! RAY?!?!


                                     RAY

                         Sheryl?


                                     SHERYL

                         Yeah.


               Ray and Sheryl hug as they are re-united.


                                     SHERYL

                         Oh, my gosh, are these your kids?

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Yes, this is Rachel.


                                     SHERYL

                         Hi, I'm Sheryl, this is my daughter, 
                         Nora. 

 
               Ray, Sheryl, Nora, and Rachel exchange handshakes.


                                     RAY

                         Hi, I've heard about you, Nora.


               Rachel looks at sea gulls that are flying rather fast away from 
               the boat. Robbie meets Sheryl with Ray.

 
                                     RAY

                         This is my son, Robbie.


                                     ROBBIE

                         Hi Sheryl.


                                     SHERYL

                         He's just like dad.


               Rachel continues watching the gulls.


                                     SHERYL

                         How you doing? You look like shit.

 
                         
               Rachel is now fully into watching the gulls. Ray, Sheryl, and 
               Robbie are engaged into small talk. Rachel sees the gulls flying 
               around something over the horizon behind the city.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (to herself) The trees are funny.

 
                         
                                     HARBOR MASTER

                         We're gonna move some cars out of the 
                         way to make more space. Give us a few 
                         minutes.

 
               Rachel watches the trees begin to be flattened and moved as something 
               gets brighter on the horizon. Rachel grabs Ray's finger and he 
               realizes that she wants him. Ray turns around to see what Rachel 
               wants as he too sees the thing on the horizon. Robbie sees Ray 
               looking that way, so he too looks that way. A robot puts it's 
               last foot down with a thud and looks at the dock full of people. 
               It makes the vibration noise which gets the attention of everybody. 
               The crowd begins overrunning the soldiers and cramming onto the 
               ship for safety. The captain sees the overflow and prepares the 
               ship for takeoff to try to stop the overflow. 

 
                                     CAPTAIN

                         CAST OFF!!! GET THAT RAMP UP!!!


                                     HARBOR MASTER

                         CAST OFF NOW!!! GET THAT RAMP UP!!! 
                         (to soldiers) No more people! No more 
                         people! We're taking the ramp up.

 
                         
               The soldiers create a blockade which holds back the crowd for 
               quite a while. As the crowd starts to collect, the soldiers start 
               to bulge forward from people pushing them. Three robots now switch 
               on their lights to look over the crowd of people. A moving crowd 
               of about 1,000 people is now collecting on the soldiers who so 
               far are withstanding. 

 
               Ray, now in the front next to a soldier, tries to get them to 
               let him and his family through. They say there is no more room.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         (to Sheryl) You just stay with me! Grab 
                         my jacket!

 
                                     SHERYL

                         I got you Ferrier. (trips) oh, Jesus!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         You okay? Come on!


                                     SHERYL

                         Jesus. Oh my god!


                                     RAY

                         Come on.


               The harbor master hit's the switch to start the ramp motor to 
               begin folding up the ramp. Soldiers shove empty cars off the 
               ramp. 

 
               Sheryl is knocked around by a few people and looses grip of Ray's 
               jacket. 

 
                                     SHERYL

                         Oh, Ray!! RAY!!!


               They run faster and Sheryl falls farther behind. Robbie makes 
               a grab for her hand but a soldier stops Sheryl just short. 

 
               
                                     SHERYL

                         NO, I CAN GO WITH HIM!!!  RAY!!!! NO!!!!

 
                         
               The ramp begins lifting as a few people make one last jump and 
               latch on to it. Ray looks back for Sheryl.

 
                                     RAY

                         SHERYL?!?!? SHERYL!!!!


                                     SHERYL

                         RAY!!!!


                                     RAY

                         There's room on the boat!!! 


                                     SHERYL

                         LET US THROUGH GOD DAMN IT!!!


                                     RAY

                         THERE'S STILL ROOM ON THE BOAT!!! THERE'S 
                         ROOM ON THE BOAT!!! THERE'S ROOM ON 
                         THE BOAT!!!

 
               Rachel screams as Ray runs to the bow with Rachel in his arms. 
               Robbie is soon to follow...

 
                                     RACHEL

                         ROBBIE?!?!


                                     RAY

                         Stay with me! Stay with me Robbie!!!

 
                         
               Robbie runs right past them and up to the captain's deck.


                                     RAY

                         ROBBIE!!!


               Robbie, panting hard, looks at the inclining ramp and sees there 
               are still people hanging on to the back side of the ramp. He 
               starts running to the stern of the ship.

 
               The captain pushes the throttle all the way full. The propellers 
               start so fast they spray water all over the people still at the 
               dock. Pulling away at it's ties to the dock, the ship begins 
               pulling away.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (seeing Robbie running to the stern) 
                         Robbie? Robbie!?!?!

 
                                     RAY

                         Robbie!!!


                                     RACHEL

                         ROBBIE!!!


               Robbie ignores them as he jumps onto the grate of the folded 
               up ramp. Climbing to the top, he begins helping those who are 
               hanging on the back side of the ramp. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Here, grab my hand!! Hold on! I got 
                         you! HOLD ON!!!

 
               Camera turns or Ray's face. Ray looks at Robbie helping people 
               in admiration and proud ness. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         TAKE MY HAND!! TAKE IT!!! 


               INT. CAPTAIN'S CONTROL ROOM - DUSK


               The captain sees some sort of whirlpool sucking water down into 
               a hole. The ship begins to slowly turn toward the hole, being 
               sucked in. 

 
                                     CAPTAIN

                         Oh, my god!


               Passengers rush over to the starboard railing where a robot emerges 
               from the whirlpool. WOOSH!!! Hundreds of gallons of water are 
               tossed up with the robot. The water in the air turns to snow 
               as it falls on the ship. The robot's engines howl in the air. 
               

 
                                     RAY

                         (fearing danger to his son) ROBBIE!!!

 
                         
               The robot's claws begin pushing the ship making it lean to one 
               side and finally tip over on it's side. Robbie is already running 
               towards Ray. At the turn of the ship, the three go into the water. 
               Cars start coming towards them. WOOSH!!! A car comes right for 
               them. SPLASH!!! The car hit's the water where they are, instantly 
               pinning Robbie and Ray to the front of it. Rachel is holding 
               on to Robbie's back, also going down.

 
               The people in the car are screaming as the car fills with water. 
               

 
               As the ship completely capsizes, people are thrown or washed 
               into the water. Cars sink down, people float and the ship bobs 
               in the water. Ray is able to un-pin himself and pulls Robbie 
               out. They all begin swimming to the surface. Rachel lags behind 
               and Robbie grabs her and helps her up.  At the surface, they 
               meet. A ship propeller at full power. They begin to swim away 
               from it. Claws from the ship over head are grabbing people and 
               pulling them into the robot's holds. 

 
               EXT. BEACH - DARK


               Ray is heaving Rachel up to shore. Robbie is not far behind. 
               They are all fighting to get their breath after swimming for 
               so long. Ray can no longer haul Rachel up the beach. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Help me. Help me with her.


                                     ROBBIE

                         (gagging) Okay.


               Robbie almost slips as he gags, still fighting for breath. 

 
               
               Pulling each other up the hill....


                                     RAY

                         Don't stop. Don't stop.


               Alert sirens can be heard coming from the city.


               Ray pulls the two of them. 


                                     ROBBIE

                         (yells in pain) AHHH.


               They all lay on the hillside, gasping for air. In the distance 
               they look... Two robots are still picking people up out of the 
               water. Two more robots have joined and are picking up people 
               off the streets. Many people scream. 

 
               With jaws clattering, Rachel looks toward the other hillside 
               on the other side of the river. Shivering Ray and Robbie look 
               there with her. 

 
               THREE MORE robots are on the opposite hillside blasting people 
               with their disintegrator beams. Many more people scream. Rachel, 
               in fright, runs towards the bushes behind Ray. Ray sees her, 
               and runs with her. Robbie runs with them. They stop and squat 
               down as they see the top of another robot coming over the hill 
               to join the three. 

 
               Robbie, running, with clenched teeth, stops. His jaw drops as 
               we are able to see hundreds of thousands of articles of clothing 
               falling from the sky. They continue running through the woods 
               where clothes fall like snow. 

 
               Pasture Fence Line - Dark


               Robbie is walking 5' ahead of Ray and Rachel along a fence line 
               of a pasture. Gunfire is seen and heard over the hill about 500 
               yards away. Robbie, who always wanted to help in the fight, begins 
               walking faster toward the gunfire.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Robbie, slow down.


               Robbie follows the fence line and walks a little faster.


                                     RACHEL

                         Robbie, slow down!!!


               Robbie, who is coming closer to the hill, sees army trucks rolling 
               down the road and up the hill. Seeing this, Robbie walks into 
               a slow run along the fence line. Ray and Rachel try to keep up. 
               

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Robbie.


                                     RAY

                         Robbie. We got to stay together Robbie.

 
                         
               Robbie, getting closer, runs faster, faster.


                                     RAY

                         Robbie! Stay together! ROBBIE!!!


               Ray and Rachel duck as a missile comes EXTREMELY CLOSE to their 
               heads. Jets speed by them overhead. Rachel screams.

 
                                     RAY

                         GET BACK HERE!!!


               Robbie, in a full scale run, runs with the army trucks that have 
               now taken to the hills. Ray and Rachel run as fast as they can 
               to try to stay with Robbie.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Robbie!! NO!! ROBBIE!!! COME BACK!!!

 
                         
               Robbie runs with the trucks with all his might. Ray and Rachel 
               are now searching for him.

 
                                     RAY

                         ROBBIE!!! (sets Rachel down next to 
                         a tree) NOW DON'T MOVE! FOR GOD'S SAKE, 
                         STAY RIGHT HERE! I'M COMING RIGHT BACK! 
                         (calling out for him) ROBBIE!!!

 
               Ray sees Robbie about 20' ahead of him. 


                                     RAY

                         ROBBIE!!! ROBBIE!!!


               Robbie is held back by two soldiers. Robbie gets thrown back 
               by them where Ray grabs him and pins him to the ground. Robbie 
               fights to get back up.

 
                                     RAY

                         WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS???


               Soldiers are blasting everything they have to something over 
               the hill. Radio people are telling their officers "no effect 
               on target". 

 
               Robbie is watching all he is able to see while Ray tries to get 
               his attention on him.

 
                                     RAY

                         LISTEN TO ME! TURN AROUND! I WANT YOU 
                         TO LISTEN TO ME!

 
               Robbie ignores him and continues watching artillery blast over 
               the hill. 

 
               Ray gets fed up with Robbie. He grabs his shoulders and flips 
               him over on to his back. Robbie looks at Ray in fright that he 
               did that. Ray grabs his coat shoulders, and climbs on top of 
               him, pining him down to the ground. 

 
                                     RAY

                         LISTEN TO ME! 


               Rachel watches helicopters fire missiles simultaneously over 
               the hill. 

 
                                     RAY

                         DON'T DO THIS! I LOVE YOU!


                                     ROBBIE

                         I NEED TO BE HERE! I NEED TO SEE THIS!!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         I KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE TO BUT 
                         YOU DON'T!!!

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         LET ME GO!!!


                                     RAY

                         YOU DON'T!!!


                                     ROBBIE

                         PLEASE LET ME GO!!!


               Rachel is approached by people. They think she's alone so they 
               try to talk her into coming with them (ad lib). 

 
                                     RAY

                         I'M NOT LETTING YOU DO THIS!! YOU CAN 
                         HATE ME.....

 
               Robbie tries to fight to get up but Ray keeps him pinned to the 
               ground.

 
                                     RAY

                         ... YOU CAN HATE ME. BUT I LOVE YOU!!

 
                         
                                     ROBBIE

                         LET ME GO PLEASE!!!


                                     RAY

                         I'M NOT LETTING YOU DO THIS!!!


                                     ROBBIE

                         DAD!!


               Ray sees the couple trying to get Rachel to go with them. For 
               a second, Ray doesn't know what to do. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Just listen to me!


                                     ROBBIE

                         I need to be here! I want to see this!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Wait, stay. Stay for Rachel. Stay for 
                         your sister. 

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Please let me go! You need to let me 
                         go.

 
               Ray and Robbie are silent for what seems to them like forever. 
               Ray looks to Rachel who is being carried away by the couple. 
               Robbie manages to turn back over to his stomach. After enough 
               trying, Robbie is able to squirm out of Ray's grasp on his shoulders. 
               

 
               Robbie crawls out of Ray's grasp and stands up. They stare at 
               each other for a while and Robbie begins running over the hill. 
               Ray runs over to Rachel to get her back from the couple.

 
                                     RAY

                         GET OFF!!! I'M HER FATHER!!! I'M HER 
                         FATHER!!! 

 
                                     WOMAN

                         We thought she was alone... we....

 
                         
               She doesn't finish as she scurries away. Ray looks at the hill 
               where the soldiers were firing at... A FLAMING army truck rolls 
               over the hill. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Robbie?!?!


               Two more trucks come over the hill ablaze. Suddenly... BOOM!!! 
               A ring of mine charges go off at the peak of the hill. The explosion 
               blast is almost big enough to knock Ray off of his feet. 

 
               
                                     RAY


                         ROBBIE!!!


               By now, Robbie has run over the hill and is long out of site. 
               A robot that appears to be on fire comes slowly rising over the 
               hill. Ray makes a run for it down the hill. We can see three 
               robots now rising over the hill. Missiles and bullets are being 
               fired at them as their shields block all the fired artillery. 
               

 
               EXT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - CELLAR DOOR - NIGHT


               Harland lives in the basement of his house about 300 feet away 
               from the hill that the robots came over. He is holding a rifle 
               as a signal for anybody who can see him.

 
                                     HARLAND

                         Over here! OVER HERE!!!


               Ray and Rachel run towards him. 


                                     HARLAND

                         Hurry!!


               The three of them scurry into the basement. Ray and Rachel run 
               into the main room while Harland proceeds to close the cellar 
               doors. Gunfire can be heard alongside the screams from people. 
               Lights flash through the cracks in the walls and door. 

 
               INT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DUSK - CONTINUOUS 


               Harland walks up to the lantern hanging on the wall and looks 
               at Ray and Rachel. His face, half lit looks medieval with the 
               clothes he wears. 

 
               Harland grabs the lantern and carries it over to where Ray and 
               Rachel are huddled shivering in their damp clothes. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         (to Rachel) You all right?


               Rachel does not respond most likely due to shock. 


                                     HARLAND

                         (to Ray) And what about you?


               Ray looks up at him and looks at the lantern. He is still heard 
               muttering "Robbie" very quietly.

 
               Harland moves a wheel barrel as rats are seen scurrying about 
               on the floor. The army platoon has gone far enough over the hill 
               that gunfire can no longer be seen or heard. 

 
                                     RAY

                         (while Harland moves the wheel barrel) 
                         (to Rachel) There you go. Is that comfortable? 
                         I need you to close your eyes now, okay? 
                         You need some sleep.

 
               Rachel's face is pure white with some red around her eyes.

 
               
                                     RACHEL

                         Dad?


               Ray already knows what she is going to ask.


                                     RAY

                         He's gonna meet us. Hey, Robbie's gonna 
                         meet us, Rach, In Boston, at your grandma's.

 
                         
               Harland is watching them through fallen out boards in the wall. 
               

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (about ready to cry) What do you think 
                         mom's doing right this minute?

 
               Harland sits down on the stairs to listen to their conversation. 
               He begins sharpening a shovel with a file. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Mom? She's in Boston. Waiting. And I 
                         know she's not sleeping 'cause she is 
                         so worried about you. (trying to comfort 
                         her) ... And she's in grandma's kitchen, 
                         and she's making that awful tea that 
                         she makes. And they're all just... ... 
                         ...there all just counting the minutes 
                         until they see you again.

 
               Rachel is crying because she misses Robbie and her mom. Ray sees 
               the first place ribbon she keeps carrying around and begins to 
               investigate what it is.

 
                                     RAY

                         (picking up the ribbon) What is this? 
                         What... What is this?

 
                                     RACHEL

                         I won.


                                     RAY

                         You won?


                                     RACHEL

                         The walk, trot, and canter. Third place.

 
                         
               She begins to feel dreary...


                                     RACHEL

                         Sing me "Lullaby and Goodnight"?


                                     RAY

                         (shakes his head in displeasure because 
                         he can't think of it) I don't remember 
                         that one.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Sing me "Hushabye Mountain"?


                                     RAY

                         I'm sorry Rach, I don't know that one 
                         either. 

 
               Rachel turns over (her back to Ray) because she realizes that 
               it is a lost hope to get a song out of him. Ray thinks for a 
               moment and remembers an old nursery rhyme he was taught. 

 
               
                                     RAY

                         (begins to sing) I'm not bragging, baby. 
                         So don't put me down. Because I've got 
                         the fastest set of wheels in the town. 
                         Something comes up to me that don't 
                         even try....

 
               Rachel turns back over as Ray continues singing...


                                     RAY

                         (continues singing) ... If I had a set 
                         of wings, man, I know she could fly. 
                         She's my little deuce coupe. You don't 
                         know what I've got... just my little 
                         deuce coupe. (now whispering) You don't 
                         know what I've got....

 
               Rachel has fallen asleep. Ray kisses her on the forehead. Harland 
               taps two glasses together and says...

 
                                     HARLAND

                         Peach schnapps. 


               Ray gets up and begins walking towards him.


                                     HARLAND

                         Disgusting, I know it. I found a whole 
                         case of this shit. 

 
               Harland hands Ray a glass as they both sit down. 


                                     RAY

                         Thank you. 


               Silence falls over for a period.


                                     HARLAND

                         I'm sorry about your son.


                                     RAY

                         We got separated... he's gonna meet 
                         us in umm... in Boston.

 
               Ray drinks the schnapps as he begins to ask...


                                     RAY

                         Did you... (pauses) ... (whispers) Did 
                         you loose anybody? 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         All of them. 


               Another pause.


                                     HARLAND

                         (introduces himself) Harland Ogilvy. 
                         

 
                                     RAY

                         (introduces himself) Ray Ferrier.

 
                         
               They shake hands.


                                     HARLAND

                         I got water... Food.... Enough for weeks. 
                         You're welcome to stay, both of yous.

 
                         
               Ray gets up from the conversation.


                                     RAY

                         I'm sorry. I'm gonna get some sleep. 
                         

 
                                     HARLAND

                         (speaks loud enough to get Ray to pause) 
                         Those machines, those tripods they got... 
                         They buried them... right under our 
                         feet. Since before there were even people 
                         here. They've been planning this for 
                         a million years. We're beat to shit.

 
                         
               Ray looks at Harland sternly because he is afraid Rachel may 
               hear what he may say next. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Please, my daughter.


                                     HARLAND

                         Think about it.    ...    They defeated 
                         the greatest power in the world in a 
                         couple days. Walked right over us.  
                          ....    And these are only the first, 
                         they'll keep coming. This is not a war 
                         any more than there's a war between 
                         men and maggots. This is an extermination.

 
                         
               Ray walks over to where Rachel is sleeping.


                                     HARLAND

                         (feeling he's not grasping the reality) 
                         Are you afraid?

 
                                     RAY

                         Of course I am.


                                     HARLAND

                         (going on) I been around death plenty. 
                         Drive an ambulance in the city. Well, 
                         drove and ambulance in the city. That's 
                         all over now, huh?    ....   You know 
                         the people who make it Ray? The ones 
                         that don't flatline before the hospital? 
                         It's the ones who keep their eyes open, 
                         keep looking at you, keep thinking. 
                           ....    There the ones who survive... 
                            ....   We can' t loose our heads 
                         Ray.   ....   Running, that's what'll 
                         kill you.    ......     I'm dead set 
                         on livin'.

 
               He pauses and begins chuckling at his own joke.


                                     HARLAND

                         Hah. Dead set on Living. 


               Harland walks back over to the place where the conversation first 
               started. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Thank you for taking us in.


               Ray lies down next to Rachel as Harland finishes...


                                     HARLAND

                         We're not going to be exterminated.

 
                         
               The ground starts shaking from robots walking around outside. 
               Ray gets back up just as BOOM!! A small piece of the corner of 
               the basement collapses from all the vibration. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         (with shotgun at side) It's okay! Come 
                         on, I wanna show you something!

 
               They both are waling towards a window. 


                                     HARLAND

                         We're gonna fight them Ray. They gotta 
                         have a weakness. Come on, take a look. 
                         

 
               Ray and Harland see two robots spraying vine like strands out 
               of a hole on the bottom of the ship onto the ground.

 
                                     HARLAND

                         Somehow they killed a few of these things 
                         in Osaka. That's what I heard. You telling 
                         me the Japanese can figure it out but 
                         we can't? 

 
               Ray goes over to Rachel and picks her up to take her somewhere 
               else. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         We can do it. We can get 'em. We can 
                         figure it out. 

 
               Ray puts the now wide awake Rachel in a chair. 


                                     RAY

                         Stay right there!


               Ray opens up a window guard to see two robots skimming the ground 
               almost as if they are tilling up the soil. He now understands 
               that robots do this on a regular basis.

 
                                     RAY

                         I have a daughter! Why did you bring 
                         us here?

 
                                     HARLAND

                         To fight 'em together, Ray.   ....  
                          Now we'll be the ones coming up from 
                         underground. When the time is right, 
                         we'll take 'em by supries, the way they 
                         took us. We'll take 'em by surprise. 
                         

 
               Ray puts his hands over his face as he realizes he is staying 
               with an insane man. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         We're right under their feet, Ray. Right 
                         here, under their feet. 

 
               INT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NEAR DUSK


               Ray looks at the mysterious red plant that is growing wildly. 
               He feels it and them snaps a piece of it off of a pipe. He examines 
               it closely as he walks over to the window where lights are beaming 
               in and out as the robots work. He takes another piece of a wall 
               and studies that one. 

 
               Ray hears a hovering craft over his head. A light flows over 
               the roof boards that streams down to the other end of a board 
               hall in the basement. Harland is sitting on the stairs with Rachel.

 
               
                                     HARLAND

                         You miss your mommy? I had a little 
                         girl nearly your age. You know, if anything 
                         happens to your daddy, I'll take care 
                         of you. 

 
               Ray is very angry that Harland is saying things like that to 
               his daughter.

 
                                     RAY

                         Rachel!


               Rachel runs towards him and he points to stand beside him. They 
               both stare at Harland, on the stairs, in dismay. 

 
                                     RAY

                         (distinctly angry, but not yelling) 
                         You don't have anything to say to her, 
                         do you understand? If you want to talk 
                         to somebody, or ask somebody a question, 
                         you ask me!

 
                                     HARLAND

                         (also angry at Ray) What exactly is 
                         your plan, Ray? I know what I'm gonna 
                         do. How about you? You gonna sit here, 
                         wait for them to come get you? Is that 
                         your plan?

 
               Harland walks around to different parts of the basement doing 
               miscellaneous things. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         Maybe you want to get caught. Couple 
                         of days hiding in a basement too much 
                         for you, I bet. You'll probably turn 
                         yourself right in! 

 
               The robots outside stop moving. All the rumbling stops. 


                                     RAY

                         Listen. It stopped.


                                     HARLAND

                         (paying no attention) Maybe you'll be 
                         okay. Maybe you'll get lucky and they'll 
                         train you as their pet. You know, train 
                         you, feed you, teach you how to do tricks...

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         (yells) WILL YOU SHUT UP AND LISTEN?!?!?!

 
                         
               Pieces of wood fall from the hole as a robot camera comes floating 
               down into the hole. Ray hides behind the stairs. The camera eye 
               opens and lights turn on for it. 

 
               Rachel is hiding as well. The camera looks around the couch. 
               Ray moves as to not be seen by it moving around the couch. It 
               sees a rat and quickly follows it for a few seconds. Ray and 
               Harland exchange looks as Ray runs toward Rachel to hide with 
               her. 

 
               The robot continues checking out the basement. Harland grabs 
               an axe to cut off the camera from it's limb. Ray shakes his head 
               no to get him to stop. Ray silently does expressions to convince 
               him not to. 

 
               Harland goes towards ray so they can hide together. Harland almost 
               makes it before he thuds against a cabinet full of glass containers 
               which clang together. The robot hears this and turns around toward 
               the noise. They run to a different spot.

 
               Robot gets closer...


               Ray puts a mirror in front of the doorway to trick the robot 
               into seeing another robot. The camera looks over the mirror and 
               sees nothing. 

 
               It turns around just as... Rachel's boot slides, making a noise. 
               The robot views into the boot that is hanging out. It looks behind 
               the mirror to find just a boot sitting there. Ray, Rachel and 
               Harland are in the middle of the basement. A sight of relief 
               comes as the robot camera exit's out of the hole.

 
               Now the actual aliens come into the basement. Harland turns the 
               lantern out and runs to hide. The aliens look around the basement. 
               They look at, smell, and touch various different things throughout 
               the basement. Ray, Rachel, and Harland scurry to different parts 
               of the basement.

 
               Harland loads his gun and aims it to fire at one of the aliens 
               but the gun is pulled back by Ray.

 
                                     RAY

                         (dead silent) Give me that!


               Ray and Harland are in a silent fight for the gun. They both 
               have their hands on it. The aliens continue looking around. 

 
               
               Ray and Harland are both sweating bullets fighting for the gun. 
               Still silently.  Harland pins Ray against the wall and forces 
               him down to the ground to try and break the gun free of his grasp.

 
               
               The aliens are seen taking and smelling a photograph from a box. 
               

 
               Ray lets go of the gun and Harland jerks it away from him just 
               as the vibration like noise is heard from the robot. The aliens 
               scurry out through the open hole.

 
               Harland comes down to Ray, now sitting on the floor, and says....

 
               
                                     HARLAND

                         You and I... I don't  think we are on 
                         the same page. 

 
               INT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY


               The vines ray looked at are growing at a phenomenal rate along 
               the concrete slab under the window. Robots are spraying a red 
               mist out of the back of their ships. Ray holds his hand in the 
               mist that is entering the window.  After a moment.... Ray retracts 
               his hand and turns it over to reveal what appears to be blood. 
               

 
                                     HARLAND

                         RAY!!! RAY!!!! RAY!!!! RAY!!!! 


                                     RAY

                         KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN!!! QUIET!!! 

 
                         
               Harland turns around and his whole face is covered in spots of 
               blood. 

 
               They both turn back around then Harland runs. Ray watches a man 
               being set down, fighting to be let go. A needle like object comes 
               down and stabs the man. It then pumps the blood out of him. Ray 
               has a horrified look on his face. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         (repeats for about 2 minutes) Not My 
                         Blood!!!

 
               Ray realizes they will have the same fate if he keeps yelling. 
               Then... the robots stop because they hear him. Ray runs to Harland 
               who is digging some sort of hole. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Stop it! Stop it! You gotta stop it! 
                         You gotta be quiet or they'll hear you!

 
                         
                                     HARLAND

                         (with an insane expression and tone) 
                         They drink us!

 
                                     RAY

                         Please, they'll hear you!


                                     HARLAND

                         Then they spray us, like a fertilizer!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         You gotta be quiet!


                                     HARLAND

                         Drink US and....


                                     RAY

                         They're gonna come back down here!

 
                         
               Harland has mentally lost it now. 


                                     HARLAND

                         Then they spit us out all over their 
                         goddamn red weeds!

 
                                     RAY

                         (no longer whispering) Do you understand 
                         what I'm gonna have to do? I can't let 
                         my daughter die because of you. 

 
                         
               Harland pays no attention to him.


                                     HARLAND

                         This tunnel will get us to the city. 
                         We'll have our own tunnels there. Ready 
                         Made! Subway, see what I'm saying!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Stop it!


                                     HARLAND

                         You can hide a whole army down there!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Stop it!!


                                     HARLAND

                         ... We'll go underground!


                                     RAY

                         STOP IT!!!


                                     HARLAND

                         Sneak attacks at night!


                                     RAY

                         YOU STOP IT!!!


               Ray grabs him by the arm just as he hits ray in the forehead 
               with a shovel. Ray releases his grip and lies on a dirt pile 
               next to Harland. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         We're the resistance Ray! They can't 
                         occupy this country! Occupations always 
                         fail! History's taught us that a thousand 
                         times. This is our land.

 
               Ray runs up the stairs of the room to Rachel standing calmly 
               in the middle of the basement. 

 
                                     HARLAND

                         (continues) ... We eat it, we breathe 
                         it, only we can live on it! They can't 
                         survive here Ray. They weren't built 
                         for it.

 
               Ray hugs Rachel because he knows what he has to do. 


               Harland goes on saying odd things as Ray gets Rachel prepared 
               for what he has to do.

 
               Ray puts a black cloth over Rachel's eyes which makes her breathing 
               go erratic. 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         What are you doing?


                                     RAY

                         Whatever you hear... don't take this 
                         off.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Dad??


                                     RAY

                         Rach?


                                     RACHEL

                         Dad?


                                     RAY

                         What was that song... that lullaby I 
                         didn't know?

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Hushabye Mountains


                                     RAY

                         Yeah. Please, Rach, sing it. 


                                     RACHEL

                         (begins to sing) ... A gentle breeze....

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         Don't stop.


                                     RACHEL

                         ... On Hushabye Mountain...


                                     RAY

                         That's my girl.


                                     RACHEL

                         ... For far away my baby goes...


               Ray kisses her hands and has her put them over her ears. Then 
               walks back to Harland. He is still digging and chanting "not 
               my blood"

 
                                     RACHEL

                         ... it fills the sails ... 


               Harland stops and sees Ray standing in the doorway.


                                     RACHEL

                         ... of boats that are waiting ...

 
                         
               Ray closes the door behind him as he steps in. 


                                     RACHEL

                         ... Waiting to sail your worries away 
                         ...

 
               Rachel hears screams and grunts as the two men fight behind the 
               door.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         ... So close your eyes. You're on Hushabye 
                         Mountain ... 

 
               Rachel's voice begins trembling as she holds her ears tighter.

 
               
                                     RACHEL

                         ... Wave goodbye to the cares of the 
                         day and watch your boat, from Hushabye 
                         Mountain, sail far away from Lullaby 
                         Bay. 

 
               All is silent for a while. Ray opens the door and walks out. 
               Rachel releases her hands and takes off the blindfold. Ray is 
               sitting on the stairs. 

 
               Rachel sits in his lap and puts his arms around her. They both 
               sit there in silence. 

 
               INT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DUSK


               Ray and Rachel are sleeping on the couch. As we view down from 
               Ray's face we find that Rachel is wide awake for some reason. 
               She sits up and....

 
                                     RACHEL

                         (screams) AHHHH!!!


               A robot camera is 1' away from her face. Rachel runs to the wall, 
               still screaming as ray hit's the camera with his hands. The camera 
               hit's the ceiling and shakes it's self off of debris. 

 
               Ray begins blasting the axe he had in hand into the camera attachment 
               line. Rachel screams as he hit's the line. Over and over and 
               over. Rachel runs up the basement stairs. Ray continues hitting 
               it and it finally pulls away. The camera, still attached by a 
               hair, hits some wood planks and is pulled out of the hole. 

 
               
                                     RAY

                         Rachel???


               No response for a few seconds, then Rachel lets off a gut wrenching 
               scream. 

 
                                     RAY

                         RACHEL!!!  (to himself) Oh, my god, 
                         no!

 
               He runs up the stairs to search for her in the house. 


                                     RAY

                         Rachel? Rachel? (looks up the stairs) 
                         Rachel??

 
               Ray opens the front door to find red vines coated in blood in 
               the doorway. He quickly brushes them down stepping out the door. 
               

 
                                     RAY

                         (searching) Rachel, make some noise 
                         baby. Rachel??

 
               He begins walking down a path to look for her farther out.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         Rachel? Rachel? Talk to me baby, come 
                         on!

 
               He gets no response from Rachel. All is dead silent accept for 
               him. 

 
                                     RAY

                         Rachel?!? RACHEL?!?!?!


               Ray sees an entire field of blood coated red vines beyond the 
               hill. 

 
                                     RAY

                         RACHEL!!!! RACHEL!!!


               A robot's lights turn on to him as a food lands close enough 
               to him to blow him back. One of the robot's grabbing claws comes 
               after Ray. He hides in a truck. The claw breaks through the glass, 
               grabs the car, and flips it, causing it to roll about 3 times. 
               

 
                                     RAY

                         (screams) AHH!


               Now in the car, lying upside down, he hears Rachel scream. He 
               looks and Rachel is standing at the top of a hill. 

 
               The robot centers above her and begins to grab her with a claw. 
               Ray runs towards her to try and do what he can to stop it. 

 
               
                                     RACHEL

                         (screams) AHHHHH!!!!


                                     RAY

                         NO NO NO!!!


               The robot blasts through a building. Ray is right behind the 
               foot. He runs into an army vehicle and finds a belt full of grenades. 
               He takes on off, removes the pin and throws it at the robot.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         HEY!!!


               It hit's the robot's shields and the robot turns right around. 
               It eyeballs Ray for a moment and picks him up by a grabbing claw. 
               

 
                                     RAY

                         (screams in pain) AHHH!


               He is thrown into a cage with about 30 other people in it as 
               well. The gate closes on the top as he is thrown in. The camera 
               shows he is in one of two cages. People scream and cry in confusion. 
               Ray spots Rachel sitting on the side of the grate.

 
                                     RAY

                         RACHEL!!


               He goes towards her just as the door opens, it makes a sound 
               and a grabbing claw comes out of a hole on the robot. Ray falls 
               down (luckily), it grabs another person and sucks him into the 
               ship. The same happens in the other cage. 

 
                                     RAY

                         (reaching Rachel) Rachel. (no response) 
                         Rachel.

 
               She seems to be frozen.

                         Rachel.


                                     RACHEL

                         Dad?


               Ray goes to speak just as BOOM! The grate shifts, tossing all 
               the people around and the door opens to take another person up. 
               Ray ducks down with Rachel but this is noticed by the grabbing 
               claw. He is swept up by it. Rachel holds on to his neck to go 
               with him. But then, Ray sees his belt of grenades. He prigs Rachel's 
               hands off of him and grabs the grenades. A soldier sees this 
               and latches onto Ray's arm.

                         Pull me! Pull me!!!


               People all start latching on to the soldier and begin heaving 
               him and Ray down. They loose ground until more people join. 

 
               
                                     SOLDIER 2

                         We got him! Keep pulling! Pull me!

 
                         
               Ray is let loose by the clamp and they all fall back into the 
               cage. Ray spits out two grenade pins out of his mouth. This is 
               seen by the soldier.

                         EVERYBODY DOWN!!!


               Hardly anybody gets down as the inside of the robot explodes. 
               We can see the robot exploding on the inside. It breaks doors 
               and fluid stars spilling out of it. The robot releases it's cages 
               and they fall into a tree. Splitting open. People promptly climb 
               out. 

 
               Once the robot falls to the ground, Rachel looks at Ray in a 
               way that meant how did you do that.

               Ray walks with Rachel down the road as soldiers are ushering 
               them to "keep moving." The crows are now eating the red plant 
               which appears to be dying rapidly.  Ray picks up a piece, of 
               dead plant.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         What happened to it?


               Ray crumples the plant in his hand. It turns to dust and blows 
               away.

 
                                     RAY

                         It's dying. 


               Watching the dust, they walk along to find a robot lying half 
               struck into a building. 

 
                                     RAY

                         What happened?


                                     SOLDIER 3

                         I don't know, something's happening 
                         to them. Please keep moving.

 
               Ray goes up to another soldier for information.


                                     RAY

                         Something's happening to them?


                                     SOLDIER 4

                         Go. Go. Just keep moving, sir. 


               Ray asks another soldier down the road for information.


                                     RAY

                         Excuse me, excuse me, what happened 
                         here? You guys take it down? 

 
                                     SOLDIER 5

                         No sir, it was behaving erratically, 
                         walking in circles then it went down 
                         on it's own about an hour ago. (to people) 
                          Now let's keep moving, don't stop do 
                         not stop! Keep moving!

 
               Rachel and Ray are walking down the road with soldiers and other 
               people.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         How is it dead all by it's self?


                                     RAY

                         Rachel, I'm not sure. 


               Seeing another robot, one soldier motions to get into the water 
               tunnel. Other soldiers make signals to get set up for defense 
               if necessary. Everyone gets into the tunnel. A soldier can be 
               heard telling everyone "calm down and get in the tunnel".

 
               
               Ray notices that birds are flying over AND LANDING ON the robot. 
               The robot's shields are down. As he goes to tell someone, the 
               robot makes the viberating sound. 

 
                                     RAY

                         (to a soldier, during the robot noise) 
                         LOOK AT THE BIRDS!!!

 
                                     SOLDIER 6

                         I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!!


                                     RAY

                         LOOK AT THE BIRDS!!!


                                     SOLDIER 6

                         I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!


                                     RAY

                         (louder) LOOK AT THE GOD DAMN BIRDS!!!

 
                         
               The soldier looks at them and doesn't get what Ray's getting 
               at. He looks back at Ray. The noise continues erratically as 
               if the robot is fighting to stay alive.

 
                                     RAY

                         NO SHIELDS!!!


                                     SOLDIER 6

                         (motions and says) I CAN'T HEAR YOU!!!

 
                         
                                     RAY

                         (pointing) NO SHIELDS!!!


                                     SOLDIER 6

                         (now getting it) (to the soldiers) THE 
                         JAVELIN'S THE KEY! LOAD THE GUSTAV, 
                         IT'S GONNA BE A TOUGH KILL!!! LET'S 
                         GO!!!

 
               Ray gets in the tunnel as all the soldiers come running out.

 
               
                                     RAY

                         (to the people in the tunnel and Rachel) 
                         It's safer in here!

 
                                     SOLDIER 6

                         LETS GO!!! BRIGN OUT THE JAVELIN!!!

 
                         
               Soldiers scurry to get set up and they hurriedly fire missiles 
               at the robot. The first missile hit's the grabbing claws and 
               knocks them off. A few more shots and the robot collapses into 
               a nearby factory. The factory explodes and the robot grinds to 
               a halt on the ground. They check it to be clear as an alien falls 
               out of the door. It quickly dies on site. 

 
                                     SOLDIER 6

                         IT'S CLEAR!


               We watch the alien turn to stone as it dies.


               Boston - Walking Down Street near Mary Ann's Mother's house - 
               Day

 
               Mary Ann walks up to the front door and sees Ray walking down 
               the street with Rachel in his arms. She flutters open the doors 
               and she and Rachel run towards each other on the street. Mary 
               Ann begins crying.

 
                                     RACHEL

                         MOM!!!


               They hug each other crying. 


               Mary Ann looks at Ray who is still standing in the middle of 
               the street. 

 
                                     MARY ANN

                         (just barely hearable) Thank you.

 
                         
               Mary Ann's parents come out of the door. The mother has a shocked 
               look on her face. Tim is behind them. 

 
               Ray's eyes and face perk up as we see ROBBIE coming down the 
               front steps towards him. 

 
                                     RACHEL

                         Robbie?


               Ray and Robbie take a good look at each other and Robbie finally 
               mutters with a dry throat.

 
                                     ROBBIE

                         Hey dad!


               They hug each other in thankfulness for each other's survival.

                         From the moment the invaders arrived, 
                         breathed our air, ate and drank, they 
                         were doomed. They were undone, destroyed, 
                         after all of man's weapons and devices 
                         had failed, by the tiniest creatures 
                         that God and his wisdom, put upon this 
                         earth. At the toll of a billion deaths, 
                         man had earned his immunity, is right 
                         to survive among this planet's infinite 
                         organisms. And that right is ours against 
                         all challenges, for men do not live 
                         nor die in vein.
