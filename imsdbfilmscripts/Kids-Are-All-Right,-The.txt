    The humming stillness of an American suburb on a summer's
    day: nannies push strollers, joggers jog, mailmen deliver,
    dogs are walked, kids shoot hoop in wide open driveways.

    On a quiet, tree-lined street we pick up two young athletic-
    looking boys riding bikes. LASER ALLGOOD (15) and his
    friend, CLAY (15).

    Like bats out of hell they pass block after block of
    charming, evenly spaced houses until they round a corner and
    drop their bikes in front of a large ranch house.

    They walk inside.   We HEAR a baseball game on TV in another
    room.

    Clay pounds on blue pills with a hammer, reducing them to
    powder. Laser watches.
                        LASER
              I don't know, dude.

    Clay cuts the powder into lines with a school ID card.
                        CLAY
              B minus in geometry, yo!   This
              shits the bomb!

    Clay rolls up a dollar bill and takes a snort.   Then hands
    the rolled up bill to Laser.

                        CLAY (CONT'D)
              Add it up, son.
    Laser takes the bill, bends over and snorts a line.

    Part Oxford reading room, part teenage girl's lair. Leaning
    against the bed we see JONI ALLGOOD (18). It's her room.
    She pours over a game of Scrabble.

    Sitting next to Joni is her best girl friend, SASHA, (18).
    Sasha's checking out Joni's FACEBOOK PAGE.
                                                             2.

    Joni's best guy friend, JAI (18) sits across from her,
    calculating his next Scrabble move.

                        SASHA
              Oh my God, Joni, there are so many
              hotties in your class. You are so
              gonna hook up the first week.

                        JAI
              Just cause you're a 24 hour drive-
              thru doesn't mean everyone else has
              to be...

                        SASHA
              Hey, she worked her ass off! She
              deserves some hot jock sausage!
    Jai looks repulsed, and hurt.

                  (flip)
              Whatever. Why don't you guys just
              do it and get it over with?

    Joni and Jai blush. They're both too scared to admit their
    crush on each other.
                        SASHA (CONT'D)
              What? I'm just asking.

                        JAI
              Uh, maybe because we're friends...

                        SASHA
              Oh, really...?
    Sasha turns to Joni like an agent provocateur.

    Laser and Clay wrestle on the floor while Clay's DAD watches
    a baseball game on TV. They bump into the couch. Clay's dad
    looks back, menacing.

                        CLAY'S FATHER
              Hey, ladies! Take it down a notch.

    The boys keep wrestling, wired from the pills. Again, they
    knock into the couch. Clay's dad spins around, pissed.
                        CLAY'S FATHER (CONT'D)
              What did I just say?!
                                                              3.

     The Dad grabs Clay, pulls him off of Laser and over the
     couch. He gets his son in a headlock, forcing the boy's face
     into his big fat sweaty armpit. Both Dad and Clay enjoy the
     brutal play. Clay laughs manically.

                             CLAY
                Let me go!

                          CLAY'S FATHER
                Don't do the crime if you can't do
                the time.
                          CLAY
                Dad, your pits smell like burnt
                ass! Get off me!
     As Laser observes this male-bonding between father and son,
     we note a trace of longing on his face.

     Joni, Laser and JULES ALLGOOD (40's) fair-skinned,
     attractive, sit before well prepared dinner. Still buzzing,
     Laser taps his fingers incessantly on the table.

          Honey, that's disgusting.   We're
          eating.

Nic gets up and goes to the kitchen for wine.   Laser's cell
phone RINGS. He answers it.

                    LASER
          Hey, what's up?

Jules puts her hand on Laser's arm.

          Nobody.    Clay.

Jules and Nic share a look. Jules starts making maternal
windshield wiper strokes with her thumb on Laser's arm.

          Can I ask you something?
          What do you get from your

Laser looks down at Jules' thumb on his arm.

          Do you feel like he's the kind of
          person who will help you grow?

               I just think it's easier to knock
               them out when it's fresh.
                         JONI
               Yeah, I know, I'll do them tonight.

                         NIC
               Great...I mean, you don't want to
               have to start with an apology. You
               know? Then it's embarrassing.
                         JULES
               Okay, honey. She got it. Let it
               go.

               vibes.

     Nic takes another swig of vino and smiles at Joni through
     increasingly plum-stained teeth.

               I haven't.

     Joni tiptoes up a dark staircase and enters an office off the
     mom's bedroom. She heads for the desk and stealthy opens a

     ANGLE ON - THE BED

     We now only see Nic. Jules has slipped under the blanket,
     and is now between Nic's legs. We see Nic trying to get into
     it, but having a hard time.

                         NIC
               I don't like the guys in this one.
               They're too shaved.

                         JULES
               Don't focus on it.
                         NIC
               How about the one with the biker
               gang?

                         JULES
               We left it in Hawaii.

     Jules wrestles with the blankets.    Wants them out of her way.

                         NIC
                   (pulling them back up)

                            JULES
               Sorry.     I couldn't breathe.
     Jules wrangles the blankets, trying to cover her partner.
     The transition is awkward and Jules gets caught in the top
     sheet. As Nic repositions herself, she leans on the VOLUME
     CONTROL BUTTON and suddenly the porn is blasting at full
     volume.
                                                               10.

                         MAN IN MOVIE
               I'm gonna fuck that tight ass!...
     Jules and Nic both dive for the remote. It's lost under the
     mass of bedding. They struggle to find it as the grunting
     and 70's disco music blares.

     pulsing though.

     Nic finally recovers the remote and hits mute.

                         NIC
               Jesus Christ!
     Nic flops back, traumatized.

                         NIC (CONT'D)
               The whole neighborhood heard that!
                         JULES
               No, they didn't.

                         NIC

     Joni turns back to the file on the desk. She flips though
     some pages of documents and stops. CLOSE ON a PHOTO of a 4
     YEAR-OLD BOY standing in a sandbox looking straight into a
     camera with a big, open grin.

     We see that boy, 35 years later, carrying a box of tomatoes
     and putting them in the back of a truck. This is PAUL, Joni
     and Laser's biological father.

     Paul walks in carrying the box of tomatoes. He approaches
     TANYA, (30's) the restaurant's super sexy hostess.
                         PAUL
               How you doing, foxy?

                         TANYA
               Mm, flapjack, you're smelling ripe.

                         PAUL
               Oh, sorry...
                         TANYA
               No, I like it. It's earthy.

                         PAUL
               What can I say. I've just been out
               there, you know...hoe-ing.

                    chart)
               How's it looking tonight?
     They stand close to each other, peering at the chart.

     Paul's cell rings. He gives Tanya a hand squeeze and heads
     for the kitchen, answering.

               calling from The Pacific Cryobank.
                          PAUL
               Okay.   What can I do for you?

                         WENDY
               I just need to confirm that you
               donated sperm with us between 1991
               and 1993.
     At the mention of the word sperm, Paul goes pale.

                         PAUL
               Yeah...I did a little bit of that
               back then...

     Paul enters. The kitchen is humming with COOKS prepping for
     the dinner rush. He looks around for a quiet spot.

                         WENDY
               As you know the Cryobank has a

               prohibits us from releasing your
               identity without your consent.

     A cook, MARGO, approaches Paul to speak with him.   Paul nods:
     "Can't talk." Hands her the box of tomatoes.

                          PAUL
               Uh-huh.
     Paul heads to the back of the kitchen, searching for privacy.

     Paul moves into the pantry, finds the farthest corner.

               Not really. I mean I was 19 when I
               did it. It was so long ago...I
               just figured no one actually used
               my stuff.

     Tanya moves closer to him, flirty.

     He studies them for a beat, sees them looking around.
     Figures they must be "his kids." They look in his direction,
     spot him. He raises his hand, stands. They walk over.

     They all sit eating.    Paul can't help but study their faces.
                         PAUL
               Listen, feel free and ask me
               anything you want, okay?
                   (off their stares)
               Or we can just hang out. That's
               fine too. Whatever you guys want.

                            LASER/JONI
               Okay.
     Paul presses on, trying to break the ice.

                         PAUL
               Anything you want to ask me, Laser?
                         LASER
               I...uh...I didn't really have any
               specific questions...
                         PAUL
                   (helping him out)
               That's fine. I'd love to know
               about you guys. What about you,
               Joni? What are you up to?
                         JONI
               Uh, well, I just graduated high
               school. I'm starting college in
               the fall.
                            PAUL
               Oh yeah?     Congratulations.
                                                18.

                    LASER
          Joni's the brains in the family.
          She won a National Merit
          Scholarship.

                    PAUL
          Shut the front door!

                    LASER
          Yeah. And she got like an 800 on
          her Verbal SAT.
                    JONI
          Okay, Laser...

                    LASER
          What? I'm just saying you're
          really smart.

                    JONI
          No, I just work harder than you.
                    PAUL
          Don't stress it, Laze. School
          wasn't my thing either and I turned
          out okay.
                    LASER
              (re: his name)
          Laser.
                     PAUL
          I'm sorry. Laser.
              (beat)
          So tell me about you, Laser. What
          are you into?
Laser freezes.   So his sister jumps in.

                    JONI
          Laser's an amazing athlete.
                     PAUL
          Oh yeah?

                    LASER
          Did you play any sports in school?

                    PAUL
          I played a little basketball in
          junior high.
                                                        19.

                       LASER
          That's it?

                    PAUL
          Pretty much. The whole "team"
          thing got on my nerves, you know
          like, "Hey, let's go kick some ass,
          man!" What about you?
                    LASER
          I play some Soccer. Basketball.
          Baseball. You know, team sports.

Paul realizes he's put his foot in his mouth.

                    PAUL
          Hey, I wasn't bagging teams in
          general. Teams are great. I'm
          just weird like that.

                    LASER
          Yeah, I like teams.

We can tell Laser is growing frustrated at his inability to
connect with Paul. Joni jumps in.
                    JONI
          So this is your place?

                    PAUL
          Yeah, I've been working on it for a
          while. I also have this organic co-
          op farm down the road. We use a
          lot of the stuff we grow there for
          the restaurant.
                    JONI
              (excited)
          That's so cool.      I'm totally into
          local.
                    LASER
              (busting her)
          You are?

                    JONI
          Uh, yeah Laser! I've been like
          trying to get moms to buy local for
          forever.

Laser tries again to reconnect.
                                                               20.

                         LASER
               So, like, do you raise pigs and
               stuff?
                          PAUL
               No.  No pigs...
                   (beat)
               But it's a great spot. You guys
               should come check it out sometime.

                         JONI
               Yeah...Definitely...

     Excited, Joni turns to Laser.    He seems uninterested.

     The kids and Paul exit the restaurant. Paul walks to a
     classic BMW motorcycle. Lasers tries to hide his awe.
                         LASER
               Is that yours?

                           PAUL
               Yeah.    You like motorcycles?
                         LASER
               Yeah, but...our moms are kind of
               anti-motorcycle.
                         JONI
               And by "kind of" he means they'd
               kill us if we ever rode one.

                         PAUL
               That's too bad.   They're fun.

     Time to say goodbye. Again, no one knows the protocol here.
     After an awkward beat, Paul holds out his arms for hugs.
                         PAUL (CONT'D)
               Well it was great to meet you guys.

     He and Joni hug.
                         PAUL (CONT'D)
               I hope this was okay.

                         JONI
               Yeah...totally...thank you.

     Now Paul and Laser share a somewhat awkward man-hug.
                                                            21.

                         PAUL
               Really nice to meet you, Laser.

                            LASER
               Yeah.

     Joni gives a quick wave to Paul. She turns to go and Laser
     follows. Paul watches them walk away. He looks stirred up
     by the meeting.

     Joni and Laser head back home.

                         JONI
               I just never pictured him that way.
               I just...I don't know...He was so
               cool and interesting. I can't
               believe that was him...He was so
               nice, you know?...
                            LASER
               I guess...

                            JONI
               You guess?

                            LASER
               Yeah...
                         JONI
               God, Laser! You're the one that
               wanted to meet him so bad!

                            LASER
               I know.

                         JONI
               Well what did you think of him?
                         LASER
               I don't know. He seemed kind of
               into himself.

     Nic and Jules are cuddled up affectionately on the couch
     watching cable. They see Laser on his way out of the house.

                         JULES
               Hey bug, come here. We're watching
               "Locked Up Abroad: Uganda."
                           LASER
               I saw it.    It was gnarly.
                         NIC
               Where are you going?

                           LASER
               Clay's.

     Jules and Nic shoot each other a concerned look.

                         NIC
               Don't be back late, okay?

                           LASER
               I know.
                         JULES
               Can I have a hug before you go?

                           LASER
               Mom...
                         JULES
               Just a quick one.   Please!

                           LASER
               Hug her.    That's what she's there
               for.

     Laser leaves.   Nic hits mute on the TV, looks at Jules.
                         NIC
               Ugh. Maybe we should just sit him
               down and ask him already.

                           JULES
               What?    "Are you and Clay fucking?"

                         NIC
               "Exploring" is the word I'd use...
                                                23.

                    JULES
          And what if he is "exploring?"
          This is the age for that. Why
          should we care?

                     NIC
          We shouldn't...
              (then)
          I just don't understand why he's
          exploring with that loser.

                    JULES
          Look, we don't even know what the
          deal is. We're jumping to
          conclusions.
                    NIC
          I feel like he has so much
          potential and he's just wasting it.

Nic's comment hits a nerve in Jules.
                    JULES
          What are you trying to say?

                    NIC
          What do you mean, what am I trying
          to say?

                    JULES
          It feels like there's some subtext
          here.

                    NIC
          What are you talking about?
                    JULES
          I don't know: Like mother like son?
          Is that it? Both of us aimless,
          wandering in the darkness, "wasting
          our potential?"
Nic won't go there.

                    NIC
          Okay, honey, you're on a whole
          other tangent and I have no idea
          what you're talking about.

                    JULES
          Well, maybe it hasn't risen to the
          plane of consciousness for you yet.
                                                             24.

                           NIC
                Yeah.   Maybe not.

     Nic clicks the volume back on, freezing Jules out.

                Sweet. They were really good kids.
                The boy's kind of a sensitive jock
                and the girl's kind of innocent but
                whip-smart and super cute.

                          TANYA
                Sounds like you connected.
                          PAUL
                Yeah, we kinda did.

                          PAUL
                We didn't really leave it anywhere.
     Brooke, the sexy Wiccan volunteer, comes up to Paul bearing a
     basket of freshly-picked fruits.

                            BROOKE
                Hey Paul.
     Paul leans over the basket.

                          PAUL
                Whatcha got? Oh cool. First
                strawberries of the season.

                          BROOKE
                Don't they look awesome? I thought
                you should have the first taste.
     And with that, she smiles, hands him the basket and leaves.
                                                                   25.

     Clay rummages through the top drawer of Jules' dresser.
     Laser stands behind him, uncomfortable.

     pink, Japanese "all-in-one" dildo and a few DVD's.

                 Whoa!

     Clay turns on the dildo.      It starts to gyrate.

                 Yo, it's alive!

                           LASER
                 Dude, put it back!!
     Laughing, Clay throws the dildo back in the drawer.    Then he
     grabs one of the DVDs and spins back around.

     We see a COP giving a young MAN a BLOW-JOB. Laser and Clay
     sit motionless, shocked, disgusted, riveted.

     Laser and Clay are still watching the porn...as Jules walks
     in the room.

               Laser, you left your bike out...

     We enter a family conference already in progress.
     Nic and Jules act calm but are inwardly mortified that their
     15-year-old son found their porn.

                         NIC
               Laser, your mom and I accept you

Jules steels herself for a frank discussion.

                    JULES
          Laser, is there anything you want
          to talk about?

          Anything.     Anything on your mind.

Laser cracks his knuckles.
                    LASER
          Well there is something.

Nic and Jules share a look.      "Here we go."
                    LASER (CONT'D)
          It's more of a question, really.

          That's okay.

                    JULES

          Why do you guys watch gay man-porn?
Nic and Jules look at each other, thrown.

          Well, sweetie, human sexuality is
          complicated. And sometimes,

          intuitive...

          For instance, since women's sexual
          responsiveness is mostly internal,

          know...

                    JULES
          You would think that. But in most
          of those movies, they've hired two
          straight women to pretend and the
          inauthenticity is just unbeara--
                    NIC
          Okay, that's enough! Laser, your
          mom and I have a sense there's some
          other stuff going on in your life
          and we just want to be let in.

               us you own a restaurant.

Nic finishes a glass of wine as Jules takes note.

                    NIC
          So Paul, did you always know you
          wanted to be in food-services

Paul smiles at Nic, trying to disarm her.

                    PAUL
          Well, I always liked food.
                    NIC
          No, I was asking because I remember
          reading in your file, back when we
          were looking for, you know, sperm,
          anyway, you said you were studying
          international relations.

                    PAUL
          Oh yeah. Wow, that was a long time
          ago. Yeah, I was considering it,
          but then I dropped out of school.

                    JONI
          You dropped out of college?
                    PAUL

          No?    Why's that?

                    PAUL
          It just seemed like a massive waste
          of money after a while. I mean, I
          wasn't "doing" anything. I was
          just sitting on my ass listening to
          people spout off ideas I could've
          just as easily learned reading a
          book.
Paul sees that his little rant may be alienating the moms.

                    PAUL (CONT'D)
          I'm not saying higher learning

Paul wants a break from the heat.

Jules smiles, embarrassed.   Nic jumps in.
                     NIC
          We met at UCLA. I was a resident
          in the ER and Jules had an

           Laser, that's not nice.

                     LASER
           What's not nice is subjecting your

                     PAUL
           So what'd you do for her?
                     NIC
           Gave her a Vallium. Tried to get

           around.

           Actually, she started teasing me

          How `bout you, Jules? What do you
          do?
Jules never likes this question.

          I quit before the kids were born.

                         PAUL
               You think so?

                          JULES
               Yeah.
     The observation strikes Paul. Suddenly, he's feeling a kind
     of fast-tracked intimacy with Jules he hadn't expected.

     Jules and Laser play Ping-Pong as Nic gets home with Chinese
     take-out for the family dinner.

                         NIC
               What's the score?

                         JULES
               Pretty close.
     Laser cranks a forehand that whizzes past Jules.

               20-3...match point.

               So how'd it go today?

                          JULES
               Great.   We settled on a concept.

                         JULES
               It's hard to explain. You have to
               kind of see the space to get it.

               Laser! What do I have to do?! I
               bought you a card. I left it on
               your desk. All you had to do was--

               Mom, settle! I will...

                         NIC
               Don't tell me to settle, mister.
               And if it's not in the mail by
               tomorrow morning, we're not going
               to the Dodger game Saturday.

                         LASER
               Whatever, I have other plans
               anyway.

                         LASER
               I said I'd do something with Paul!
     Laser serves a rocket, whizzing past a flailing Jules. He
     tosses the racquet on the table and leaves. Nic yells:

                         NIC
               You used to be so cute!

     We cut onto Paul and Laser, looking out at something.   Laser
     is holding a DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA.

                         PAUL
               This may not be a good idea.
                                                              44.

                         CLAY (O.S.)
               Are you filming?!

     We cut to Clay on a skateboard on the ledge of a brick wall.
     He's preparing to ride the ledge, jump a dumpster and land
     his board on the ground.

                         PAUL
                   (to Laser)
               He's not gonna make it.
                   (calling to Clay)
               Clay, you're not gonna make it!

                         LASER
               I think he may be right, dude.
               Maybe this isn't such a good idea.
                         CLAY
               Will you quit being a man-gina and
               run the camera! I'm only doing
               this once so keep my shit in frame!
     Laser sighs, then holds up the camera. Paul looks at Laser,
     wondering why he puts up with this guy.

     VIDEO CAMERA'S POV: We watch as Clay psychs himself up   with
     an assortment of deep breaths and head-slaps. Finally,   he
     starts down the ledge. He starts his jump, catches air   and
     hits the edge of the dumpster and falls. We see him go   into
     the dumpster and land with a nauseating THUD. Paul and   Laser
     rush up and look over the edge.
                         PAUL/LASER
               ARE YOU OKAY?!

     There's Clay, his arm bent at a disturbing angle, in agony.
                         CLAY
               Did you get that?!

                         LASER
               Seriously, dude, are you okay?

                         CLAY
               I'm fucking fine! Fuck! Did you
               fucking get it?!

     Paul and Laser walk over to Paul's truck.

                    PAUL
          Maybe next time we can hang out
          just you and me.
                    LASER
          Clay's cool. He's just gets a
          little amped sometimes.

                    PAUL
          That's not amped.    That's being a
          dick.
                    LASER
          He's not a dick, that's just his
          way.
                    PAUL
          Okay...I just didn't like the way
          he was talking to you.

                    LASER
              (defensive)
          Well, you don't know him.

                    PAUL

          You're right...I don't...

                    LASER
          Hey, can I ask you a question?
                       PAUL
          Sure.

                    LASER
          Why'd you donate sperm?
                    PAUL
          Well, it's a lot more fun then
          donating blood.
Laser doesn't laugh.    Paul realizes he's gonna have to give a
"non-joke" answer.

                    PAUL (CONT'D)
          I don't know, I guess I thought,
          you know, if I can help somebody in
          need, somebody who wants a baby...

Laser's not really buying that.
                    LASER
          So you did it to help people?
                                                               46.

                         PAUL
               It was a long time ago...

                         LASER
               How much did you get paid?

                         PAUL
               Why do you want to know?
                         LASER
               I'm just curious.
                         PAUL
               I don't know, like 60 bucks a pop.

                            LASER
               That's it?

                         PAUL
               It was worth more back then.     You
               know. With inflation...
                   (off Laser's look)
               Hey, I'm glad I did it...

     Laser doesn't quite buy Paul's altruism.    He looks over at
     him, then away.

     Jai and Joni and Sasha play Scrabble.    Sasha checks out the
     photos of Paul on Joni's phone.

                         SASHA
               Hello? Donor Dad? Stone cold fox.
                         JAI
               Must you take everything beautiful
               and make it dirty?

                         SASHA
               I'm just saying. Spermster's a
               hottie. Is he single?

                         JONI
               Okay, first of all, ewww. Second,
               he's a really good person and I'd
               prefer it if you didn't taint him
               with your whore juice.

     Sasha hops up, energized by the banter.
                                                                47.

                          SASHA
               Fair enough, hairy muff. I'm outta
               here. You love birds can split my
               letters...

     Sasha splits and suddenly the room is thick with nervous
     tension.

                         JONI
               You want to keep playing?

                           JAI
               Sure.

     As Jai incorporates Sasha's tiles into his own, we see Joni
     gathering her nerve to make a move. Jai probably feels it
     but in his nervousness he can't look at Joni.

                         JAI (CONT'D)
               Sometimes I feel sorry for Sasha,

                           JONI
               Yeah...

     Joni starts to move in, her face draws closer to Jai's, inch
     by inch.

     Somehow, deep down, Jai can sense her moving towards him
     which exhilarates and freaks the shit out of him at the same
     time. To the point where he lets slip...
                         JAI
               It's like she has to sexualize
               every experience, you know? It's
               just sad...
     That stops Joni in her tracks.

                         JONI
               Yeah, it is. It's really sad.
     Jai's sabotaged the mood and they both know it.

     Jules walks in to find Nic in sexy satin man-PJ's, sitting at
     the rim of a RUNNING BATH. There are candles burning.

Jules takes a seat beside her.       Nic holds her hand.

                    NIC (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry I've been such a bitch

          You've been really patient with me.
          I just want you to know that hasn't
          gone unrecognized.

Nic gives her a long, sweet kiss.      Jules is warming up.

                       NIC (CONT'D)
          Get in.

CUT TO - JULES

In the tub, revelling in the warm bubbly water.      Nic is
sitting on the ledge, massaging her feet.

                    JULES
          Oh god, chicken, that's the spot.
                    NIC
          How's the water?

                       NIC
          In a bit.     You enjoy it first.

Nic goes deeper with the massage.      Jules' eyes roll back.
                    NIC (CONT'D)
          Oh, I forgot the lavender salts.

Nic starts to get up.    Jules grabs her hand.
                    JULES
          No, don't stop...

                    NIC

     Nic gets up and sashays to the door.

                            NIC (CONT'D)

     a finger and mouths: "Sorry..."

          tape it to my ass cause that's
          where it'll end up.

                    PAUL
          Hey now, don't go negative on your
          ass.

Jules blushes at all this talk of her ass.
                    JULES
          So...you're good with the plants?
              (off his silence)
          Look, we don't have to do that. We
          could do go in a totally different
          direction if you--

          No, I'm just thinking. Hang on.
              (covers his eyes)
          Yeah, I'm good with the plants.

                    JULES
          Sorry. Sometimes I mistake silence
          for criticism.

          No, I know...I just...
              (beat)
          Sometimes Nic can be a little
          critical, you know. She's a
          perfectionist.

                    PAUL
          That doesn't mean you have to be
          negative.

Jules looks away.    We HEAR a knock from the back.
                    LUIS (O.S.)
          Excuse me, Senora? Hello?

Jules turns, sees Luis standing at the glass door.
                       JULES
          What's up?

                       LUIS
          5 o'clock.
                       JULES
          Yeah.     Okay.

Jules wants Luis to leave her alone.    But he's not going.
                    LUIS
          Same time tomorrow?

                      JULES
          Yes!    Same time!

Luis leaves.   Jules turns back to Paul, laughs nervously.

Jules pushes Paul, laughing.

                    JULES
          That's mean.

Paul hands her a Tupperware with some of the pie in it.

               Okay!   God, you're such a pusher!
     Jules grabs the pie and gives him a kiss on the mouth, almost
     as a mistake. Before they know it, they're making out.

     Jules snaps back, freaked.
                         JULES (CONT'D)
               Whoa. I'm sorry. That was...I
               don't know where that came from...

                          JULES
               Okay.   I'm gonna go now...

     Jules starts backing away, acting as if nothing happened.

                           PAUL
               Jules...?

                   (overcompensating)

     Jules bolts for the door, clutching her pie.   Paul watches
     her go, stunned by what just happened.

               know the terms.

               No, we just talked...conceptually.

                         NIC
               Oh, so it was less of a "doing"

               the Paul digs a little.

               Okay.   You're right.

     Chastened, Nic looks back at her magazine.    Jules rolls over.

Laser sees the dog has no tags. He looks around for an
owner. The dog nuzzles Laser for affection.

the dog and smacks him to get him to run away.

blood, and walks away. Friendship over.

     the garden.
     CLOSE ON Jules' thong peaking out of her jeans. Luis walks
     across Paul's field of vision, interrupting his reverie.

     Jules steps tentatively into Paul's house.
                                                            59.

                      JULES
          Paul?

Jules walks further into the house. She looks anxious.      Paul
opens his office door and sees Jules in the hall.

                      PAUL
          Hey.    What's up?
                    JULES
          Look, I'm sorry about last night.
          I'm really embarrassed.

                      PAUL
          Don't be.    She's the one who wigged
          out.
                    JULES
          I know, she's just going through a
          lot of stuff right now...
                    PAUL
          Jules, it's okay.      You don't have
          to defend her.

They stare at each other, unsure how to act.
                    JULES
          And look, I just want you to know,
          about the other day, the kiss,
          that's not something I...do.
                    PAUL
          Yeah, I sensed that.

She takes a step toward him, feverish.
                    JULES
          I just wanted to clear the air.

They stare at each other.      It's like watching two magnets.
                    PAUL
          The air is clear.

Jules grabs Paul and starts smothering him with kisses.
It takes a second for Paul to get his bearings, but when he
does, he starts kissing her back with equal fervor, pushing
her up against the wall, wedging his hand between her legs.
                    JULES
          Paul, I can't!
                                                              60.

                     (urgent whisper)
                 I have a guy outside!

     Overcome with lust, Jules wraps her legs around his waist and
     Paul walks her into...

     Quick cuts of their awkward ravenous gropings. Somewhere
     between slapstick and animal. He pulls her hair back hard.
     She loves it. She pulls his hair back harder. He yelps.
     She pulls down his underwear. Her eyes widen. It's been
     decades since she's seen a hard cock in the flesh.

                               JULES
                 Oh.   Well.     Hel-lo!

     Cut to them fucking. It's gawky and passionate.    Somewhere
     in the middle of it, Jules starts laughing.
                               PAUL
                 What?

                               JULES
                 Nothing.
     Paul flips her on her hands and knees and they go at it some
     more.

     She keeps laughing. Paul goes harder to make her stop. The
     paces grows quicker. They're getting closer. And then...

                            LUIS (O.S.)
                 Hello?   Excuse me, Senora Allgood?!
     They stop mid-thrust.

     Jules runs out to meet Luis, waiting patiently at the door.

     Luis stares at his employer. She looks totally disheveled.
     Jules starts feeling her hair, smoothing it into shape.

     Paul and Laser shoot hoop. There's a tense-ness to their
     patter. Laser takes the ball and steps to the top of the key

     Laser does a trick behind the back lay-up.        Nails it.   Then
     tosses the ball to Paul.

Paul saunters up to the table and stands behind Sasha.   He
mindlessly places his hand on Sasha's shoulder.

          Sorry guys, I need to steal Tanya
          back now.

back places her hand on top of his.

     Jules and Paul lie naked in the bed. Jules slithers around

     Jules punches his arm, mock hurt. They start rough-housing.
     Then kissing. Then the phone rings.

     Paul grabs a handful of Jules' ass. Jules throws her leg
     over Paul and climbs up for another round. Suddenly, Joni's
     voice echoes through the machine.

               Listen, don't worry about your
               friend.
     Jules pales. She mouths: "What are you doing?!"    Paul
     gesticulates: "I'm sorry!"

                         PAUL (CONT'D)
               No. Honestly. I didn't even

     arm free and walks out.

                    LUIS
          Yeah, no lines.

His look of confusion trips off her paranoia.      She's
convinced he knows everything.

          I don't ask you why you keep
          blowing your nose constantly! I
          mean, if you have a drug problem
          that's your business...

               him as everyone else and this has
               caused some...friction...between

               So I was thinking. Maybe it would
               be nice if we all had dinner at his
               house sometime. That way, I could
               get to know him a little better,
               and I could see all the good work
               mom's been doing with his backyard.

     recognize this is a big step for Nic.

     Paul gets dinner ready with Joni and Laser as his sous-chefs.
     Both kids seem really jazzed to be cooking with him.

     IN THE BACKYARD -EVENING

     Jules tours Nic around the backyard, looking a little freaked
     out as she shows her the work she's been doing.

                         JULES
               I'm gonna do some planting over

               It looks great, honey. Very
               indigenous. I'm so proud of you.

     Nic kisses Jules spontaneously. Jules looks nauseous again.
     They head back up the stairs, toward Paul's house.

The Allgoods look at Nic: this is a first.

                    NIC (CONT'D)
          God, Paul, this steak is delicious.
          What's the seasoning?

                    PAUL
          I just mist it with a little
          truffle oil.

Nic looks at Jules and smiles in full overcompensation mode.

          that. Right, honey?

          So it's not too rare?
                    NIC
          No, it's perfect. Juicy. Tender.
          Exactly what rare's supposed to be.

                    PAUL
          Good. A lot of people in the
          restaurant order a steak rare and
          they freak out at the slightest
          sight of red.
                    NIC
          Ugh, isn't that annoying? That
          happens to me all the time when I'm
          grilling.

                    PAUL
          Don't people know that rare means
          red?
                     NIC
          Right?!   It means bloody!

                    PAUL
          Exactly! They should see what rare
          looks like in Argentina. The cow's
          practically still mooing.
Laser chuckles at Paul's joke, then reigns it in.   Joni tries
to insert herself in the conversation.

                    JONI
          I really want to go to Argentina.

Joni glares at Nic: stop being such a Paul hog.

Nic stops, eyes still closed. She's connected to a part of
herself she rarely lets herself visit. The moment is
punctured by her smart-ass 15-year-old son.

to Paul.

On her way to the loo, Nic turns back to Paul.

     Nic washes her hands at the sink. Something catches her eye.
     She lifts Paul's hairbrush from the shelf in front of her and
     examines it. She reaches into the bristles and pulls out...

     A few strands of long red hair.

      kiss. And it's completely sweet and intimate.

      But then the kiss starts to morph as Joni's energy turns
      manic, intense, less romantic than emotionally needy. We see
      Jai start to pull away. But Joni keeps holding him, wanting
      more. Finally, Jai breaks off the kiss.

                I'm not going to Siberia, mom.

      Jules looks at the family unit, misty.
                          JULES
                I can't believe this is our last
                dinner together.
                          LASER
                Oh God, are you gonna cry?

      Jules looks at her son, fed up.
                          JULES
                I wish you were gay.    You'd be so
                much more sensitive.

      The doorbell rings.
                          JONI
                It's probably Sasha.    I'll get it.

      Joni runs to the door.   Opens it. It's not Sasha.   It's Paul.
                          JONI (CONT'D)
                    (shocked)
                What are you doing here?

                          PAUL
                I needed to talk to you before you
                left.
                          JONI
                There's nothing to talk about.

                          PAUL
                I just want to apologize again for
                what happened. I can't tell you
                how much I regret it.

      Joni walks out for privacy, closes the door behind her.
                          JONI
                So like, everything that happened
                between us. What was that? Was
                that just bullshit?!
                          PAUL
                No, it wasn't bullshit at all. I
                know I don't seem credible right
                now but I really care about you...
      Paul struggles to keep his emotions in check.

                          PAUL (CONT'D)
                ...and I just hope someday we'll be
                able to see each other again. Do
                you think that could maybe happen?

                          JONI
                I don't know...
      Joni looks down welling up.

                          JONI (CONT'D)
                I just wish you could've been...
                            PAUL
                What?

      Joni chokes back tears.
                            JONI
                Better...

      Paul and Joni look up at each other when the door suddenly
      flings open. Nic is there, fuming.
                                                                93.

                          NIC
                You've got some balls, mister!

                          PAUL
                Nic, hold on...

      Nic walks toward he and Joni.   Joni ducks back inside.

                          NIC
                No, you hold on! Let me tell you
                something, you really hurt my kids!
                          PAUL
                Well, they're kinda my...

                          NIC
                    (cutting him off)
                No! They're not. This is not your
                family. This is my family! You're
                just a fucking interloper...
      Jules joins Nic, concerned things are getting out of hand.

                          PAUL
                I didn't mean to hurt anyone...
      Paul and Jules share a look as Nic deals the coup de grace.

                          NIC
                If you want a family so much, go
                out and make one of your own!
      Nic heads back inside and slams the door behind her.

      Paul stand alone, spinning. After a moment he spontaneously
      looks back into the house. Laser is staring at him through
      the window. Their eyes lock and Paul give Laser a contrite
      smile. That's the final straw for Laser. He grabs his plate
      and walks out of view.

      Reeling, Paul heads for his motorcycle. He gets on the bike,
      helmet in hand. Turns on the ignition. He picks up the
      helmet and pauses, shaking in the hell of his own making.
      Losing it, he hurls the helmet at the motorcycle.

      Laser, Joni and Nic watch "Locked Up Abroad" Jules walks in
      front of them, picks up the remote and turns off the TV.
                          JULES
                I need to say something.
                                                                94.

      Everyone sits up.   Jules acts stoic but she's wrecked.

                           JULES (CONT'D)
                 Look, it's no big secret your mom
                 and are in hell right now. Bottom
                 line...marriage is hard...really
                 fucking hard. Just two people,
                 slogging through the shit, year
                 after year, getting older,
                 changing. It's a fucking marathon,
                 okay?!
      Everyone is silenced by the outpouring.   Jules soldiers on.

                           JULES (CONT'D)
                 So sometimes you're together so
                 long, you just stop seeing the
                 other person. You just see weird
                 projections of your own junk. And
                 instead of talking to each other,
                 you go off the rails, and act
                 grubby and make stupid choices.
                 Which is what I did. And I feel
                 sick about it because I love you
                 guys and I love your mom and that's
                 the truth. Sometimes you hurt the
                 ones you love the most. I don't
                 know why. Maybe if I read more
                 Russian novels I would...

      Nic looks down, overwhelmed by it all.
                            JULES (CONT'D)
                 Anyway, I just wanted to say how
                 sorry I am about what I did and
                 that I hope you'll forgive me
                 eventually.
                     (awkward)
                 Thank you.

      And, without further ado, Jules hands the remote back to
      Laser and departs the field. Everyone's silenced by Jules'
      rambling apologia, especially Nic.

      Joni wakes up. She looks around her room. There's nothing
      on the walls. The floor is covered with boxes taped and
      labeled. It's time to go.

      Nic and Jules stuff the last of Joni's things in the back of

      As they drive past buildings and dorms, Joni sees STUDENTS
      swarming the campus. She takes it all in, nervous, excited.
      Nic and Jules steal looks back at Joni, feeling her
      nervousness, wishing they could take it away.

      Laser dollies Joni's boxes though the corridor and while Joni
      and the moms follow behind.

      Nic and Jules follow Joni to the door.    They all jam up at
      the threshold.

                           JONI
                 Guys, it's okay.   I got it.

      Nic and Jules get the hint. They move back and Joni enters
      the room alone. Nic and Jules quietly turn and leave.
                                                                96.

      Joni stands among her bags and boxes looking around. She
      goes into her suitcase and pulls out her linens. She starts
      making her bed but suddenly stops mid way. She stares out
      toward the hallway.

      Finally she moves to the doorway and looks out.    She realizes
      her family isn't there.

      EXT. DORM BUILDING - DAY
129                                                              129

      Joni exits, looking around to find her family. The station
      wagon is gone. She looks panicked. Her pace quickens as she
      makes her way down a hill toward the road.
      Finally Joni sees the Volvo heading towards her.

      The car pulls over to the curb and everyone gets out.   Joni
      looks vulnerable. She tries to cover it.
                          JONI
                Where'd you go?!

                          NIC
                We had to move the car.

                          JONI
                I thought you left.
                          JULES
                We wouldn't leave without saying
                goodbye.

                          NIC
                Give us some credit.

      And suddenly, everyone realizes...this is it. It's time to
      say goodbye. First Laser comes up and hugs Joni.
                          LASER
                It's gonna be weird not having you
                at home.

                          JONI
                Sorry to leave you alone with them.

                             LASER
                It's okay.     I can handle it.
      Laser backs up. Then the moms both come up and hug Joni,
      tears streaming down their faces.
                                                               97.

                           JONI
                Guys, come on...
                    (beat)
                Look, I'll talk to you soon.

      Joni tries to detach from the hug. But her moms won't let
      go. They keep holding her and crying.

      Slowly, their tears begin to break Joni down.

      Trapped in their loving embrace, Joni's feelings rise up,
      unbidden, overpowering her. She starts crying.

      The moms hold her tighter, which makes her cry even harder.

      Soon she's sobbing in her mothers' arms, as all the pressure,
      resentment and anger she's felt starts seeping out of her.

      Nic and Jules feel their daughter letting go.   They hold her
      tight to comfort her.
      They keep holding her until a calm sets in.

      The hug breaks apart. Nic pushes the hair from Joni's face.
      Joni gives her moms one last smile.
      Laser, Jules and Nic get back in the car. Joni stands
      watching as they drive off and her new life begins.

      The family drives home. Jules is at the wheel. Nic's in the
      passenger seat, eyes red and puffy. Laser's in the back.

      No one speaks, everyone's lost in their own worlds.   Finally
      Laser breaks the spell.

                          LASER
                I don't think you guys should break
                up.
      A long beat.

                           NIC
                No?   Why's that?
                          LASER
                I think you're too old.

      Both Nic and Jules crack smiles. Their son's rudeness is
      unsurpassed. But then his words have an unexpected gravity.
                                                            98.

                     NIC
           Thanks, Laser.

Jules, disarmed and slightly smiling, reaches over and puts
her hand on Nic's leg. She gives it a gentle squeeze and
doesn't let go. Nic looks over to Jules, finally disarmed.

Nic reaches for Jules' hand and holds it tight.   Nic and
Jules look at each other, and then away.

Laser watches his moms holding hands from the back seat.
Their small gesture is what he needed. He smiles to himself,
grateful for a sign.

FADE OUT
THE END
