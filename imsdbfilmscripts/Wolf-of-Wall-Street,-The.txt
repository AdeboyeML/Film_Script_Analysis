           Your job is `connector', which
           means you'll be dialing the phone
           over 500 times a day, trying to
           `connect' me with business owners.
           And till you pass your Series 7,
           that's all you'll be doing. Sit.

Jordan takes a seat at the desk next to Fogel's.

           Just so you know, last year I made
           over 300k and the other guy you'll
           be working for made a million.

           A million dollars? I could only
           imagine what a douchebag that guy
           must be.

A manicured hand lands on Jordan's shoulder. It's MARK
HANNA, 30s, charismatic, movie-star handsome.

                          MARK HANNA
           Jordan? Mark Hanna.
                (re: Fogel)
           Good, you've met Jerry. One of
           the smartest guys in the office.
           Who's ever sucked a dog's cock out
           of loneliness.

Fogel's smile turns to a frown.      He hands Jordan a stack
of 3x5 index cards.

                         MARK HANNA
           Don't mind Jerry, his father raped
           him as a child. Besides, I'm
           senior broker here, he's a
           worthless piker. I heard you
           pitched stock at your job

mouthpiece, kicks the desk violently.

Mark Hanna slams down his phone in victory, scrawls out a
"buy" ticket. He places the ticket into a glass cylinder
which he slips into a plastic pneumatic tube.

           relaxed. Nobody wants to buy
           something from someone who sounds
           like they haven't gotten laid in a
           month. Take breaks when you feel

                Mr. Fleming, good morning, Jordan
                Belfort with Investor's Center in
                New York City. You recently
                responded to one of our ads...

     A few of the other Brokers glance over, eavesdropping.

                              JORDAN (CONT'D)
                The reason I'm calling is that
                an extremely exciting investment
                opportunity crossed my desk today.
                Typically our firm recommends no
                more than five stocks per year:
                this is one of them...

                Aerotyne International is a

                to only a dollar -- and our
                research indicates they could go
                much, much higher -- your profit
                on a mere three thousand dollar
                investment would be upwards of
                fifty thousand... That's right,

           The only way the Banque Real de

           foreign legal body is if the crime
           being pursued also happened to be
           a crime in Switzerland. But there
           are very few Swiss laws pertaining
           to your "rumored" improprieties.
           Which is why Mr. Azoff's joke is
           most appropriate: from a financial
           standpoint you are now in heaven,
           and we welcome you. If the U.S.
           Justice Department or FBI or SEC

Jordan looks to the TV, where POPEYE pours a can of
spinach down his gullet. Instantly, his chest and arm
muscles swell to five times their size.

Jordan goes to get his coke. He snarfs up two fat
spoonfuls and -- like that -- his chest swells and he
takes a deep breath and he dashes back to the rescue...

Jordan rushes back to Donnie, who is now blue.

           This stupid sonovabitch! All

           now I had to save his life `cause
           I took a CPR class when the baby
           was learning to swim. Just for
           the record, I want it noted: not
           for a second did I even think
           about letting him choke to death,
           even though it would've saved me
           an awful lot of headaches.

Donnie still isn't breathing. Jordan flips him over,
tries the Heimlich -- we hear a CRUNCH as he breaks
Donnie's ribs. He flips him back over, but he's almost
completely blue.

                  hearing rumors lately, about me,

                  Five years ago when I started
                  Stratton with Donnie Azoff, I knew
                  the day would eventually come when
                  I'd be moving on. It's truly with

           new Mercedes, a woman who lives in
           the finest condo complex on Long

           single mom on the balls of her
           ass. Three months behind on her
           rent with an eight year old son!
           She came to me for a job and when
           I hired her she asked for a $5000
           dollar advance so she could pay
           his tuition. And what did I do,
           Kimmie?

                  Do you dream of being financially
                  independent but struggle every
                  month just to pay your bills?
                  Would you like to own a home like                      *
                  this one someday but can barely
                  afford to pay your rent?
                       (ZOOM IN ON HIM)
                  My name is Jordan Belfort and
                  there's no secret to wealth
                  creation. No matter who you are,
                  where you came from, you too can                       *
                  become financially independent in
                  just a matter of months. All you
                  need is a strategy.

                    The first action you have to take
                    is to DECIDE to be wealthy. When
                    I was 24 years old, I made a
                    DECISION not to just survive but
                    to THRIVE. I started my own stock
                    brokerage firm, developing a                          *
                    SYSTEM OF SELLING that within a
                    year made me a multi-millionaire.

            Ladies and gentlemen, please join                    *

            Zealand... Mr. Jordan Belfort!                       *

BIG APPLAUSE as Jordan takes the stage, waving. This             *
might go on a while. If so, there COULD be TITLES:               *

    Jordan Belfort spent 22 months in federal prison             *
             and paid $100,000,000 in fines.                     *

THEN:                                                            *

        His cellmate was, no fucking joke, Tommy Chong.          *

THEN:                                                            *

Since his release, he's become a multi-millionaire again         *
               as a motivational speaker.                        *

When the applause finally dies down...                           *

...Jordan doesn't speak. Instead he walks down to the            *
front row of his audience, studying faces. He picks one.         *
Takes a pen from his coat and offers it to him.                  *

The Kiwi, embarrassed, takes a moment, then:                     *

                          KIWI IN AUDIENCE                       *
            Well, it's a good pen, it's a                        *
            ballpoint --                                         *

Jordan takes the pen back with a smile.        Hands it to the   *
next person.                                                     *
