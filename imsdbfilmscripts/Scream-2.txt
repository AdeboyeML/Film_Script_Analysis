                                               FADE IN:
   
   
   EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT
   
   An old preserved movie theatre. The kind only found in
   a small town. Very picturesque. The marquee in front
   reads:
   
   "SNEAK PREVIEW TONIGHT
   'STAB'
   Rated R"
   
   A line has formed around the block, GUYS and GIRLS -
   mostly college age.
   
   CLOSE on a girl, MAUREEN, no more than 18. A friendly
   face with innocent eyes. She stands in line with her
   boyfriend PHIL, same age. A handsome counterpart.
   
                       MAUREEN
             I hate scary movies.
   
                       PHIL
             It'll be okay, baby, I'll hold your
             hand.
   
                       MAUREEN
             If we hurry, we can still catch the
             Sandra Bullock movie.
   
                       PHIL
             We got free tickets.
   
   He pulls her close, snuggling with her.
   
   
   EXT. BOX OFFICE
   
   Maureen and Phil reach the box office, presenting their
   tickets.
   
   They pass through the front doors where an USHER stands
   randomly handing out GHOST MASKS. A Hollywood variation
   of a most familiar one. Phil takes one.
   
                       MAUREEN
             What's that?
   
                       USHER
             The studio sent them.
   
   
   INT. THEATRE - A MINUTE LATER
   
   The small theatre is nearly packed to capacity. Maureen
   and Phil enter, moving down the aisle searching for two
   seats. A YOUNG GIRL SCREAMS, whizzing by them as a
   GHOST MASKED GUY chases after her. The crowd LAUGHS.
   Everyone is having fun.
   
   Maureen and Phil find aisle seats down towards the
   screen just as the lights DIM. People FAKE SCREAM in
   terror. A very lively crowd.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   Credits roll as the movie begins. The studio logo
   appears followed by...
   
   "A ROBERT RODRIGUEZ FILM"
   
   
   IN THE THEATRE
   
   Maureen turns to find a GHOST MASK in her face. Phil
   has slipped it on.
   
                       MAUREEN
             I don't think so.
   
   Phil gets in her face, playing with her. She swats him.
   
                       MAUREEN
             Take it off.
   
                       PHIL
             But...
   
                       MAUREEN
             Now.
   
   He obliges.

   More credits.
   
   "BASED ON THE BOOK "THE WOODSBORO MURDERS" BY GALE
   WEATHERS"
   
   Maureen looks behind her, toward the rest of the
   audience. A sea of white ghost faces fill the theatre.
   The publicity masks actually glow in the dark. A
   chilling sight that leaves Maureen extremely spooked.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The movie begins. A house in the middle of nowhere.
   Lights burn from within.
   
   Inside the house, a YOUNG GIRL, Alicia Silverstonish is
   taking a shower. The water cascades over her nubile
   body. Suddenly, a FIGURE is glimpsed through the
   curtain. It's all very PSYCHO.
   
                       MAUREEN
             Now why does she have to be naked?
             How does that serve the plot?
   
                       PHIL
             Sssshhh.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower
   curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She
   grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living
   room, grabbing the phone.
   
                       GIRL
             Hello?
   
   A menacing VOICE responds.
   
                       VOICE
             Hello?
   
                       GIRL
             Who is this?
   
                       VOICE
             You tell me.
   
   
   IN THE THEATRE
   
   Maureen is not having a good time. She's already
   spooked.
   
                       MAUREEN
             I hate this shit.
   
                       ON SCREEN
             The phone rings again.
   
                       VOICE
             Why did you hang up on me?
   
                       GIRL
             Who is this?
   
   
   IN THE THEATRE
   
   Maureen shifts in her seat.
   
                       MAUREEN
             Why doesn't she just hang up and
             call the police? Stupid..
   
                       PHIL
             Shush.
   
                       MAUREEN
             I'm gonna pee. You want anything?
   
   He nods. Maureen stands and moves up the aisle.
   
   
   INT. LOBBY - SECONDS LATER
   
   Maureen emerges from the theatre and into the small
   lobby. It is dark and shadowed. She moves down a long
   hallway to a staircase. A "BATHROOM" sign with an arrow
   points downstairs.
   
   Maureen hits the stairs to...
   
   
   INT. BASEMENT LOUNGE - SAME
   
   A small lounge leads to two bathroom doors. Very low
   lighting. Maureen descends the stairs, heading for
   the...
   
   
   INT. GIRL'S RESTROOM - SAME
   
   A large bathroom. Five stalls line one wall. The door
   CREAKS open. Maureen enters and shoots for a stall.
   
   
   INSIDE THE STALL - MOMENTS LATER
   
   Maureen finishes up, fastening her pants. Suddenly, the
   bathroom door CREAKS open. Maureen listens. FOOTSTEPS
   are heard. Loud and heavy.
   
   Maureen eyes the crack in the stall door. Not much is
   visible. Suddenly, a SHADOW sweeps by. The footsteps
   stop.
   
   Maureen finishes up quickly. She flushes, throws the
   stall door open and rushes out to find...
   
   THE BATHROOM EMPTY.
   
   The stall doors are all closed. Maureen shoots for the
   door. She rips the door open as a FIGURE rushes her...
   
   A YOUNG GIRL followed by her FRIEND, both perky and
   loud. They hurl past Maureen, LAUGHING and carrying on.
   
                       GIRL #l
             I got so scared my bladder rolled.
   
                       GIRL #2
             You chicken shit. It's just a
             movie.
   
                       GIRL # l
             No, it really happened. It's a true
             story.
   
   Maureen is out the door. Now thoroughly spooked.
   
   
   INT. BASEMENT LOBBY - SAME
   
   Alone, Maureen moves for the stairs when a FIGURE
   emerges from the shadows. A GHOST MASKED SHAPE
   appearing behind her...
   
   LUNGING FOR HER, grabbing her, spinning her around. She
   SCREAMS MADLY as the Ghost starts LAUGHING. The mask
   comes off. It's Phil.
   
                       MAUREEN
             You ass.
   
                       PHIL
             I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to.
             It was too easy.
   
                       MAUREEN
             You are so not funny.
   
   Phil takes her in his arms.
   
                       PHIL
             Come on, baby. Lighten up a little,
             will ya?
   
                       MAUREEN
             I get scared really easy, okay.
   
                       PHIL
             You gotta go with it. Scary movies
             are great foreplay.
   
   He's sincere. He leans down and plants a kiss on her.
   She caves, kissing him back. Sweet and sensual.
   
                       MAUREEN
             I just have a hard time with
             insipid, sexist violence.
   
                       PHIL
                   (nibbling her neck)
             We can still Sandra Bullock it.
   
                       MAUREEN
                   (nibbling back)
             Sandra started without us. We can
             stay. He kisses her again, then
             breaks away.
   
                       PHIL.
             Yeah? Okay. I gotta whizz. Meet me
             upstairs?
   
                       MAUREEN
             Want some popcorn?
   
                       PHIL
             Butter.
   
   Maureen moves up the stairs out of sight. Phil turns,
   reaching for the bathroom door just as a...
   
   GHOST MASKED FIGURE appears in his path. Phil steps
   back, surprised. Suddenly, a flash of silver shoots
   forth as Phil is pierced with a long sharp knife. Quick
   and silent. He bellies over just as the Ghost Shape
   strikes again. Phil goes down without a scream.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   INT. LOBBY - SECONDS LATER
   
   Maureen is at the concession. A GIRL at the counter
   hands her change and Maureen is off with soda and a tub
   of popcorn.
   
   
   INT. DARK THEATER - SECONDS LATER
   
   SCREAMS and GASPS from the audience as the movie plays
   on.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   A patio chair comes flying through a glass door. The
   young girl in the movie tears off running, SCREAMING,
   flying through the room.
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   The crowd is really with the movie. Some even talk to
   the screen. "You dumb bitch. Get out of the house."
   etc.
   
   Maureen makes her way back to her aisle seat. She sits
   down next to...
   
   
   PHIL
   
   Who sits with the mask on. The reflection from the
   movie bouncing against it in the darkness.
   
                       MAUREEN
             Give it up.
   
   She sits down, with the popcorn.
   
                       MAUREEN
             How many stabs did I miss?
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The young girl slips out a side door, completely
   terrified. In her hand, she holds a portable phone.
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   Maureen offers Phil popcorn.
   
                       MAUREEN
             Why doesn't she run?
   
   Phil turns to her, bringing his finger to his masked
   lips, SSSHHING her.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The young girl runs by a window. She looks in. A GHOST
   MASKED KILLER stares back. The Figure CRASHES through
   the window attacking her. She fights him off, getting
   away, running...
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   Everyone in the theater is SCREAMING. Maureen tries her
   best to detach herself from the movie. She eats her
   popcorn.
   
                       MAUREEN
             This is so tired.
   
   She turns her attention to Phil.
   
                       MAUREEN
             Hey, you... pasty face...
   
   Phil ignores her. She reaches over in the darkness
   putting her hand on his knee. She inches it up. The
   Ghost-masked Phil just stares ahead.
   
                       MAUREEN
             Whatsa the matter? Can't I get your
             ghost?
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The young girl is running through the yard. The Ghost
   Killer is right behind her, chasing her... she
   SCREAMS...
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   Maureen pretends to watch the movie while her hand
   continues to move between Phil's legs. She stares
   ahead, WINCING at what's about to happen to the girl on
   screen.
   
   She doesn't notice as Phil pulls a long sharp hunting
   knife from inside his coat jacket. Maureen's hand moves
   up Phil's jacket... something stops her. She feels
   something on her fingers... something wet. She pulls
   her hand back, the reflected movie illuminating bloody
   fingers.
   
   Maureen stares at her hand...
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The Ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her,
   pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife.
   The young girl is helpless...
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   Maureen looks at Phil, confused... as if seeing for the
   first time... IT'S NOT PHIL. She pulls away when, the
   Ghost-masked Figure grabs her with one hand, the other
   one clutching the hunting knife.
   
   Maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a LOUD
   SCREAM that is matched by the entire audience as they
   SCREAM at the screen.
   
   
   ON SCREAM
   
   The young girl is stabbed in the heart.
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   Maureen is helpless. The knife comes fast and furious,
   striking her in the stomach. She falls forward, into
   the aisle as...
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The young girl, clutching her bloody chest... drags
   herself, crawling across wet grass... the killer behind
   her... raising his knife again.
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   Popcorn flies as Maureen falls forward, into the aisle,
   clutching her bloody stomach. She's speechless, unable
   to SCREAM. She holds her bloody hand out for all to
   see, begging for help. She stumbles down the aisle.
   
   Someone YELLS "Sit down." Maureen turns to several
   PEOPLE who begin to react. She turns behind her to see
   the Ghost Face coming at her again... knife raised.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The young girl is slashed again.
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   The knife slices into Maureen again... then again. The
   theatre audience is starting to take note as the Ghost
   keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. A
   horrifying, sickening sight.
   
   Maureen stumbles forward, her bloody body moving down
   to the front of the theater. Suddenly, the entire
   audience begins...
   
   
   APPLAUD AND CHEER
   
   Maureen, swaying from side to side, turns to the crowd
   and emits a HORRENDOUS BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM as...
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   The young girl lets out an enormous EAR SCREECHING
   SCREAM that mirrors Maureen's as the killer attacks one
   last time, stabbing her, silencing her forever.
   
   
   IN THE THEATER
   
   The Ghost slashes out one last time, direct and fierce.
   Maureen falls back against the movie screen... very
   much dead. Her arms flail across the screen... smearing
   blood over the wide screen image of the GHOST MASK.
   
                                               SMASH CUT

   INT. DORM ROOM - MORNING
   
   A typical college dorm room. Industrial strength
   furniture. There's two of everything.
   
   A RINGING phone stirs a YOUNG GIRL in bed, asleep under
   a mound of blankets and pillows. The girl starts to
   rise as the phone is answered. A VOICE is heard. Brass
   and sassy.
   
                       VOICE (O.S.)
             Hello... uh-huh... Who is this?
             Well, we identify ourselves around
             here. No, you can't. Uh-huh...
             yeah, right...
   
   The girl rolls out of bed, her hair falls away to
   reveal her face - It's SIDNEY PRESCOTT. Two years older
   has brought a maturity to this beautiful young woman.
   Her face posses a survivor's edge. Stronger and more
   determined, she appears to have weathered the storm.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I got it.
   
   She stands and moves to...
   
   
   HALLIE
   
   Her roommate and friend. An attractive young black
   woman. Twenty at most. Brazen. Fun. Full of life. She
   hands the phone to Sidney.
   
                       HALLIE
             Knock yourself out.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Hello?
                   (silence)
             Hello?
   
                       VOICE
             Hello Sidney.
   
   A VOICE spits out of the phone. Deep and haunting.
   Sidney doesn't flinch.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Yes?
   
                       VOICE
             What's your favorite scary movie?
   
                       SIDNEY
             Who is this?
   
                       VOICE
             You tell me.
   
   Sidney grabs a small device hooked to the phone. She
   takes a look at its display.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Cory Gillis. 442-8730.
   
   Silence.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Hot flash, Cory - prank phone calls
             are a criminal offense prosecuted
             under penal code 653M...
   
   CLICK! The phone goes dead.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Enjoy the movie.
   
   She hangs the phone up, turning to Hallie.
   
                       HALLIE
             Time to change numbers again?
   
                       SIDNEY
             Nah... I think it'll die off. It's
             opening weekend. Let's see how it
             goes.
   
   Sidney grabs her robe and shower bucket as Hallie
   channel surfs. Various morning news programs are on
   their small TV. Snippets are heard.
   
                       REPORTER
                   (from TV)
             "... The two victims, Maureen Evans
             and Phil Stevens..."
   
   The channel switches. A YOUNG MAN is being interviewed.
   Attractive, sullen. Sad.
   
                       YOUNG MAN
                   (from TV)
             Please, I just wanna be left alone.
   
   His voice stops Sidney cold. She turns to the
   television.
   
                       HALLIE
             He sure gives a lot of interviews
             for someone who wants to be left
             alone.
   
   Hallie hits the remote. The man's image disappears as
   the TV goes off. Hallie turns, all smiles.
   
                       HALLIE
             Get your ass in gear. You're late.
             Don't forget we've got rush at the
             Deltas tonight. Don't wear anything
             you don't want trashed. Sid? Sid?
   
   Sidney turns from the television. Momentarily lost.
   Recovery is immediate.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I can't believe I let you talk me
             into going Greek.
   
   Sid moves to the door and throws it open. A GHOST
   FIGURE LEAPS at her. She SCREAMS but then stops
   herself.
   
   It's just a costume hung from her doorframe. Preset, to
   scare. Another prank. Sidney rips it down, turns to
   Hallie, throwing the costume at her.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Pumps. Nice handbag. Whaddya think?
   
   Sid is surprisingly cool. She exits out the door,
   leaving Hallie staring at the Ghost Mask in her hands.
   
                       CUT TO:
             
   
   EXT. DORMITORY - MORNING - LITTLE LATER
   
   Sid steps outside of her dorm. The morning sun shines
   down as Sid breathes in, taking in the day just as
   FIFTY NEWS REPORTERS NOB HER.
   
                       REPORTER #2
             Sidney, did you know the victims?
   
                       REPORTER #1
             Do you feel responsible for the
             murders?
   
                       SIDNEY
             What murders?
   
   Microphones are shoved in her face as Sidney is seiged
   upon by journalists and TV cameras. She starts to
   panic.
   
                       REPORTER #3
             Do you think there will be more
             murders?
   
   Sidney is mortified. She pushes and shoves but there is
   no escape. The questions come at her like lightning.
   She sees a whole in the crowd and goes for it as a
   REPORTER, a flashy woman - all hair and teeth, thick
   sunglasses, moves in her way.
   
                       FLASHY REPORTER
             Did you kill them last night, Sid?
             Has it gotten to you? Have you
             finally snapped?
   
   Sidney's eyes flare. Her fist starts to clench when...
   
   BAM! Someone beats her to it. A fist flies out from the
   crowd, connecting with the flashy woman's face. She
   drops. Sid spins around to find...
   
   
   GALE WEATHERS
   
   Standing, tight-fisted. Their eyes meet. A quick
   moment. Sidney is happy to see her.
   
   The onslaught continues. Cameras flash, reporters
   shove. Gale moves in front of Sid, holding the crowd at
   bay. The reporters begin to throw questions at Gale.
   
                       GALE
                   (to Sid)
             Quick, get outta here.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What's going on?
   
                       GALE
             Just go. l'll find you later.
   
   Sid wastes no time. She takes off, running around the
   side of the building. She stops, takes a breath, but
   the reporters are on her tail. She looks up to see a...
   
   
   SMALL CAMPUS SECURITY VEHICLE
   
   Appear, moving towards her. It slows down.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
                   (from the vehicle)
             Hop on, Sid.
   
   Sid goes for it as two hands reach out to help her. One
   smooth move and Sidney is in the arms of...
   
   
   DEWEY RILEY
   
   She looks at him. Her face a book of questions.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What's going on, Dewey?
   
   He smiles at her. A safe, warm smile. His face as cute
   as ever.
   
                       DEWEY
             It'll be alright.

   EXT. SECURITY CART - MINUTES LATER
   
   The security cart trots along, passing STUDENTS coming
   and going. Dressed smartly in a campus security outfit,
   Dewey maneuvers the cart across the campus grounds.
   Sidney rides beside him, horrified as she listens to
   him.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Three hundred people watched?
             Nobody did anything?
   
                       DEWEY
             They thought it was a publicity
             stunt.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Oh my God. How could it happen?
   
                       DEWEY
             They don't know. It was carefully
             planned. Earlier in the day the
             victims received anonymous passes
             to the movie.
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's a copycat killer I knew this
             would happen. That fucking movie.
   
   The cart comes to a stop in front of a building.
   
                       DEWEY
             As of now, they don't see any
             relation. But they're checking it
             out. The state, Special Task Force,
             FBI - they're all here. They'll
             find the guy.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Yeah, right.
   
                       DEWEY
             Look, Sid, why don't you take off?
             Disappear for a few days. I'll come
             with you.
   
                       SIDNEY
             No. I will not crawl under a rock.
             This is a fucked-up world and
             people kill people all the time.
             I'll just get used to it.
   
   Dewey steps down off the security cart and helps Sid
   off.
   
                       DEWEY
             Nothing will happen to you. I
             promise.
   
   Sid's tough demeanor is cracking. She takes a deep
   breath.
   
                       DEWEY
             That's why I'm here, right? We take
             care of each other. C'mon, I'll
             walk you to class.
   
   He starts off, for the first time, a severe limp is
   visible as his left leg drags behind him.
   
                       SIDNEY
             You go, it's all stairs, I can take
             it from here.
   
                       DEWEY
             Don't worry...
   
                       SIDNEY
             Dewey, I'm completely equipped with
             mace, alarm whistle, keyring,
             knife, a degree in defensive
             combat...
   
                       DEWEY
             Just in case...
   
                       SIDNEY
             No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be
             okay. Go back to work and let me
             get back to my quasi pseudo-happy
             existence.
   
   Sidney reaches up and gives her pseudo-brother a kiss,
   then takes off for the building. Dewey watches until
   she disappears inside, then limps back to his security
   cart.

   EXT. STUDENT UNION PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATER
   
   A newsvan pulls up and parks next to a trough of other
   newsvans and REPORTERS. Some are doing live remotes,
   others ready themselves for the next onslaught.
   
   Gale gets out of the newsvan, her cellular affixed to
   her ear.
   
                       GALE
             I don't know... no one's talking.
             What's the studio's position? Never
             happen. They'd be stupid to pull
             the movie. With all this free press
             - they're gonna have huge numbers
             this weekend. It'll break box
             office records. Of course I have
             bumps.
   
   Gale's CAMERAMAN can be seen behind her, in the van
   fussing with equipment.
   
                       GALE (CONT'D)
             I need two minutes at six o'clock.
             I wanna do a piece on the slain
             kids - no sympathy shit - let's
             stick with the movie angle. I wanna
             pull a clip from an old film...
   
   Gale turns to her cameraman, snapping her fingers.
   
                       GALE (CONT'D)
             Hey, what was the name of that
             movie?
   
   The guy looks up at her. It's RANDY. Two years older
   but still the charming jokester.
   
                       RANDY
             HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE. MGN/UA.
             1980. Tom Hanks' first film.
   
                       GALE (CONT'D)
                   (into phone)
             HE KNOWS YOU'RE ALONE. Yeah, find
             it. Don't worry, I've got it
             covered... I have a plan. Yeah,
             I'll get it. Give it a rest - I
             said I'll get it. Later.
   
   She hangs up, turning to Randy.
   
                       GALE (CONT'D)
             Pressure's on. You ready for this?
   
                       RANDY
             I'm there, man. No worries. I got
             ya covered. I'm so there. That's
             why I'm here - because I'm there.
   
   Randy holds up his camera - stoked.

   INT. SCHOOL OF FILM - LATER
   
   Sidney moves down a hallway. Not your typical school
   building. Through open doorways, film equipment is
   glimpsed. Editing bays and the like. She's in the Film
   Department.
   
   She comes upon an open door and peers in. A large room,
   a class is in progress. She slips in quietly.
   
   
   INT. CLASSROOM - SAME
   
   Sidney takes a seat at the back of the room. A handful
   of FILM STUDENTS sit around on torn couches heavy in
   discussion. Sid goes unnoticed as she watches a
   whirlwind debate. A SNOTTY GUY is pontificating a
   point.
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             Sequels are too handicapped. By
             definition alone, they're inferior
             films.
   
   Hallie sits on a couch next to MICKEY, 20's, atheletic,
   cool and rowdy. Arms enwrapped.
   
                       MICKEY
             Bullshit generalization. Many
             sequels have surpassed their
             original.
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             Name one.
   
                       MICKEY
             ALIENS Far better than the
             original.
   
                       ANOTHER GUY
             Subjective.
   
                       SOME GIRL
             Life's subjective. I much prefer
             Ridley Scott.
   
   The conversation overlaps, everyone arguing... making
   their point about ALIENS VS. ALIEN.
   
                       HALLIE
             No way. ALIENS rocked. "Stay away
             from her - you bitch."
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             I'll give you that one. Name
             another.
   
                       MICKEY
             T2.
   
                       SOME GIRL
             You've got a hard-on for Cameron.
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             A bigger budget does not make a
             better movie. TERMINATOR one is
             historical.
   
   Someone screams out, "You Sarah Connor?" as the
   TEACHER, a young artsy type, speaks up.
   
                       ARTSY TEACHER
             How about THE GODFATHER PART II?
   
   Ooooohhh. The whole room goes worship silent. All in
   agreement.
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             The almighty exception. Name
             another.
   
   A YOUNG MAN, handsome and smooth, jumps into the
   conversation. His name is Derek.
   
                       DEREK
             EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. Smarter story.
             Improved effects.
   
   From the back of the room, Sidney watches him. Fixated.
   
                       HALLIE
             I liked JEDI. With the furry
             things.
   
   Everyone BOO'S. "Ewoks blow."
   
                       MICKEY
             Lucas and his Romper Room stage.
   
                       HALLIE
             I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH,
             PART 20.
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             Case in point. The entire horror
             genre was destroyed by sequels.
   
                       ARTSY TEACHER
             Really? And why do you think that
             is?
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             Sequels suck. Hello. It becomes
             about: money and no one's
             interested in quality.
   
                       DEREK
             It's more than that. Horror films
             are only as good as their villains.
             How can Freddie and Jason possibly
             be scary after they've been diluted
             through five or six sequels.
   
                       TEACHER
             What's the solution? If you were
             making a sequel today what would
             you do differently?
   
   The class stews on this. Derek turns, spotting Sidney
   in the back of the room. She gives a half wave. He
   starts for her, excusing himself.
   
                       SNOTTY GUY
             The point is - I made my point.
             Sequels suck.
   
   
   INT. CORRIDOR - SAME
   
   Derek and Sidney move out into the hallway. Derek
   throws his arms around her protectively.
   
                       DEREK
             How are you? You weren't in class.
             I called as soon as I heard...
   
                       SIDNEY
             I skipped. Too many "That's her"
             looks.
   
                       DEREK
             I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
   
                       SIDNEY
             Don't ask what you can do. No
             coddling. Life rolls on status quo.
   
   He looks at her with bedroom eyes.
   
                       DEREK
             I can do that. And I can also do
             this.
   
   He moves on her, wrapping her in his arms and kissing
   her passionately. She breaks away, laughing.
   
                       SIDNEY
             No PDA.
   
   But it's a failed objection. He kisses her again and
   they're soon devouring each other like two people in
   love. Right in the middle of the hallway.

   EXT. STUDENT UNION - LATE AFTERNOON
   
   The place is a circus. The front steps of the student
   center have been roped off to form a platform. A podium
   and mike have been placed center.
   
   CROWDS have gathered for the press conference that is
   being held by the university. Reporters and cameras
   have been roped off to the side. On stage, DEAN FISHER,
   a sharp looking woman in her forties is talking to
   spectators.
   
                       DEAN FISHER
                   (reading from a
                   prepared statement)
             "... and we feel this unfortunate
             isolated tragedy in no way reflects
             upon our fine school and we should
             trust that the authorities and FBI
             are acting quickly to bring us
             answers..."
   
   Beside her stand uniformed COPS, the local SHERIFF, FBI
   AGENTS. She continues on...
   
   
   IN THE ROPED OFF NEWS SECTION
   
   Gale walks through the crowd, listening to the Dean.
   
                       FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
             Gale? Can I have a second?
   
   Gale spins around to find DEBBIE SALT, the flashy
   reporter who she decked earlier, standing in front of
   her.
   
                       GALE
             Look, I'm sorry about the face.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer -
             NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
   
                       GALE
             Fair enough.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             What are you doing here? I thought
             you had retired from field
             reporting?
   
   The woman has immediately put Gale on the defensive.
   TWO OTHER REPORTERS have taken notice. Suddenly,
   CAMERAS are on Gale.
   
                       GALE
             Well, you know I'm dear to the
             subject matter.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             And much richer as a result.
   
                       GALE
             Do I know you? You look familiar.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             I took your vulture seminar seminar
             at Berkeley last year.
   
                       GALE
             Good for you.
   
   And in seconds the vultures are upon her as Gale
   Weathers is beseiged by REPORTERS. The questions spew
   forth. "Why are you here?" "Is this the work of a
   copycat killer?" "Have you talked to Sidney?" etc.
   
                       GALE
                   (ever smooth)
             Guys, you're missing the show.
   
   And with that Gale wanders off into the crowd.
   
   
   ON STAGE
   
   The LOCAL SHERIFF, a smart looking guy in his 50's is
   fielding questions.
   
                       SHERIFF
             No, we have no evidence of a serial
             killer. We think the killer acted
             deliberately and not at random...
   
   
   ON THE LAWN
   
   Students and concerned faculty stand. Among them are
   Sidney, Derek, Hallie and Mickey. Next to them stand
   JOEL, 20's, black, sensible and friendly. A very
   intelligent face.
   
                       DEREK
             But what are they doing? He's
             talking but he's not saying
             anything.
   
                       JOEL
             Sounds like they don't know
             anything.
   
                       HALLIE
             Do you think they'll cancel Hell
             Week?
   
                       MICKEY
             You're getting nailed - you're not
             getting out of it.
   
   From across the way, two gorgeous sorority type girls,
   LOIS and MURPHY stand with their FRATERNITY JOCK
   BOYFRIENDS. All looks and attitude. Their eyes are on
   Sidney as they huddle in a conspiratory stance.
   
                       JOEL
             Have they questioned you yet, Sid?
   
                       SIDNEY
             This has nothing to do with me,
             Joel. There's an estimated 270
             serial killers currently active in
             the US at any given time. I can't
             control that. Who's hungry?
   
                       HALLIE
             I have rehearsal.
   
                       MICKEY
             I have to watch rehearsal.
   
   Hallie kicks him. Joel moves to Sid.
   
                       JOEL
             I gotta hit the library. Anatomy.
             Some of us have real majors. You
             gonna be okay, Sid?
   
                       SIDNEY
             You're not allowed to ask that.
   
                       JOEL
             I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Thanks, Joel.
   
   Joel smiles, heading out as the two sorority girls,
   Lois and Murphy saunter over.
   
                       LOIS
             Hello, pledges. Enjoying
             yourselves?
   
   Instantly, Hallie stands at attention. Sidney joins
   begrudgingly.
   
                       HALLIE
             Yes, sister Lois. Very much so.
             Thank you for asking.
   
                       MURPHY
             Good. We need your help, pledges.
             Are you familiar with the Deltas TP
             fundraiser?
   
   The pledges shake their heads. Suspicious. Lois
   withdraws two rolls of toilet paper from her book bag
   and passes them out.
   
                       LOIS (CONT'D)
             In our efforts to raise money for
             our favorite cause...
   
                       MURPHY
             ... this week's TKE kegger...
   
                       LOIS
             Ne ask that you sell individual
             squares of toilet paper for a mere
             nickel a piece.
   
                       MURPHY
             We've set you each at a five dollar
             quota.
   
                       MICKEY
             Come on, guys. Uncool.
   
                       MURPHY
             Am I getting fraternity
             interference, Mickey?
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's okay. I can peddle toilet
             paper.
   
                       DEREK
             Sid, you don't have to.
   
   Sidney takes her toilet paper.
   
                       SIDNEY
             No special treatment. I can do
             this. C'mon Hallie.
   
   She throws him a comforting glance. She's okay with
   this. She heads off with Hallie. Derek watches.
   
                       DEREK
             How do you put up with this Greek
             shit?
   
                       MICKEY
             Hey, it's cool. Hallie's into it,
             I'm into Hallie...
   
                       ACROSS THE WAY
             Gale moves through the crowd as the
             press conference/rally continues.
             She runs dead smack into...
   
   
   DEWEY
   
   Their eyes meet. A long moment. The silence between
   them is revealing.
   
                       GALE
             Hello, Dwight.
   
                       DEWEY
             Miss Weathers.
   
                       GALE
             I've been trying to reach you but
             you haven't returned...
   
                       DEWEY
             I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers,
             excuse me.
   
   He tips his hat curtly, then starts off. She stops him.
   
                       GALE
             The name's Gale, remember'?
   
   He turns on her. His eyes on fire.
   
                       DEWEY
             Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is
             embedded clearly between my ears.
   
                       GALE
             I see you read the book.
   
                       DEWEY
             Yes, I do retain reading skills.
             Shock.
   
                       GALE
             And an explanation is, of course,
             out of the question.
   
                       DEWEY
             Page 32. "Deputy Dewey filled the
             room with his dim-witted Barney
             Fifish presence." I think you've
             explained yourself.
   
                       GALE
             Oh Dewey, I'm sorry.
   
                       DEWEY
             No, what you are is a money hungry,
             fame- seeking liar and - forgive me
             for saying - mediocre writer who
             has a cold storage shed where her
             heart should be.
   
   This stings Gale.
   
                       GALE
             You have every right to be upset.
   
                       DEWEY
             Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with
             inexperience."
   
                       GALE
             I never meant to imply...
   
                       DEWEY
             How do you know my dim-witted
             inexperience isn't merely a subtle
             form of manipulation used to lower
             people's expectations thereby
             enhancing my ability to effectively
             maneuver within any given
             situation?
   
   Gale is at a loss.
   
                       GALE
             I'm sorry. I don't know what else
             to say except I'm sorry.
   
                       DEWEY
             No, I'm the one who's sorry. I
             misjudged you. Now if you'll excuse
             me, I have some oozing to do.
   
   Dewey turns and limps away, leaving Gale staring after
   him. Her face smashed fiat.
   
   
   ON STAGE
   
   The sheriff continues fielding questions from
   reporters.
   
                       SHERIFF
             No, there has been no evidence that
             more than one killer is
             responsible...
   
   
   ACROSS THE WAY
   
   Sidney and Hallie have split up. They move through the
   crowd selling toilet paper. Several STUDENTS make their
   purchase.
   
   Sidney pockets her change, looks up to see Gale,
   standing alone. She goes to her.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Hello, Gale.
   
                       GALE
             Sidney. Hello. How are you?
   
                       SIDNEY
             I'm okay. PEOPLE magazine won't
             stop calling but other than that...
   
                       GALE
             I'm sorry.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Yeah, well... you are the
             definition of mixed emotions. I
             really should hate you... I see
             your movie's getting good reviews.
   
                       GALE
             It seems to be causing a stir.
             What's with the toilet paper?
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's hell week. I'm pledging the
             Deltas.
   
                       GALE
             It's good to see you involved.
   
                       SIDNEY
             My morn was a Delta.
   
   Beat. People have begun to notice the two of them
   talking. Reporters and spectators have slowly circled
   them. Gale looks around. She spots Randy, who appears
   behind Sid, with his camera. Gale gives him the nod. He
   throws the camera up, hits the light.
   
   Sid spins around, surprised to see him.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Randy? What are you doing here?
   
   But then she sees someone else, standing off to the
   side. A man she recognizes immediately. He looks at;
   her, his face sullen, broken. Sidney loses her breath.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Cotton...
   
   He moves to her.
   
                       COTTON
             Hello, Sidney.
   
   Gale motions to Randy. He maneuvers, getting the two of
   them in frame. A long moment, Sidney just stares at
   him. Completely off guard. She looks to Randy who aims
   the camera directly at her... filming her.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What are you doing?
   
   She turns back to Gale, staring holes through her,
   realizing she's been set up. She looks back to Cotton.
   She doesn't know what to say. She turns back to Gale.
   Eyes aflame.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             You BITCH!
   
   Sidney storms off, disappearing in the crowd. Cotton
   turns to Gale. His face pained.
   
                       COTTON
             This was a mistake. I shouldn't be
             here.
   
   He takes off, pushing through the crowd. Randy stops
   filming.
   
                       RANDY
             Can you say backfire?
   
                       GALE
             Did you get it?
   
                       RANDY
             Yeah, I got it.
   
   Randy is clearly not happy about his part in this. It's
   in his voice.
   
                       GALE
             You need to check your conscience
             at the door. We're not here to be
             loved.
   
   Randy's face reveals otherwise.
   
                       AT THE PODIUM
             The sheriff continues.
   
                       SHERIFF
             No, we don't anticipate another
             murder but we are taking every
             precaution possible...
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. SORORITY ROW - NIGHT
   
   A small street that dead-ends in a cul de sac. Large
   old homes populate it. Greek signs adorn the place.
   Welcome to Sorority Row.
   
   
   INT. SORORITY HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
   
   A huge living room. Divided sensibly in several
   sections. Nicely done. Et is empty except for one girl
   who lies on the couch watching television. This is
   CICI, pretty with a lively energy about her. She
   channel surfs while talking on the phone.

                   (on phone)

             take it anymore.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE

             No, he quit - the whole God thing -
             he has issues. The previews for

   BEEP! BEEP! Call waiting bleeps through.

             Teddy's on the other line. He
             sounds drunk. I'll call you back.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             That shit. He only calls you when
             he's drunk. Don't go over there.
   
                       CICI
             I won't.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             Don't. Think Bailey.
   
                       CICI

             up?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Who's Ted?
   
   Realizing, it's not Ted.
   
                       CICI
             Oh, I'm sorry. My bad. I thought
             you were someone else.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE

                       MAN'S VOICE
             I'm inquisitive.
   
                       CICI
             I'm impatient. Look, do you wanna
             leave a message for someone?
   
   Silence. No response.
   
                       CICI (CONT'D)
             Hello? Hello? Where'd you go?
   
   Silence again. And then...
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Do you wanna die tonight, Cici ?
   
   Almost a whisper. Simple. Direct. His voice pierces
   Cici. Her eyes widen. BEEP! Call waiting CLICKS
   through.
   
                       CICI
             Just a second.
                   (clicks over)
             Yes?
   
   Cici gets up and moves to...
   
   
   INT. FOYER - SAME
   
   Cici checks the front door, making sure it's locked.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             Was it Teddy?
   
                       CICI
             No, some creep asshole trying to
             scare me.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             It's hell week. Chill. The movie
             murders have brought out the
             crazies. It's nothing.
   
   BUMP! A noise from upstairs. Cici spins around to the
   staircase.
   
                       CICI
             Shit.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             What is it?
   
                       CICI
             I heard a noise.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             Where?
   
                       CICi
             Upstairs.
   
   BUMP! Something moves upstairs. It sounds almost like
   footsteps.
   
                       CICI
             Shit. Cici moves to the staircase.
             She peers up it.
   
                       CICI (CONT'D)
                   (calling out)
             Hello? Hello?
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
                   ( la Friday the 13th)
             Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah,
             hah, hah...
   
                       CICI
             Stop it...
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             I can't believe you're alone in
             that house.
   
   Cici looks up the staircase again.
   
                       CICI
                   (soft whisper)
             I don't think I'm alone.
   
   Floorboards CREAK above her. Cici freaks.
   
                       CICI
             I'm outta here.
   
   She flies to the door, unlocking it, throwing it open.
   She moves out onto the...
   
   
   EXT. FRONT PORCH - SAME
   
   A wooden porch with a bulb glowing overhead. She stands
   on the porch steps, looking back, through the open
   door, into the house. The phone starts to CRACKLE.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             You're breaking up. Where are you?
   
                       CICI
             Outside.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             That's smart.
   
   Cici looks up and down the street. A YOUNG GUY walks
   along the sidewalk.
   
                       CICI
                   (calling out to him)
             Hey, you? HELLO? HELL0?
   
   The guy wears a headset, his head bobbing to the beat.
   He doesn't see her. Cici looks up the street to a
   sorority house down the block. Lights burn from within.
   People come and go.
   
                       CICI (CONT'D)
             There's something going on at the
             Delta Zeta's. I'm gonna walk down.
   
   Cici moves further down the porch steps. The phone
   begins to CRACK severely.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
                   (phone begins to go
                   out)
             Don't do that. Hang up... call...
                   (static)
   
                       CICI
             What? I can't hear you...
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
                   (major static)
             Hang up... call...
   
                       CICI
             I'm losing you.
   
                       GIRL ON PHONE
             ... campus security... send
             someone... check out... place...
   
                       CICI
             Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll
             call you back.
   
   Cici hangs up the phone. She hits the "TALK" button.
   Nothing but static. She tries again. She can't get a
   dial tone. She looks back to the front door. She
   hesitates quickly, debating, then she moves back up the
   porch steps.
   
   She tries the phone again. It still won't connect. She
   moves back to the front porch. It connects. Major
   static. She dials 511.
   
                       VOICE
                   (major static)
             Campus Security.
   
                       CICI
             Hello, I'm calling from the Chi
             Omega...
   
                       VOICE
                   (too much static)
             I'm sorry. I can't hear you. Hello?
   
   Cici eyes the open front door. She inches back to it.
   
                       CICA (CONT'D)
             Can you hear me now?
   
                       VOICE
             We... bad..connec... call back.
   
   The phone goes dead.
   
                       CICI
             Shit.
   
   Cici redials. The same static.
   
                       VOICE
             Hello?
   
                       CICI
             I'm calling...
   
                       VOICE
             I can't hear you.
   
   Cici peers through the front door, into the house. It's
   completely empty. Cici steps back inside the house. The
   connection becomes much clearer.
   
                       CICI
             I'm calling from the Chi Omega
             house. Someone is harassing me.
             Hello?
   
   There's no one on the line.
   
                       CICI (CONT'D)
             Shit!
   
   SUDDENLY, A FIGURE APPEARS BEHIND HER. A HAND GRABS
   HER.
   
   Cici spins around, SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER.
   
                       GIRL'S VOICE
             Did the phone ring?
   
   Standing before her is DAWNIE, a young girl, sweet, pre-
   occupied.
   
                       CICI
             Jesus, you scared me. What are you
             doing here?
   
                       DAWNIE
             I live here.
   
                       CICI
             I thought you were going to the
             mixer?
   
                       DAWNIE
             I had to change. Did anyone call?
   
                       CICI
             Just some asshole trying to scare
             me.
   
   The front door remains wide open. The phone RINGS. Cici
   stares at it in her hand. She doesn't answer it.
   
                       DAWNIE
             Are you okay?
   
   Cici nods, answering the phone. ROCK MUSIC BLARES from
   the receiver.
   
                       CICI
             Hello?
   
                       DRUNK GIRL
                   (from phone)
             We need a ride. Taxi! Taxi!
   
                       CICI
             Where are you?
   
                       DRUNK GIRL
                   (from phone)
             We're at Grogs and need a ride to
             Acid Rain.
   
                       DAWNIE
             Who is it? Is it Tina?
   
                       CICI
             They're at Grogs.
   
   Dawnie grabs the phone, moving into the living room.
   She moves to a mirror and fusses with her hair.
   
                       DAWNIE
             Tina, it's Dawnie. I'm on my way.
             Cici follows her back into the
             living room.
   
                       CICI
             I'll go. I don't mind. Really.
   
   Dawnie hangs up the phone, turning to Cici.
   
                       DAWNIE
             Take the next one. You should set
             the alarm. There's a killer on the
             loose.
   
   Reflected through the mirror is the foyer. Neither see
   as a SHROUDED FIGURE appears through the front door.
   Dawnie turns back to the mirror just as the Figure
   sweeps into the dark dining room and out of sight.
   
   Dawnie starts back for the front door. The phone RINGS.
   
   Dawnie grabs it.
   
                       DAWNIE (CONT'D)
             Hello?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Is Cici there?
   
                       DAWNIE
             Who's calling?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Ted?
   
   Dawnie throws her the phone and races out the door.
   
                       DAWNIE (CONT'D)
             It's your ill-concieved boyfriend.
             Seeya later. Set the alarm.
   
   She SLAMS the door shut behind her. A second later we
   hear it lock. Dawnie brings the phone up to her ear.
   
                       CICI
             Hello? Ted?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             No, it's me.
   
   Cici nearly collapses. She's starting to lose it.
   
                       CICI
             WHAAAATT?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Don't forget to set the alarm.
   
   Cici hangs up, throwing the phone across the room. She
   moves back to the foyer where an alarm panel is
   positioned in the wail. She hits a coupla digits and a
   BEEP is heard as she activates the alarm.
   
   She checks the door, making sure it's locked, then she
   turns and moves into the...
   
   
   DARK DINING ROOM
   
   Cici finds the light switch. CLICK! The room is
   illuminated. Two long dining tables run the length of
   the room. It's empty. Void of the Figure.
   
   
   INT. KITCHEN - SAME
   
   A large, dark kitchen. Cici moves to the frig and opens
   it, She gives it the once over. The frig light reflects
   against her face. She closes the refrigerator, not
   seeing the Shadow that bounces across her back.
   
   Cici moves to a sliding glass door that overlooks the
   backyard. She checks the lock. Secure. Then, the phone
   RINGS.
   
   She turns to the phone that's attached to a nearby
   wall. It RINGS AGAIN. She reaches for it, answering it.
   
                       CICI
             Hello?
   
   
   SUDDENLY, TWO HANDS LUNGE OUT OF THE DARKNESS
   
   One finds her neck, the other grabs her by the hair,
   wrenching her head backwards and spinning her around,
   shoving her, pushing her into the...
   
   
   SLIDING GLASS DOOR
   
   Glass explodes everywhere, shattering to bits as Cici's
   body crashes through it, setting off the ALARM. A loud,
   shrill RING resonants through the house as Cici's body
   lands on the deck outside. Still. (NOTE: WES DOES
   REALLY SCARY SHIT HERE.)
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. DELTA ZETA HOUSE - MINUTES LATER
   
   Two doors down from Chi Omega. A big, old Gothic home
   serves as the Delta Zeta sorority. MUSIC PLAYS from
   inside. It sounds like a party.
   
   
   EXT. DELTA ZETA LIVING ROOM - SANE
   
   The room is filled with fifteen to twenty people.
   SORORITY GIRLS and FRAT BOYS who SCREAM and CHEER as
   they watch four girls who sit on their knees, hands
   behind their back, in front of a coffee table devouring
   plates of macaroni and cheese topped with whipped
   cream.
   
   Sidney, Hallie, and two other girls, TERI and LUCE tear
   into the macaroni with all their might. Gobbling it up,
   making a mess of themselves. Mickey is next to Hallie,
   coaching her on. On Sid as she finishes her plate.
   
   A whistle BLOWS.
   
                       MURPHY (CONT'D)
             Looks like we have a winner.
   
   Sid sits up. Macaroni and whipped cream is all over her
   face. She smiles the victor. Everyone APPLAUDS.
   
                       MURPHY (CONT'D)
             Sidney gets to skip the next round
             of Bulimia bingo.
   
   Hallie, a face full of grime, eyes Sid.
   
                       HALLIE
             You bitch.
   
   They crack up. Someone passes her a towel. She stands
   wiping her face, looking across the room as Derek
   enters through the front door. She waves at, him. He
   hurries over.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Where have you been'? You missed my
             shining moment. I won the macaroni
             sundae binge.
   
                       DEREK
             I'm sorry honey. I got behind.
   
   
   ON HALLIE AND MICKEY
   
   Mickey is cleaning off Hallie's face.
   
                       MICKEY
             I don't want you to choke or
             anything but you're trailing. You
             need to pick the pace up.
   
   She swats him.
   
   
   ON SID AND DEREK
   
   Sid and Derek stand arm in arm watching the next round.
   
                       SIDNEY
                   (complete throw away)
             Any news?
   
                       DEREK
             About what?
   
                       SIDNEY
             The forbidden subject.
   
   He shakes his head.
   
   Suddenly, a FRAT BOY pops into the room.
   
                       FRAT BOY
             Yo, guys, outside. Something's up
             at the Chi Omega. Police are
             everywhere.
   
   People begin to stand, moving to the windows and front
   door. Sidney looks to Derek.
   
   
   EXT. DELTA ZETA HOUSE - SAME
   
   Everyone comes flying out of the front door and into
   the yard as POLICE CARS WHIP BY. SIRENS BLARING.
   
   
   ANGLE ON STREET
   
   Two doors down sits the Chi Omega house crawling with
   police, ambulances, reporters...
   
   "Yo - let's check it out." "C'mon." The entire crowd
   takes off in droves down the street. All except for...
   
   
   SIDNEY AND DEREK
   
   They stand on the porch, watching as the street becomes
   a circus.
   
   
   CLOSE ON SIDNEY'S FACE
   
   She knows.
   
   
   INT. CHI OMEGA HOUSE - SAME
   
   Captain Tyler, the Sheriff, police, FBI... the house is
   crawling. Dewey sifts around on his own, checking
   things out.
   
   
   IN THE KITCHEN
   
   Captain Tyler and the Sheriff stand at the shattered
   glass door.
   
                       SHERIFF
             Lots of blood. But no body.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Have you checked the...
   
                       SHERIFF
             Attic, garage, basement, nothing.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Take the neighborhood.
   
   The Sheriff turns to his men.
   
                       SHERIFF
             Alright men, listen up...
   
   Dewey is all ears.
   
   
   INT. DELTA ZETA HOUSE - SAME
   
   Derek and Sid stand on the porch, his arms around her.
   Her face is numb.
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's starting all over again.
   
                       DEREK
             Lemme take you home.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I'll get my jacket.
   
   Sidney, indifferent, moves through the open front door,
   back inside the house. Her face and mind detached from
   what's going on. Derek remains on the porch, watching
   the spectacle. Slowly, the door behind him closes.
   
   
   INT. DELTA ZETA LIVING ROOM - SANE
   
   Sid moves through the living room, she grabs her coat
   when the phone RINGS. She looks at it suspiciously...
   knowingly... she reaches for it.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Hello?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Hello Sidney?
   
   The VOICE. Low and haunting. Sidney closes her eyes.
   When she opens them tears are immediate But still, she
   refuses to crack.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Who are you?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Soon, Sidney, soon.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What do you want?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             To see every ounce of blood drain
             from your body.
   
   The Voice has never sounded more evil... more
   seductive. Sidney doesn't flinch. She holds steady.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Then come and get me.
   
   And with that Sidney hangs up the phone, SLAMMING it
   down. Silence. And then...
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             My pleasure.
   
   The Voice comes from inside the room... behind her.
   Sidney spins around and finds herself staring at the...
   
   
   GHOST MASKED FIGURE
   
   But not the one from the movie theater. The one from
   Sidney's nightmare long ago. It stands in the foyer
   archway, staring at her.
   
   A sustained moment. A stand off. Sidney doesn't move.
   But then the killer withdraws his trademark. A long,
   steel hunting knife... blood stained.
   
   
   SIDNEY BOLTS
   
   As the GHOST LEAPS at her. She SCREAMS, dodging him,
   
   
   ON THE PORCH
   
   Derek hears her SCREAM. He turns to the front door. He
   finds it locked. He starts to BEAT on it.
   
                       DEREK
             Sid? Sid?
   
   
   IN THE LIVING ROOM
   
   Sid just dodges the Ghost, just missing the knife's
   blade. She bolts through the living room, to the front
   door. Derek beats on it from outside.
   
   
   IN THE FOYER
   
                       SIDNEY
             Derek. He's in the house. Help...
             me...
   
   She struggles with the door, there are too many locks,
   the Ghost is already upon her. She looks to the stairs,
   thinks better of it... flies through the dining room.
   
   
   INT. FRONT PORCH - SANE
   
   Derek is going nuts trying to get into the house. He
   moves along the porch to the windows, looking through.
   He watches as the Ghost Figure chases her into the
   kitchen. Derek looks about the porch. He rears his foot
   back and kicks in the window.
   
   
   INT. KITCHEN - SAME
   
   Sid moves through the kitchen to the back door. She
   struggles with the lock as the Ghost is right behind
   her. She barely makes it out the back door...
   
   
   EXT. BACK YARD - SAME
   
   A large, fenced in yard. Lots of big oak trees. Sid
   flies down the back porch and into the yard. She moves
   across it, passed trees and shrubs. She spots a closed
   fence door in the back of the yard. She looks behind
   her to find...
   
   
   NOTHING
   
   She scans the yard, the Ghost Figure has completely
   disappeared. She moves behind a big tree, hiding behind
   it.
   
   Sid stops, catches her breath, then peers from behind
   the tree. The yard is completely empty. She goes for
   the fence door, slowly moving around the tree.
   
   BUMP! A noise in the darkness. She spins around, still
   making her way around the tree, moving backwards,
   walking right into a FIGURE. She SCREAMS, spinning
   around, finding herself face to face with...
   
   
   CICI'S BODY
   
   Hanging, dangling, hung from the tree, her stomach a
   ripped, bloody mess. Sidney SCREAMS IN UNFORGETTABLE
   HORROR. She steps back, falling right into the arms
   of...
   
   
   DEWEY
   
   She turns, SCREAMING.
   
                       DEWEY
             It's okay. It's okay. It's just me.
   
   He takes her into his arms, comforting her, as she
   holds on for dear life.
   
   
   EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - MORNING
   
   The early sun casts light upon an otherwise dark and
   joyless morning as the blood stained campus slowly
   comes to life.
   
   
   EXT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - MORNING
   
   The local campus security office has been converted
   into a media event. News trucks, cameras and REPORTERS
   stand guard outside while inside...
   
   
   INT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - MORNING
   
   The place is packed. No longer just a campus security
   office. The place has been converted to the local
   police station as well as FBI headquarters. UNIFORMS
   and SUITS swarm the place.
   
   In a back section of the room, Sheriff Hartley and
   Captain Tyler are in a huge discussion with Dean
   Fisher. Tempers are heated. Its been a sleepless night
   for all.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             We don't know if it's random. We
             haven't been able to connect the
             victims.
   
                       SHERIFF
             The first two were stabbed without
             thought. The sorority girl was
             gutted with autopsy precision.
   
                       DEAN FISHER
             Christ! Just do something. I will
             not have a repeat of Gainesville.
             Not on my campus. .
   
   Dewey listens to this exchange, slowly stepping
   forward.
   
                       DEWEY
             Sidney Prescott, sir.
   
   They both turn to him.
   
                       DEWEY (CONT'D)
             She's the connection.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             We know that, son.
   
                       DEWEY
             The killer was trying to get to
             her. That sorority girl was a
             distraction.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             We're aware of that.
   
   Sheriff Hartley steps forward.
   
                       DEWEY
             The killer is obviously repeating
             Woodsboro. I can fill you in on
             what I know.
   
   Dewey is not a welcome participant. Eyes roll. Captain
   Tyler pulls Dewey aside.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Look, son. I know you've lived
             through this, but we got it under
             control. Why don't you have some
             coffee?
   
   Just then, Gale Weathers appears being ushered in by
   TWO UNIFORMS. Dean Fisher greets her with smiles The
   FBI and local police fawn over her.
   
                       SHERIFF
             Thank you, Miss Weathers for coming
             in.
   
                       GALE
             Of course, what can I do?
   
   Captain Tyler gives Dewey a patronizing pat on the
   back, sending him off.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             We were hoping you could help with
             the killer's profile.
   
   Dewey's face couldn't be more burned.
   
   
   INT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - MORNING - MINUTES LATER
   
   A chalk board in front of them. Three names are written
   on it under the label "Victims" - "MAUREEN EVANS, PHIL
   STEVENS, CICI TAYLOR"
   
   Gale is at the chalk board
   
                       GALE
             Maureen Evans - Maureen Prescott.
             Sidney Prescott's mother. The first
             victim in the Woodsboro Murders.
             Phil Stevens - Stephen Orth - the
             first kid to be murdered. Ten to
             one - Cici is not the third
             victim's real name.
   
                       SHERIFF
             It's Cassandra.
   
                       GALE
             Nickname Cassie or - Casey. The
             third victim in Woodsboro. She was
             hung from a tree and gutted.
   
   The room goes quiet. Dewey watches from the back of the
   room. His eyes burning holes into Gale.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Jesus...
   
                       GALE
             This is a complete copycat. Your
             killer is even going in sequence.
   
   Captain Tyler sits up.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Who was the next victim in
             Woodsboro?
   
                       GALE
             In the book or in the movie?
   
                       DEAN FISHER
             Let's try reality.
   
                       GALE
             Mr. Himbry - the principal was the
             next victim. However, in the movie
             version, Tatum Riley was killed
             next. Dramatic license.
   
                       SHERIFF
             Jesus Christ. Captain Tyler flies
             out of his seat and into action.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
                   (to his men)
             Find me every variation of Himbry
             and what was the other name...
   
                       DEWEY
             Tatum Riley.
   
   Dewey speaks up. His voice soft but heard. The entire
   room stares at him, knowingly. Gale's eyes find his. He
   looks away.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Both on campus and the surrounding
             community. I want names ASAP.
   
                       DEAN FISHER
             I'll get you full access.
   
   The room breaks into a fury as they jump into action.
   Gale stops Captain Tyler.
   
                       GALE
             What about Sidney? Is she safe?
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             She's completely insulated. I've
             got my top men on her.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   INT. SIDNEY ' S DORM ROOM - MORNING
   
   Sid, Derek, Hallie, Mickey, and Joel lounge among
   pillows and blankets. The remains of a sleepover. Joel
   parts the blinds.
   
   
   ANGLE THROUGH WINDOW
   
   Two plains clothed policemen are in view, milling about
   outside - standing guard.
   
                       JOEL
             How many guys they have on you?
   
                       MICKEY
             I counted four.
   
   Hallie reads from a notebook in her hand.
   
                       HALLIE
             Okay, you're sure about skipping
             Calculas?
   
                       SIDNEY
             Please, I have the perfect excuse.
   
                       HALLIE
             What about rehearsal?
   
                       SIDNEY
             Gotta.
   
                       HALLIE
             I'll cover you through rehearsal.
             Derek when do you get outta docu-
             drama?
   
                       DEREK
             Two.
   
                       HALLIE
             So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
   
                       DEREK
             And watch her til 8:00 - I've got
             to edit.
   
                       JOEL
             Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio
             and we can grab a bite.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
   
                       HALLIE
             Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take
             her late evening.
   
                       MICKEY
             Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
   
                       HALLIE
             Too bad.
   
                       SIDNEY
             This is exactly what I don't want.
   
                       DEREK
             I think it's out of your control.
   
   Derek puts his arms around her, pulling her close.
   Mickey and Hallie argue about this evening. Joel moves
   out the door.
   
                       JOEL
             Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
   
                       SIDNEY
             But...
   
   Derek kisses her sweetly.
   
                       SIDNEY
             My screwed up life shouldn't have
             to bleed onto my friends.
   
                       DEREK
             Let us decide that.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What about your film? Isn't it due
             next week? Have you even started
             it?
   
                       DEREK
             It's under control.
   
   He kisses her again.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   INT. STUDENT UNION - LATER
   
   A huge one-stop for students. Comprised of several open
   floors, it looks like a mini-mall. A cafeteria, book
   store, movie theatre, arcade, etc. fill the place.
   
   Gale moves through the lobby area when she sees Debbie
   Salt heading her off. She tries to bolt but she's not
   fast enough.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Hi, Gale, any leads?
   
                       GALE
             Tons and tons.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Where is Sidney's father?
   
                       GALE
             Home - where he lives.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             And are the police sure about that?
   
                       GALE
             Why don't you ask them?
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Already did. He's the perfect
             suspect, don't you think?
   
                       GALE
             No, I don't.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Parents are always responsible. It
             all starts in the home.
   
                       GALE
             Look, I know you kinda hold me up
             as your career template and it
             gives you some anal charge to
             challenge me but you win. Okay? I'm
             not interested in the scoop
             anymore. Excuse me.
   
   Gale charges off, moving to a nearby newsstand. The
   tabloid papers exploit what's going on. Crazy headlines
   about the murders dominate the newsrack.
   
   Gale is clearly bothered by this. Just then, a phone
   RINGS. She pulls it from her pocket.
   
                       GALE (CONT'D)
             Hello?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Hello, Gale.
   
   It's the Killer. His voice is unmistakable.
   
                       GALE
             Who is this?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             I'll give you one guess.
   
   Gale knows immediately. She looks around for help. A
   CAMPUS COP is across the lobby.
   
                       GALE
             Who are you?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             That's not the way we play the
             game.
   
                       GALE
             I don't play games.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             What if your life depended on it?
   
   Gale gets testy with him.
   
                       GALE
             What do you want?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             You're pretty when you're angry.
   
   Gale stops cold. She looks around. The place is alive
   with people. He could be anywhere.
   
                       GALE
             Where are you?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             I'm everywhere.
   
   She continues moving to the Campus Cop.
   
                       GALE
             Oh - a God complex
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Stay away from the cop.
   
   A deadly warning. Gale stops. She plays it cool. She
   looks above her to the upper floor. STUDENTS hang over
   a balcony.
   
                       GALE
             What do you want from me?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             It's what you want from me.
   
   Silence.
   
                       GALE
             What do you mean?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             You are writing another book,
             aren't you? That's why you're here.
             The story's not over.
   
                       GALE
             You're getting obvious.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             No, Gale, I'm just getting started.

             No, wait...
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Watch your back.
   
   CLICK. The phone goes dead. Gale spins around, doing
   quick circle to make sure no one's around her. She
   turns and heads off, right into...
   
   
   DEWEY
   
   They both GASP.

   INT. CAMPUS THEATRE - DAY
   
   A large tiered theatre. Seats five-hundred. Old but
   preserved and updated. A rehearsal is in progress.
   SEVERAL ACTORS stand stage center running lines as
   stagehands work on the set around them.
   
   Sidney is one of them. She moves around the stage, very
   animated. More alive than ever. She dons a Russian
   accent. Convincing. A promising actress.
   
                       SIDNEY
                   (in character)
             "Pain, yah, such pain. Pain."
   
   An awkward silence. Everyone looks at each other.
   Finally, Lois, the bitchy sorority girl speaks up.
   
                       LOIS
             That's not the line. You jumped.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Shit. Did I?
   
                       LOIS
             About a page.
   
                       DIRECTOR
                   (off stage)
             CUT! Let's take five.
   
   The actors break up as Sidney, frustrated, walks across
   a make shift bridge that takes her across the orchestra
   pit and down the stairs into the house where Hallie
   sits watching. Sid's bodyguards can be seen sitting
   scattered about.
   
                       HALLIE
             That was good.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Yeah, right.
   
   The DIRECTOR, mid-30's, intelligent, friendly.
   
                       DIRECTOR
             Sid, why don't you get outta here?
             We'll pick this up tomorrow.
   
   Sid nods in agreement. The Director smiles at her.
   
                       DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
             Work on the accent.
   
   She grabs her things and heads off with Hallie when...
   
                       VOICE
             Sid?
   
   Sid turns to find Randy moving through an aisle. He had
   been watching rehearsal. Sid's face tenses.
   
                       HALLIE
             Who is that guy?
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet
             you outside.
   
                       HALLIE
             No, girletta, I don't leave your
             side.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I've got my entourage. Take a
             break. Please.
   
   Sid is definite. Hallie backs off, heading up the
   aisle, against her better wishes.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What do you want?
   
                       RANDY
             I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never
             should have gone along with Gale. I
             know I'm stupid. I wish I had some
             good reason to give you but I'm
             just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be
             mad at me.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Do you work for her now?
   
                       RANDY
             Well, yeah... she gave me a job.
             Freelance. It got me outta
             Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton
             and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I
             knew it was a bad idea but it
             seemed like a quasi harmless bad
             idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up.
   
   Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly
   appearing.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Me, too. Randy. Me too.
   
   He nods, knowingly.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Wanna get outta here?

             If he calls again - find help.
             Don't engage him in conversation.
             I'm gonna put a man on you - to

                       DEWEY
             I can do it, Captain.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Thanks, Dewey, but I was thinking
             I'd pull Jesse off...
   
                       GALE
             I'd prefer Dewey, Captain.
   
   Tyler doesn't argue. He's too crazed. Dewey avoids
   Gale's stare.

             How's the name search going?

   ON SCREEN
   
   A young girl, looking a lot like Tori Spelling, runs
   down a school corridor. She runs smack into a young,
   handsome boy. He could very well be Johnny Depp.
   
                       TORI
                   (in movie)
             Oh, God, Billy, you scared me. What
             are you doing here?
   
                       JOHNNY
                   (in movie)
             They let me go, Sid, I didn't do
             it. I'm innocent.
   
   
   IN THE THEATRE
   
   Sid and Randy sit in the small cineplex mall type
   theatre. Behind them sit Sid's trusting police guards.
   Sidney shifts in her seat.
   
                       RANDY
             You okay, Sid?
   
                       SIDNEY
             Yeah.
   
   
   ON SCREEN
   
   Tori Spelling and Johnny Depp continue their dramatic
   discussion.
   
                       JOHNNY
             When my mom left my dad, I accepted
             it. That's just the way the cookie
             crumbles. Moms leave.
   
                       TORI
             Yeah, but your mom left town. She's
             not dead. My mom's dead. Do you
             hear me? She's dead. Dead. And
             she's never coming back. Ever,
             Ever.

             My documentary is due on Tuesday.
   
                       MICKEY
             What's your subject?
   
                       DEREK
             I WAS A SORORITY SLUT.
   
                       JOEL
             You should of done it on Sidney.
             That would have been a cool.
   
                       DEREK
             She wouldn't let me.
   
                       MICKEY
             Not with Primetime Live and 20/20
             coming at her. I'd save my shit
             too.
   
   Hallie comes waltzing up.
   
                       DEREK
             Where's Sid?
   
                       HALLIE
             Damned if I know. She ditched me.
   
                       DEREK
             You weren't supposed to leave her
             alone.
   
                       HALLIE
             I didn't say she was alone. That
             guy - from her home town showed up.
             They went off together.
   
   Hallie plops down, giving Mickey a big kiss.
   
                       MICKEY
             I've been waiting for you, baby.
   
                       JOEL
             Is that cool? Just to leave her
             like that?
   
                       HALLIE
             She's got guards with her.
   
                       DEREK
             What guy?
   
                       HALLIE
             Randy somebody.
   
                       JOEL
             Randy Meeks. He was with Sid that
             night in Woodsboro.
   
                       MICKEY
             Her old boyfriend?
   
                       JOEL
             No, she killed her boyfriend. Randy
             was a friend.
   
                       MICKEY
             Watch out, Derek.
   
                       HALLIE
             He tried to kill her first.
   
                       MICKEY
             Is Sid in therapy?
   
                       JOEL
             She was for a while. Gave it up.
   
                       DEREK
             How do you know so much about her?
   
                       JOEL
             I read the book.
   
                       MICKEY
             I could use some therapy.
   
                       DEREK
             Should we be worried about this
             guy? Isn't it kinda weird he just
             showed up and now people are dying?
   
                       HALLIE
             He seemed harmless.
   
                       DEREK
             Aren't most serial killers
             seemingly harmless?
   
                       JOEL
             And white.
   
                       MICKEY
             Easy black boy.
   
                       JOEL
             It's documented. Most serial
             killers are attractive - slightly
             off white males in their twenties.
   
                       HALLIE
             That's you, honey.
   
   Hallie kisses Mickey again.
   
                       MICKEY
             I got a surprise for you.
   
                       HALLIE
             What?
   
   Suddenly, he leaps up on the cafeteria table and begins
   to sing at the top of his lungs.
   
                       MICKEY
             "If I should stay. I would only be
             in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I
             know, I'll think of you each step
             of the way...
   
                       HALLIE
             Don't do this.
   
                       MICKEY
             "And IIIIIIIIIYEIIIII will always
             love you OOOOOOWUOOOOOOOO will
             always love you."
   
   Everyone has taken notice. They begin to cheer and sing
   with him.
   
                       JOEL
                   (to Derek)
             Whitney?
   
                       DEREK
             I think he's doing Dolly.
   
                       MICKEY
             "And I hope life treats you kind
             and I hope you have all you dreamed
             of offffff. I wish you JOYYY."
   
                       DEREK
             Definitely Whitney.
   
   Hallie can't help but be touched. He finishes up,
   ending on a last, final note. As he does, he pulls a
   necklace from around his neck. His Greek letters dangle
   from it. He places them around her neck, kissing her.
   
                       JOEL
             Isn't that a big no-no?
   
                       DEREK
             I think so.
   
   Hallie breaks away. She swats him.
   
                       HALLIE
             You're going to get it. You know
             what happens.
   
                       MICKEY
             But I love you. And I want the
             whole world to know it.
   
   Hallie smiles, her eyes misty. Derek and Joel eye each
   other.

   It's the end of the movie. Tori Spelling is running for
   her life from two killers - Johnny Depp and his
   sidekick. She finds herself trapped in the kitchen.
   Johnny Depp holds the knife up to Tori's face.
   
                       TORI
             Why did you kill my mother?
   
                       JOHNNY
             Because she was sleeping with my
             dad. She's the reason my mom left.
             She was a whore just like you.

   Sidney can't take it anymore. She gets up and races out

   INT. LOBBY - A SECOND LATER
   
   Sid emerges from the theatre and into the lobby. She
   moves into a curtained section where the water fountain
   is. She looks up and sees Randy flying out of the
   theatre. He exits outside looking for her. The cops are
   right behind him.
   
                       VOICE
             Hello Sidney.
   
   Sidney spins around. Cotton Weary stands before her.
   shoulders slumped, his face pained.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Cotton.
   
                       COTTON
             Can we talk?
   
                       SIDNEY
             I don't think that's a good idea.
   
                       COTTON
             Look, yesterday wasn't my idea.
             That was all Gale and dollar signs
             and ratings.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What do you want from me, Cotton?
   
                       COTTON
             You could start with an apology.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I did that.
   
                       COTTON
             You wrote me a letter. Very
             cordial. Very appropriate.
   
                       SIDNEY
             How? What could I say that would
             make a difference? I took away a
             year of your life - how do I
             apologize for that?
   
                       COTTON
             I wish it was just a year. I lost
             everything because of you. I have
             nothing now. Look at me, this is
             what I've become.
   
   A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Cotton, there isn't one day, one
             hour, one minute when I'm not
             reminded of what I've done. I have
             not had one second of reprieve and
             no therapy or religion or spiritual
             plane can ever erase what I feel in
             every vein of my being. And I wish
             I had in me what you need to hear
             but I don't think the words exist.
   
   More silence.
   
                       COTTON
             I just thought if I saw you face to
             face, maybe it would help.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Did it?
   
                       COTTON
             It helped me realize one thing.
   
                       SIDNEY
             What?
   
                       COTTON
             You're a self-obsessed little cunt
             like your mother.
   
   And with that, Cotton flips on a dime. His face turns
   evil. Sidney races by him as he throws out his arm,
   stopping her just as...
   
   
   THE TWO POLICE GUARDS
   
   Appear, grabbing him from behind. They throw him
   against the wall, retaining him. Randy appears at Sid's
   side.
   
                       RANDY
             You okay?
   
   Sid nods as she watches the officers arrest him. They
   do a body search, pulling from his coat a large
   revolver. Cotton just smiles.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - LATER
   
   Sid and Randy walk up the steps to the school library.
   The ever helping guards behind them.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I don't know. I don't think Cotton
             did it. It's too predictable.
   
                       RANDY
             If he's innocent he'll have an
             alibi.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I guess Gale's going to be pissed
             she missed her exclusive.
   
                       RANDY
             I'll relay it. You sure you don't
             wanna go home?
   
                       SIDNEY
             I have this button I press. See? It
             insulates me.
   
   She mimes an air lock valve.
   
                       RANDY
             I gotta coupla of those buttons
             myself.
   
   There's something sad about this exchange. These two
   people understand each other
   
                       SIDNEY
             Thanks for the movie, Randy.
   
                       RANDY
             Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just
             had that been there done that
             feeling.
   
   Sidney watches as Randy shoves off, disappearing across
   campus. Sid turns to find Derek leaning against a pole.
   
                       DEREK
             I had the four o'clock shift. You
             weren't there. You had us worried.
             Is everything okay?
   
                       SIDNEY
             No, it's not.
   
                       DEREK
             I don't really know what happened
             in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you
             don't trust me.
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's not you, Derek. I don't trust
             myself. I tend to make big
             selection errors when it comes to
             men.
   
                       DEREK
             Then I'll make this easy for you. I
             like you. I'm crazy about you, Sid.
             But I'm gonna stay away. Until you
             say otherwise.
   
   A long moment. He looks at her, hoping she'll say
   otherwise.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I'm sorry, Derek.
   
   Derek nods. So that's how it's going to be. He turns
   and wanders off, not looking back once.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. NEWSVAN - CAMPUS - LATER
   
   The newsvan is parked at a curb. It sits out of the way
   overlooking the student commons area. A grassy area
   where students sit and conjugate.
   
   Gale walks back and forth with the cellular attached to
   her ear. Dewey sits leans against the van, watching
   her. He still has a crush but hides it as best he can.
   
                       GALE
                   (on phone)
             The interview's not going to
             happen. 1 changed my mind. I've
             harassed the girl enough. It's in
             poor taste and a bad idea.
   
                       FROM THE PHONE
             Your entire career is in poor
             taste...
   
                       GALE
             Gotta go, call me when you have
             something nice to say.
   
   Gale hangs up, she looks to Dewey. Smiles.
   
                       DEWEY
             So what made you change your mind
             about Sidney?
   
                       GALE
             Mood swing. I'm manic depressive.
   
                       DEWEY
             You're a hard one to figure out.
   
                       GALE
             It's that complex yet shallow
             quality. It's deliberate.
   
                       DEWEY
             I think you're all an act.
   
                       GALE
             And deep down I'm a good person?
             Make no mistake, Dewey, I'm a shit.
   
                       DEWEY
             I know that.
   
                       GALE
             Yeah?
   
                       DEWEY
             I also know that you're an aging TV
             reporter slash writer who, despite
             huge tabloid success, has some self
             worth issues regarding your
             personal life which directly
             effects your professional life in a
             non-positive manner. A coupla
             failed relationships with - I'm
             guessing balding, older men - have
             turned you into this bitch with a
             cell phone. But I bet sometimes,
             late at night, when you're all
             alone a sadness seeps to the
             surface and in a moment of clarity
             you know that all you really want
             is to be touched and held and
             fondled.
   
   Gale stares at him, stunned. A moment as the tension
   swirls about them.
   
                       GALE
             And where did you gain all of your
             Gale Weather's insight?
   
   Dewey approaches her. Gale has never been more taken
   with him. They stand incredibly close.
   
                       DEWEY
             After my spinal cord was damaged I
             was laid up for over a year. A lot
             can happen when you're on your
             back.
   
   They're nearly touching now. Just then, Randy
   approaches.
   
                       RANDY
             What'd I miss?
   
   Gale backs away from Dewey, breathless. Her cellular
   phone RINGS. She eyes Dewey, then hands it to Randy.
   
                       GALE
             I'm not here.
   
   Randy takes the phone.
   
                       RANDY
             Hello?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Gale?
   
                       RANDY
             She's not here right now.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             But she's standing right next to
             you.
   
   Shit! Randy motions to Gale and Dewey. It's him. He
   points around campus, mouthing "He's watching." Gale
   grabs Dewey.
   
                       GALE
             C'mon.
                   (to Randy)
             Keep him talking.
   
   Gale and Dewey race off, across the grassy area where
   STUDENTS come and go.
   
   
   ON RANDY
   
   He holds the phone, scared, not knowing what to say?
   
                       RANDY
             So... what's your favorite scary
             movie? No response. Silence.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             They'll never find me.
   
   Randy eyes Dewey and Gale, they move through Students,
   searching.
   
                       RANDY
             What do you care? Let 'em have
             their fun. So, what's up?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             What's your favorite scary movie?
   
                       RANDY
             SHOWGIRLS. Absolutely frightening.
             What's yours? Wait, let me guess.
             THE HOUSE ON SORORITY ROW? FINAL
             EXAM. GRADUATION DAY? THE DORM THAT
             DRIPPED BLOOD? SPLATTER UNIVERSITY?
             Am I close?
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Closer than you think.
   
   
   ON DEWEY AND GALE
   
   They move through passing STUDENTS.
   
                       GALE
             He has to be nearby. He likes the
             game.
   
   Dewey is on the his walkie. "I need back-up." He has a
   hard time keeping up with Gale. He hobbles along.
   
   
   BACK ON RANDY
   
   He goes on a tirade pacing back and forth.
   
                       RANDY
             So what's your deal? Can we talk
             openly for a second? How does one
             become a serial killer? Huh? Are
             you psychopathic or merely
             psychotic? And what is the
             distinguishing feature'? Were you
             slapped around as a child? Is it
             hereditary? Did your Mom take test
             drugs? You know, have you tried
             getting laid? It's done wonders for
             my homicidal tendencies.
   
                       MAN'S VOICE
             Do you want to die?
   
                       RANDY
             Gee, let me think. "Do you want
             to... " Is that the best you can
             do? Some tired hand me down rehash?
             Hey, pal, no one's gonna write a
             book about you. No movie rights.
             Nothing. I've been through this
             before and much better I might add.
   
   
   ON GALE AND DEWEY
   
   Gale spots a YOUNG MAN, sitting with some other KIDS.
   He's talking on a cellular phone. She races to him and
   rips it from his hands. He leaps up ready to pounce on
   her.
   
   Dewey appears.
   
                       DEWEY
             It's okay. C'mon, Gale.
   
   
   BACK ON RANDY
   
   Randy won't let up. He continues dissing.
   
                       RANDY
             And if you're such a brilliant
             smart killer - why copycat? Why not
             be original? Where's the
             innovation? Let's pioneer some new
             ground. Make a statement. Go down
             in history. Now you'll always be
             the Woodsboro copycat killer.
             That's lame. It's like a bad
             sequel. And why Woodsboro? What
             about Manson, Bundy, Son of Sam?
             Why imitate two high school loser-
             ass dickheads - 1 knew the guys.
             Stu was a wussy ass wet rag and
             Billy - jesus - what a rat-looking
             homo-repressed, mama's boy.
   
   Suddenly the newsvan door RIPS OPEN, a GHOST MASKED
   FIGURE lunges out grabbing Randy by the neck. The move
   is quick and precise. A hard yank and Randy is wrenched
   back into the newsvan. The door SLAMS shut.
   
   
   ON DEWEY AND GALE
   
   As they run back to the newsvan. SIRENS are heard in
   the distant. Gale races up to find Randy nowhere.
   
                       GALE
             Randy? Randy? Where did he go?
   
   Dewey circles the van as Gale moves to the sliding side
   door. She tears it open as...
   
   RANDY'S BODY FALLS OUT. Blood everywhere. His throat
   slit.
   
   Gale's SCREAM is heard all over campus.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. CRIME SCENE - NEWSVAN - LATER
   
   Yellow tape has been placed around the newsvan. People
   have gathered as Randy's body is taken out on a
   stretcher.
   
   Captain Tyler and Sheriff Hartley share frustrated
   faces.
   
                       SHERIFF
             He's broken his pattern.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             They've broken their pattern.
   
                       SHERIFF
             You're sure about this two person
             thing?
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Broad daylight, a crowded movie
             theatre. This is too much fun for
             one person.
   
   Different UNIFORMS whirl by.
   
                       SHERIFF
             I would say we are now officially
             baffled.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             On national television.
   
   Sheriff Hartley looks up as REPORTERS flock them,
   surrounding them in questions.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   INT. LIBRARY - RESEARCH COMPUTER ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
   
   A room of the library sectioned off exclusively for
   computer use. It consists of thirty to forty cubicles
   that house computer terminals. Every cubicle is full.
   The place is packed.
   
   Sid sits at a terminal busy at work. Her two police
   guards wander up and down the cubicles keeping an eye
   out.
   
   
   CLOSE ON SIDNEY
   
   Her face appears concentrated, focused. She scans the
   computer screen in front of her.
   
   
   ON THE MONITOR
   
   Sid is typing feverishly. Suddenly, her screen starts
   flashing and BEEPING, freezing her words.
   
   
   ON SIDNEY
   
   Confused, she tries to make it stop but it won't. She
   leans back, turning to the GUY next to her. A handsome
   young man.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Excuse me? Did your computer just
             freeze?
   
   The guy leans over and takes a look at Sid's monitor.
   
                       GUY (CONT'D)
             You have an instant message, that's
             all. Just hit ALT M.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I'm not signed on.
   
                       GUY
             Someone here in the room. All the
             terminals are connected.
   
   The guy returns to his own computer. Sidney eyes the
   screen suspiciously. She hits ALT + M. A message pops
   up on the screen.
   
   "YOU'RE GOING TO DIE TONIGHT."
   
   Sidney freaks. A muffled CRY. She shoots up, looking
   about the crowded room. He could be anywhere. The two
   guards take notice, rushing over to her.
   
                       SIDNEY
             He's here. He's in the room right
             now.
   
   She points to the screen. The men instantly break up
   and cover the room. They start pulling people from
   their terminals to check their screens.
   
   Sidney backs away from her screen, her terror growing.
   
   Suddenly, it starts flashing and BEEPING again. She
   looks around. She slowly moves toward it, drawn
   uncontrollably. She hits ALT + M. Another message pops
   up:
   
   "THE POLICE CAN'T SAVE YOU."
   
   
   CLOSE ON SIDNEY'S FACE
   
   It's stone pale. She takes a deep breath and begins to
   type.
   
   
   ON THE MONITOR
   
   The words "FUCK YOU" appear. Sid hits "SEND".
   
   
   INT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - PRIVATE OFFICE - LITTLE
   LATER
   
   Captain Tyler and Sheriff Hartley are drilling a very
   subdued and cool Cotton.
   
                       COTTON
             What better alibi could I have? I
             was here in custody.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Maybe you don't work alone.
   
                       COTTON
             Yeah, that's it.
   
                       SHERIFF
             Why did you attack Sidney Prescott?
   
                       COTTON
             There was no attack, we were
             talking. Very heatedly. Miss
             Prescott and I have a very
             complicated past. That's no crime.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             And the gun?
   
                       COTTON
             I have a permit. It's registered. I
             have a legal right to carry it.
   
                       SHERIFF
             Why do you need a gun?
   
                       COTTON
             Gentlemen, your growing hysteria is
             not reason enough to hold me here.
             I've been down this road before.
             And unless you're going to charge
             me with a crime I'd like to walk
             outta here. I have an interview at
             6:00.

   INT. CAMPUS SECURITY STATION - OUTER OFFICE
   
   Gale sits at a table. Dewey approaches. He places a
   hand on her shoulder. They're both at a loss.
   
                       GALE
             Where's Sidney'?
   
                       DEWEY
             She's safe.
   
   Silence.
   
                       DEWEY (CONT'D)
             How you doin?
   
                       GALE
             Not good. How you doin?
   
                       DEWEY
             Not good.
   
   Just then, the Sheriff and Captain emerge from their
   office. Cotton is escorted out behind them. Gale moves
   to him.
   
                       DEWEY
             Can't we hold him?
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             No, we got pressure from California
             State. The man practically has
             clemency. We can't run the risk of
             falsely accusing him. He has to be
             standing over the victim with knife
             in hand before we make a move.
   
                       DEWEY
             What now?
   
   
   ON COTTON
   
   He stands at a counter, signing forms. Gale approaches.
   
                       GALE
             What's going on, Cotton?
   
                       COTTON
             You know the story, Gale. Man
             falsely accused, sent to prison,
             proved innocent, released back into
             the real world and never trusted
             again. Want the exclusive?
   
                       GALE
             Did you do it?
   
   She looks him dead in the eyes.
   
                       COTTON
             Now, Gale, you were so instrumental
             in my freedom. You're not having
             character doubts now, are you?
   
                       GALE
             You have a right to be angry.
   
                       COTTON
             No, Gale, I don't have any rights.
             You made sure of that.
   
                       GALE
             Cotton, I've done nothing but help
             you.
   
                       COTTON
             You've done nothing but get rich
             off of me. How many books have you
             sold, Gale? You think I don't
             understand points and royalties and
             ancilliary rights?
   
   Just then, the OFFICER behind the counter brings him
   his gun in a plastic bag. Cotton takes it out and
   checks it over. Gale is surprised to see the gun.
   
                       GALE
             Don't do anything stupid, Cotton.
             You've come to far.
   
                       COTTON
             Gale, I don't know what I'm doing
             from one moment to the next. I'm
             just taking it as it comes.
   
   Cotton pockets the gun and heads out. Gale rejoins
   Dewey and the others.
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             Night's coming. I think its time to
             beef up security on the Prescott
             girl.
   
                       GALE
             Where is she?
   
                       SHERIFF
             She was just escorted to her dorm
             room.
   
                       DEWEY
             Is she safe there?
   
                       CAPTAIN TYLER
             We're going to bring her in. Hide
             her out for a coupla days. And
             we're issuing a campus lock-in this
             evening. No one is allowed out
             after dark.
   
                       DEWEY
             That doesn't work, sir.
   
                       GALE
             You're just isolating people.
             You're giving the killer a blank
             canvas.

   Day turns to night and college life comes to a deadly
   stand still as everyone observes the imposed campus
   restrictions.
   
   
   EXT. SIGMA PHI EPISILON - NIGHT
   
   The fraternity house sits dark and quiet. A YOUNG MAN
   walks up the walk to the front door. He TAPS on it
   three times and it quietly opens as he's ushered in.
   
   
   INT SIGMA PHI HOUSE - NIGHT - SAME
   
   The young man makes his way down a long hallway, down a
   spiral staircase, through a thick basement door and
   into...
   
   
   A RAGING PARTY
   
   Music peels paint as YOUNG COLLEGE STUDENTS rock to
   deafening tunes. A row of kegs line one wall as a the
   party gears up for a drunken night ahead.
   
   Derek is seen with his video camera. He's filming Lois
   and Murphy. They talk into the camera. Both tipsy
   chatty.
   
                       LOIS
             It's all about sisterhood.
             Everybody thinks its about partying
             and blowjobs but...
   
                       MURPHY
             ... we only promote safe rubbered
             sex.
   
                       LOIS
             ... it's really about family and

             ... harmonica style is okay.
   
                       LOIS
             I just love being a sister.
   
   Mickey approaches as Derek finishes up.
   
                       DEREK
             Thanks, ladies.
   
   They take off to the kegs.
   
                       MICKEY
             Are they aware of your not so
             positive portrayal of Greek life?
   
                       DEREK
             Not one bit.

             Where's Sid?
   
                       DEREK
             She dumped me.
   
                       MICKEY
             No way.
   
                       DEREK
             Yeah.
   
                       MICKEY
             You freakin?
   
   Derek shrugs. He's clearly upset by it when from out of
   nowhere, SEVERAL FRAT BOYS appear, picking Mickey up,
   lifting him over their heads. Everyone starts CHEERING
   and CLAPPING.
   
                       FRATERNITY JOCK
             He lavaliered. He's dead.
   
   They carry him around the room, CHANTING. The frat boys
   abduct Mickey, taking him up the stairs and out sight.
   Others lookie loo's follow. Derek grabs his camera and
   bolts.

             I enjoyed its clever execution...

             We're missing the Sig Ep party.
   
                       SIDNEY
             No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties
             and mass murderers don't go
             together. Trust me.
   
                       HALLIE
             No, no, I hadn't planned on going,
             it's just Mickey will be pissed.
   
   Hallie clearly wishes she were there.
   
                       SISKEL
                   (from TV)
             It was just an excuse to kill
             young, big breasted girls. I didn't
             like it.
   
   They're reviewing STAB. Hallie switches channels.
   There's a KNOCK on the door. Sid answers - it's Dewey
   and Gale. From the look on their faces...
   
                       SIDNEY
             Someone else has been killed.

   MICKEY
   
   Who stands buck naked, tied... chained to a tree in the
   back yard. The yard is crowded with FRAT BOYS and
   SORORITY GIRLS who delight in torching him. Mounds of
   syrup, eggs, and other wet and slimy food is plunged
   upon him.
   
                       FRATERNITY JOCK
             Who do you love?

             No, I said Hallie.
   
   More food and slime come barreling at him. A drunk Lois
   and Murphy pull the police tape down from the previous
   night's crime scene and begin to Mayflower him. The
   crowd goes crazy.
   
   
   INT. SIDNEY'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT
   
   Hallie consoles Sidney. Dewey and Gale nearby. Sidney
   is a stone rock. It's frightening to watch her hold it
   together.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I'm fine. I wish people would stop
             treating me like glass. I'm not
             gonna break.
   
                       HALLIE
             It's okay to break, girl. You
             shatter if you have to.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I'd really just like to be alone.
   
                       DEWEY
             The police are waiting outside.
             They're going to take you somewhere
             safe.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Dewey, there's no such place.
   
                       DEWEY
             Humor me, Sid.
   
   Sidney starts packing an overnight bag.
   
                       HALLIE
             Can I come with her?
   
                       SIDNEY
             No, Hallie, I'm not gonna take you
             down too. I'll be alright.
   
                       GALE
             Sid, I'll come with you.
   
                       SIDNEY
             But who would operate your camera?
   
   A burn. It comes out of nowhere. Gale goes silent. A
   KNOCK at the door. Dewey opens to find a Police guard
   standing with Joel.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             He's cool, Remy.
   
   Joel is ushered in. He says his hello's, moving to
   Hallie. Gale and Dewey move out into the hall with the
   guards. Sid continues to pack. Her face rigid.
   
                       JOEL
             They got Mickey. He's being toasted
             at the Deltas.
   
                       HALLIE
             I knew it. Shit! I gotta get over
             there.
   
                       JOEL
             We're under quarantine.
   
   He points to Dewey who talks to Gale in the hallway.
   
                       HALLIE
             I'm the only one who can cut him
             down.
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's not a good idea, Hallie.
   
                       JOEL
             I'll go with her.
   
                       HALLIE
             Be safe, girl.
   
   She gives Sidney a hug before she can object, then she
   and Joel race out into the hallway as Dewey sticks his
   head in.
   
                       DEWEY
             Sid, you should get going.
   
   He looks at Joel and Hallie.
   
                       DEWEY (CONT'D)
             Where are you two headed?

                   (instant cover)
             Hallie forgot her footage at the
             film dept. I'm gonna walk her over
             before it's gets too late

             I gotta have it, Dewey.
   
   Gale steps in.

             Hey, Dewey?
   
                       HALLIE
             Seeya, Dewey.
   
   Hallie and Joel race outta there before any more
   objections. Dewey turns to Gale.
   
                       GALE
             If you were truly a copycat,
             wouldn't you want to emulate

             you could?
   
                       DEWEY
             Meaning?
   
                       GALE
             He's already gotta be a part of
             Sid's life. What do you know about
             this Derek?
   
                       DEWEY
             Solid alibis. He was with Sidney
             when she was attacked.
   
                       GALE
             Billy had alibis too.
   
   Dewey turns to Sid who now stands ready in the doorway.
   
                       DEWEY
             Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll
             find you later, okay.

             Whatever.

   Mickey is still tied to the tree. He's so completely
   covered in hardened gook it looks like he's wearing
   clothes. The last of the crowd has left. They've gone
   back to the party. He stands shivering in the cold.
   
   He checks the chain that holds him secure. It's
   composed of several bike locks and steel twine. He's
   not going anywhere.
   
   BUMP! He hears a noise. He looks to the nearby shrubs
   and beyond. Nothing. Just a noise of the night.

   A dark room. A slight disturbance at the door and it
   comes popping open. Light from the hall floods the room
   as Dewey and Gale slip in and close the door behind
   them.
   
                       GALE
                   (checking door)
             You broke the lock.
   
                       DEWEY
             You broke my heart.

             What are we looking for?
   
                       DEWEY
             A bloody knife. A ghost mask.
             Something like that?
   
                       GALE
             Can we turn the light on?
   
                       DEWEY
             That's not the way it's done.
   
   Dewey pulls out his flashlight and begins to search the
   room. He sifts through drawers and a closet.
   
                       DEWEY
             And it's sexier in the dark.
   
                       GALE
             Dewey, you and I would never make
             it.
   
                       DEWEY
             Maybe not. But think about the sex.
             As frustrated as I am...
   
                       GALE
             ... and as lonely as I am...
   
                       DEWEY
             We'd break some furniture.
   
   Gale LAUGHS at this. She reaches over and pats his
   buttock.
   
                       GALE
             Tell you what. We get through this
             one. And we'll take out a hotel
             room. Over here with the light.
   
   Dewey points the light to a framed picture. It's of
   Joel and Derek - a buddy pose. She sifts through some
   text books on the desk.
   
                       DEWEY
             They're roomates.
   
                       GALE
             And Joel's pre-med.
   
                       DEWEY
             The sorority girl was gutted with
             autopsy precision.
   
                       GALE
             Shit! It's both of them. The first
             murders were to throw us - using
             the same names as Woodsboro. But
             they've moved on - they're getting
             closer to Sidney. They're not
             looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to
             kill. They're looking for the new
             Tatum.
   
                       DEWEY
             Hallie?
   
   A moment. Then in a splash, they're outta there.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - MINUTES LATER
   
   A squad car makes it's way down the quiet campus
   street.
   
   
   INT. SQUAD CAR - SAME
   
   Sidney sits in the backseat. The two police officers
   ride in front.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Where are you taking me?
   
                       POLICE GUARD #1
             Actually, I don't know.
   
                       POLICE GUARD #2
             We're meeting another car that will
             transport you the rest of the way.
   
                       POLICE GUARD #1
             Safety precautions.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I feel like Eddie Murphy.
   
   The car comes to a halt in front of a stop light.
   
                       POLICE GUARD #1
             We feel like Kevin Costner.
   
   Sidney smiles at this just as the car door rips open on
   the passenger's side. Two hands reach in and yank
   Police Guard #2 from the car. He starts to CRY OUT but
   it's cut short.
   
   Sid SCREAMS as the Police Guard behind the wheel
   struggles with his seat belt. He looks up to see a
   Ghost Masked Figure move around the side of the car
   towards his door. He reaches for his gun but it's too
   late. The Ghost has the door open.
   
   A flash of silver and the Police Guard's throat is
   slit.
   
   
   IN THE BACK SEAT
   
   Sidney SCREAMS and SCREAMS, BEATING on the door of the
   car. It won't open. She's trapped like a caged animal.
   
   
   IN THE FRONT SEAT
   
   The Ghost pulls the Police Guard from the car, then
   gets in, behind the driver's seat. The Ghost puts the
   car in drive and takes off down the road.
   
   Sidney looks behind her as the guard's dead bodies lay
   sprawled in the middle of the road. She turns to the
   door, BEATING and CLAWING at it. She leans back, manic,
   and KICKS at the window with her feet. No use.
   
   
   EXT. CAMPUS DRIVE - SAME
   
   The car makes its way down the deserted street
   
   
   IN THE BACKSEAT
   
   Sidney is beyond frantic. She eyes the Ghost through
   the gate. She turns and twists looking for an escape.
   Through the window, she sees approaching headlights.
   She SCREAMS through the closed window as a car passes
   by.
   
   Sidney takes notice as the car turns onto another
   campus street. Big, stone school buildings line each
   side of a thin, road.
   
   She eyes the Ghost through the rearview window. The
   white masks turns as hidden eyes bore through her. The
   Ghost hits the gas, picking up speed.
   
   Sidney looks to the book bag on the seat beside her.
   She rips it open, rustling through it frantically. She
   pulls books, pencils, paper... Sid grabs a long, yellow
   No.2 pencil. She grips it hard, looking to the metal
   grate just behind the driver's seat. The Ghost's neck
   is right up against it.
   
   Sid takes the pencil and positions it right behind the
   Ghost's head, ready to attack.
   
   Without pause, Sid RAMS the pencil through the grate,
   into the Ghost's neck. It lodges there as the Ghost
   falls forward in pain, losing control of the wheel for
   a moment.
   
   The car jumps the curb and SLAMS against a building.
   The Ghost yanks the wheel, over correcting. He tries to
   bring it back to the road but doesn't see the lamp post
   that stands directly in the car's path.
   
   The Squad car makes direct contact with the lamp post,
   SLAMMING into it, bringing the car to a CRASHING HALT,
   lodging it agaisnt the building's stone exterior.
   
   Smoke rises from a bashed engine as it emits a fatal
   rumbling.
   
   
   INSIDE THE CAR
   
   All is still. In the backseat, Sidney rises from the
   floorboards. She looks up to see the Ghost Masked
   figure slumped over the steering wheel. Out.
   
   Sid quickly pulls herself together, looking about,
   sizing up her options. She tugs on the door handle. It
   won't budge. She looks to the passenger's side of the
   car. It's flush against the building.
   
   Then she notices the metal grate. The edge has been
   pried apart in the crash. Sidney reaches for it,
   pulling on it, bending it backwards...
   
   CREAK!
   
   Sid tries to stifle the noise it makes, all the while
   eyeing the Ghost who remains unconscious. She creates
   an opening large enough for her to crawl through. She
   lifts herself up and pulls herself through to the...
   
   
   FRONT SEAT
   
   Sid falls down into the seat, her eyes never leaving
   the Ghost. She lay crumpled up against the smashed
   passenger's door, the only sound is her own TERRIFIED
   BREATHING. She watches the Ghost Masked Figure. His
   body doesn't move. She contemplates her next move.
   
   The only way out is through the driver's door.
   
   After what seems an eternity, she slowly reaches over
   with her foot and nudges the Ghost. No movement.
   Nothing.
   
   She slides across the seat towards the Ghost, moving to
   his side. She reaches with her hand and pushes on the
   Ghost's shoulder. His body moves, slumping back against
   the back of the seat. It clears space for her to pass
   through.
   
   She sits up on her feet, facing the Ghost. With her
   leg, she reaches over him, straddling him. She leans
   against the steering wheel, her arm quickly reaching
   for the door knob.
   
   HONK!
   
   Her back brushes against the horn. Sid TENSES, her face
   a little more than a foot from the Ghost Mask. He
   doesn't move. He's completely out cold. Sid pushes the
   car door open and starts to slide completely over the
   Ghost when she stops.
   
   She looks to the Ghost.
   
   
   CLOSE ON HER FACE
   
   As she fights with a decision. Then, with a fierce
   determination, Sid reaches for the Ghost Mask. She
   finds the edge and begins to peels the Mask away
   when...
   
   
   THE GHOST COMES TO LIFE
   
   Lunging forward. Sidney SCREAMS, leaping, falling out
   the car door.
   
   
   OUTSIDE THE CAR
   
   BAM!
   
   Sid hits the pavement hard. She lifts herself up when
   her entire body is YANKED VIOLENTLY BACKWARDS.
   
   The Ghost has hold of her foot, pulling her back into
   the car. Sidney KICKS and WRITHES breaking free. She
   hops to her feet as the Ghost emerges from the car.
   Sidney SLAMS the car door shut. It catches the Ghost,
   knocking him backwards.
   
   Sid tears off, down the street, running, burning up the
   pavement.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. FILM SCHOOL - MINUTES LATER
   
   The film school sits in the still darkness.
   
   
   INT. HALLWAY - SAME
   
   Dewey and Gale move down a dark and shadowed hallway.
   THUMP! They stop cold.
   
                       GALE
             Ssshh! What was that?
   
                       DEWEY
             Let's find out.
   
   Dewey keeps moving.
   
                       GALE
             This is all too familiar.
   
                       DEWEY
             Over here.
   
   Dewey has lead her to a door marked "LECTURE HALL".
   
   
   INT. LECTURE HALL - SAME
   
   The same room seen earlier. A large, rounded room with
   three levels of seats that shoot straight up to the
   ceiling. A podium stands center. Video monitors hang
   from the ceiling in different places around the room.
   
   Dewey and Gale enter. If not for the red EXIT SIGNS
   that hang over the exit doors, the room would be
   completely dark.
   
   They move down the first level of chairs to the
   lecturn.
   
                       GALE
             Maybe they never got here. He could
             have taken her anywhere.
   
                       DEWEY
             C'mon. Let's go.
   
   CLICK! STATIC! A noise from above takes their
   attention. They looks up as a video monitor comes to
   life. Images appear.
   
   
   CLOSE ON MONITOR
   
   Home-made video footage fills the screen. A movie
   theatre, people standing in line. The home camera ZOOMS
   in to a YOUNG COUPLE. Maureen and Phil come into view.
   
   
   ON DEWEY AND GALE
   
   Gale watches the screen as Dewey looks around the room,
   searching for it's source.
   
   CLICK! Another monitor comes to life. More home shot
   video footage. This time of a big house. A closer look
   reveals it to be the Chi Omega Sorority House. A young
   girl stands on the front porch talking on a portable
   phone. It's Cici.
   
   
   ON GALE AND DEWEY
   
                       GALE
             Jesus Christ!
   
                       DEWEY
             He filmed his victims.
   
   CLICK! ANOTHER MONITOR TURNS ON.
   
   It's Randy standing outside the newsvan with the
   cellular phone to his ear.
   
   CLICK! Another monitor turns on. It's of a man and
   woman back to the camera. The couple move in frame. It
   becomes apparent quick. It's Gale and Dewey. As they
   stand in the room - live. They're being taped.
   
   
   CLOSE ON DEWEY AND GALE
   
                       GALE
             Shit!
   
   Dewey spins around. He reaches for the gun he no longer
   carries.
   
                       DEWEY
             Dammit!
   
   He looks around the room, up to the two levels above
   them. He spots a small light on the second level. He
   squints his eyes and sees a FIGURE standing behind it.
   
                       GALE
             Let's go.
   
                       DEWEY
             No, wait here.
   
   Dewey hands her his flashlight and takes off for the
   stair rise that leads to the upper level.
   
                       GALE
             No, Dewey, let's call for backup.
   
   But Dewey is gone, leaving Gale alone. She turns to the
   monitor to see her face in fear-stricken CLOSEUP.
   
   
   ON THE UPPER LEVEL
   
   Dewey moves fast, limping his way to the level's edge.
   He approaches the railing and makes his way around to
   the shining light.
   
   He reaches it, finding nothing but a camera and tripod.
   It sits alone against the railing. Dewey surveys the
   second level. Empty seats everywhere. Completely bare.
   
   Dewey looks down to the main floor... to Gale who looks
   up to him.
   
                       GALE
             Dewey?
   
                       DEWEY
             There's nothing. I'm coming down.
   
   Dewey turns to leave, his eye catching a monitor that
   hangs level with the railing. On the monitor, Gale is
   in frame, looking up at Dewey, her face fear stained.
   She takes a step forward, moving out of frame,
   revealing
   
   
   THE GHOST
   
   Who stands right behind her. Dewey looks down to see
   the Ghost standing directly behind Gale.
   
                       DEWEY (CONT'D)
             Watch out!
   
   
   DOWN BELOW
   
   Gale turns just in time to see the gleam of a killer's
   knife as it darts out of the darkness. Gale catapults,
   just dodging it. She moves like lightning up the aisle
   of seats.
   
   
   UP ABOVE
   
   Dewey races for the stairs, going as fast as his
   handicapped leg will allow.
   
   
   DOWN BELOW
   
   Gale tears out the exit door, the Killer right behind
   her.
   
   
   AT THE LECTURN
   
   Dewey arrives, searching, looking for Gale.
   
                       DEWEY (CONT'D)
             Gale!
   
   He eyes the exit door as it slowly closes. He moves for
   it.
   
   
   INT. CORRIDOR - SAME
   
   Gale races down the hallway, eyeing the nearest door.
   She tears it open, disappearing into...
   
   
   INT. SOUND STAGE - SAME
   
   Gale finds herself in the student studios. She stands
   in a huge control booth that overlooks a dubbing stage.
   Lots of glass walls and doors. It has a maze quality.
   
   Gale moves out a side door and into a dubbing room.
   Darkness everywhere Gale stops for a second, listening
   as she main door CREAKS open. And then FOOTSTEPS are
   heard, making their way towards her.
   
   Gale proceeds deeper into the studio. She moves into a
   sound proof room and closes the door. Not seeing the...
   
   
   GHOST FIGURE
   
   That stands behind her. She turns around and SCREAMS.
   She starts out, but then realizes he's standing in the
   control booth. She's protected by a clear, large,
   plexiglass window that wraps around the room. The ghost
   moves out the side door, heading her way. He disappears
   out of view. Gale freaks. She races to the door, trying
   to secure it. There's no lock.
   
   
   AT THE MAIN DOOR
   
   Dewey slips through quietly, trying his best to be
   quick on his toes. Through the control booth window, he
   immediately spots Gale.
   
   
   INSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM
   
   Gale looks for objects to block the door with. She
   drags a shelf of sound equipment towards the door.
   
   
   OUTSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM
   
   Dewey moves to the window.
   
                       DEWEY
             Gale! Gale!
   
   She doesn't hear him. The room is sound proof. He BEATS
   against the glass. Still, she doesn't turn to him.
   
   
   INSIDE THE DUBBING ROOM
   
   Gale shoves everything she can find against the door,
   not seeing or hearing Dewey as he POUNDS against the
   sound proof barrier behind her.
   
   She also doesn't see the Killer that appears behind
   Dewey. He moves on him swift and focused.
   
   
   INSIDE THE DUBBING STAGE
   
   Gale can't take her eyes off the door. Her face is
   terrified. If she'd only turn around, she would see
   Dewey - his face terror stricken as a knife is hurled
   into him repeatedely. With each thrust, blood is
   splattered against the glass.
   
   
   IN THE CONTROL BOOTH
   
   Dewey SCREAMS for his life, caught completely off
   guard. He falls forward onto the control panels.
   Suddenly, microphone feedback tears through the studios
   as Dewey's CRIES are heard throughout the stage.
   
   
   IN THE DUBBING STAGE
   
   Dewey's DEATH SCREAM rips through the room.
   
   Gale turns to the window to see Dewey, his face smashed
   against it, blood smeared across the glass. She moves
   to the window, her face only inches from his. A moment
   as their eyes meet. Dewey's life is near gone. His eyes
   reveal it.
   
   Gale BEATS against the glass window.
   
                       GALE
                   (through tears)
             NOOOOOOO!
   
   Dewey's body slides down, out of view. Gale is
   mortified. She looks to the Killer who has already made
   his way through the control booth. He's coming for her.
   She races to the door, throws the things away.
   
   She manages to pull the door open just enough to slide
   through. And she's off and running.
   
   Gale finds a door and plows through it, stopping only
   long enough to lock it.
   
   BAM! The Ghost RAMS it from the other side but it
   holds. Gale surveys her surroundings. She's in a
   storage room. She eyes another door. She moves through
   it and out into...
   
   
   THE HALLWAY
   
   Gale shoots down it.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. CAMPUS STREET - SECONDS LATER
   
   Sidney races down the deserted street. Not a soul in
   sight. She reaches a corner, moves off the road and
   passes through a series of trees and shrubs, coming out
   onto...
   
   
   EXT. SORORITY ROW - SAME
   
   The houses have long since gone to sleep. The Delta
   Zeta House stares at Sidney. Lights burn from within.
   Sid goes for it.
   
   
   EXT. DELTA ZETA FRONT PORCH - SAME
   
   Sid makes her way up the front porch. She POUNDS on the
   front door, SCREAMING her lungs out.
   
                       SIDNEY
             SOMEBODYPLEASEOPENUPSOMEBODY!
   
   Sid wastes no time, she moves along the wraparound
   porch, beating at the windows. But nothing. Everybody
   is off partying. Suddenly, Sid hears something. A
   WHIMPERING. She turns to find Murphy and Lois, laying,
   strewn across the end of the porch. Passed out.
   
   Sid runs to them.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Oh God, help me. We have to call
             the police.
   
   Sid kneels over Murphy, shaking her. Murphy's eyes open
   and she GIGGLES. The girl is completely wasted. She has
   no comprehension skills at all.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Do you have keys? I need to get
             inside.
   
   Sid looks to Lois. She's in worse shape.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Shit!
   
   Sid contemplates, not knowing what to do. She leaves
   them, moving down off the porch and around to the back
   of the house. She gets to the back door, tries it. It's
   locked too.
   
   Sidney checks out the yard. Off to the side, she spots
   a big tree with a...
   
   BODY, lying next to it in a heap on the ground She
   moves toward it.
   
   As Sid approaches she sees clearly that it's Mickey. He
   lay on his side, curled, knees to chest, his arm still
   chained to the tree.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Mickey? Mickey?
   
   A look of dread creeps across her face. He lay there
   very much dead.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Oh God, no, Mickey...
   
   She kneels over his body just as it stirs, lifting up,
   rising. Mickey's face comes into view, coated in dried
   funk, his eyes wide.
   
                       MICKEY
             Sid? Jesus, where's Hallie? I've
             been here all night.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Listen to me. We've got to get
             help. The Killer's here.
   
                       MICKEY
             What are you talking about?
   
                       SIDNEY
             He's after me.
   
   Mickey pulls on his chained arm.
   
                       MICKEY
             Shit! You've got to cut me down,
             Sid.
   
   Sid inspects the chain. It's meant to hold.
   
                       SIDNEY
             I'll be right back.
   
                       MICKEY
             Where you going?
   
   Sidney moves to the shed that's attached to the garage.
   Leaning against the side are a row of garden tools. Sid
   settles on a shovel.
   
   Sid returns to Mickey who has risen to his feet. He's
   pulling and twisting the bike chain that binds him.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Watch out.
   
   Sid lifts the shovel up and brings it down directly on
   the lock. It bends somewhat but stays in tact.
   
                       MICKEY
             Do it again.
   
   CLANK! A noise behind them. They both spin around
   peering into the night.
   
                       MICKEY (CONT'D)
             What was that?
   
                       SIDNEY
             Don't panic.
   
   Sidney, determined, raises the shovel high and brings
   it down with great force. It CRACKS the lock, loosening
   it.
   
   Mickey pulls on it. It won't quite give.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Watch out.
   
   Sid raises the shovel again, unfaltering. She doesn't
   see the Ghost Masked Figure that slides down from the
   tree branch behind her. The Figure moves quickly and
   gracefully, coming to a stance directly behind Sid.
   
   Mickey looks up, just in time.
   
                       MICKEY
             SIDNEYWATCHOUT!
   
   Sid turns just as the Killer strikes. But Sid is ready.
   Without thought, she swings the shovel at the Ghost,
   catching his mid-section, sending him flying.
   
   Mickey goes ballistic chained to the tree. He pulls,
   twists, squirms... anything to free himself.
   
   The Ghost rises, moving on Mickey. Sidney sees this.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Hey.
   
   Sidney distracts the Ghost. She takes off, the Ghost
   following her. She moves around the tree, sprinting
   across the yard, running smack into...
   
   
   THE GHOST MASKED KILLER
   
   But Sidney spins around as two Ghosts appear on each
   side of her. She stands THUNDERSTRUCK as the two
   Killers descend on her. She dives between the two but
   they counter, keeping her surrounded.
   
   Sid watches as one of the Ghosts withdraws his knife.
   She turns to the other. His knife is already poised.
   They close in on her, ready to strike.
   
   She looks for an escape. There's not one. BAM!
   
   Suddenly, Mickey appears, barreling into one of the
   Ghosts. They go sprawling across the grass.
   
                       MICKEY
             Run, Sid...
   
   Sidney makes her break, she runs passed them, towards
   the front of the yard.
   
   Mickey leaps to his feat. The Killer right behind him.
   He now finds himself in Sid's predicament. He doesn't
   know where to run. The two Killer's close in on him.
   
   Sidney gets to the corner of the house. She stops...
   she doesn't want to leave Mickey. She turns back around
   just in time to see...
   
   Mickey sandwiched in between the two Ghosts. They're
   knives strike at the same time. One through the
   stomach, the other through the back. They withdraw
   their knives. Mickey's body suspends, momentarily
   hanging in the air. Then collapses to a heap on the
   ground.
   
   Both Ghosts turn to Sid at the same time. She takes off
   running, along the side of the house, through a row of
   shrub that take her to...
   
   
   EXT. STREET - SAME
   
   Sid is back on the campus street, running down the
   middle of it.
   
   She spots a car stopped at a red light half a block up.
   KIDS are inside, rock music BLARES. Sid SCREAMS and
   SCREAMS but they don't hear her. She runs, feet
   pounding, toward them but the light turns green and the
   car takes off. It's taillights fading in the night.
   
   She turns finding herself alone in a parking lot. The
   theatre sits in the distance. She spots someone
   entering the theatre. It looks like Hallie.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Hallie?
   
   But Hallie doesn't hear her. Sid races forward.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. CAMPUS MINUTES LATER
   
   Gale races down the empty campus street. She eyes an
   emergency phone that's attached to a street lamp. She
   goes for it.
   
   Gale rips the phone from its cradle, presses the CALL
   button.
   
                       VOICE
                   (from phone)
             What is your emergency please?
   
                       GALE
             Someone's trying to kill me. I need
             the police.
   
                       VOICE
             Are you in danger now?
   
                       GALE
             Yes, goddammit!
   
                       VOICE
             Where is your attacker?
   
                       GALE
             I don't know.
   
                       VOICE
             Stay under the safety light. Help
             is on its way.
   
                       GALE
             The safety what? Fuck that!
   
   Just then, Gale hears a NOISE. A door opening. She
   looks up to see Sidney disappear through the side
   theatre door.
   
                       GALE
             SIDNEY!
   
   But Sidney has already disappeared inside. Gale yells
   into the phone.
   
                       GALE (CONT'D)
             Fuckin' hurry.
   
   Gale throws the phone down and tears off for Sidney.
   
   
   INT. THEATRE SAME
   
   The theatre is big and old. Plush chairs, balcony, huge
   proscenium stage.
   
   Sidney enters through a side house door. She pulls on
   it, releasing the emeregency lock. She makes her way
   down the aisle toward the orchestra section.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Hello?
   
   The stage is dark and bare with the exceptions of the
   furniture from the DEATHTRAP set. BUMP! A noise from
   the stage wings.
   
                       SIDNEY (CONT'D)
             Hallie?
   
   Sidney moves down front to the little bridge that
   extends out over the orchestra pit. She crosses it and
   moves to stage center, peering into the wings on either
   side of her.
   
   Complete darkness.
   
   DRIP! DRIP!
   
   Something drips down from above and onto Sidney. She
   wipes it from her face when...
   
   CLICK! A spot light turns on from the back of the
   house, illuminating Sid center stage. She jumps at
   this, unnerved. She looks to her hand, covered in
   crimson. Then out to the house... the light is
   blinding.
   
   CLANK! A NOISE from above..ropes, pulleys moving. Sid
   looks up as a set wall comes PLOWING down at her. She
   leaps out of the way, falling to the floor.
   
   The wall falls into place on the stage. It is the back
   wall of the set that's dressed with framed pictures and
   antique weapons and...
   
   
   DEWEY
   
   Who hangs from it, pinned up against the wall, very
   much deadk, arms outstretched, crucified. His body a
   bloody mess. Sidney stops, stunned. She stands frozen
   in unspeakable horror. Her entire being ripped apart.
   She breaks into tears. And then...
   
   Sid backs up, moving, racing toward the wings when
   another wall flies in, sealing the backstage area off,
   trapping her. She looks in shock at...
   
   
   HALLIE
   
   Strung up, her body hanging lifeless. Sid SCREAMS,
   turning, running to the other side of the stage when a
   third wall comes flying in, creating the three walled
   set of DEATHTRAP.
   
   Attached to it, is the body of Joel. Dead. Blood
   everywhere. And then, Sid hears...
   
   CLAPPING!
   
   A single pair of hands from somewhere in the house...
   applauding. She turns around and spots a FIGURE moving
   down the aisle. She can't make out who it is.
   
   Sid bolts. She spots the set door up center, near
   Dewey's body. She goes for it, ripping it open to
   find...
   
   
   COTTON WEARY STANDING IN THE DOORFRAME
   
   Sid SCREAMS. But then sees his face, he looks scared.
   And then, Cotton's body falls forward to the floor, his
   arms and legs bound by electric tape.
   
   Sid turns back to the front of the stage. The Figure is
   now walking across the bridge, holding something... a
   light attached to a video camera. She's being filmed.
   Sid looks back to Cotton who looks up to her with
   pleading eyes.
   
                       COTTON
             Quick, untie me.
   
   Sid is paniced. She doesn't know what to do. She leans
   down to untie him but stops.
   
                       VOICE
                   (from behind video
                   camera)
             You've seen this movie before,
             haven't you?
   
   Sidney looks to the voice. The camera is pulled away to
   reveal...
   
   
   DEREK
   
   He smiles at her.
   
                       DEREK
             Smile for the camera.
   
   Sidney remains silent.
   
                       COTTON
             Sid, c'mon.
   
   Side backs away from Cotton. She doesn't trust either
   one of them. Derek watches her, amused.
   
                       DEREK
             Go on, untie him.
   
                       SIDNEY
             No. This is a set up.
   
                       DEREK
             That's quick.
   
                       COTTON
             Please, Sidney, he's going to kill
             us.
   
   Derek begins filming again.
   
                       DEREK
             You must be dealing with some
             serious trust issues right about
             now.
   
   Sidney says nothing. She egdes away, moving to the wall
   where Hallie hangs.
   
                       DEREK (CONT'D)
             Sidney, you can't keep your back to
             the audience like that. Could you
             cheat a little forward for me?
   
                       COTTON
             Please, Sidney.
   
                       DEREK
             You're really stumped, aren't you?
             You know there's two killers but
             you don't know who they are. I'm a
             given. The boyfriend. Way obvious.
             But now you're torn. Everyone else
             appears to be dead. Except for
             Cotton. Hmmm? Hmmm?
   
   Suddenly, Hallie comes to life behind Sid, reaching
   out, grabbing her. Sid JUMPS. She spins around to find
   Hallie breaking out in a torrent of GIGGLES. Very much
   alive.
   
                       HALLIE
             Paaaaiiin... yah, such pain... The
             story of your life, Sid.
   
   Sidney stares in mortal shock as Hallie cuts herself
   down from the wall with a big hunting knife.
   
                       DEREK
             Need some help, honey.
   
                       HALLIE
             I got it..
   
   Sidney's eyes go back and forth between the two.
   
                       DEREK
             You should really see your face
             right now, Sid. It's doing some
             freaky shit.
   
   Derek's right. Sid's face appears completely tortured.
   
                       HALLIE
             Yeah, you look quizzical yet
             pensive.
   
                       DEREK
             Yeah, how can we help? Do you have
             any questions regarding the sequel
             of your life?
   
   Sidney stares them down. She's been here before.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Why?
   
                       DEREK
             Good question. You took the bait.
   
                       HALLIE
             Ever see NATURAL BORN KILLERS?
             Well, Derek and I have this whole
             Mickey/Mallory-Woody
             Harrelson/Juliette Lewis thing
             going on.
   
                       DEREK
             I really don't like that
             comparison, honey.
   
                       HALLIE
                   (to Sid)
             He hates Oliver Stone.
   
                       DEREK
             I find his work overwrought.
   
   Sid is waning.
   
                       HALLIE
             C'mon, Sid, don't fade on us. We've
             been planning this baby for a year.
             Humor us.
   
   Sid turns to Cotton. She kneels down and begins to
   untie him.
   
                       DEREK
             Nope. You had your chance.
   
   Derek dummy lunges at her with the knife. Sid backs
   off.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   EXT. THEATRE SAME
   
   Gale approaches the side theatre door. She pulls on it.
   It's locked.
   
                       GALE
             Shit.
   
   She moves down along the theatre to another door.
   
                                               CUT TO:
   
   
   INT. THEATRE A MINUTE LATER
   
   Hallie and Derek move around Sid, taking turns filming
   her with the camera.
   
                       DEREK
             We met on the internet.
   
                       HALLIE
             He sent me the cutest e-mail.
   
                       DEREK
             I read her postings on the horror
             movie chat boards and fell
             hopelessly. Hook, line...
   
                       HALLIE
             We have our own website now. We
             dedicated a whole page to you.
   
                       DEREK
             You'd me amazed at how many of us
             there are out there. It's a whole
             world, Sid. You're really popular
             amongst the demented.
   
                       HALLIE
             You're the one who got away.
   
                       DEREK
             Until now.
   
                       COTTON
             You guys are fucked.
   
                       HALLIE
             Actually Cotton, and I think
             critics would agree, it's the other
             way around.
   
                       DEREK
             Poor Cotton, could life be a little
             more cruel?
   
                       SIDNEY
             You're not going to get away with
             this.
   
                       HALLIE
             Of course not. Who wants to? What's
             the point if we don't get caught?
             Where's the glamour in that?
   
                       DEREK
             The way I see it. We'll be
             arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on
             the home footage. Secure a book
             deal. If all goes as planned, our
             trial should coincide with the
             release of STAB II.
   
                       HALLIE
             A verdict and premiere all on the
             same day. I love it.
   
                       DEREK
             We're hoping for the death penalty.
             I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING
             swan song exit planned.
   
                       HALLIE
             And now, drum roll please...
   
                       DEREK
             Hope you're ready, Sid. We got one
             last surprise for you.
   
   Cotton pull and twists on his bound wrists. Sid had
   loosened them somewhat. He tries to finish undoing
   them.
   
                       HALLIE
             A twist ending if you will.
   
                       DEREK
             Yeah, we really had our work cut
             out for us. It really is the curse
             of the sequel. The Billy/Stu
             thing's been done.
   
                       HALLIE
             ... so we had to be different but
             yet the same because if you venture
             to far away from your orginal story
             you completely alienate the
             audience...
   
                       DEREK
             And we didn't want to do that, Sid.
             We wanted to give you your money's
             worth.
   
                       HALLIE
             So we found a compromise.
   
                       DEREK
             Or it found us.
   
                       HALLIE
             We have a surprise guest star
             waiting in the wings.
   
                       DEREK
             Just for you, Sid.
   
                       HALLIE
             Wait a sec, Derek. We forgot to
             flip.
   
   Derek reaches in his pocket for a coin.
   
                       DEREK
             Oh yeah.
                   (to Sid)
             We figure the one of us that
             actually kills you will get a
             little more press. It's been an
             ongoing discussion.
                   (to Hallie)
             Heads or tails?
   
                       HALLIE
             Tails.
   
   He flips the coin.
   
                       DEREK
             Shit! You win.
   
   
   IN THE AUDITORIUM
   
   Gale emerges from the lobby. She found a way in. She
   eyes the proceedings on stage. She sees Sidney standing
   over Cotton. And then Hallie and Derek on either
   side... knives in hand. She races down the aisle.
   
                       GALE
             Sidney!
   
   
   ON STAGE
   
   They all turn, spotting Gale. Sid moves forward, happy
   to see her.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Gale!
   
   
   IN THE AUDITORIUM
   
   Gale moves down the aisle, not sure what's going on.
   
   
   ON STAGE
   
   Sidney moves down center. Derek cuts her off just as...
   
   
   THE CURTAIN DROPS
   
   Gale glimpsed the terror on Sidney's face just as the
   curtain separates them.
   
   
   ON STAGE
   
   Derek grabs Sidney, holding her, the knife at her
   throat.
   
                       HALLIE
             It's about time she showed up.
   
   
   IN THE AUDITORIUM
   
   Gale moves to the exit door and into the...
   
   
   INT. STAIR WELL SAME
   
   Gale eyes a door that's marked "STAGE DOOR". She opens
   it and steps in coming face to face with a...
   
   
   A LARGE AUTOMATIC REVOLVER
   
   Gale's eyes move down the end of the gun to find...
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             standing, lips pursed.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Hello, Gale, we've been waiting for
             you.
   
   Gale's face is a mass of confusion.
   
   
   INT. STAGE SAME
   
   Derek releases Sidney, shoving her, she falls to her
   knees, next to Cotton.
   
   
   CLOSE ON COTTON'S HAND
   
                       SIDNEY
             Okay, look, you guys - I applaud
             your methodical expertise but I
             have a question. What's going to
             happen after I die? I thought the
             heroine is supposed to live.
   
                       HALLIE
             Not this time.
   
   Hallie moves in on her.
   
                       DEREK
             Yeah, we're trying to send a
             message to Hollywood. I'm really
             getting tired of all the happy
             endings. It's just not reality. In
             the real world the good guys die,
             the innocent are punished, and the
             murderers inherit the earth.
   
                       SIDNEY
             But nobody wants to see that. It'll
             never go. They'll rewrite you. You
             don't want that.
   
                       HALLIE
             Oh, Sid, you're sounding desparate.
             I guess fearing death makes one
             anxious.
   
                       SIDNEY
             You fucking freaked out movie nut
             psychos...
   
                       VOICE
                   (off camera)
             Don't blame the movies, Sid. Movies
             don't create pyschos.
   
   Sid stops dead in her tracks as these words still her
   very soul. The Voice comes from the wings. They all
   turn as Gale Weathers appears. Behind her, with gun in
   hand, is Debbie Salt. Derek grabs the camera. He
   doesn't want to miss a second.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Don't you know that by now? It's
             about family. It all starts at
             home. It starts with the father...
             and the mother.
   
   Sidney mouth drops, her face aghast, as she looks to
   Debbie Salt. She recognizes her immediately.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Mrs. Loomis?
   
   Gale stops cold.
   
                       GALE
             What?
   
                       SIDNEY
             Oh my God.
   
   Gale turns to Debbie Salt.
   
                       GALE
             Jesus. It can't be.
   
                       HALLIE
             Told you we had a guest star.
             Didn't see that coming, did you?
   
                       DEREK
             Everything's taken on a hyper-
             reality, hasn't it?
   
                       GALE
             You're Billy's mother?
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             I couldn't believe you didn't
             recognize me. You even interviewed
             me for your book.
   
                       GALE
             You're all in this together?
   
                       DEREK
             We had to have financing.
   
                       HALLIE
             Tuition's expensive.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Why Mrs. Loomis?
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Where should we start? Your mother
             ruined my marriage by sleeping with
             my husband. You ruined my family by
             killing my son. Gale aired it to
             the world. Should I go on... isn't
             that enough?
   
                       GALE
             Jesus, you're just as whacked as
             your son.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Where do you think he got it?
             Mental illness is heriditary. Who
             do you think incouraged him to kill
             your mother? He was a smart kid but
             children need parental guidance.
   
   Sidney is completely horror stricken. She stands in
   total disbelief.
   
                       DEREK
             Yeah, she's been great, Sid. We
             never would have been able to it
             without her.
   
   Debbie Salt/Mrs. Loomis looks to both Derek and Hallie,
   smiling.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             And I couldn't have done it without
             you two. Now who won the coin toss?
   
   Hallie raises her hand.
   
                       HALLIE
             I did.
   
   Debbie points the gun at her, quickly, simply... and
   FIRES. Sid and Gale SCREAM as a bullet through the
   forehead sends Hallie flying back against the flat
   wall. Her body drops to the floor. Dead.
   
   Derek drops the camera, completely taken back. He looks
   to Debbie.
   
                       DEREK
             What are you...
   
   Debbie turns the gun on him. FIRES AGAIN. Derek moves,
   the bullet catches him in the stomach. He drops to his
   knees. Debbie FIRES again. Derek takes another bullet.
   This time dropping. Very dead. His body falls near
   Cotton who has remained suspiciously quiet through this
   ordeal. He eyes Derek's knife that now lay near his
   wrists.
   
   
   SIDNEY AND GALE
   
   Turn to Debbie in complete horror.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Nice kids but a little out there.
   
                       GALE
             What are you going to do?
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Finish what my son started.
   
                       GALE
             But you'll never get away with it.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Enter Cotton Weary.
   
   Cotton looks up.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT (CONT'D)
             Think about it. An innocent man
             wrongly accused. Spends time in
             prison where he justs sits with his
             righteous anger, waiting, planning
             his revenge. His life so
             incomprehensively ruined he's
             forced to take revenge on the
             people responsible. It's perfect.
   
                       COTTON
             No... not again.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Sorry, Cotton. I guess you were
             just meant to be a killer.
   
                       SIDNEY
             You'll never get away with this.
   
   Debbie moves to Cotton, shrugging.
   
                       DEBBIE SALT
             Who would you like to shoot first,
             Cotton?
   
   Just then, Cotton leans up, freed from his bindings.
   With the knife in hand, he lunges for Debbie Salt. It
   strikes her, lodging into her chest. She goes back.
   Cotton doesn't stop, he stabs her again and again. She
   goes down. Dead.
   
                       GALE
             Thank God.
   
   Gale rushes to Cotton as he jumps to his feet. She
   helps him with the last of his bindings. Sid looks
   about at the body count on stage. It's mounting. She
   takes a deep breath. Relieved.
   
                       GALE (CONT'D)
             God, Cotton, what a nightmare. I'm
             so sorry.
   
                       COTTON
             Yeah...
   
   Gale gives him a hug.
   
   
   CLOSE ON COTTON'S FACE
   
                       GALE
             Thank you.
   
   He hugs her back. She doesn't see as he rises the knife
   behind her, bringing it down in one swift, maniacal
   move. Gale's body jerks, a moment of shock and then she
   goes limp as the knife lodges in her back.
   
   Sidney turns just in time to see Cotton toss Gale's
   body down into the orchestra pit. He turns, facing
   Sidney. The bloody knife in hand.
   
                       SIDNEY
             NOOO!
   
   Cotton moves to Derek's body where the video camera
   lay, he pulls the tape from it.
   
                       COTTON
             It's perfect, Sidney. No one will
             ever suspect me. I have proof. I'm
             the victim.
   
                       SIDNEY
             Please, Cotton, don't do this.
   
   He holds up the video cassette. Murder in his eye.
   
                       COTTON
             I get my revenge and make some fast
             cash.
   
                       SIDNEY
             It's over, Cotton.
   
                       COTTON
             Not until you're dead.
   
   Cotton lunges for her. Sid tears off, slipping through
   the set door to...
   
   
   BACKSTAGE
   
   Sid runs to the rear of the stage. She moves in the
   narrow space that exists between the scrim and the back
   wail. She races down it.
   
   She almost reaches the end when COTTON RIPS THROUGH THE
   SCRIM!
   
   Sidney ducks, bypassing him. She comes to the stage
   door. It's locked. She turns, seeing the metal ladder
   that's attached to the wall. It leads to the catwalk
   above.
   
   Sid goes for it. She climbs up the ladder with
   lightning speed.
   
   Cotton, up and running, is close behind.
   
   
   INT. CATWALK SAME
   
   The catwalk sits above the open fly space where flats
   and a large chandelier are stored in the air.
   
   Sid reaches the top and takes off running down to the
   ending.
   
   AND THAT'S AS FAR AS I'VE GOTTEN.
   
   WHAT HAPPENS IS SID AND COTTON FIGHT TO THE FINISH, HE
   CHASES HER THROUGH HANGING FLATS, THEN DOWN THE FLY
   RAIL, BACK TO THE STAGE. SID GETS FINDS A KNIFE AND
   STABS COTTON.
   
   HE STABS HER BACK. THEY FIGHT, CONTINUING TO STAB EACH
   OTHER UNTIL THEY BOTH DROP CENTER STAGE. THEY LAY NEXT
   TO EACH OTHER, NEITHER ABLE TO MOVE. THEIR EYES SLOWLY
   CLOSE.
   
   
   
   THE END (FOR NOW)
