          1 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - NIGHT 1

           Static shots: A deserted locker room. Empty showers.
           Cinder-block tunnels lit with wire-encased lamps like in
           a coal mine. THREE SECURITY GUARDS watch a game on a TV.
           LEGEND: October 15, 2001

                         
           We begin to hear disembodied cheering crowds and the
           faint voice of an announcer -

                         

           BRENNAMAN V/O
           ... nobody on, two and two to Saenz - who
           has just three at bats in the series, and
           none of them hits - as he settles back in

                          -

          2 EXT. OAKLAND COLISEUM -NIGHT 2


                         
           At the end of a tunnel, the A's empty dugout. The empty
           diamond. Just a couple of the floodlights are on.

           BRENNAMAN V/O
           - Rivera looks in for the sign, he has
           it, the pitch, Saenz swings and -

                         
           The announcer's voice and excited crowd abruptly cut
           off. In silence, we regard the 60,000 empty seats that
           wrap around the playing field ... but then see that, in
           fact, it's 59,999 empty seats. There's a lone figure
           seated in one of them. The sound snaps back on:

           STEVE LYONS V/O
           - a ground out to second, Thom, is not
           what the A's were looking for from Saenz -
           down by two in the ninth -

                         
           The lone man in the stadium has a radio and a bag of
           peanuts. He seems at peace as he looks down on the empty
           diamond - a peace only slightly belied, perhaps, by the
           baseball he absently turns in a hand. He switches the
           radio back on -

           BRENNAMAN V/O
           Eric Byrnes has emerged from the dugout
           to bat for Menechino -

           2.

           2.

                         

                         
           He turns it off again. Calmly eats a peanut. Waits.
           Switches the radio back on -

                         

           BRENNAMAN V/O
           - the A's are down to their last strike
           and this Yankee crowd is on its feet -
           Rivera squints for the sign, he has it,
           delivers and -
           Again, at the crucial moment, he cuts the radio. Waits
           just a few moments. Turns the radio back on -

                         

           BRENNAMAN V/O
           It is bedlam in New York. The Yankees -
           down two games to none - have come back
           to win three, and the Division Series.

                         
           The outcome of the series seems to have no effect on
           Billy. He simply gets up, switches off the radio, and
           climbs the steps to leave. But somehow we still faintly
           hear, as he comes past shuttered concession stands toward
           an exit, the voice of one of the announcers -

                         

           STEVE LYONS V/O
           This is an exceptional feat not only for
           New York, Thom, but for Oakland - though
           not the kind you can be proud of: Only
           once before has a team lost a Division
           Series after winning the first two games -

          3 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - NIGHT 3


                         
           It's coming from a small television a night security
           guard is watching. But when he sees Billy approaching,
           he quickly shuts it off.

                          BILLY
           It's okay, Joe, you can leave it on.
           It's no big deal.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           No, it's okay, I don't need to watch it.

                         
           The guard's eyes consider the baseball Billy absently
           turns in his hands -

                         

                          BILLY
           How's Meg?

                          SECURITY GUARD
           She's good, thanks.

                         
           - and the glass window of the bar behind him -

           3.

           3.

                         

                         

                          BILLY
           And the boys?

                         

                          SECURITY GUARD
           They're good. Everybody's good.

                          BILLY
           That's good.
           The security guard waits for the baseball to sail through
           the glass, but it doesn't happen.

                         

                          BILLY
           Night.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           Night, Billy. It was a great season.

          4 EXT. COLISEUM - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 4

           A lone car sits in the parking lot in front of the
           Coliseum. We HEAR-

           TARA V/O
           They had three times your payroll, Billy.

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah...

           TARA V/O
           You're not watching them celebrate,
           right?
           Car's off. Billy sits in the dark on his phone.

                         

                          BILLY
           No. That would be, uh--

                         

           TARA V/O
           Pointless? Self-destructive? Masochistic?

                          BILLY
           Are you asking me to pick one?

           TARA V/O
           What you should be doing is thinking
           about what an amazing job you did and how
           great you are.

                         

                          BILLY
           I'll be honest, right this minute I'm not
           thinking about either of those things.

           4.

           4.

                         

                         

           TARA V/O
           You take a team with that payroll to the
           playoffs? You take the Yankees to a fifth
           game? I'm not even sure the better team
           won.

                          BILLY
           They were down two-love and then beat us
           three in a row. Trust me, the better team
           won.

                         
          BILLY presses a button on his portable radio and is hit
          with sound of sports talk radio--

                         

           CALLER V/O
           --while embarrassing the entire city and
           making a mockery of their fans. I'm sick
           of this.

           TARA V/O
           Let's go away.

                         

                          BILLY
           That sounds good.

                         

          CUT TO WHAT BILLY'S BEEN LOOKING AT THIS WHOLE TIME -
          Three enormous looming likenesses of the Oakland A's
          premiere players on floodlit banners--Jason Giambi,
          Johnny Damon, Jason Isringhausen.

           TARA V/O
           Someplace they don't have a baseball
           team.

                          BILLY
           How about Oakland?

                         

           TARA V/O
           Okay, here are the rules for tonight. You
           can do anything you want but you can't
           give any quotes to the press, go on the
           internet or hurt my car, we have a deal?

                         

                          BILLY
           Yeah.

           TARA V/O
           They had three times your payroll, Billy.
          From the radio we've been hearing shards of "--an
          unprecedented choke--", "--get rid of Billy Beane--", "--
          Billy Beane knows nothing about baseball--".

           TARA V/O
           How about Hawaii? I'll make a
           reservation someplace. The place with
           the turtles.

           Billy chucks the radio away. Gets back in the car, puts
           it in gear. HARD CUT TO --

           Very impressive performance today. In my
           job as the national cross-checker for the
           New York Mets, I see the top 200 players
           in the United States. It's been a while
           since I've seen a five tools guy, the
           complete package. Your throwing ability,
           your fielding skills... Ed told me you had
           power but I had no idea it was of the
           light tower variety. I hope you're as
           interested in professional baseball as we

           something I want to do full time. I have

           Well, Billy, we're certainly looking
           forward to meeting your folks and talking
           to them as well. And we believe in
           college, but that's something you can do
           in the winter months. You need to know
           the sky's the limit with your ability.
           You could be a superstar before you've
           even graduated. But to get to that
           level, you need to work with our people.
           Pro-ball is where you need to be to
           develop the skills God gave you.

          There is an epidemic failure within the
          game to understand what's really
          happening. And it leads people who run
          major league teams to misjudge their
          players and mismanage their teams.
          They're still asking the wrong questions.
          People who run baseball teams still think
          in terms of buying players. Sorry to say
          that.

           The goal shouldn't be to buy players,
           what you want to buy is wins. To buy
           wins, you buy runs. You're trying to
           replace Johnny Damon. The Red Sox look at
           Johnny Damon and they see a star worth
           seven point five million a year. When I
           look at Johnny Damon, I see an imperfect
           understanding of where runs come from.

          DAMON swings at the first pitch and knocks it into left

           PETER V/O
           - which in 2001 was .324. That's 10
           points lower than league average, and 17
           points lower than Garcia's.

           PETER V/O
           True, he stole some bases. But attempted
           steals in general have to succeed 70% of
           the time before they even start to
           contribute to run totals. In 2001 he cost
           you runs.
          DAMON's tagged out at second.

           He's got a good glove. He's a decent
           leadoff hitter. He steals bases. But he's
           not worth the seven point five million
           Boston is paying him. You're lucky to
           have him off your payroll, it opens all

           be one or the other. To postpone four

           leagues. The sooner he gets there the

           walks more than anyone in baseball except
           Barry Bonds. Take out intentional walks
           and it's more than Bonds. He's the Greek

           Every at bat is like a hand of blackjack.
           Every card that's dealt, your odds
           completely change. For instance, every
           first pitch strike, your batting average
           goes down about 75 points.

           doesn't think very much of himself at
           all, and when he tightens up we've got
           ourselves an adventure. So I'd like to
           see Chad Bradford out of the pen tonight
           when we're in, let's say, just to make it

           The FANS are booing as ART makes his way to the mound to
           take MAGNANTE out. BRADFORD makes his way from the
           bullpen and takes the ball from ART.
           ART turns to head back to the dugout but slows as he sees
           a strange sight: BILLY is standing at the dugout rail.

           BILLY'S POV OF THE SCOREBOARD: 11-0 at the bottom of the
           3rd. Unfortunately the idyllic moment is short-lived as
           Dye strikes out swinging and the teams swap places. The
           A's take the field with TIM HUDSON pitching.
           Billy looks around. He sees the scoreboard, a FAN with a
           big funky cowboy hat, the charged-up crowd in the stands,
           it's like the Coliseum at Rome.

           two-seam fastball and parked it in the
           upper deck in left field for a pinch-hit
           walk-off home run in a record breaking
           game. Go tell him about it.

           Here's the thing -- we changed the game.
           We got this year, maybe next, then
           they're gonna catch on. This is our
           moment. I want to go the distance. I
           wanna shove it up the Yankees' ass. Not
           just the Yankees, but... these guys

           That's right, it's just a record. It
           gets buried in some book. Come on, tell
           me who won 19? I don't even know. It's
           4th place at the Olympics. Any other
           team wins the World Series this year...
           great. We're still in the record books.
           But if we win, we've changed the game.
           We've put it on its head and shoved it up
           their ass. If we don't, they're gonna
           erase us.

           an incredibly close game but the A's are losing by one

           The flaw in the A's thinking, and this

           is their failure to comprehend you have
           to manufacture runs in the post season.

           Durham swings at the fastball and connects, but it's a
           pop fly to second which a TWINS INFIELDER easily nabs.
           The PITCHER throws his glove in the air and the CATCHER
           runs out to the mound as the rest of the Twins run to the
           middle of the field to begin their victory celebration.

                         
           Durham turns away and heads back to the dugout.
