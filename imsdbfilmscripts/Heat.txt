EXT. CEDARS-SINAI - WIDE - DAY

A monolith with alienating foregrounds. A bus pulls in on
Beverly. NEIL McCAULEY and a nurse get off. Neil carries
a paper bag and wears white pants like a hospital attendant.
Neil is an ice-cold professional: very big, very tough.
At 42 his short black hair is graying. He spent eight
years in McNeil and three in San Quentin. He got out and
hit the street in 1987. Four of the McNeil years were
spent in the hole. Neil's voice is street, but his language
is precise like an engineer's. He's very careful and very
good. Neil runs a professional crew that pulls down high
line, high number scores and does it anyway the score has
to be taken down: if on the prowl (a burglary), that's
fine; if they have to go in strong (armed), that's fine
too. And if you get in their way, that's got to be your
problem. His lifestyle is obsessively functional. There's
no steady woman or any encumbrance. Neil McCauley keeps
it so there's nothing he couldn't walk from in 30 seconds
flat.

ANGLE

Right now, he enters the big double doors and pulls a white
intern's coat from his paper bag.

INT. CEDARS-SINAI CORRIDOR - TRAVELING TWO SHOT - DAY

We DOLLY on Neil as he crosses through the long crowded
corridor. Patients, nurses, interns and doctors pass by.
A P.A. broadcasts occasional messages.

PROFILE

Nail crosses under an "EMERGENCY" sign and keeps going
towards the exit doors.

TRAVELING - FRONTAL

Neil APPROACHES THE CAMERA. From the other direction two
ambulance attendants wheel an old man under oxygen and
pass by Neil.

WIDE REAR SHOT

Without breaking his stride from the moment he got off the
bus, Neil exits through the doors, examines four ambulances
parked in the slots, climbs into one and drives off. Maybe
he's stolen it. We don't know.

EXT. R & C CONSTRUCTION SUPPLIES - ON CHRIS - DAY

CHRIS SHIHERLIS crosses past stacks of gravel and cement
with a white-coated BLACK CLERK. Chris wears a hard hat
over a mongol cut, Levi's, black boots and a sleeveless
sweat shirt and carries on one shoulder a 150 lb., red,
Milwaukee Tool Company case. He looks like a construction
worker by day who by night hits L.A's slams, jams and raves.
He's 29, from Austin, Texas. Chris is also a highline
pro: a boxman who knows five ways to open any safe made.
Right now he's buying a hollow core drill. He and McCauley
were cellmates in San Quentin Penitentiary from 1984 to
1987. Chris hit the streets in 1988. He's a hot dog and
spends money as fast as he makes it. Right now, he and
the Clerk exit to the sales counter.

          Cash. Put "Jack's Fencing" on
          the receipt.

                       CLERK
          $788.   30

Chris pays; Clerk writes receipt.

                      CLERK
              (continuing)
          ...that a good racket? I ought
          to get out from behind this
          counter...

                      CHRIS
              (takes receipt)
          Yeah.
              (beat)
          Take it easy.

He leaves with the heavy red case.

INT. "TOYS 'R' US STORE" - ON CERRITO - DAY

MICHAEL CERRITO - at 40 - is looking at a doll house.
He's a wide, thick, coarse-featured big man. Sicilian
from Sunnyside, he's spent 15 years in Attica, Joliet and
Marion penitentiaries. He's strictly a "cowboy": his
natural inclination towards a score is "...get the guns
and let's go." He's been off smack and everything else
for five years. He's clean and sober. He's the nicest
guy on the block and a loving father. If you get in his
way, he'll kill you as soon as look at you. If you asked
him about the contradictions, he wouldn't know what you
were talking about.

CLOSE OR DOLL HOUSE DETAILS

It's 3 x 6 and two feet high. Miniature room sets are
inside. Cerrito's thick fingers close the door. He picks
it up. WIDEN. He crosses to a counter and MIDDLE-AGED
CLERK.

                      CERRITO
          Wrap this here up.

                      CLERK
          Yessir. You're going to have a
          happy little girl.

                       CERRITO
          Two.   I got two girls.

                         CLERK
          That's nice.

                       CERRITO
          Yeah. And gimme those three
          masks there.

Clerk takes down Clark Gable, Three-eyed Monster, and
Beautiful Lady, full-head rubber masks.

                      CERRITO
              (continuing)
          Gimme Donald Duck, too

                      CLERK
              (does and laughs)
          A little early for Halloween?

          Yeah. Halloween's coming early
          this year. What do I owe you?

INT. CONDOMINIUM - A HAND - MORNING

Slides across the back of JUSTINE'S thigh.

JUSTINE'S AND HANNA'S FACES

She is 29, auburn,  languorous, her eyes are closed and she
makes love with her  husband, VINCENT HANNA. Pressing her
face to his, their  hair intertwined... It's morning. We
are in an expensive  condominium.

WIDE

The two bodies locked into the rhythms of their love-making,
twisted in white sheets. OFF SCREEN a shower runs.

                 (to Hanna)
             He's already half an hour late.

             He gonna show? Or the son of a
             bitch gonna stand her up like
             last time?

Hanna clips a 2" .38 in his waistband.       Justine shrugs and
shakes her head.

                 (starting out of

He leaves.

                         JUSTINE
             Falls back on the pillow,
             disappointed. It's as if she'd
             been stood-up. The bed sheet
             falls half off of her. She's
             exposed, vulnerable. She looks
             out the window, occluded by light
             muslin, away from us and exhales.

Bare-chested washing at a sink. WAINGRO'S 27. He sports
prison tattoos including an Aryan Brotherhood swastika
covering his abdomen. He's a graduate of the "gladiator
academies," Chino and Tracy.

He's dressed in Army and Navy Store gray workman's clothes.
He combs his long hair straight back off his round forehead.
Now he tucks his shirt in and puts on wrap around shades.

          Yeah.

He climbs in. Cerrito pulls out. Waingro - delayed -
offers his hand. Cerrito has to wait until he finishes
his gear change to shake it. The timing's a little weird.

                      WAINGRO

Awkward pause.

                      WAINGRO
          This works good, maybe I could
          go again?

Cerrito looks at Waingro.   He wants to protect his
concentration.

                       CERRITO
          Yeah.   Stop talking, slick...

It ends the conversation. Waingro drums his fingernails
on the dash. He's anxious.

Cerrito has the monster mask three eyes and a twisted mouth.
Waingro is a beautiful woman. Their movements now are

CERRITO'S POV:

As we approach the street an armored truck passes by. We
fall in behind. At this point we realize these men are
going to pull down an armed robbery of this armored truck.
But, we turn LEFT. The armored truck went straight. Then
we turn RIGHT. However we SEE the armored truck again.
It turned left. Our paths will intersect at 90 degrees.

Door crashes down, opens, Guard One falls out. Then GUARD

He yanks their guns away - his 9mm.      At the back of each

tries to twist away as a reflex. Cerrito cracks him in
the face with the AR15, driving him to the wall.

It's like Waingro can't hear. He's fixated with Guard

concerned with his masculine pride than his safety. He's
a stupid man.

   number three 'cause it didn't
   rake any difference anymore, so
   why leave a living witness?

            The plates are mezzotints. They
            evoke a feeling Japanese painters
            called "sabi". They believed
            there were eight scenes of
            transcendental loneliness. They
            painted them over and over again.
            One is a flock of geese hovering
            over a field. There's always
            mist. It's painted just as the

          What is it?

                      CEZAR
          A bank. On Thursdays it gets
          cash deposits for distribution
          to other branches. The branches
          have to buttress their cash
          accounts to handle Friday payroll
          checks from a Toyota and Nissan
          plant, a steel mill and two
          refineries. One day a week,
          Thursday, the main branch carries
          the full whack.

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org   34.


               CEZAR
   'Cause I can get it. 'Cause
   this is the best thing I seen in
   three years. 'Cause a screw-up
   makes 10 percent of nothin' equal
   nothin'. And 'cause those are
   the terms and they ain't
   negotiable.

   Strong. Through the front door.
   During the day.

   How many guys?

                CEZAR
   Four.   Three plus a driver.

               NEIL
   That's not a $100,000 worth
   anything. You're giving me an
   address to what's strictly a
   cowboy score: "Get the guns and
   let's go!" We smash, grab and
   boogie while they hit the alarm.

               CEZAR
   Three alarms. And that's why
   the price. 'Cause you chop-in
   through the roof the night before
   on the prowl and bypass 'em. I
   got circuit diagrams, blue prints,
   the works. So yeah, they hit
   the alarms, but nothing gonna
   happen.

               NEIL
   Do I have to kill people?

   I doubt it. Two men have the
   two keys to open the box.

Neon under the vapor lamps. O.S. the cacophony of horns

               (to Hanna)
           Here's how we found her.

POLAROID - BLACK PROSTITUTE

in a nightgown, folded over the lip of a garbage can at
the waist. She's a pitiful rag doll. Someone killed her
and then threw her away.

HANNA

is too controlled.    Anger's underneath.

                         HANNA
           How old?

                       RICHIE
           Sixteen, seventeen.

           hematoma.

                       HANNA
           Who are they?

THEIR POV: HEAVYSET BLACK WOMAN

and two stunned young boys. She's crying and arguing with
two uniformed LAPD trying to hold her back. One LAPD is a
black woman. The heavyset woman doesn't really know what
happened yet except it's bad.

                         RICHIE (O.S.)

           The family.

               (low; shrugs)

Now Richie bends over the body bag on the ground and unzips
it. We don't see the dead girl. We only see Hanna. A
third uniformed officer in the background spins away.

                      HANNA
          Oh, this is nice.

                      RICHIE
          I wanted you to see this 'cause
          I got a feeling it's serial and
          gonna end up in your court.

                      HANNA
          Homicide getting anywhere?

                      RICHIE
          Nowhere.

Hanna rises. The mother's arguing with the man cop because
she wants to see. Horror and hysteria blossoming through
shock. She pushes the uniformed cop of the way. Hanna
goes to try to help. They grapple.

                      MOTHER
              (reaches out)
          Baby! Where's my baby.!

Anguish. It's a mess. The woman collapsing into Hanna's
arms. For one moment Hanna's eyes lock onto hers. He
freezes. One doesn't forget the look he sees in her eyes.

                      EADY
          My father wanted me to marry
          someone in Taipei. It was like
          I was a piece of furniture: "Go
          be his wife." After I left he
          won't talk to me. Because I
          went on my own. I can't let
          people tell roe what to do again.
          And that trust comes from knowing
          someone over time.
              (avoids Neil)
          This is hard between us for me.
          Because I like you very much.

Neil looks right into Eady's face.

Nothing. Then the Pontiac with its lights off rolls

curious. He raises his head over the edge and his eyes go
wide. WIDEN. He's inches from the back of Cerrito's head.
Cerrito twists and turns and jerks back in effort - almost
touching Jackson. Cerrito's too absorbed to sense Jackson's
presence. Jackson carefully closes his eyes and sinks
down.

He gets a nod from Cerrito.   He slams the lock punch with
a cut down sledge hammer.

Hanna rips open Marciano's desk drawer finds a gun, unloads
it, throws it on the floor, finds a small tape recorder,
pops the tape out and tosses it to Schwartz. Then he
flashes a badge at Marciano.

                        MARCIANO
            L.A.P.D. Who the hell you think
            you're pushing around? You got
            no jurisdiction and I know people
            here!

                       SCHWARTZ
            Who? The fucking Tooth Fairy!
            So what?

                        HANNA
            You go back to Newark on a New
            Jersey warrant for smuggling
            cigarettes up from North Carolina
            three years ago or you go to
            work for us. Cut and dried.
            That...is...it.

                        MARCIANO
            Oh, my God...

                        HANNA
            Charlene Shiherlis.

                        MARCIANO
            Who?

                        SCHWARTZ
            "Who?" The stranger you been
            talkin' dirty to on the telephone
            every day for the last month.

                        MARCIANO
            You can't tie me to her!

                        HANNA
            Who has to. You're onna plane
            to New Jersey, jagoff.

                        MARCIANO
            Oh, man...
                (to himself)
            Why did I get mixed up with that
            bitch?

             'Cause she's got a great ass and
             you goT your head all the way up

                   (defeated)
             So?

                         HANNA
             So it's no big thing. I don't
             even want her. You can have
             her, after. I want her husband
             and all his buddies; that's all.
             And you're gonna help.

INT. ROBERT'S COFFEE SHOP - NEIL + CHRIS - DAY

in a booth next to the window. Out the window is morning
traffic on Beverly Boulevard. Empty coffee cups say they've
been there a while. They lean close and talk low. Neil's
explosive behind it.

                         NEIL
             LAPD? The G? What? Where the
             hell did this heat come from?

                         CHRIS
             Maybe it's only the EMA score,
             not us.

             houses bugged, I beepers on all
             the cars. We got major problems..
             Where's Cerrito?

Neil looks over at the cook behind the high counter and
recognizes him.

NEIL'S POV: DAVID BREEDAN

                         NEIL (O.S.)
             Recognize the cook?

          armed robbery.

INT. KITCHEN - BREEDAN

Grim, cold, working his ass off on five breakfast orders
simultaneously.

                         NEIL (O.S.)
          Hey, David.     How you doing?

Breedan turns, recognizes Neil and warms as if the sun
rose.

                       BREEDAN
          Hey, Homeboy! All right!
              (flips eggs; checks
               orders)
          How bout you?

                      NEIL
              (sits on counter)
          Gettin' by. You okay?

                      BREEDAN
              (embarrassed; re:
                job)
          Yeah. Temporary. Know what I
          mean?

Neil looks out and sees Cerrito.

                       NEIL
          Sure.   See you around.

INT. RESTAURANT - ON BOOTH

Neil slides in.

          My car. Bugs. Two of 'em.
          Count 'em. One in the wheel
          well. Second behind the fire
          wall. Night of the party? I
          dropped Elaine and swung by EMA
          to check out the junction box...

                         CHRIS
             Without the platinum how do we
             buy the bank score?

                         NEIL
             I cash in T-bills to pay-off
             Kelso. That's not our problem.

                         CERRITO
             What the hell happened to Van
             Zant and our 750?

                         NEIL
             With the heat we got, you wanna
             play World War Two in the streets
             with Van Zant?

                         CERRITO
             Van Zant gets a pass?!

                         NEIL
             Fuck Van Zant. I got more
             motivation to whack him than you
             do. He is a luxury. Our problem
             is: jam and take the bank or
             split.
                 (beat)
             And I mean right fucking now.
             Do not go home, pack, nothing.
             Thirty seconds from now we are
             on the road. Gone.

No answer.    Chris and Cerrito are thinking.

                         CHRIS
             For me, the bank's worth the
             stretch. I say accept the risk,
             stay.

                         NEIL
             Michael?

                         CERRITO
                 (quietly)
             I roll with you. Whatever...

                         NEIL
                 (quietly)
             Not on this one, Michael. On
             this one you make up your own
             mind.

                         CERRITO
                 (he can't)

           I got some plans. To go away
           after. So for me, it's worth
           the stretch.

Chris is surprised.

                       NEIL
               (continuing)
           But, Elaine takes good care of

           T. Bonds; real estate. If I
           were you, I'd be smart and cut
           loose of this.

CERRITO

thinks.   The he shrugs, laughs:

                       CERRITO
           Hey. To me the action's half
           the juice anyway. I'm in.

                        NEIL
           All right.   All right.

EXT. WILIMINGTON OIL FIELDS - OIL PUMP - DAY

WIDEN. It's a desolate area - empty space. Off in the
distance is a manufacturing plant and a billboard. PAN
LEFT and HOLD on Cerrito's Coupe de Ville. It pulls down
the dirt access road, lurching up and down on its soft
shocks, and raising billows of tan dust. It stops. Neil -
in a gray chamois jacket over a black T-shirt - gets out.
He hasn't shaved in a couple of days. Chris and Michael
Cerrito get out the left side. They walk TO CAMERA and:

                       CERRITO
           That the place?

                        NEIL
           Yeah. You see how the road leads
           back around?

                        CERRITO
           Yeah.

                       NEIL
           That's the escape route...

VERY LONG SHOT: NEIL, CERRITO AND CHRIS

the three men point. Chris draws a map. Then they climb

PULL BACK and REVEAL Schwartz with binoculars and Casals
with earphones. They had been surveilling Neil and Cerrito.
There's a tape recorder with a directional microphone in a
parabolic dish.

                        CASALS
           I know.   Let's go!

WIDER

The two men run back from their observation position to an
unmarked car parked a hundred yards behind.

It's later. The CAMERA PANS the empty, desolate landscape

           What are they taking down out
           here?

PULL BACK to REVEAL Hanna, Schwartz, Casals and Bosko.
Hanna looks through binoculars.

                        CASALS
           They were looking at something
           southwest...

                       HANNA
           What's's that down there?

                       CASALS
           An auto parts company. They're
           going to knock over a payroll?

                       SCHWARTZ
           The company only pays by check.

                        HANNA
           Maybe they're gonna steal the
           hub caps ...

O.S. we HEAR a CLICK.

                       HANNA
               (continuing)
           A billboard. Oil pumps.     What

          figure.

ANGLE ON HANNA

Recognition dawns.

                      HANNA
          I got an idea what they're looking
          at. You know what they're looking
          at?

Hanna turns his back on the rest of the detectives and a
big smile dawns upon his face. He raises his arms out
wide. Hanna turns in one direction, then another. Schwartz
doesn't understand.

                      HANNA
              (continuing; to
               Schwartz)
          Is that guy something; or is
          that guy something? I mean, you
          gotta give this crew credit.
          They are so fucking good...
              (beat)
          Know what he's looking at?

VERY TIGHT ON HANNA IN 3/4 REAR SHOT

The image vibrates. Hanna says more. We don't hear it.
We HEAR a CAMERA SHUTTER CLICK. The IMAGE FOCUSES and
DEFOCUSES. Another CLICK.

                      HANNA
          Us. The L.A.P.D. The Police
          Department. We just got made...

Hanna laughs.

EXT. KNOLL - L.S. HANNA - TWILIGHT

Pull back to reveal he's being surveilled by Neil. He's
been photographing Hanna with a black Nikon on a tripod
with a 1300Mm Questar Reflector lens. Neil's made his
tail. The recce in the blue Cadillac was bait. Neil half
returns Hanna's smile. He climbs into the Caprice. Cerrito
roars off, leaving a cloud of dust which billows into mauve
against the deep sky.

INT. NATE'S MERCEDES - TWO SHOT - TRAVELING - DAY

Vapor lights glide past. Neil examines circuit diagrams
and architectural blueprints of the bank. Next he unfolds
a pasted-together 180 degree view of the street.

                      NATE

              (beat)
          It's terrific.

Neil puts the materials back in the case and snaps it shut.
Next, Nate hands Neil a thick envelope. Inside are the
pictures Neil took of Hanna and xeroxes of Hanna's
employment records.

                      NATE
          His name is Hanna; first name,
          Vincent. I smeared this sergeant
          in vice five yards. Hanna's all
          over you. He's a hot dog.
          Lieutenant in major Crimes Unit.
          He's taken down some heavy crews.
          Blew away Frankie Yonder in
          Chicago and he was a fucking
          maniac. Was working Narcotics
          before that. He's good, Neil.
          Dedicated. Divorced three times.
          Current wife's Justine. He's
          why the extra heat.
              (pause)
          Vice sergeant says Hanna likes
          you. Thinks you're some kind of
          'star.' 'You do this sharp, you
          do that sharp. Look how sharp
          this guy is to figure that.'

Neil laughs.

                      NATE
              (continuing)
          Funny as a heart attack.
              (pause)
          With this guy and this much heat,
          you should pass on the bank.

Hanna leaves. Then Justine looks at where he stood. Her
cold demeanor cracks, then reassembles and she lights a
roach, takes a hit, dumps it in the toilet and finishes
her makeup.

He pumps Liquid Vel. It suds. Hanna    picks up a plate to
wash it. He looks at it. Pauses.      Then he SMASHES the
plate into the piles of dirty dishes   and rests on his

Both cars pull onto the shoulder. Out of the unmarked

He approaches Neil's car.

NEIL

watches Hanna approach, wary.    He didn't expect this to

          her real father's a world class

          legit operation. I won't have
          details until tomorrow morning.

Marciano does. Charlene seems to soften and relax and
take satisfaction at Marciano's put-down.

                        FARINA
                (continuing; soft)
            He's right. And you know it.

            Yes.

                        FARINA
            Well, you're right. You would
            be. But if you don't betray
            Chris, you betray Dominick.
            Because he becomes an orphan
            when you go to prison as an
            accessory 'cause you got no living
            parents to take him. Then he
            ends up state-raised and fucked
            for life. Your son Dominick's
            innocent. He didn't choose a
            life like that. Chris did.

Charlene rises and crosses to a bedroom and looks in the
door - presumably at Dominick.

                        FARINA

            Give up Chris. You get off clean.
            Do it for your kid.

Charlene sits - shell-shocked - dressed in black with white
face and red lipstick. Marciano re-enters with a drink
for her.  Charlene looks towards the bedroom containing
Dominick, then nods her head "yes." Farina dials a number.

            Use these credit cards. They
            say "Mr. and Mrs." I reserved
            the car. Buy me some clothes.
            Here's a list. I can't go home
            for my stuff. Can you do it?

                        EADY
            When's it over?

                        NEIL
            Twenty-two hours. Then we fly
            out of here...clean.

He kisses her.    She doesn't respond.    She stares at him.

                        EADY
            I want you to let me go.     When
            will you let me go?

                        NEIL
            You can go now. There's the
            door, you want out...

                        EADY
            No, I have to do what you say.
            But will you let me leave after?

FARINA'S POV:

A MAN

                (ignorant of Hanna's
                 presence; to Ralph)
            It's ready...

JUSTINE

Ralph sees Hanna's 2" .38 in his waistband.

Hanna's reaction to Ralph is vacant of emotion.

                      HANNA
          I'm Vincent Hanna.

                      JUSTINE
          Don't you even get angry?

                      HANNA
              (to Justine)
          I'm angry.
              (to Ralph)
          Ralph, you can ball my wife.
          You can lounge around her $1.7
          million condominium on her sofa.
          You can do all those things.
          But you do not get to watch my
          fucking TV...!

Hanna lifts it off the table, spilling framed pictures.   A
commercial segues to a quiz show.

                      HANNA
              (continuing; to

          I've never screwed around. I've

          day we met.

                      JUSTINE
          It would have been preferable if
          you had! You made me do this!

                      HANNA
          Right I had Ralph fuck you 'cause
          it makes me feel so good.

                      JUSTINE
          Put down the television. You
          look ridiculous.

          Dr. Prince says I'm trying to
          get your attention. Christ! I
          have to pay someone to figure
          out my life with you.

                      RALPH
          Maybe I should...

                      HANNA

          all the time on the couch.

                      JUSTINE
          And what do you do?

                      HANNA
          What do I do? I speak the English
          language. Words. Sentences
          even.

                      JUSTINE
          How admirable: proletarian candor.

                       HANNA
          Thank you.

                      JUSTINE
          Except you don't say a damned

She unplugs the TV. The image Hanna's holding dies.   Hanna

NEIL

continues to the elevators. It says he KNOWS Waingro is a
trap. He knows the LAPD are here. He's come for him
anyway.

smashes the glass and sets off the fire alarm. Immediately
a SIREN SOUNDS. The building's elevators - except Neil's

Painter One looks through the scope. He looks down at the
ninth floor and laughs. Then he looks away and sees
something else:

PAINTER TWO'S POV: ROOM

Waingro goes to a drawer, pulls out a gun and starts towards
the door.

smashes into waingro a second time.

NEIL

reaches around, grabs Waingro by the arm, dislocates his
shoulder, breaks his collarbone and throws him across the
room. Waingro's gun goes flying.

WAINGRO

Neil's   on the ground, his back against the rack. One arm
is in   his lap. The other is flung over the top bar of the
strobe   rack. Neil looks at Hanna and gestures with his
hand.    Hanna takes it. Neil holds on tight.

NEIL

last breath.

                        NEIL
            ...not half bad.

Then Neil's eyes dim.    And he dies.

LONG REAR SHOT: HANNA + NEIL

Neil's head has fallen onto his shoulder. Hanna still
grips his hand and looks down the runway into the west at
the lines of blue runway lights like rivers. The two of
them stay there like that.
