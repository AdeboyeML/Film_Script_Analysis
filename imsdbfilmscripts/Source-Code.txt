          Darkness.
          A SOUND slowly builds: the rhythmic rocking of a TRAIN'S
          WHEELS over RAILROAD TRACKS...

          INT. HIGH SPEED TRAIN - MORNING

          COLTER jolts awake. Sunlight hits his face.
          He blinks. A stunned beat. He's disoriented.
          Slowly he turns his head to one side...
          PASSENGERS. Filling most of the seats. Office workers on
          their morning commute into a city.
          Turning the other way, he's confronted with a window. Trees
          flash by, splitting the rising sunlight into a hypnotic
          strobe pattern.
          Colter looks to be thirty years old. A military buzz cut. A
          disciplined physique, lean and spare, almost gaunt. Skin
          burnished by years of desert sandstorms and equatorial sun.
          His expression, prematurely aged by combat, is perpetually
          wary, sometimes predatory, accustomed to trouble.
          Despite his military bearing, Colter wears a button down
          shirt and navy sports coat. On his wrist is a digital watch.
          It reads 7:40 a.m.
          He swallows. A strange, creeping panic.
          He has no idea where he is.

          EXT. NEW JERSEY COUNTRYSIDE - MORNING

          The train hurls straight at us.
          NEW ANGLE -- Skimming alongside as the train twists and
          turns, sucking up track -- feet, yards, miles of it.
          Beneath it, the curving rails, which the rushing train barely
          seems to touch. They vibrate with an eerie, dulcimer HUM.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Colter hasn't moved. By his side he sees a canvas MESSENGER
          BAG. Is that his?
          Tentatively, he lifts the edge of the bag to look inside. A
          red APPLE rolls against two LIBRARY BOOKS. The bag's leather
          NAME TAG reads: "SEAN FENTRESS."
          It's not coming back to him. This whole experience is
          starting to freak him out.
          He catches the scent of something. A passenger walks by with
          a STEAMING CUP OF COFFEE.
          CHK-THOCK! Two rows back, an OVERWEIGHT MAN opens a can of
          soda.
          Sitting opposite Colter, facing him, is a WOMAN in her late
          twenties (CHRISTINA). In contrast to the corporate suits
          around her, her appearance is thrift store funky: black nail
          polish, dark lipstick, black hair with blue streaks, a button-
          down blouse edged in black funeral lace with silver skull-and-
          bones cufflinks. She's busy writing in a journal.

                         COLTER
          Ma'am?
          Nothing.

                         COLTER
          Excuse me... ma'am?
          She looks up. Blank stare.

                         COLTER
          What is this?

                         CHRISTINA
          What's what?

                         CHRISTINA
          (looks out the window)
          Almost at Newark.
          Goes back to her journal.

                         COLTER

          It's more of a hell hole.
          But Colter still doesn't understand. He gets up. Nausea
          slams into him. He hangs on to the seat.

                         COLTER
          Woah.

                         (BEAT)
          I think I'm going to puke.

                         CHRISTINA
          (gestures, alarmed)
          Okay, bathroom's that way.
          Colter looks down the aisle, hesitating.

                         CHRISTINA
          Go. Seriously.
          Colter eases himself into the aisle. Totters down the length
          of the car until he finds the RESTROOM.
          The door is LOCKED. The latch reads "OCCUPIED."
          Bracing himself, he lurches forward into...

          INT. TRAIN - SECOND CAR - MORNING

          He freezes. It's a mirror image of the first car. But no,
          the passengers are different.
          Beside him there's a small door. Thinking it's the bathroom,
          he instead opens it to find a CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT. A
          cramped office with chairs and surveillance monitors.

                         CONDUCTOR
          Ticket?
          A heavy-set CONDUCTOR stands in the aisle. A jangling of
          keys. Colter just stares at him. Dazed.

                         CONDUCTOR
          May I see your ticket?
          The last thing on his mind. Bewildered, he searches his
          pockets.

                         COLTER
          I don't think I...

          He pulls out a citation pad.

                         COLTER
          Is this...?
          From inside his sports coat he pulls out a TRAIN TICKET. The
          conductor snips his ticket and brushes past.

                         COLTER
          Wait a sec. I'm a little out of it
          here. Where's this train headed?

                         CONDUCTOR
          New York. Penn Station.

                         COLTER
          New York?
          Why would he be going to New York? How can this be
          happening? Fear starts to grip him as the hallucination
          simply continues.

                         COLTER
          Do you know where I got on?
          The conductor examines his ticket again.

                         CONDUCTOR
          Princeton Junction.

                         COLTER
          Where's that?

                         CONDUCTOR
          "Bout ten minutes back.

                         COLTER
          But I've never been to Princeton
          Junction. See... I don't remember
          waking up or buying a ticket or
          getting on the train or anything
          else. It's just a blank.

                         CONDUCTOR
          Lucky you.
          The jaded conductor moves on. Colter is alone with his
          confusion. Takes a deep breath. The nausea has eased
          slightly.

          out.

          INT. TRAIN - FIRST CAR - MORNING

          Entering the first car again. The rows of passengers. Must
          be at least forty people.
          As he walks back up the aisle, he looks from face to face:
          A pale COMPUTER ENGINEER reviews some documents.
          A forty-something SECRETARY does a crossword puzzle.
          DEREK, a stock broker type, talks on his cell phone:

                         DEREK
          Trust me, by one o'clock, the
          bridge is going to be jammed...
          A COLLEGE STUDENT, slumped against a window, eyes shut,
          listens to an MP-3 player.
          An OLD MAN with a faded wool suit clutches a cane.
          A BACKPACKER, female, European, 20s, hiking boots, examines a
          guidebook.
          A dowdy OFFICER MANAGER type sorts supermarket coupons into a
          tabbed file box.
          An African American EXECUTIVE reads a newspaper.
          None of them pays any attention to Colter.
          A WHOOSH of AIR -- he turns to
          An AIR-CONDITIONING VENT. The HISS of AIR sound sinister.
          Like the exhalations of a creature.
          A SCRAPE. He looks to see
          A woman FILING HER NAILS.
          Colter cringes. Every detail, every sensory impression seems
          heightened, near the point of overload.
          He reaches Christina again. Eases back in the seat across
          from her. She writes in her journal, ignoring him.

          There's something else in his sports coat. A WALLET. He
          turns it over a few times, inspecting it. Pulls out a
          DRIVER'S LICENSE. Another man's face is in the photo. The
          name on the license reads: "SEAN FENTRESS." The same name as
          on the messenger bag. The street address on the license
          reads: "58 Alexander Road, Princeton Junction, New Jersey."

                         COLTER
          Sean Fentress? Who the hell's
          that?
          And why does he have this guy's wallet? He leans forward to
          speak with Christina again.

                         COLTER
          Ma'am?
          She lowers her journal, annoyed. We see she hasn't been
          writing but DRAWING. A well-executed sketch of a face.

                         CHRISTINA
          Why do you keep calling me ma'am?
          How old do you think I am, anyway?

                         COLTER
          I'm having a little problem here.
          I'm trying not to freak out, but I
          think something's happened to me.

                         CHRISTINA
          Like what?

                         COLTER
          Like, total memory loss. Complete.
          I don't know how I got here.

                         CHRISTINA
          So you drank too much last night.
          So did I. Unfortunately, I
          remember the whole thing.

                         COLTER
          That's not it. See... I'm a pilot.
          I fly helicopters in Iraq. I'm in
          the army.
          She waits for more. As if he's telling a joke.

                         COLTER
          I was on a mission. Right before I
          woke up here I was in the middle of
          a mission...

          Boy, you really did drink a lot
          last night.

                         COLTER
          I'm telling you the truth.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Now approaching Newark Station.
          Newark Station, next stop.
          The train begins to SLOW DOWN. A few people begin to get up.
          The platform of Newark Station slides into view.

                         COLTER
          These aren't my clothes. And this
          wallet here...
          He holds up the driver's license. One final attempt to
          convince her.

                         COLTER
          You see this? This isn't me.

                         CHRISTINA
          Of course it is.

                         CHRISTINA
          Take a look in the mirror, good
          sir.
          The mirror? She goes back to her sketchbook. Determined not
          to be interrupted again. Anxiety ripples through Colter.

                         COLTER
          This can't be happening.
          The train lurches to a stop.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Newark Station.
          Colter gets up. Through the windows, a few passengers
          disembark onto the platform: Derek, the Old Man, the College
          Kid and GUZMAN, a Middle Eastern man, who HURRIES past all of
          them towards the station building.

          Colter only half notices all this. He's intent on reaching
          the train's BATHROOM, the door of which is now OPEN.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          All aboard. Doors are closing.
          Christina watches Colter go. Curious.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          This is a New York bound train.
          Next stop, New York - Penn Station.
          The train begins MOVING. Colter reaches the bathroom.

          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING

          A fluorescent light flutters on as Colter shuts the door.
          He's in a tiny space with prefab restroom fixtures in
          stainless steel.
          He SHOUTS in surprise. Recoils backwards. Eyes locked on

                         THE MIRROR
          Staring back is SEAN FENTRESS'S FACE. Not his own.
          He's frozen there. Heart pounding. Seized by cosmic panic.
          He SLAPS himself in the face. Hard.

                         COLTER
          Wake up!
          The restroom rattles and tilts with the motions of the train,
          obliging him to hang on.
          This isn't a dream. At least not one he can wake up from.
          The other guy's face stares back at him. Blinks when he
          blinks.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Warehouses go by in a blur. The train is entering New
          Jersey's industrial zones on the outskirts of New York City.
          From her seat, Christina stares at the messenger bag which
          Colter left behind. Then up at the closed restroom door.

          Colter sits on the closed toilet seat. Head buried in his
          hands. Scared. Desperate for it all to end.

          INT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS

          Christina's holding Colter's messenger bag. She talks
          through the closed door.

                         CHRISTINA
          You left your bag on the seat.
          Which is a flagrant violation of
          rail security, leaving a suspicious
          package behind and all that. I
          probably saved you a huge fine.
          No answer.

                         CHRISTINA
          I'll just leave it right out here
          for you.
          She places the bag beside the door. She hesitates at the
          door. The oddness of this situation.

          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Colter stares into the mirror at the stranger's face.

          Christina's walking back down the aisle.
          The car rocks to one side as an EXPRESS TRAIN flashes by on
          the opposite tracks, going the other way. A blur and a
          whoosh, and it's gone.

          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING

          On the verge of opening the door, Colter hears a METALLIC
          RATTLING. Two SCREWS are rattling around in the sink.
          Colter picks up a screw. Turns it over and over in his hand.
          What are they doing in the sink?
          He looks UP.
          An overhead VENTILATION PANEL has been PRIED OPEN. Above it

          Colter looks up into the crawl space. Can't quite see the

          Moving carefully in the tiny space, he stands up on the
          toilet. Grabbing onto the ventilation panel, he WRENCHES IT
          all the way open. Then PULLS himself uncomfortably upward.
          On tip-toes, he looks into crawl space and discovers

          It's an enormous device. Several large CANNISTERS tied

          Fuel lines explode in the other cars in a horrendous chain
          reaction. The fire is spectacularly bright, lighting up the
          windows of the rowhouse apartments facing the tracks.
          Nearby TREES INCINERATE, mere matchsticks amid sheets of
          flames.
          On the rowhouses, a ALUMINUM DOOR MOLDINGS begin to MELT in
          the intense heat.
          One of the FREIGHT CARS, loaded down with coal, shuddering
          from the blast, wobbles a few yards then PITCHES OVER --
          ROLLING off the rails, tipping right off the elevated
          tracks...
          It FALLS through the air and SMASHES into the middle of an
          traffic intersection below with a shattering force.
          The cascade of EXPLOSIONS continues. Large portions of BOTH
          TRAINS are ANNIHILATED, while the heat reduces the heavy-
          gauge steel rails back to elemental, molten ore.

          The Screech-Owl song can be seen as
          a progression of musical notes.
          Did the notes go up, down or remain
          at the same pitch?

                         COLTER
          I don't know. Just tell me --

          How many times was the bird call
          repeated?

          What does this have to do with the

          Twice.

          Incorrect. Who bombed the train,
          Captain?

                         COLTER
          I don't know who bombed the train!
          Colter is seething now. Had it with these games.

                         GOODWIN
          You have seventeen minutes. Use
          them. Find the bomber.

          COLTER (V.O.)
          Hey. What's happening?
          The HUM of machinery starting up.

          COLTER (V.O.)
          Goddamn it, Goodwin, what is all
          this?
          The machinery HUM changes modulation. Then gives way to a
          GENTLE ROCKING SENSATION. Tha-thunk. Tha-thunk. Tha-thunk.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Colter opens his eyes...
          SUNLIGHT hits his face. In flickering patterns. He turns to

                         LOOK OUT

          A TRAIN WINDOW
          At the passing woodland scenery.
          He's back on the train. Back in the same navy sports coat.
          Across from him, Christina is at work on her sketch pad.
          Just like before. Other commuters all around him.
          Everything is exactly the same as before.
          Note: The remaining story will follow this "binary pattern."
          Scenes will take place either on the train or in the capsule.
          Compared to tomb-like isolation chamber he just came from,
          the train is exploding with sensory input -- the smell of
          steaming coffee, the cramped proximity of other passengers,
          the crinkle of an freshly-ironed dress shirt, the glint of a
          buckle on a purse, the slanting sunlight, the trees out the
          window, bursting with summer leaves.
          Almost unintentionally, Colter finds himself repeating the
          same opening actions as last time -- checking his watch (7:40
          a.m.)... turning at the scent of passing coffee... peeking in
          the canvas messenger bag beside him...
          This time, however, he takes the books out of the messenger
          bag. The books are stamped "NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY."
          He also takes out the APPLE. Sniffs it. Takes a bit. It's
          good. No, it's awesome. Crisp and delicious.

          Is Goodwin watching him from somewhere?
          Not knowing what else to do, he takes a few more bites.
          Enjoying this small pleasure.
          He reaches in his sports jacket pocket and pulls out his

          TRAIN TICKET.
          CLOSE ON -- THE TICKET. It hasn't been punched yet.
          CHK-THOCK! The Overweight Man opens his can of soda. Just
          as before.

                         COLTER
          It's a goddamn simulation.
          Christina's pen stops sketching. She glances up.

                         COLTER
          A three dimensional, completely
          immersive scenario. Touch, taste,
          sound, sight and smell.
          A measure of relief. A way to think about all this.

                         CHRISTINA
          Are you talking to me?

                         COLTER
          Complete with pretty girl.

                         CHRISTINA
          Pretty girl.

                         COLTER
          Every combat simulator has one. In
          the middle of a fire fight a pop-up
          window starts playing a porno.

                         (CONFIDENT NOW)
          You're an unusual choice for a
          distraction.

                         CHRISTINA
          And you're a moron.
          Disregarding her, Colter gets up. Pursuing a new line of
          action. The only way he can make sense of this. He starts
          walking up the rows.

                         COLTER
          Find the bomber. Find the bomber.
          The conductor approaches him.

          Expecting this now, Colter hands over his ticket to be
          punched.

                         COLTER
          Everything okay today, chief?

                         CONDUCTOR
          Say what?

                         COLTER
          Anything out of the ordinary?
          The conductor frowns at him. Who is this guy?

                         CONDUCTOR
          Please take a seat, sir.
          Colter moves on. He looks for suspects. We've seen the
          faces before -- the Computer Engineer, the Secretary, the
          Stock Broker, the Backpacker and so on.
          All seems normal. He finds himself focusing on a jumble of
          unfiltered details -- Suits. Ties. Shoes. Skirts.
          Watches. Newspapers. Coffee cups. Litter.
          Sudden dizziness. He grabs a seatback for support. Sensory
          details slam into him. We go EXTREMELY CLOSE ON:
          The STITCHING on a leather purse.
          A FOUNTAIN PEN rattling in a fold-out tray.
          AIR CONDITIONING hissing from a vent.
          A CRUMPLING SOUND as the Overweight Man crushes an empty soda
          can.
          TAP, TAP, TAP -- the Computer Engineer tapping his foot on
          the floor. Faster and faster.
          Derek, the Wall Street Type, talks on his phone:

                         DEREK
          Trust me, by one o'clock, the
          bridge is going to be jammed...

          The restroom door swings open. GUZMAN, the Middle Eastern
          man, emerges. After a furtive glance around, he quickly
          takes a seat.
          Now Colter makes the connection. The bomb in the restroom.
          The Middle Eastern man emerging from the same restroom.
          Colter starts down the long aisle.
          In his seat, Guzman slips on dark glasses. He looks
          forbidding with his mustache and olive-colored skin.

                         COLTER
          How's it going?
          Colter stands in front of him, arms crossed. Behind his dark
          glasses, Guzman ignores him, but he's visibly uncomfortable.

                         COLTER
          What's your name?
          Guzman is stock still. Beads of sweat on his forehead. The
          conductor appears, accosting Colter.

                         CONDUCTOR
          Didn't I tell you to take a seat?

                         COLTER
          Goodwin? Where are you? It's
          over. I found him.
          Appealing to Goodwin's invisible presence. But nothing
          happens.

                         CONDUCTOR
          Who are you talking to?
          An edgy silence. Other passengers looking over. Colter's
          about to retort, about to accuse Guzman, when he stops.
          It's too easy.
          Colter senses the uproar he's about to create. Which just
          might be a mistake. He reconsiders.

                         COLTER
          Sorry. This guy seemed a little...
          anxious. I was worried about him.

                         GUZMAN

                         (THICK ACCENT)

          You feeling all right, sir?
          With a pained smile, Guzman loosens his collar.

                         GUZMAN
          Motion sickness, I'm afraid. I
          believe I will get off at the next
          stop.

                         CONDUCTOR
          Very well.
          The conductor turns back to Colter.

                         COLTER
          Okay. I'm sitting down.
          Turning away, he finds a seat. He studies Guzman out of the
          corner of his eye.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Now approaching Newark Station.
          Newark Station, next stop.
          The train begins to slow down.
          Several rows up, he sees Christina. She looks back at him
          with distaste.
          A small number of passengers get up, among them the College
          Student. He catches Colter's attention as he picks up a
          WALLET from a seat and catches up with Derek, the Stock
          Broker, who's about to get off the train.

                         COLLEGE STUDENT
          Hey, you dropped this.

                         DEREK

          Wow. Thanks.
          The College Student waits to get off. Colter now eyes him
          closely.
          As the train pulls to a stop, Guzman forcefully pushes
          forward towards the doors, moving with a barely contained
          urgency.

          The doors slide open.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Newark Station.
          The Old Man, Derek and the College Kid get off. Guzman
          hurries past them towards the station house.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          All aboard. Doors are closing.
          Just before the doors close, Colter steps out onto the
          platform. Eyes locked on Guzman -- who disappears inside the
          station house.
          The train PULLS OFF, leaving Colter behind. Did he make the
          right move?
          As he goes to pursue Guzman, Colter is struck by more sensory

                         IMPRESSIONS:
          The STATION CLOCK. Its digital numerals flash 7:50 a.m.,
          hurting Colter's eyes with their brightness.
          The dying HISS of the rails as the train recedes down the
          track.
          The super-sharp glint of a PENNY embedded down in the gravel
          of the tracks.
          The melancholy SIGH of trees in the wind.
          Pushing it all aside, he hurries after Guzman.

          INT. NEWARK STATION HOUSE - MORNING

          Entering, Colter stops. There's no sign of Guzman. Just an
          empty marble lobby. A lone CLERK restocks timetable
          brochures at a display.

          (not looking up)
          Lots of guys come through here.
          Windows look out over the station's parking lot. There's no
          sign of Guzman out there.

                         COLTER
          He was just here. A Middle Eastern-
          looking guy.
          Through the platform doors comes Derek, followed by the
          College Kid. Derek heads for the parking lot, while the
          College Kid mills around the newspaper stand.
          A muffled COUGH.
          Colter spins. Sees a door marked "MEN'S ROOM."

          INT. NEWARK STATION - MEN'S ROOM - MORNING

          Pushing open the door, Colter discovers a row of 1930's-era
          sinks and stalls. An intercom crackles to life:

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          The train to Philadelphia will be
          four minutes late... The train to
          Philadelphia will be four minutes
          late...
          Colter's footsteps echo down the length of the deserted men's
          room. The last stall door is SHUT.
          From within the closed stall, comes the sound of VOMITING.
          Colter edges closer.
          A toilet FLUSHES. Guzman emerges from the stall. Looks
          awful. Freezes when he sees Colter.

                         COLTER
          All better now?
          Guzman's face hardens. He goes to the sink to wash his
          hands.

                         COLTER
          Don't much care for trains myself.

          The bathroom mirror, of course, reflects back Sean Fentress's
          face, not Colter's. Guzman does not seem to notice this
          disparity. He picks up his briefcase and briskly walks out.
          Colter takes an uneasy look at Fentress looking back at him
          in the mirror, then follows Guzman out.

          INT. NEWARK STATION - MORNING

          Colter emerges in the lobby. Guzman is nearby. A bit
          indecisive. Colter wanders over to the newspaper stand.
          The STATION CLOCK reads 7:54 a.m.
          Colter looks down at HIS WATCH: THREE MINUTES remaining.
          What will Guzman do?
          Guzman glances over at Colter, then heads through the doors
          and back out on the train platform.

          EXT. NEWARK STATION - MORNING

          Guzman sits on a bench. Colter stops nearby him.

          The tracks begin to VIBRATE. In the distance comes the HORN
          of an EXPRESS TRAIN approaching.

          Open your briefcase. Prove to me

          I will prove nothing to you. Leave
          me alone.
          WHAM! Colter PUNCHES Guzman with tremendous force, sending
          Guzman sprawling to the ground.
          Colter's hand throbs from the force of the punch. The
          simulation's reality stuns Colter all over again.
          Crouching down, Colter pops open Guzman's briefcase. Inside
          is a corporate IDENTIFICATION BADGE with Guzman's name and
          photograph on it. The company is Shell Oil.

          Guzman groans in pain. Colter rifles through his briefcase.

          Where the hell's your phone?
          Another look at HIS WATCH -- 20 SECONDS.
          Grabbing Guzman, Colter goes through his suit pockets. He
          triumphantly pulls out GUZMAN'S CELL PHONE and steps back.
          Guzman looks up at him, eyes moist with humiliation and
          malice.

          A distant THUD rattles the station windows. Colter pivots,

          Closing in on the station.
          The second thing he sees, far beyond it, miles further down
          the tracks, is the RISING PLUME of a HUGE EXPLOSION.
          Colter looks back at Guzman in shock. Then down at Guzman's
          cell phone. Which has remained off.

          THE ARRIVING EXPRESS TRAIN
          With a cry of rage Guzman SPRINGS UP and PUSHES COLTER INTO
          THE PATH OF THE ON-COMING EXPRESS TRAIN -- with a blast of
          its horn, THE TRAIN RUNS HIM OVER.
          Everything stops.
          Like film celluloid catching fire in a projector, the world
          itself BLISTERS AND BURNS INTO SEARING WHITE... into
          smothering, forgetful SILENCE...
          For exactly 2/3 of a second (1/3 of a second longer than
          before), the same flickering after-image appears:

          THIN LINES -- RADIATING OUTWARD --

          The SOUND of MACHINERY STRAINING. Colter is SLAMMED back

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Stabilize. Lower your pulse.
          Colter opens his eyes. He's back in his military flight
          suit.
          The craft goes still. Cautiously, he releases his hands from
          their grip on the seat restraints. He looks like he's
          sweated off five pounds.

          I didn't find the bomber. You
          fooled me with the Middle Eastern
          guy. I went for the diversion.

          functional. Ice crystals have formed over the circuitry.
          Colter hugs himself, shivering. His breath is visible in the
          capsule's tomb-like cold.

                         COLTER
          Goodwin? What's happening? Come
          in. Can you read me? It's goddamn
          cold in here.
          He hits a few buttons. Almost at random. The VENTS which
          had been blowing in air FALL SILENT.

                         COLTER
          Goodwin, I'm losing oxygen.
          The monitor fizzles out. The light from the controls FADES.

                         COLTER
          Goodwin!
          It's now COMPLETELY DARK.
          He BANGS on the side of the capsule. Just a muffled thump.
          A terrifying silence.
          The SNAP of a harness releasing. A THUD as Colter falls to
          the floor of the capsule. Cursing. Some sounds of thrashing
          around. Then...
          The SPARK of a BLUE FLARE illuminates Colter's face. He's
          activated a miniature signal light on his flight suit. It
          begins to BLINK. Like a beacon for downed pilots afloat in
          the sea. It is the only light in the otherwise dead capsule.
          Up on his knees, he grasps the release handles of the EXIT
          HATCH. Using all his strength he TURNS...
          But the handles don't budge. The hatch remains sealed.
          He gets to his feet. Can't stand up fully. The capsule is
          incredibly cramped.
          Rifling through a cabinet, he discovers OPERATIONAL MANUALS
          in small, almost illegible type. And a small set of TOOLS.
          He spreads them out on the tiny ledge. Taking a wrench, he
          BANGS on the escape hatch. A deep, clanging ECHO in the
          hull.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.
          So, like any pilot would, he sets about repairing his craft.
          At first he puzzles over the electronics and circuitry.
          Daunted by the complexity.
          There's no time to lose. Using a miniature screw driver, he
          begins unscrewing the monitor panel. His fingers are slow
          and clumsy in the frigid cold and the screw driver slips out
          of his hands.

                         LATER
          Icicles have appeared over dormant air vents. Colter, ice
          crystals in his hair, is shivering more violently. Much of
          the capsule's electronics lay open and exposed.
          Using copper wires, he's attempting to revive a row of
          BATTERIES. They spark once... twice... Nothing.

                         COLTER
          Come on!
          Another SPARK. It shocks him. There's a puff of blue smoke.
          He's burned his fingers.
          But the battery now has a tiny BLINKING GREEN LIGHT.
          Working fast, Colter attaches the copper wires to the leads
          on the battery. From inside the engines comes a faint
          electric HUM.
          FFFT. The monitor awakens. Like a film projector it throws
          the image of a PLAYING CARD onto the opposite side of the
          craft.
          Colter begins replacing the monitor components. As he does,
          a pre-recorded AUDIO FILE comes on:

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          -- four principle dialects of
          Arabic: Egyptian, Gulf, Syrian-
          Lebanese and North African. We
          will now play you portions of each,
          discussing the audible differences
          between them.
          CLIPS of SPOKEN ARABIC begin to play.
          Colter continues reconstituting the computer. The monitor
          fills with scrolling lines of COMPUTER CODE.
          With an oddly low-tech CLANG, the heart of the machine
          reawakens. The air vents come back to life. Heat starts to
          return. The icicles begin to DRIP.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.
          Colter sits back in his seat, exhausted from the work.
          The monitor switches to a real-time view of the LAB.
          Goodwin's chair is there, but Goodwin is not in sight. In a
          background distorted by the FISH-EYE LENS, various
          technicians wander by.

                         COLTER
          Hello? Anyone out there? It's me.
          He toggles an audio jack. Then a MAN comes walking up.
          Frowns into the camera, as if through the foggy lens of
          another world.
          It's the MAN WITH THE PIPE. The elusive Bohemian scientist
          whom Colter glimpsed once before. He will be known as

          RUTLEDGE.

                         COLTER
          Can you hear me?
          Rutledge is tinkering with the camera. The image shakes for
          a moment as he adjusts it. Then puts on a headset.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Project designer initiating
          sequence and drives check.

                         COLTER
          I'm here! I'm okay!
          Rutledge checks his headset. Not sure he heard right.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Is someone there?

                         COLTER
          Yeah. It's me. Colter.
          Rutledge blinks in surprise. The blue eyes sparkling.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Wow! It's you.

                         COLTER
          The capsule lost power. It's still
          pretty cold in here.

                         RUTLEDGE
          We've been working towards you from
          the other side. Nice to have you

                         RUTLEDGE
          The name's Rutledge.

                         COLTER
          They wouldn't let me talk to you
          before.

                         RUTLEDGE
          No, I guess not. They're pretty
          anal around here.
          (lights his pipe)
          Don't tell them you saw me smoking
          in here, okay?
          His genial eccentricity is completely at odds with the
          military environment. And then it occurs to Colter:

                         COLTER
          You're the inventor of this thing.

                         RUTLEDGE

                         (SHRUGS)
          I prefer the term project designer.
          And sorry for all the secrecy.
          Goodwin will be thrilled you re-
          established contact.

                         COLTER
          I don't want to deal with Goodwin
          anymore.

                         RUTLEDGE
          What?

                         COLTER
          Don't you understand? He's
          torturing me. I'm helpless. Can't
          you get me out of here?
          Rutledge looks uneasy. As a scientist, he's ill-equipped to
          deal with personnel issues.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Why would Goodwin have it in for
          you?

                         COLTER
          He's a remote operator. And remote
          operators are risk averse pussies
          who sit at control screens in the
          rear while actual pilots like me
          put their asses on the line in the
          field.

                         RUTLEDGE
          He seems pretty devoted to the
          mission.

                         COLTER
          And just what kind of mission is
          this? Talk to me, man. Why won't
          he let me save those people on the
          train?

                         RUTLEDGE
          Because they can't be saved.

                         COLTER
          Why not? I know what's going to
          happen. I could take apart the
          bomb. Stop the train.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Yeah but you'd be doing it in the
          Source Code, not here. Not in our
          own past.
          Mystery upon mystery.

                         COLTER
          What's the difference?

                         RUTLEDGE
          I'm not sure I should be telling
          you this.

                         COLTER
          Telling me what?
          Coaxing the scientist in him.

                         RUTLEDGE
          It's quantum physics. Linear
          algebra. Parabolic calculus. It
          would take weeks to explain.

                         COLTER
          Is Source Code time travel?

          Rutledge sighs. Looks at his pipe.

                         RUTLEDGE
          It's gone out again.

                         COLTER
          Why can't I save those people on
          the train?

                         RUTLEDGE
          Think of it like this: events in
          our past can never be undone.
          Einstein proved that.

                         COLTER
          So...

                         RUTLEDGE
          So Source Code opens up another
          past for you. A parallel past. It
          looks the same but it has no
          intersection with our own world.
          In essence, by sending you back, an
          entirely new but utterly parallel
          world is created. It looks
          identical to ours, but nothing you
          do there has any effect on this
          reality.
          At last some useful information. Colter races to process it.

                         COLTER
          What happens to the Source Code
          world after I leave it?

                         RUTLEDGE
          I don't know. You can never know
          that because you're not there to
          observe it. Maybe it vanishes.
          Maybe not.

                         (UNEASY)
          I should tell them you're okay.

          Lower your pulse. The situation

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          The rich smell of steaming coffee. The glint of a polished
          leather shoe. The crisp click of someone uncapping a
          fountain pen. The scenery rushing by -- the blur of trees,
          the soft lavender of the morning sky. The swell and pull of
          the mighty machine coursing over the rails.
          If a train ride could ever be a sensory delight, this is it.
          To Colter, every sensation has become even more pronounced,
          more intensely real than ever.
          CLOSE ON - HIS WATCH - A beep as he sets it to countdown

          Don't you have people you can go to
          for help? Friends, family?
          The train begins to move again.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          This is a New York bound train.
          Next stop, New York - Penn Station.

                         COLTER
          Most of my friends are in the
          military. My dad runs a melon farm
          in Alabama.

                         CHRISTINA
          Maybe now's the time to reach out
          to him.
          She hands him her cell phone. Colter just holds it in his
          hand.

                         COLTER
          Me and my dad, we don't see eye to
          eye. We're just two different
          people.

                         CHRISTINA
          As opposed to being the exact same
          person?

                         COLTER
          Are you always this sarcastic?

                         CHRISTINA
          This is so not about me.
          Colter reluctantly dials. As it rings --

                         COLTER
          What day is it?

                         CHRISTINA

          June?
          One more thing to puzzle him.
          The call connects. An OLDER MAN, DONALD STEVENS, answers.
          The gravelly voice of a Midwestern farmer.

          DONALD (V.O.)
          Hello?

                         COLTER
          Dad?
          Donald doesn't respond.

                         COLTER
          Dad, it's me. It's Colter.
          Again, silence.

                         COLTER
          Been a while, huh? I'd been
          meaning to call you, but --
          Click. The line goes dead. Colter looks at Christina.

                         COLTER
          He wanted me to stay on and take
          over the farm but... I had other
          ideas.

                         CHRISTINA
          You're intimidated by him.

                         COLTER
          What?

                         CHRISTINA
          You're scared of him. I can see
          it.

                         COLTER
          The hell I am.
          Challenged, he redials. Braced for conflict. The call
          connects.

                         COLTER
          Dad, don't hang up. We're going to
          talk. I need your help.

          Now you listen to me. Whoever you
          are, never call here again.
          Donald hangs up.

                         CHRISTINA
          He's still mad at you, huh?

                         COLTER
          No... it was like he didn't even
          know who I was.
          Troubled, he hands back her phone. Outside, the EXPRESS
          TRAIN flashes by.

                         CHRISTINA
          I don't know how to help you.
          She feels bad for him. And something inside Colter closes.
          Retreating inside himself.

                         COLTER
          Sorry to have bothered you.
          He gets up to go. Christina stays where she is.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Back in his seat. Lost in the view out the window. The
          neighborhoods have given way to Newark's industrial fringe.
          Bringing him closer to the inevitable end.

          CHRISTINA (V.O.)
          I have a friend.
          Surprised, he turns to find her there.

                         CHRISTINA
          She works at the New York Times.
          Her name's Stephanie. She's just a
          proofreader, but she wants to be
          made a reporter. She's always
          saying she needs a good story to
          bring in so she gets noticed.
          Something like this, with a crazy
          paranoid angle could really
          interest her.

                         COLTER

          She's already quite suspicious of
          the government.
          Christina's dialing her phone. Colter turns back to the
          window.

                         CHRISTINA
          I'm getting voice mail.
          (into the phone)
          Steph, it's Christina. You know
          that story you're always looking to
          write? I might just have something
          for you. I met a guy. His name is
          Colter Stevens. He says he's in
          the army. He flies helicopters in
          Iraq, but now they've put him into
          a secret project called Source
          Code. Maybe you can look into it a
          bit, okay? Call me.
          She hangs up. Pleased with herself.

                         CHRISTINA
          She'll call back. Just wait.
          None of it will do Colter any good, but he manages a smile.

                         COLTER
          Thank you, ma'am.

          Twenty five?
          She smiles, pleased.

          How can I help you if you don't
          tell me everything about this?

          INT. TRAIN BATHROOM - MORNING

          Colter enters the tiny space. Christina is reluctant to
          follow him into the bathroom.

                         COLTER
          You said you wanted to know.

                         CHRISTINA
          Can't you just tell me?
          He gives her an imploring look. She sighs and squeezes in
          next to him.

                         CHRISTINA
          Try anything and I'll kill you.

                         COLTER
          Shut the door.
          As she shuts the door, Colter gets up on the sink.

                         CHRISTINA
          What are you doing?
          He wrenches back the ventilation panel, then steps aside.

                         COLTER
          It's up here.
          He holds out his hand. She grabs hold and steps up on the
          sink. She's not quite tall enough to see into the
          crawlspace, so he steps up behind her and lifts her the rest
          of the way.

                         CHRISTINA

          Her blouse brushes his face as he holds her up. A long beat
          as she looks inside the overhead space at the bomb.

          Acetone Peroxide. It's a liquid
          explosive. There's fourteen
          cannisters of it. Simple
          detonator. Cell phone signal
          closes the circuit and boom.
          He lowers her. An incredulous beat.

          Did you put this here?

                         COLTER
          No. It was someone else. They
          don't know who. That's why I'm
          here. To find out.
          Watching her. Will she believe him?

                         CHRISTINA
          We have to tell someone. We have
          to stop this.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          The bathroom door opens and Christina walks quickly away.
          Mounting fear. Colter falls into step behind her.

                         COLTER
          It won't matter. The train's
          already...

          Already what?

          crazy, but it's true. I've been
          sent from the future -- from five
          hours in the future. This train's
          already been blown up.
          She backs up. Scared of him. Every right to be.

                         COLTER
          You wanted to know. Now you know.

          Colter catches up with her inside the exit vestibule. She's
          stabbing at the door release button.

                         CHRISTINA
          Why won't it open?!
          Her phone is RINGS. They both stop. She looks at the

                         CHRISTINA
          Stephanie did a computer search.
          Something in her expression worries him.

                         CHRISTINA
          She's got a database of all
          newspaper articles going back to

          No. But you were. She found you.

                         COLTER
          She found me? What does that mean?
          She stops. Not wanting to go on.
          From outside comes the HORN from the approaching freight
          train.

                         COLTER
          Jesus Christ, Christina, are you
          going to spit it out?
          In his hand, the CELL PHONE RINGS. Colter's eyes light up in
          amazement -- the DISPLAY SCREEN is showing the name and
          number of the bomber. But before he can read what's there,
          Christina's voice finds its way to the back of his brain:

                         CHRISTINA
          According to the notice, you were
          killed in action two months ago.

          doubles over. She runs to him --

          Everything around him PIXELATES into a hundred thousand
          POINTS on an array. Christina's cries become bursts of
          static. Flying behind the array come LINES OF COMPUTER CODE -
          - the Source Code architecture laid bare.
          And then the screen itself seems to melt, giving way to a
          frightening series of HALLUCINATORY FRAGMENTS:

          The smooth, glassy calm of 30,000 feet. The regular

          other wounded packed together. The grumble of another,
          unseen wounded soldier:

          Never any damn leg room on a plane.
          An ALARM begins beeping.

          Then, a PLAYING CARD appears, as if through a slide
          projector. The Jack of Clubs.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Captain...?
          The playing card flickers, separates into pixels, then
          dissolves.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Captain, allow me to introduce
          myself. My name is Goodwin.
          You're with Beleaguered Castle.
          You are safe. All your needs will
          be met here.
          Lines of computer code flit across the screen. A blinking
          cursor.

          FADE TO BLACK.
          A tiny APERTURE opens... revealing CHRISTINA. And the
          bicycle. And the stone wall. The strange, recurring vision.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Captain?
          The sound drives away the image, replacing it with

          THE JACK OF CLUBS

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Captain, just tell me what you see.
          Just look and speak.
          Groggy breathing. A ragged voice:

          COLTER (V.O.)
          I see a card.

          GOODWIN (V.O.)
          Very good. Very, very good.

          INT. ISOLATION UNIT

          On Colter's face. A deep, cold knot in his stomach.
          Shuddering in fear. The truth before him now. Crouching
          there, a nightmare, ruling over him.
          On the MONITOR, Goodwin looks into the camera. Assessing the
          situation.

          Are you comfortable? Are you warm?
          Colter clings to his harness as if to keep from vanishing
          entirely from existence.

                         GOODWIN
          Do you need to urinate?
          Colter swallows. Too terrorized to speak.

                         GOODWIN
          Beleaguered Castle is waiting for
          your report.
          Goodwin taps his pen on his clipboard. Impatient. He flips
          a switch. A blocky COMPUTER VOICE, something out of the
          1970s, comes on:

          COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
          Hearing Test. First sequence.
          Left ear.
          A short SERIES of ELECTRONIC TONES.

          COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
          Hearing Test. First sequence.
          Right ear.
          The tones cease. Colter remains impassive and inert.

                         GOODWIN
          Captain, I know you can hear me.
          Did you find the bomber?
          Goodwin keys in some commands. Forever adjusting.

          COMPUTER VOICE (V.O.)
          Memory Thread One: "When Lily woke,
          she had the bed to herself. She
          sat up, bewildered by the
          strangeness of her surroundings;
          then memory returned, and she
          looked about her with a shiver."
          Goodwin stops the audio.

                         GOODWIN
          As you're collecting your thoughts,
          I should tell you there's been
          another development. A terrorist
          group has taken responsibility for
          bombing the train.

          This began broadcasting over the
          Internet a half hour. We've traced
          it to central Asia.

          ON THE MONITOR
          A grainy VIDEO shows an arid, wind-swept plateau of a far-
          away desert. It is twilight. A MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER, his face
          hidden by a hooded cloak, sits cross legged before a
          flickering camp fire and a tea service.
          The fighter rises, picks up a rocket-propelled grenade
          launcher, and approaches the camera. The wind whips his
          black robes. The figure looks slight. Almost spectral. It
          begins speaking to the camera.

                         MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER

          divine vengeance. God willing, you
          will soon suffer another.
          Colter does not raise his head. No idea whether he's even
          listening.

                         MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTER
          These attacks will show you that
          you will never be safe. You can
          secure your borders. But what can
          you do against one of your own
          citizens? One who looks like you,
          who is blameless, living already
          among you, who takes eighty million
          of our dollars, a trifle, and
          carries out our bidding? You
          cannot stop this. Time has run
          out.
          The image freezes. Then switches back to the live feed of
          Goodwin.

                         COLTER

          further discussion. Perhaps at a
          later date.

                         COLTER
          Will you let me out of here?
          Goodwin ignore the question. Continues making notations.

                         GOODWIN
          Frankly, Captain, we're
          disappointed.

                         COLTER
          Find Rutledge! Now!

                         GOODWIN
          I have to say that we expected more
          from you.

                         COLTER
          Stop! Stop reading from your
          goddamn script!

                         GOODWIN
          Perhaps we overestimated your
          abilities.

                         COLTER
          I swear to fucking Christ!

                         GOODWIN
          Please accept the criticism in the
          spirit it was given. Perhaps a few
          memory exercises would help.

                         COLTER
          I don't need your criticism and I
          don't need your memory exercises,
          you gutless freak. And by the way,
          that bomb is detonated by a cell
          phone. When activated, the phone's
          display screen displays caller ID
          information. Caller ID. I wonder
          if that information would be useful
          to Beleaguered Castle.
          For a split second, Goodwin looks thrown. But the mask of
          the cold clinician goes back up.

          information.

                         COLTER
          You'll have to send me back. I
          didn't get a good look at it. But
          I will next time.
          Goodwin hesitates. Skeptical.

                         GOODWIN
          What assurance do we have you'll be
          able to read the screen before the
          device detonates?

                         COLTER
          Goodwin, there's no time left.
          Send... me... back.
          Goodwin's pale, inscrutable face fills the monitor. His eyes
          are unblinking. Unfeeling. Nothing behind them.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Colter prowls the aisle feverishly. He scans the overhead
          luggage rack. Peeks inside a bag. Doesn't see what he
          wants. He looks all around... up the rows of passengers...
          intently scanning...
          There. The Computer Engineer. He's asleep. But clutched in
          his hand is what Colter wants -- a CELL PHONE.

          CLOSE ON - THE COMPUTER ENGINEER - MOMENTS LATER
          The train jolts slightly, waking him up. Looking down, the
          Computer Engineer notices that his cell phone has vanished.
          Across the aisle, a LATINA OFFICE MANAGER taps him on the
          arm. She gestures down the aisle to

                         COLTER

          People turn to look. Among them is Christina. Colter just

          INT. SECOND CAR - MORNING

          The Computer Engineer hurries in. Colter is nowhere in
          sight. He RUNS down the aisle and towards the next car.
          PAN OVER to the DOOR of the CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT as it

          CLICKS SHUT.

          INT. TRAIN CONDUCTOR'S COMPARTMENT - MORNING

          Breathless, Colter has just finished shutting the door and is
          about to use the cell phone when sees
          THE CONDUCTOR and a TRAIN OFFICIAL
          Looking over at him in surprise.

                         COLTER
          Sorry. Wrong turn.
          Reversing gears, Colter backs out of the compartment.

          INT. SECOND CAR - MORNING

          Just as the befuddled Computer Engineer disappears into the
          third car, Colter steps back into the aisle and walks the
          other way.

          INT. FIRST CAR - MORNING

          Sweating a bit now, Colter is keying in a number on the cell

          the oppression of being back in the capsule. Back in
          Rutledge's power.

          I think so. But there wasn't time
          to read the screen. As soon as it
          rang the bomb went off.

          not to do.

          What in heck's name did you do for
          those seventeen minutes?
          Colter does not answer.
          The machinery again STARTS UP. Colter tenses, bewildered.
          Eyes dart accusingly to the screen.

          Colter GROANS and opens his eyes. Gripped by another terror.
          Returning from yet another trip on the train. Another bomb
          blast. Death and resurrection. Rutledge looks in on him
          with impatience.

          The HUMMING again. He's helpless. An insect on a pin.
          Colter tears at his restraints, ready to bash his brains out
          against the controls. He SCREAMS...

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          The Overweight Man, wide eyed in surprise, has his finger
          poised to open his can of soda.

          Go ahead! Open your fucking soda!
          CHK-THOCK! The Overweight Man complies. Some half-muttered
          reproaches, then most people go back to what they were doing.

                         CHRISTINA
          What's wrong with you, anyway?
          She glares at him at he stands up. He can't respond.
          Despair surges through him. He stumbles off down the aisle.
          But where can he go? There is no freedom. No escape.
          Imprisoned in both worlds.
          From her seat, Christina watches him go. Sensing the torment
          in him.

                         EXIT AREA
          Colter is slumped in a corner. Christina appears. Taps him
          on the shoulder.

                         CHRISTINA
          You okay?
          He eyes her furtively. Like a cave man who's never seen
          another human being before.

          You're not okay.
          He's ghastly pale. He's sweating profusely.

          How do you...?
          A group of passengers approaches the exit area. We've seen
          them all before: Derek, the Old Man, the College Kid. And
          the small encounters: shuffling around, positioning at the
          doors, and the College Kid tapping Derek on the arm, holding
          out Derek's wallet.

          He steps out onto the platform. Holds out his hand for her

          She's incredulous. This guy. His words. This whole moment.

          Instead of going directly to the station house, Derek
          continues walking down the platform alongside the train, as
          if intending to reboard further down.
          And then it happens.
          With a quick motion Derek TOSSES SOMETHING through an open
          door of another car, then heads quickly away towards the
          station house.
          With no time to think, Colter slips back on board just as the
          doors slide shut.

          Did someone pick it up? Colter looks up the aisle and then
          the other way into the next car. No one there.
          Once more he examines the exit area. Gets down on his knees.
          Then he spots it -- an OPENING between the floor and one of
          the wall panels, only a few inches high.
          And there something lies. Colter slides it out.
          Derek's WALLET. Intentionally left here. The same wallet
          the College Kid gave back to Derek earlier.
          Opening it, Colter pulls out Derek's DRIVER'S LICENSE.

          Newark Station, next stop.

          I don't understand.

          STEPHANIE (V.O.)
          Maybe you should get off. Are you
          okay?
          The station platform slides into view.

                         CHRISTINA
          I'm fine. Everything's normal. Is
          there something on the news? Some
          kind of alert?

          STEPHANIE (V.O.)
          Nothing that I've heard.

          EXT. NEWARK PLATFORM - MORNING

          The train pulls to a stop. Passengers begin to get off.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Newark Station.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          Christina is out of her seat, debating.

          STEPHANIE (V.O.)
          I think you should get off.

                         CHRISTINA
          I'll be late for work.

          STEPHANIE (V.O.)
          The hell with work, Christina! You
          hate that job anyway.

                         CHRISTINA
          It's probably a joke. A weirdo guy
          from somewhere.
          She sees Colter down in the exit area. They lock eyes.
          And somehow she knows. He made the call. Colter quickly
          disappears into the other car.

          INT. SECOND CAR - MORNING

          The doors stand open to the platform. Just then Derek's
          WALLET goes skidding back on board, disappearing under the
          wall panel. A second later, Colter reaches the exit area.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          All aboard. Doors are closing.

          EXT. NEWARK PLATFORM - MORNING

          The train doors shut. Colter is now out on the platform.
          Christina is not there. Concerned, walking quickly forward,
          Colter looks through the windows...
          And finds her staring back at him. Still on the train. A
          strange moment between the two of them.
          Once again he's failed to save her.
          They watch each other for as long as possible, until the
          train pulls away.

          INT. TRAIN - MORNING

          As the train SPEEDS UP, Christina sits down again, lowering
          her phone.

          STEPHANIE (V.O.)
          Did you get off...?

                         CHRISTINA
          No. I'll call you back.
          She hangs up. Disturbed. As if she's failed some test.
          But what test? Why this weird feeling?

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          This is a New York bound train.
          Next stop New York - Penn Station.
          The train SPEEDS UP. Anxiety creeps into her face. Looking
          around, the tranquility of the passengers begins to seem
          ominous, hinting that she's made the wrong choice.

                         CONDUCTOR

          The metal door to THE SAFE has been OPENED.

          INT. NEWARK STATION - MORNING

          Inside the quiet lobby, Derek is heading for the outer doors
          to the parking lot, when:

          COLTER (O.S.)
          Derek Frost.
          Colter is walking towards him, holding up Derek's WALLET.

                         COLTER
          You forget something?

                         DEREK
          Gosh. Is that my wallet?
          As he goes to take it, Colter GRABS HIM.

          INT. NEWARK STATION - MEN'S ROOM - MORNING

          Behind the closed door at the end stall comes the sound of

          GUZMAN VOMITING.
          BANG - The men's room DOOR flies open -- Colter DRAGS Derek
          inside.

                         DEREK
          What the hell, man? What the
          hell???

                         COLTER
          You see this?
          Colter pulls out the DETONATOR CELL PHONE -- the one he took
          off the bomb. Holds it inches from Derek's face.

                         COLTER
          Now you can't blow it up.

          What is this? Get away from me!
          The BARREL of a 9 MM PISTOL. Aimed right at him.

                         COLTER
          Believe me, I'm very accurate with
          one of these things.

                         DEREK
          Jesus.
          Derek raises his hands. Sweating. All fright. Like a
          decent man, terrorized.
          It gives Colter pause. Does he have the right guy?
          A toilet FLUSHES. The last stall door opens and Guzman
          emerges. Stops cold as Colter swings the pistol at him.

                         COLTER
          Stay there, my man.

                         DEREK
          Don't hurt me.

                         COLTER
          Stop acting, for Chrissakes.

                         DEREK
          Keep my wallet. Take my watch.
          Take anything you want.
          Unprompted, Guzman takes out his own wallet and sets it on
          the counter. Calmer than Derek. Accustomed to trouble.

                         GUZMAN
          There. Now you have two wallets.
          Take them and go.

                         COLTER
          Shut up!
          Tensing. This isn't supposed to happen like this.

                         DEREK
          Please. I have a family.

                         COLTER
          What about those other passengers?

          Click. Colter pulls back the hammer and savagely JAMS the
          barrel of the pistol into Derek's cheek.

                         COLTER

          Guzman takes a step towards Colter.

                         COLTER
          One more step, asshole.

                         GUZMAN
          Don't treat him like this. He's
          not an animal. Neither are you.

                         DEREK
          Listen to him. For God's sake I'm
          not a terrorist...!
          A URINE STAIN spreads on Derek's pants. He looks down,
          ashamed. Colter keeps the gun on him.

                         COLTER
          Piss all you want. You took eighty
          million dollars to kill hundreds of
          people today.

          put this bullet through your brain.

                         DEREK
          I don't know what you're talking
          about!

                         COLTER
          I'm going to do it.
          Tightening his finger around the trigger. Tears are
          streaming down Derek's face. But he's not going to talk.

                         DEREK
          I would never hurt anyone. I have
          a family. I guess you'll have to
          kill me.
          But Colter can't. He can't shoot him. He lowers the gun.
          Disgusted with himself. Why can't he do it?

                         GUZMAN
          You see? You are a human being.
          Speaking gently. Trying to calm him. Even as Colter feels
          like he's failed.

                         GUZMAN
          This can be worked out. We can
          listen to each other.
          The temperature cooling. Derek's nodding with him.

          The detonator CELL PHONE RINGS, startling all of them.

          My friend had it. From when you
          called her -- to try and get me off
          the train. Who are you? What do
          you want?
          Derek and Guzman cautiously lower their hands. Watching in
          confusion.

                         COLTER
          I was trying to warn you.

          Talk to me. I feel that something

          On the train. Earlier. Derek in his seat, on his cell

          Trust me, by one o'clock, the
          bridge is going to be jammed...

          Colter looks to Derek. His stomach sinks.

          "By one o'clock, the bridge is
          going to be jammed." That's what
          you said. You knew. You knew
          there was going to be an

          across the...
          The realization hits.

          They're going to bomb the bridges.
          While they're full of people.

                         ON DEREK
          A slight flicker travels across Derek's face. Like a
          disturbance on a surface of deep water.

          Christina? Just hang in there.
          You'll be okay.

          What's happening? Are you okay?

          Derek picks up the phone and terminates the call. He coldly
          evaluates the two men dying in pools of blood. Then calmly
          walks out.
          As the life slips from Colter's eyes, he manages to focus on
          his beeping WATCH --
          Where the seventeen minutes have RUN OUT. And the world

          In the haze comes the mystical vision again -- but deeper in:
          THE STONE WALL now curves over our heads, becoming a TUNNEL.
          CHRISTINA walks away from us -- down into the tunnel. The
          far end is ablaze in WHITE LIGHT.
          We try calling to her. But our voice is weak and faint. She
          continues towards the light... and we do not follow.

          A jarring transition. We are now away from Colter's P.O.V.
          and in the real, physical environment of the Source Code
          operations center. Military and civilian personnel work amid
          mysterious scientific equipment.

          Rutledge talks on a wall phone. Like a team player serving
          his country.

                         RUTLEDGE

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Yes... We appreciate that... I just
          hope the information has come in
          time to clear the bridges... Thank
          you, sir.
          When he hangs up, he turns to Goodwin and a few other
          TECHNICIANS. Naked ambition courses through him.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Whether or not they can stop the
          bridge attack, we came up with the
          intelligence. And that virtually
          assures all of our futures. This
          is just the beginning, guys.

                         (TO GOODWIN)
          You did a great job, Goodwin. You
          operated our captain with skill and
          professionalism. What's that you
          have?
          Goodwin opens an envelope and slides out a CITATION.

                         GOODWIN
          The Army investigated Colter's
          helicopter crash in Iraq.
          Apparently he stayed behind to fly
          protective cover for a disabled
          convoy until he ran out of fuel.

                         RUTLEDGE
          What's this, then? Some kind of
          posthumous reprimand for reckless
          flying?

                         GOODWIN
          No. It's the Silver Star.
          Something in Goodwin's voice momentarily checks Rutledge's
          breezy good humor.

                         RUTLEDGE
          Send it on to his father. It'll
          ease the pain of his son's death.

                         GOODWIN
          I thought I might inform the
          captain of the citation.

          Better not. We can't risk
          acquainting him with the citation
          in case the memory wipe isn't
          entirely clean.

                         GOODWIN
          The memory wipe?

                         TECHNICIAN
          I thought we were going to let him
          die.

                         RUTLEDGE
          I know, I know. But now the
          Director of National Intelligence
          is sure to want a closer look at
          our program, and until we train up
          another candidate, we'll need to
          keep Colter around to demonstrate
          it.

                         TECHNICIAN
          Oh.

                         RUTLEDGE
          This thing is much bigger than any
          one of us. Goodwin, please clear
          Colter's memories and re-initialize
          Source Code.
          Rutledge walks away. The technician gives Goodwin a look of
          disgust. Goodwin carefully replaces the citation into the
          envelope.

          INT. CONTROL CONSOLE - DAY

          Mission Control. Panels, consoles and screens. Goodwin
          takes a seat at his workstation. He swings a microphone up
          and goes to flip a switch.
          Then stops. Unsure how to proceed. Looks down at the
          envelope with the citation in it.

          Inside the capsule, the silence continues. Colter thinks to
          himself. The MONITOR then comes on.

          Rutledge walks by himself. Reflecting. Pleased with
          himself. Under his breath, he acknowledges the praises he's
          imagining in his head:

                         RUTLEDGE
          Thank you, sir... I appreciate your
          faith in me... It's a great day for
          our country.

          INT. ISOLATION UNIT

          Colter looks out at Goodwin. A beat of difficult silence.

                         GOODWIN
          How are you feeling? Are you
          comfortable?

                         COLTER
          Just do it.

          Come again?

                         COLTER
          Just do it. I knew they wouldn't
          let me die. At least you can make
          me forget all of this. I hope.
          Goodwin stares at his hands. Unmoving.

                         COLTER
          What are you waiting for? You're
          just doing your job. I'd do the
          same thing if I was you. At least
          you've got a shot at saving those
          people on the bridges.

                         GOODWIN
          I doubt it.

          An unusually personal statement, coming from Goodwin.

                         COLTER
          Look, someone had to be where
          you're sitting, and someone had to
          be in here. Turned out it was you
          and me.

          Just do it. I'm tired.

                         GOODWIN
          Would you like to see Christina
          again? One last time?
          Colter's not sure he heard him right.

                         COLTER
          I don't understand.

                         GOODWIN
          Seventeen minutes. That's all I

          about Source Code. We've kept too
          much from each other.
          An odd sensation comes over Colter.

          I usually report in at 0600. Today
          I was there early. I was there
          when the call came in. Your call.

          How? The Source Code was a
          parallel world! You told me so!
          It's hermetically sealed. Nothing
          I did on that train would have any
          effect on this reality!

          We didn't know if any bleed-

          implications would be staggering.
          That's why you were told to avoid
          unduly influencing events.

          No. Not in our world. The time
          currents are too strong. But minor
          alterations, here and there, a
          phone call, say, those might slip
          through. We didn't know for sure.
          But you proved it.
          Colter is thunderstruck. Unable to grasp it.

                         GOODWIN
          I've been thinking about the things
          you said on that call. As the day
          passed, the more I understood them.

          blazer. The slacks. The commuters, caught up in their
          individual concerns, ignore Colter. But he looks on them
          with an appreciation approaching joy.
          For a moment he just sits there. Simply being alive in this

          Snapping his attention back to

          Colter walks down the aisle. Looks at HIS WATCH -- 12
          minutes, 40 seconds. The train begins to SLOW DOWN.

          ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
          Now approaching Newark Station.
          Newark Station, next stop.
          The Computer Engineer begins to wake up. As he does, Colter
          passes by, deftly slipping the borrowed cell phone back into
          the engineer's hand without being noticed.
          Derek packs up his things. We see him hide his wallet into a
          gap in the seat cushions and get up.

          Hey, you dropped this.

                         DEREK
          Wow. Thanks.
          Keeping his composure, Derek accepts the wallet.
          Colter steps aside, allowing them to pass. Allowing it all
          to happen.
          The station slides into view. No one on the platform.

          Rutledge runs up to a locked door and swipes his access card

          The train comes to a halt. Unlike before, the doors stay
          shut for SEVERAL SECONDS LONGER than usual. Derek waits
          quietly at the doors.
          Finally they open. Derek steps out onto the platform,

          and starts toward the station house. Guzman is ahead of him,
          already pushing open the doors to the station.
          All is quiet. Perhaps too quiet. Derek approaches the

          In station lobby are POLICE OFFICERS.
          Derek's jaw tightens. He changes course, heading instead for
          an outdoor stairwell.
          Coming UP the stairs, however, are more POLICE OFFICERS.
          Wheeling around, Derek heads the other way. Walking faster,
          but keeping his head. Not running, not panicking.
          The train, oddly, is still sitting there.
          As he nears the other end of the platform, MORE OFFICERS
          appear from behind columns, cutting off his escape. The
          police are coming from all sides, converging on the platform.
          Yet no one panics. No one runs. Finally --

          Derek goes to get back on the train. The doors, however,
          SLIDE SHUT in his face. Through the closed doors, Derek
          looks in at Colter, still on the train. They stare at one
          another through the window.

                         POLICE COMMANDER
          Mr. Frost. Please turn to face us.

          Of course. What's this about?
          Unseen by the officers, Derek has taken out his CELL PHONE
          and is DIALING IT as he turns around.
          The police approach, cautiously.

          The restroom door is open and swarming with conductors
          examining the bomb.
          On the platform, the officers tackle Derek, subduing him.
          Passengers watch at the windows, mesmerized.

          exposed brain.

                         (SHRIEKING)
          What are you standing there for?!
          Do it! We can save him!!!
          No one moves. Rutledge rashly grabs for one of the MP's
          rifles.

                         RUTLEDGE
          I guess force is the only thing you
          people understa --

                         MP
          Back away, sir, now!
          The MP has leveled his rifle at Rutledge. Who steps back,
          aghast. His authority has vanished with Colter's life.
          Goodwin shuts off the monitors. Silence fills the room.
          Colter is dead.
          Rutledge stares sorrowfully at Colter's body. Then at
          Goodwin with burning hatred.

                         RUTLEDGE
          You're a murderer.
          Goodwin offers his hands to the MP.

                         GOODWIN
          Go ahead and arrest me.
          But the MP does nothing.

                         GOODWIN
          I'll be around. Whenever you want
          me.
          They part as he walks out of the room. A look of grim
          satisfaction on his face.

          EXT. NEWARK STATION - PARKING LOT - MORNING

          Christina walks past the bicycle parked against the stone
          wall. She's about to enter a TUNNEL that goes under the
          tracks. The same tunnel from Colter's vision.
          She stops. Something tells her to turn around.
          The bench where Colter sat is empty.
          But three feet away... Colter is standing there. Still here.
          Dumbfounded, he looks at his watch -- it remains at ZERO.
          He looks all around. Trees stirring in the breeze. A bird
          flies overhead. The crowd of passengers outside the station.

                         CHRISTINA
          You okay?
          Colter turns to her. How can this be? He's afraid to even
          speak. As if that alone could break the enchantment.
          But the world is here. It goes on. That's all he knows.
          Finally he swallows. Finding his voice.

                         COLTER
          You're right. The least I can do
          is buy you coffee.
          This pleases Christina, although she tries not to show it.

                         CHRISTINA
          Okay, well, come on then.
          Walking forward, he joins her. The two of them disappear
          down the tunnel.
          A beautiful morning.

          FADE OUT.
