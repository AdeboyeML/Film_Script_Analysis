               BEVERLY HILLS STREET - NIGHT

               It is late night, and deserted. Engine noise approaches; 
               headlights appear; as the car draws closer we hear singing.

               It is a Mercedes convertible and as it roars by, the singing -- 
               a sloppy baritone and a giggling soprano -- whooshes by with 
               it.

               We hold as another car approaches. This one is a conservative 
               sedan, whose occupant does not sing.

               INSIDE THE CONVERTIBLE

               The middle-aged driver is in a tuxedo with a rumpled shirt 
               and cocked bow tie. He is flushed, a Rogue forelock bouncing 
               over his forehead, and he merrily sings "Casey Jones" along 
               with the passenger, a young woman in a party dress who 
               squeals, rocks with the motion of the car, and 
               enthusiastically pipes in on the chorus.

               ANOTHER EMPTY STREET

               The convertible makes a hot turn onto the street and 
               approaches with its singing.

               REVERSE

               The car enters and roars away. After a beat of quiet, the 
               conservative sedan enters and recedes.

               BEACH

               We are at the Malibu Guest Quarters Motel. The singing, 
               squealing Mercedes screeches into the lot and rocks to a 
               halt.

               The young woman staggers out still giggling, and holding a 
               half-empty bottle of champagne.

               The man tosses her a key with a large plastic tag.

                                     MAN
                         Number Seven.

               She trots away.

               The man twists his rear-view mirror to look at himself. He 
               straightens his bow tie. He puffs his bounding forelock with 
               one finger, nods his head to make it bounce, grins 
               approvingly, and cocks a pistol-finger at his own reflection.

                                     MAN
                         Zing!

               MOTEL ROOM

               The man enters and looks around. The young woman's dress is 
               tossed onto the bed but she is nowhere to be seen.

               The man pulls an imaginary train whistle.

                                     MAN
                         Choo! Choo!...

               He looks around, in a closet, under the bed.

                                     MAN
                         I'm a locomotive, baby! I'm the Wabash 
                         cannonball! I'm a hunka-hunka 
                         burninnnnn' love! I got fire in my 
                         boiler and a fuh -- a fuh --

               He is reacting to a long leg which pokes out from behind the 
               window curtain.

               A salacious smiles spreads across his lips. He pulls on the 
               cord to draw back the curtain and reveal the young woman in 
               red panties and a bra and a saucily cocked conductor's cap.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Tickets, please.

               The man is stripping off his clothes.

                                     MAN
                         Excuse me, Miss, is this the train 
                         to Ecsssstasy?

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Pull in your ears, Rexie -- you're 
                         comin' to a tunnel!

               Rex lunges at the young woman and they tumble onto the bed 
               just as --

               CRASH -- the door is kicked open and a short stocky black 
               man built like a bulldog and wearing a porkpie hat rushes 
               into the room with a video camera glued to his eye. He looks 
               like Clarence Thomas with a mustache.

                                     MAN
                         I'm gonna nail your ass!

               The young woman screams, clutching the sheets to her naked 
               bosom. Rex leaps from the bed, still clad only in his 
               chemindefer boxers, and darts around the room seeking egress.

               The man with the video charges around the room following Rex

               THE VIDEO IMAGE

               Rex is stumbling around the room in a panic, looking for his 
               clothing. The camera swish-pans back to the young woman still 
               screaming in the bed.

                                     MAN
                         I'm gonna nail your ass!!

               We swish-pan back to Rex as he bends over to pick up his 
               trousers, mooning us.

                                     MAN
                         I'm gonna nail your ass!

               PULL BACK FROM THE VIDEO IMAGE

               To reveal that we are in the detective -- Gus Petch's -- 
               office.

                                     GUS
                         I nailed his ass.

               Faintly, from the television monitor we hear screaming and 
               mayhem.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE
                         Trains...

               THE WOMAN

               Watching the monitor, MARYLIN REXROTH is a sensual beauty, 
               with intelligence and class. She watches the monitor without 
               expression.

                                     MARYLIN
                         ...I thought he'd outgrown trains.

               Gus Petch sits behind a desk.

                                     GUS
                         They never grow-up, lady. They just 
                         get tubby. Me, I've always had ample 
                         proportions. But it's all muscle -- 
                         I'm hard as a rock. I'm not on of 
                         these cream puff sit-behind-a desk 
                         private dicks; I'm an assnailer

                                     MARYLIN
                         So I see.

               Faintly, from the monitor:

                                     VOICE
                         I'm gonna nail your ass.

               We hear the Young Woman SQUEAL. Marylin reacts.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Hard to believe that's the best he 
                         could do.

                                     GUS
                         Probably you're the best he could 
                         do.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Oh. Thank you.

                                     GUS
                         You're takin' it pretty well. I seen 
                         'em weep like they'd hired me to 
                         prove their husbands weren't fooling 
                         around. And I seen 'em celebrate. 
                         Like I just handed 'em a winning 
                         lottery ticket.

               Marylin turns her attention back to the screen.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm just enjoying the movie.

               TRACKING SHOT

               All from the perspective of a moving automobile.

               The moving shots show mansions, palm trees, boutiques; we 
               pass joggers, strolling businessmen holding cellular phones 
               to their ears, male models working as waiters at sidewalk 
               cafes, young women on roller blades who turn, smile, and 
               wave at the camera. It is la dolce vita Los Angeles style.

               THE DRIVER

               A handsome, fortyish man in a town car talks into cellular 
               phone. This is MILES MASSEY.

                         -- hello Marjory, any messages? Yeah? 
                         Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Have Wrigley look 
                         up Oliphant v. Oliphant for its 
                         relevance to the Chapman filing. She 
                         took the kids where? Tahoe? Which 
                         side of Tahoe. Great. If the cruise 
                         goes all the way around the lake, 
                         she left the state and she's in 
                         breach. She can't leave the state. 
                         Tell Wrigley to prepare a filing to 
                         attach everything. Primary residence, 
                         autos, stocks...
                              (Beat)
                         Sure. Put him through.
                              (Beat)
                         Hello Ross. What? She's sleeping 
                         with the nanny? Well, you're 
                         separated. She can sleep with -- is 
                         this the one you slept with? Oh. A 
                         guy? Interesting career choice. Hmmm? 
                         Yes. I know you want her dead. 
                         Everyone in your tax bracket wants 
                         their ex wives dead.

               Rex is trying his key in the front door of his house. Finding 
               it doesn't, work he rattles the knob, then leans on the 
               doorbell.

               We hear distant chimes.

                                     REX
                         Honey! ...Honey?!

               Finally, through the intercom:

                                     MARYLIN
                         Rex. Get away from the door.

                                     REX
                         Look, Marylin, can't we have a 
                         civilized discussion about this?

                                     MARYLIN
                         We are. And it's winding down.

                                     REX
                         But Marylin, you know a divorce would 
                         ruin me right now. Everything I have -- 
                         everything we have -- is tied up in 
                         my business. The business is my entire 
                         life.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, 
                         Topeka and the Santa Fe?

                                     REX
                         Marylin?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Rex. Go away. I don't want to have 
                         to sic the dogs on you.

                                     REX
                         Dogs?

               From inside the house we hear the menacing sound of LARGE 
               DOGS BARKING.

               LETTERING

               On an interior wall; it says MASSEY, MEYERSON, SLOAN & 
               GURALNICK.

               A pull back shows that we are in a waiting room, and a 
               receptionist leans over her partition to chirp at Rex Rexroth.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         Mr. Massey will be right with you.

               INT. MASSEY MEYERSON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               Miles addresses a group of young Attorneys at the firm.

                                     MILES
                         The problem is that everyone is 
                         willing to compromise. That's the 
                         problem with the institution of 
                         marriage -- it's based on compromise. 
                         Even through its dissolution. One 
                         attorney will try to score some 
                         points, the opposition will try to 
                         impeach. The process will find an 
                         equilibrium point determined by the 
                         skill of the opposing lawyers, and 
                         then each party will walk away with 
                         their portion of the "goodies." Some 
                         say, "Life is compromise." But at 
                         Massey Myerson we believe life is 
                         struggle and the ultimate destruction 
                         of your opponent.

               The Receptionist pokes her head into the conference room.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         Your eleven o'clock is here.

                         Ladies and Gentlemen -- we will 
                         continue this at the Associates 
                         Meeting next Friday. In the meantime, 
                         I want you to consider this... Ivan 
                         the Terrible, Henry the VIII, Attila 
                         the Hun -- what did they have in 
                         common?

                         Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and 
                         consider this office your office, 
                         your haven, your war room -- for the 
                         duration of the campaign.

                                     REX
                         Thank you.

                                     MILES
                         Now Rex.

               He leans back in the leather executive chair behind his desk, 
               makes a steeple of his fingers, and dons his look of deepest 
               concern.

                                     MILES
                         -- Tell me your troubles.

               Rex, nervous, laughs ruefully.

                                     REX
                         Jeez. Where do I start?

               Miles gives an encouraging, rueful smile in return.

                                     REX
                         ...Well, my wife has me between a 
                         rock and a hard place.

                                     MILES
                         That's her job. You have to respect 
                         that.

                                     REX
                         When I first met Marylin -- Well, we 
                         were crazy about each other. Not 
                         emotionally, of course. We just 
                         couldn't keep our hands off each 
                         other.

                                     MILES
                         Mm.

                                     REX
                         But then... But then...

               Quietly.

                                     MILES
                         Time marches on. Ardor cools.

                                     REX
                         No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly 
                         cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And 
                         very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of 
                         it out there.

                                     MILES
                         Ah.

                                     REX
                         You know what I mean when I say "it."

                                     MILES
                         Gotcha. No need to get anatomically 
                         correct with me, Rex.

                                     REX
                         Seems like there's more of it than 
                         ever before --

                                     MILES
                         Well, with the expanding global 
                         population -- Let me ask you this -- 
                         your wife. Has she pursued the 
                         opportunities which must present 
                         themselves to the "knock-out, sexy 
                         woman" you described?

                                     REX
                         I don't know. I can assume...

                                     MILES
                         Not in court you can't. Has she 
                         retained counsel?

                                     REX
                         I'm not sure.

                                     MILES
                         And your wife is aware of or has 
                         evidence of your activities?

                                     REX
                         Video.

                                     MILES
                         Mmm... And to cut to the chase, 
                         forensically speaking -- is there a 
                         pre-nup?

               Rex hangs his head.

               Miles sighs sympathetically.

                                     MILES
                         The fault, dear Brutus, is not in 
                         our stars, but in ourselves. Well, 
                         let me ask you this: what kind of 
                         settlement do you seek? What are, 
                         for you, the parameters of the 
                         possible?

                                     REX
                         That's the problem. I can't afford 
                         to give her anything.

                                     MILES
                         Nothing?

                                     REX
                         I know that sounds rough but I'm 
                         about to close on a deal to develop 
                         some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged 
                         up to my ass. If this deal goes south, 
                         I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.

                                     MILES
                         So, you propose that in spite of 
                         demonstrable infidelity on your part, 
                         your unoffending wife should be tossed 
                         out on her ear?

                                     REX
                         Well -- is that possible?

               Miles smiles at him.

               EXT. RUNNING PATH - SAN VICENTE BLVD. - MORNING

               Marylin power walks along the San Vicente Bike Path with her 
               friends SARAH SORKIN and RAMONA BARCELONA. It's early, but 
               the path is crowded with bikers, bladers, runners, power 
               walkers, wheelchair racers etc. Ramona pushes her infant in 
               a baby jogger.

                                     SARAH
                         You want to come out to the beach 
                         house tomorrow?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I didn't know Barry had a beach house.

                                     SARAH
                         Neither did I until my lawyer found 
                         it -- quite a paper trail -- he had 
                         it in the dog's name.

                                     RAMONA
                              (To Marylin)
                         So who'd you hire?

                         Ruth Rabino.

                                     SARAH
                         She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis 
                         or a Pearlman? She definitely did a 
                         Factor.

                                     MARYLIN
                         She did a Harriman.

                                     SARAH
                         Wow.

                                     MARYLIN
                         In the words of my Private 
                         Investigator, we're going to nail 
                         his ass.

                                     RAMONA
                         I've been trying to nail George's 
                         for years, but he's very careful. 
                         I'll just keep having children. I 
                         think I'm pregnant, by the way.

                                     SARAH
                         Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.

                                     RAMONA
                         Three is not Farrow.

                                     SARAH
                         Who's Rex's guy?

                                     SARAH
                         Of Massey Myerson?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Do you know him?

                                     SARAH
                         By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey 
                         that cute little island of George's.

                                     RAMONA
                         George was so impressed he hired him 
                         when he divorced his second.

                                     SARAH
                         Muriel Rumsey.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Who's she?

                                     SARAH
                         Now? She's a night manager at 
                         McDonalds.

                                     RAMONA
                         You should have tried to get pregnant 
                         Marylin -- solidify your position.

                                     MARYLIN
                         No.

                                     RAMONA
                         You like kids.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I can't have a baby with a man I 
                         don't love... And I can't submit a 
                         child to divorce.

                                     SARAH
                         It's not so bad these days. Kids 
                         like joint custody. Two sets of toys.

                                     RAMONA
                         Maybe next time.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Maybe.

                                     SARAH
                         We do have a man for you.

                                     RAMONA
                         Thorstenson Gieselensen. He just 
                         separated from his third. He's in 
                         fish. He is fish.

                                     SARAH
                         She's keeping his name. And one of 
                         his planes. And all seven of his 
                         children

                                     RAMONA
                         And only two are hers.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Please. I'm not seeing anyone until 
                         this is over. One husband at a time.

                                     SARAH
                         I wish I had your discipline.

               A COURTROOM

               We are close on the person on the witness stand, a woman in 
               her 60's.

                                     LAWYER
                         Mrs. Guttman, you have testified 
                         that you were your husband's sexual 
                         slave for thirty-six years, ever 
                         since you were married --

                                     WITNESS
                         Except for two years when he was in 
                         the Navy, in Korea.

                                     LAWYER
                         Prior to your marriage, what was 
                         your profession?

                                     WITNESS
                         I was a hostess. For Trans-World 
                         Airlines.

                                     LAWYER
                         What is your husband's profession?

                                     WITNESS
                         He manufactures staples and industrial 
                         brad-tacks. He's very successful.

               JUMP BACK

               At the counsel's table in the foreground Miles chats, voice 
               lowered with WRIGLEY, a boyish, bespectacled junior associate. 
               Beyond them we see the woman on the witness stand continuing 
               her testimony.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Wait... He wants to give her...?

                                     MILES
                         Nothing.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         And she has...?

                         Video.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         What the fuck...?

               Miles turns to Wrigley with a look of indignation. He gestures 
               to their surroundings.

                                     MILES
                         Wrigley!

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Sorry.

                                     MILES
                         Sometimes I have serious doubts about 
                         you.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         I am very sorry.

                                     MILES
                         Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?

                                     WRIGLEY
                         No. You're not.

                                     MILES
                         I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer 
                         clerked for Scalia.

               Wrigley looks suicidal.

                                     BACKGROUND LAWYER (O.S.)
                         Couldn't you simply walk away from 
                         this abusive relationship?

                                     WOMAN
                         No, he had the videos...

                                     MILES
                         Anyway, I need a challenge. This --

               He waves dismissively at the courtroom.

                                     MILES
                         -- is not a challenge. I need 
                         something I can sink my teeth into, 
                         professionally speaking.

                                     WOMAN
                         He would invite these girls home 
                         from the staple factory to our 
                         condominium in Palm Springs. He had 
                         a device he called the Intruder.

                                     JUDGE
                         Mr. Massey! I ask again, if you have 
                         any questions for the complainant.

                                     MILES
                         I'm sorry, your honor, I was just 
                         conferring with my associate...

               He rises.

                                     MILES
                         Now then, Mrs. Guttman. Do you know 
                         a gentleman named Morris Rudnick?

                                     MRS. GUTTMAN
                         Well, yes, Morris is my accountant.

                                     MILES
                              (sadly)
                         Accountant.

               He reaches back and Wrigley puts a manila file in his hand.

                                     MILES
                         We would like to offer these 
                         photographs into evidence...

               WAITING ROOM - MASSEY MEYSERSON

               The receptionist leans over her partition to chirp at Marylin 
               and her attorney Ruth Rabinow. Ruth is a sturdy woman in her 
               late 60's. If Mrs. Guttman had gone to law school...

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         Mr. Massey will see you now.

               CONFERENCE ROOM

               In the middle of the Massy Meyerson conference table is a 
               large fruit and pastry plate.

               The door swings open. Miles rises.

                                     MILES
                         ...Ruth!

               They shake hands.

                                     MILES
                         -- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. 
                         And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.

                                     MARYLIN
                         And you must be Mr. Massey.

               They appraise each other for a beat. They are impressed and, 
               they are impressive. As they settle in:

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Sadly)
                         Hello, Rex.

                                     REX
                         Marylin.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Are you alright? You lost weight.

                                     REX
                         My whole metabolism is -- off.

               Miles has been staring at Marylin. She notices this, and 
               smiles shyly. He snaps out of it.

                                     MILES
                         So, Ruth. How's Sam?

                                     RUTH
                         Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly 
                         fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.

                                     MILES
                         A yert.
                              (To Rex)
                         Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a 
                         time when most women are in Boca, 
                         having early bird specials -- she's 
                         working so her husband can be in 
                         Montana. In a yert.

                                     REX
                         What's a yert?

                                     RUTH
                              (Dryly)
                         I ran into your mother at the 
                         radiologist last week.

                                     MILES
                         What?!

                                     RUTH
                         Oh, just a routine mammogram. She 
                         said to say hello. She's going to 
                         Positano with your brother's family.

               A tight, terse smile from Miles.

                                     MILES
                         How nice.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Positano is beautiful. Remember when 
                         we were there, Rex? We stayed in the 
                         Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?

                                     REX
                         Yeah.

               They drift for a moment.

                                     RUTH
                         So, Miles. If you have a proposal, 
                         let's hear it.

                                     MILES
                         At this point my client is still 
                         prepared to consider reconciliation.

                                     RUTH
                         My client has ruled that out.

                                     MILES
                         My client is prepared to entertain 
                         an amicable dissolution of the 
                         marriage without prejudice.

                                     RUTH
                         That's delusional.

                                     MILES
                         My client proposes a thirty day 
                         cooling off period.

                                     RUTH
                         My client feels sufficiently 
                         dispassionate.

                                     MILES
                         My client asks that you not initiate 
                         proceedings pending his setting 
                         certain affairs in order.

                                     RUTH
                         Ha Ha.

                                     MILES
                              (conceding the point)
                         Heh heh.

                                     REX
                         What's so goddamn funny?

               Miles lays a hand on his arm.

                                     MILES
                         Please -- let me handle this.

               He puts the clipboard away and looks carefully at Ruth.

                                     MILES
                         -- So much for the icebreakers. 
                         What're you after, Ruth?

                                     RUTH
                         My client is prepared to settle for 
                         fifty percent of the marital assets.

                                     MILES
                         Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why 
                         not ask for a hundred percent?

                                     RUTH
                         Oh brother. Here we go.

                                     MILES
                         Why not a hundred and fifty percent?

                                     RUTH
                         Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe 
                         we're being too conservative. Seventy 
                         five percent.

               Rex winces. Rubs his stomach. Marylin leans forward and 
               whispers to him.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Do you need a Tagamet?

                                     REX
                         You have some?

               She removes a pack of the tablets from her purse, along with 
               several vials of prescription drugs.

                                     MARYLIN
                         These are yours.

                                     MILES
                         Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.

               She hands the pills to a grateful Rex. Their hands touch for 
               a moment.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Have you been taking your digestive 
                         enzymes?

                                     REX
                              (Contrite)
                         Sometimes I forget.

               She looks at him like a concerned parent. Miles and Ruth 
               watch the interaction.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (To the attorneys)
                         I'm sorry. Where were we?

                                     RUTH
                         We were about to request the primary 
                         residence, and thirty percent of the 
                         remaining assets.

                                     MILES
                         Are you familiar with Kirshner?

                                     RUTH
                         Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner 
                         was in Kentucky.

                                     REX
                         What's Kirshner?

                                     MILES
                         Please -- let me handle this. Okay, 
                         Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your 
                         bottom line?

                                     RUTH
                         The primary residence and FORTY 
                         percent of the remaining assets. 
                         You're becoming tedious Miles.

                                     REX
                         Aren't we going in the wrong 
                         direction?

                                     MILES
                         Shhh. Please. Let me do my job.
                              (To Ruth)
                         Buy a clue, Ruthie. Have you forgotten 
                         about Kirshner?

               Ruth stands and closes her attaché case.

                                     RUTH
                         See you at the preliminary.

               Miles calls to Ruth's retreating back.

                                     MILES
                         Fine. We'll eat all the pastry.

               Going through the door, Ruth doesn't react, but Marylin 
               following, glances back -- bemused, but with a trace of a 
               smile.

               Rex swallows two more tablets. He sits, looking despondent.

                                     MILES
                         I think that went as well as could 
                         be expected.

                         She always looked out for me.

                                     MILES
                         And she had private investigators 
                         assisting her.

                                     REX
                              (Sentimental)
                         She brought my digestive enzymes.

                                     MILES
                         In anticipation of making you sick.

                                     REX
                         Maybe I should reconsider my...

               Miles looks at him. Shakes his head, sadly.

                                     MILES
                         A superficial display of marital 
                         solicitude, and you lose your resolve? 
                         Rex. I underestimated you. But I'm 
                         your attorney, and if you choose to 
                         reward her for that mediocre charade 
                         of spousal concern...

               He shrugs, helplessly.

                                     REX
                         You're right. Screw her.

               INT. GYM - CLOSE ON

               A woman walking across a gymnasium floor. Suddenly, she's 
               assaulted by a huge, grotesquely garbed assailant. His sweats 
               barely cover his massive, overdeveloped musculature. On his 
               head, a ski mask stretches over a padded football helmet. He 
               grabs the woman, yanks her back towards him. She reacts 
               swiftly. With a ferocious "NO," she stomps on his foot, and 
               smashes him in the face. The mugger raises his hands in a 
               gesture of submission.

               APPLAUSE

               We pull back and see that we are in a Self Defense Class. 
               Two instructors, two "muggers" and ten women students all 
               wearing T-shirts with the words IMPACT-Personal Safety. 
               Marylin and Sarah sit against the wall.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I don't know what his game is. He 
                         dismissed every one of Ruth's 
                         proposals. And Sarah, we weren't 
                         unreasonable.

                                     SARAH
                         Well what does he want?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, 
                         but I could tell she was surprised.

                                     SARAH
                         He has a reputation for being tough.

               Marylin watches as a new "victim" begin her walk across the 
               gym.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Grinning)
                         Lilly's up.

                                     SARAH
                         Oh, God!

               The mugger emerges from his station and makes his way toward 
               the "victim." She glances over her shoulder, and at the sight 
               of the monster bearing down on her, screams and runs to the 
               exit. Marylin and Sarah giggle, but reproachful looks from 
               the other students force them to affect concerned looks.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Whispers)
                         Every week --

                                     SARAH
                         I'm dying.

               The two Instructors and the Mugger try to coax the sobbing 
               woman back into the room. They clasp her in an empathic group 
               hug.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by 
                         his intransigence. If I didn't know 
                         better, I'd swear Massey had some 
                         personal investment in my ruination.

                                     SARAH
                         So where are you now?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Well, if he continues to maintain 
                         this position -- we're in court.

                                     SARAH
                         Shit.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Get this! He called and invited me 
                         to dinner.

               The INSTRUCTOR, a vivacious phys ed major, approaches Marylin.

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         Marylin? Ready.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Huh? Oh, yeah. Sure.

               Marylin gets up and coolly walks to center stage, passing 
               the traumatized Lilly.

                                     SARAH
                         That's completely odd.

               Marylin begins the Victim walk. The Mugger quickly moves up 
               from the rear.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (To Sarah)
                         I know. That's why I accepted. Find 
                         out what's up with this clown.

               The Mugger is upon her. He grabs her hair. She stomps his 
               foot, and smoothly wheels around SMASHING him in the nose 
               with her elbow, while KNEEING HIM in the groin.

               The women Cheer.

                                     INSTRUCTOR
                         That was excellent, Marylin. But you 
                         forgot to yell "no."

                                     MARYLIN
                         Ah.
                              (Calmly, to the Mugger)
                         No.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ELEGANT RESTAURANT - EVENING

               Miles rises from his seat as Marylin enters.

                                     MILES
                         Mrs. Rexroth. Thank you for coming.

               The Maitre d' is pulling out a chair for her.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I have to admit. I was curious. And 
                         hungry.

                                     MAITRE D'
                         Something to start? Some wine, 
                         perhaps?

               Miles glances at the wine list.

                                     MILES
                         French?
                              (She smiles)
                         Bordeaux? Hmmm. Chateau Margaux '57.

               Miles nods at the maitre d' who returns the nod and withdraws.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I assume this is on Rex?

                                     MILES
                         Isn't everything?

               Miles regards her.

                                     MILES
                         Your husband told me you were 
                         beautiful, but I was unprepared.

                                     MARYLIN
                         "Dismiss your vows, your feigned 
                         tears, your flattery, for where a 
                         heart is hard, they make no battery."

               Miles leans back, props his chin on one fist, and considers 
               her.

                                     MILES
                         Simon & Garfunkel?

               She laughs.

                                     MILES
                         Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Did you see the tape?

                                     MILES
                         Not yet.

                                     MARYLIN
                         See the tape. Then we can discuss my 
                         heart.

               A waiter appears and pour a taste of wine which Miles sips 
               and -- He nods at the waiter who pours two glasses.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your 
                         performance about this afternoon?

                                     MILES
                         What does your lawyer think?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Ruth says you've been too successful, 
                         that you're bored, complacent, and 
                         you're on your way down.

                                     MILES
                         But you don't agree?

                                     MARYLIN
                         How do you know?

                                     MILES
                         Why would you be here?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I told you. I was hungry.

               FLAP a menu enters frame. It is handed to Marylin; another 
               is handed to Miles.

                                     MILES
                         I'll have the tournedos of beef. And 
                         the lady will have the same?
                              (To Marylin)
                         I assume you're a carnivore.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I know you do.

               She addresses the waiter.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Risotto with white truffles, please.

               Miles looks at her with appreciation.

                                     MILES
                         "Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at 
                         first sight?"

                                     MARYLIN
                         You didn't ask me here to pick me 
                         up. You could get in trouble for 
                         that.

                                     MILES
                         Not really. You're not my client. 
                         Freedom of association. Big issue 
                         with the First Amendment fans. Want 
                         to go to Hawaii for the weekend?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Have you ever been married, Miles?

                                     MILES
                         No.

                                     MARYLIN
                         You don't believe in it.

                                     MILES
                         As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.

                                     MARYLIN
                         You just haven't met the right person.

                                     MILES
                         No. I haven't. Have you?

               She regards him for a moment.

                                     MARYLIN
                         All right, Miles. Let me tell you 
                         everything you THINK you know. I was 
                         married to Rex for a long time. I 
                         was an excellent wife, a partner, a 
                         lover, a hostess and a friend. There 
                         was only one thing I did wrong during 
                         the five years we were together. I 
                         got five years older. Think he should 
                         be able to ditch me for that?

                                     MILES
                         He wants a reconciliation.

                                     MARYLIN
                         See the tape. Then we can discuss 
                         reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I 
                         nailed his ass. Now I'm going to 
                         have it mounted and have my 
                         girlfriends over to throw darts at 
                         it. Then I'm getting on with my life. 
                         That's all I'm after.

                                     MILES
                         Gotcha.

                                     MARYLIN
                         What is it you're after, Miles?

                                     MILES
                         Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking 
                         for an ass to mount.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Well, don't look at mine!

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Oyez. Oyez. Family court for the 
                         fifth district of Los Angeles County 
                         is now in session.

               COURT ROOM

               A large black woman in judicial robes and raiment enters 
               from behind the Solomonic Platform.

                                     CLERK
                         -- The Honorable Marva Munson 
                         presiding. All rise.

               Massey, Wrigley, and Rex Rexroth in between, rise. Rex and 
               Wrigley remain respectfully standing, facing forward, as 
               they whisper out of the side of their mouths:

                                     REX
                         Have you sat before her before?

               Wrigley considers.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         -- the judge sits. We argue. We argue 
                         before her. She sits before us.

                                     REX
                         Okay. Has she sat before you before?

                                     WRIGLEY
                         You can't sit before her. That's the 
                         rule! She sits before we argue!

               Miles glances over and hisses:

                                     MILES
                         Shut! Up!

               A GAVEL CRASHES

               LATER

               We are on a close lateral track of the jurors faces as they 
               sit, with earphones on, in the darkened courtroom, illuminated 
               by a flickering TV monitor.

               Leaking tinnily through the headsets we hear a very faint:

                                     VOICE
                         I'm gonna nail your ass.

               The track ends over at Marylin's table, where Marylin also 
               wearing headphones, looks on with studied stoicism. Ruth 
               lays a consoling hand on her shoulder.

               LATER

               Marylin Rexroth now struggles to maintain her composure on 
               the witness stand. She is modestly dressed and her attitude 
               is one of shocked, wounded innocence.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I was devastated. Of course.

                                     RUTH
                         Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.

                                     JUDGE
                         Mr. Massey, any questions?

               Miles soberly rises.

                                     MILES
                         Mmmm --

               He paces, hands clasped behind his back, affecting to be 
               lost in thought.

               Marylin watches him.

               Finally Miles, still pacing, declaims:

                                     MILES
                         "Dismiss your vows, your feigned 
                         tears, your flattery, for where a 
                         heart is hard, they make no 
                         battery..."

               Marylin looks up from her handkerchief with a look of startled 
               irritation. Miles stops pacing and turns to face her with a 
               faint smile.

                                     MILES
                         Do you know those lines, Mrs. Rexroth?

               Marylin examines him with guarded eyes. Ruth sensing something 
               unscripted going on, tries to cut it off.

                                     RUTH
                         Objection, your honor!

                                     JUDGE
                         Grounds?

                                     RUTH
                         Uh... poetry recitation.

                                     MILES
                         Let me rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, how 
                         high is that wall around your heart?

               Marylin eyes him suspiciously.

                                     RUTH
                         Your honor, this is harassment! Arid 
                         frankly it's still a little...

               She flutters one hand.

                                     RUTH
                         ...arty farty!

                                     MILES
                         Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you 
                         ever been in love?

               Marylin hesitates, gives a "what does this mean look" to 
               Ruth. She returns a "beats me."

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.

                                     MILES
                         And you've always loved him?

               Smiles slips out:

                                     MARYLIN
                         "Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at 
                         first sight?"

               Miles returns a fleeting smile.

                                     MILES
                         And you hoped to spend the rest of 
                         your life with him?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes. Why is that so difficult for 
                         you to understand?

               She looks at Rex with tender sorrow.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Rex was -- is -- a very appealing 
                         man. I am sorry I couldn't...
                              (Tearing up)
                         I tried my best.

               Miles almost smiles. She's good.

                                     MILES
                         That'll be all Mrs. Rexroth. Please 
                         forgive me for causing you additional 
                         anguish.
                              (To the Judge)
                         Thank you, Your Honor. No further 
                         questions.

               A Bailiff offers to help Marylin off the stand. She politely 
               and courageously declines.

                                     JUDGE
                         Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.

                                     RUTH
                         We rest, Your Honor.

                                     JUDGE
                         Mr. Massey?

                                     MILES
                         Yes, Your honor. I call Patricia 
                         Kennedy DeCordoba Isenberg.

                                     BAILIFF
                         Patricia Kennedy DeCordoba Isenberg.

               Marylin, in the process of reseating herself behind her table, 
               pauses.

               Ruth notices this and leans in.

                                     RUTH
                         Who's that?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Jesus.

               An attractive woman in her mid fifties advances to be sworn. 
               She was a beauty, but her glory days are past and she's not 
               taking it well. She looks tense and slightly hypo-manic. She 
               speaks in a breathy, giggly voice, and smiles frequently for 
               no apparent reason.

                                     BAILIFF
                         Mrs. Isenberg.

                                     PATRICIA
                         Banderas.

                                     BAILIFF
                         Mrs. Banderas, do you solemnly swear 
                         that the testimony you are about to 
                         give shall be the truth, the whole 
                         truth, and nothing but the truth so 
                         help you God?

                                     PATRICIA
                         Yes, Mr. Bailiff. I do.

                                     MILES
                         Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your 
                         relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.

                                     PATRICIA
                         We don't have much of a relationship 
                         anymore. I haven't seen her since 
                         before she married Rex. We had some 
                         very nice times prior to that. We 
                         were quite close.

                                     RUTH
                              (To Marylin)
                         Is this a lover?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Please!

                                     MILES
                         And how would you define your 
                         relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You 
                         know -- you are her...?

                                     PATRICIA
                         Mother?

                                     RUTH
                         What?!

               Marylin sighs.

                                     MILES
                         Her Mother?

               Patricia smiles coyly. Gives Marylin a silly little wave by 
               way of greeting.

                                     PATRICIA
                         Hi, Sweetie.

                                     MILES
                         Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you 
                         are frequently mistaken for sisters.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Mumbles)
                         He'll regret this.

                                     MILES
                         Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?

                                     PATRICIA
                         No. I haven't. But I've been out of 
                         town.
                              (Little girlish wave)
                         Hello, Rex. Hello there.

                                     MILES
                         You were never invited to meet your 
                         son-in-law?

                                     PATRICIA
                         No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? 
                         No. Well... no.

                                     RUTH
                         Objection, Your Honor. This isn't 
                         about Mrs. Rexroth's filial 
                         obligations.

                                     JUDGE
                         Sustained.

                                     MILES
                         Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?

                                     PATRICIA
                         Of course. Of course she was married. 
                         What else would she be? Single? I 
                         don't think so.

               She laughs merrily at some private joke between her and her 
               psyche.

                                     PATRICIA
                         Let me tell you something about Patty.

                                     MILES
                         Who's "Patty."

                                     PATRICIA
                         Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like 
                         mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. 
                         But she changed it after seeing "Some 
                         Like It Hot." To Marylin. After 
                         Marylin Monroe.

                                     MILES
                         I see. And what were you going to 
                         tell us about Patty slash Marylin?

                                     PATRICIA
                         When she was a tiny girl? And people 
                         asked her what she wanted to be when 
                         she grew up? She never said the usual 
                         things little girls say -- like -- 
                         nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? 
                         She always said --
                              (Very Shirley Temple)
                         "When I grow up, I want to be 
                         divorced."

               She laughs happily at the memory.

                                     MILES
                         Divorce was her childhood aspiration?

                                     PATRICIA
                         Well, not just divorce. She used to 
                         say "I want to be divorced from some 
                         big dumb rich guy..." And I guess 
                         her dream is coming true.
                              (To Marylin)
                         I'm happy for you Patty

               INT. SARAH SORKIN'S BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

               Pasta being cooked. Salad being tossed. Wine glasses are 
               filled. It's Girl's Night at the beach.

                                     MARYLIN
                         It was like that scene in The 
                         Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is 
                         called to testify against the Family. 
                         And he's in court, and he looks into 
                         the spectators gallery, and sees his 
                         Brother. They brought the brother 
                         from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a 
                         word. He can't testify. That's what 
                         it was like seeing Pat in there. I 
                         couldn't even have Ruth cross examine 
                         her.

                                     RAMONA
                         Why do you think she did it?

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Shrugs)
                         Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. 
                         Maybe they offered her money. Massey 
                         is very seductive. Who knows.

                                     RAMONA
                         Maybe they put a horse head in her 
                         bed?

                                     SARAH
                         That stinks. They left you with 
                         absolutely nothing. It makes you 
                         wonder about the entire legal system. 
                         Like Rodney King.

                                     MARYLIN
                         They bought her speech. If I was 
                         only in it for Rex's money, he 
                         shouldn't have to give me any.

                                     RAMONA
                         That doesn't make sense. It's like 
                         punishing you for being goal oriented.

                                     SARAH
                         Well, you can live here as long as 
                         you want. Do you have any plans?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Nothing specific, but I'll have my 
                         own place soon.

                                     SARAH
                         So, Marylin. Is that what you said 
                         when you were a little girl?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Probably. Every woman in my life was 
                         divorced at least twice. What was I 
                         supposed to say. Anthropologist?

                                     RAMONA
                         I begged you to have a baby!

                                     MARYLIN
                         In the Godfather, after the courtroom 
                         scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his 
                         veins in the bathtub.

                                     SARAH
                         You're not...

                                     MARYLIN
                         No. I'll see some blood before this 
                         is over, but it won't be mine.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Not this one. Not unless her HMO 
                         covers plastic surgery, which, 
                         incidentally, she does not need.

                         Everyone needs plastic surgery. You 
                         need it.

                         It's a form of botulism. I just inject 
                         it into your forehead, and it 
                         paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't 
                         raise them...

                                     MILES
                         Why in God's name would I want...?

                         flip the face, and set it for two

                         You never leave Beverly Hills.

                         You were going to be a Cardiac 
                         Surgeon. I was going to clerk for

                         I was going to play golf. You were 
                         going to have Asian girlfriends.

                         Yes. Your husband did show remarkable 
                         foresight in taking those pictures. 
                         And, yes, absent a swimming pool, 
                         the presence of the pool man would

                         he who had been sleeping with the

               Slatted shades are drawn against the sun. It is dim, gloomy. 
               We can just make out the shape of an ancient man -- small, 
               hunched -- seated behind an enormous desk. A gallows shape 
               next to him is hard to make out; it is tall, rail thin and 
               fixed with a swinging, glinting appendage.

               A voice -- old, dry, rasping, lightly accented of a long-
               gone Brooklyn boyhood -- seems disembodied and sourceless, 
               as if it is the voice of the gloom itself.

                         She's here now.

               INT. PRIVATE BATHROOM

               Miles runs his fingers through his hair, carefully examining 
               himself in the mirror. Suavely smiling.

                                     MILES
                         Marylin! How nice.

               He clears his throat, begins again with lower pitch, suave 
               smile still in place

                                     MILES
                         Marylin! How lovely, uh --

               He runs a finger across his teeth, which squeak, then puts 
               back the suave smile

                                     MILES
                         -- Marylin! What a pleasure --

               DOORWAY

               On Miles as he opens the door, suavely smiling.

                                     MILES
                         Marylin, what a pleas -- who the 
                         fuck are you?

               Facing him in the doorway is a large roughly handsome middle 
               aged man in a business suit.

               Just behind him is Marylin Rexroth, looking as coolly 
               beautiful as ever. She smoothly puts in:

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles, how nice of you to see us -- 
                         may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of 
                         Doyle Oil.

                                     DOYLE
                         I told you we know each other, baby. 
                         Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother-
                         in law. Martin Reiser?

                                     MILES
                         Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?

                                     DOYLE
                              (To Marylin)
                         After you, Doll.

               Marylin glides into the office. Seats herself on the couch. 
               Doyle sits next to her, one proprietary hand on her knee.

                                     MILES
                         And how is Mrs. Reiser?

                                     DOYLE
                         Few suicide attempts, little inpatient 
                         stint. Naturally, she misses her 
                         kids. Six weekends a year and 
                         alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh 
                         to us but -- hey -- all's fair. 
                         Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," 
                         takes her meds and goes to 
                         occupational therapy at a local 
                         sheltered workshop.

                                     MILES
                         So she's uh, flourishing?

                                     DOYLE
                         She makes felt wallets. Got one right 
                         here.

               Doyle pulls out a deranged piece of felt stuffed with money.

               Most of the contents slip to the floor.

                                     DOYLE
                         Yeah. I know. Leather would be more 
                         practical, but whatcha gonna do?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles, I know you're busy and that 
                         you charge by the hour so I'll come 
                         to the point. Howard and I are 
                         planning to marry.

               Miles is stunned.

                                     MILES
                         Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?

                                     DOYLE
                         Yep. My divorce just came through. 
                         Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a 
                         better deal! My wife still has health 
                         insurance and gets to see the 
                         children. But, I don't know. Guess 
                         I'm just a softie. After all Amanda 
                         and me were together for -- what -- 
                         you'd know better than me, Marylin. 
                         She was your best friend.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Thinks)
                         Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen 
                         and Mandy must be what -- twelve?

                                     DOYLE
                              (To Miles)
                         Here. Got pictures.

               He removes a family photo from the felt wallet. It's of Howard 
               and two fat teenagers. Apparently the former Mrs. Doyle was 
               cut out, but an ear and part of a hairdo are sill visible in 
               the shot.

                                     MILES
                         I... uh guess congratulations are in 
                         order.

                                     DOYLE
                         Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up 
                         and...

                                     MARYLIN
                         Honey, I don't think this is really 
                         relevant to...

                                     DOYLE
                         ...and one day, this sweet girl calls 
                         me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder 
                         to cry on deal. One thing leads to 
                         another and before I know it --

                                     MARYLIN
                         -- we realized we'd always been very 
                         attracted to one another.

                                     MILES
                         No!

                                     DOYLE
                         I had no idea until after, but --

               He looks at her with predatory lust.

                                     DOYLE
                         Baby. You are so HOT!

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Coy)
                         Howard!

               He pulls her close to him and plants a massive kiss on her.

                                     MILES
                         What a touching story.

                                     DOYLE
                         You know, Miles, after my wife -- 
                         wife's mastectomy -- things were 
                         never the same. This might sound 
                         cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, 
                         but...
                              (man to man)
                         I like my women with two boobs.

               Miles flashes Marylin a "you are KIDDING" look, but she 
               assiduously avoids eye contact.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Howard and I are here, Miles, because 
                         I have learned through bitter 
                         experience that when it comes to 
                         matrimonial law, you are the very 
                         best.

               Miles acknowledges this with a curt nod.

                                     MARYLIN
                         As you are well aware, my previous 
                         marriage ended with an unjustified 
                         strain on my reputation My motives 
                         were questioned. I was slandered in 
                         court.

                                     DOYLE
                         You did good, Massey!

                                     MARYLIN
                         Therefore in an effort to remove any 
                         trace of suspicion from my sweet 
                         Howard -- I wish to execute a pre-
                         nuptial agreement.

                                     DOYLE
                         And -- there's no talking her out of 
                         it. Believe me, I've tried.

                                     MARYLIN
                         They say the Massey pre-nup has never 
                         been penetrated.

                                     DOYLE
                         She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.

               He gropes her. She giggles like a teenager.

                                     MILES
                         Oh, for the love of...

                                     MARYLIN
                         That is true, isn't it Miles? Your 
                         pre-nup is the best there is?

                                     MILES
                         That is correct. Not to blow my own 
                         horn, but they devote an entire 
                         semester to it at Harvard Law.

                                     DOYLE
                         Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!

                                     MILES
                         I just want to make sure that you 
                         both --

               He eyes Marylin.

                                     MILES
                         -- understand what you're asking for 
                         here. The Massey pre-nup provides 
                         that in the event of a dissolution 
                         of the marriage for any reason, both 
                         parties shall leave it with whatever 
                         they brought in, and earned during. 
                         No one can profit from the marriage. 
                         The pre-nup protects the wealthier 
                         party.

                                     DOYLE
                         Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.

                                     MILES
                         And without it, that party is exposed -- 
                         a sitting duck. No wriggle room.

                                     DOYLE
                         A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put 
                         that in the Malibu house. Screw the 
                         screening room!

                                     MILES
                              (slightly sickened)
                         -- and we are sure...

               Eyes boring into Marylin.

                                     MILES
                         -- we are both sure that's what we 
                         want?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Absolutely.

                                     DOYLE
                         Course I can't do much "wriggling" 
                         if you tie me up like that again. 
                         Massey -- this is one bad bad little 
                         girl.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (laughing)
                         We'd better go before we get thrown 
                         out.

               ELEVATOR BANK

               Marylin and Howard wait for an elevator as Miles trots out 
               to catch them.

                                     MILES
                         Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could 
                         just borrow your charming fiancee 
                         for a moment.

                                     DOYLE
                         What part?

                                     MILES
                         I'd just like to have a word with 
                         her.

                                     DOYLE
                         Why not? I'm going to have her for a 
                         lifetime.

               Miles drags her to the side as Doyle checks his Sports Pager.

                                     MILES
                         What are you doing?

               She backs up as he tries to close the space between them.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Getting married.

                                     MILES
                         To him? He's a sick freak.

                                     MARYLIN
                         He's passionate.

                                     MILES
                         Passionate! He's a pervert. He should 
                         have to register when he moves.

                                     MARYLIN
                         All girls enjoy a little rough trade 
                         from time to time.

                                     MILES
                         Marylin! Listen to me.

                                     MARYLIN
                         No. You listen to me.
                              (Very quiet and 
                              deliberate)
                         You busted me, Miles. You left me 
                         with nothing! What did you expect me 
                         to do? Get a degree in counseling? 
                         Write a book about table linen? 
                         Because that's what wives do when 
                         they get dumped, and frankly, I'm 
                         not quite ready for that.

                                     MILES
                         But why him?

                                     MARYLIN
                         We told you. We realized we've always 
                         been in love.

               He has backed her against the wall of an alcove which shelters 
               a flowering ficus.

                                     MILES
                         The Massey pre-nup has never been 
                         pene -- successfully challenged.

                                     MARYLIN
                         So I hear. Is that all?

                                     MILES
                         No, that's not all.

               He moves to kiss her.

                                     MILES
                         You fascinate me.

               She deftly slides out of the way. Miles watches her as she 
               heads down the hall. As she gets on the elevator, Howard 
               grabs her butt with one hand, while giving Miles a high sign 
               with the other.

               INT. HOWARD'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Miles stares at the chessboard.

                                     MILES
                         Do you think I'm going to end up 
                         like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy 
                         bag instead of a family?

                                     KENNETH
                         Got any symptoms?

                                     MILES
                         Yes. The inability to experience 
                         pleasure.

                                     KENNETH
                         Oh. That.
                              (beat)
                         Don't waste time with your queen.

                                     MILES
                         What?

                                     KENNETH
                         The Center Counter Defense. The thing 
                         is not to move your queen too early.

                                     MILES
                         She can't really love that idiot, 
                         can she?

                                     KENNETH
                         What?

                                     MILES
                         Marylin Rexroth. She came into my 
                         office and signed a pre-nup with 
                         Howard Doyle.

                                     KENNETH
                         Doyle Oil?
                              (Miles nods)
                         A Massey Pre-nup?
                              (Miles nods again)
                         She loves him.

                                     MILES
                         He's the wrong man.

                                     KENNETH
                         Miles! Don't waste time with someone 
                         else's queen, either.

               EXT. A WEDDING BOWER - AKA CHUPPA

               From behind the bower, RABBI BOLENSKY emerges, strumming his 
               guitar and singing:

                                     BOLENSKY
                         Parsley sage, rosemary and thyme -- 
                         Remember me to one who lives there...

               A pullback reveals Howard D. Doyle before the altar with 
               Marylin. He is in a tuxedo and yarmulke. She is dressed in a 
               simple, Kennedy-type gown.

                                     BOLENSKY
                         -- she once was a true love of mine.

               The last arpeggiated chord rings out; birds tweet, everyone 
               sits.

               As Miles and Wrigley seat themselves, Wrigley is sniffling.

               Miles is irritated.

                                     MILES
                         What the hell is wrong with you?

                                     WRIGLEY
                         I can't help it. Even with the 
                         business we're in, I -- it gets me 
                         every time. It's so -- optimistic.

                                     MILES
                         Is she going through with it?

               As the crowd quiets with the end of the song, Wrigley murmurs:

                                     WRIGLEY
                         If she's not going through with it, 
                         she's cutting it awful close.

                                     RABBI BOLENSKY
                         Parsley Sage Rosemary and Thyme. 
                         Ingredients. Spices. Spicy ingredients 
                         for the banquet we call -- life. 
                         Marriage is like a Great Feast. 
                         Courtship is the Appetizer. A small 
                         mixed green taste of things to come. 
                         The Early Years -- The First Course -- 
                         a carefully poached fish dish 
                         dependent on freshness and delicate 
                         handling. Or perhaps a light pasta -- 
                         a tortellini stuffed with cheese and 
                         hope.

                                     WRIGLEY
                              (Whispers, to Miles)
                         You have any gum or mints?

                                     RABBI
                         The main course -- Mature Love -- a 
                         hearty stew, cooked slowly in the 
                         oven of companionship until the meat 
                         falls off the bone. And then -- 
                         dessert. The reward for years spent 
                         together -- the sweetness of a Life 
                         Well Lived. A sorbet of grandchildren, 
                         followed by the decafe demitasse of 
                         retirement.

               There is silence, broken only by the twitter of birds and 
               the restlessness of a hungry audience.

               Finally:

                                     RABBI BOLENKSY
                         Do you Chaim David Doyle, take Marylin 
                         to be the Barbara to your Wolfgang 
                         though the lean years as well as 
                         those that are heavily marbled?

                                     DOYLE
                         I do.

                                     RABBI BOLENSKY
                         And do you, Marylin Rexroth, take 
                         Chaim to be the roux in your bechamel? 
                         The stock in your sauce?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I do.

                                     MILES
                         Argh.

               Heads turn. Miles bites a knuckle. Birds twitter.

                                     RABBI BOLENSKY
                         Then, by the power vested in me by 
                         the state of California, and as the 
                         maitre'd in the Prix Fixe Four Star 
                         Restaurant of Life, I now pronounce 
                         you -- man and wife...

               A kiss. Cheers. Applause.

               A RECEPTION ON THE GROUNDS

               Rabbi Bolensky strolls through the crowd with a heaping 
               platter of smoked salmon.

               Miles is darkly brooding as Wrigley opens a Tiffany box to 
               show him the contents.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         What do you think?

                                     MILES
                         What are they?

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Berry spoons.

                                     MILES
                         Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm 
                         surprised at you. What is this? Some 
                         Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are 
                         the most cockamamie things I've ever --

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Miles -- why so angry?

               Miles sounds wistful:

                                     MILES
                         Why couldn't we be the club sandwich?

               Ding Ding -- Howard D. is tapping a knife against his wine 
               glass. The crowd quiets.

                                     DOYLE
                         Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls: 
                         I have something to say to my bride.

               Howard D. turns to one side to address Marylin, taking one 
               of her hands between his paws, as she beams up at him.

                                     DOYLE
                         -- Darling, like the rabbi said... 
                         life is a banquet, A Grand Bouffe, 
                         and Marylin, darling... I just want 
                         you to know that I am IN the kitchen 
                         and I CAN STAND THE HEAT!

               Laughter from the gallery.

                                     DOYLE
                         And I'm going to start this marriage 
                         by EATING MY WORDS. Because the hot 
                         hors d'oerve of this love story is -- 
                         Pre-nup Primavera!

               He reaches into his breast pocket and withdraws a piece of 
               paper.

                                     DOYLE
                         Carmine! Bring on the Pesto!

               A Caterer places a plate and a bowl of sauce in front of 
               Doyle. Marylin looks on, surprised and bemused.

                                     DOYLE
                         -- This is for you, darling.

               He starts tearing strips off the piece of paper, dipping 
               them into the sauce, and eating them. His mouth stuffed with 
               paper, Doyle repeats:

                                     DOYLE
                         -- this is for you, Darling.

               The crowd is murmuring--the murmurs grow in volume -- a 
               smattering of applause -- cheers -- more applause -- wild 
               cheers. Slowly rhythmically, Miles starts thumping his hand 
               together, nodding comprehension.

                                     MILES
                         Brilliant.

               Next to him Wrigley is puzzled.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Why is he doing that?

               Miles' hand-clapping accelerates.

                                     MILES
                         Brilliant. It's brilliant. He's eating 
                         the pre-nup.

               Wrigley's eyes widen. He looks back at Doyle eating the paper.

                                     DOYLE
                         This is for you, Darling!

               Wrigley bursts into tears.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         That's -- the most romantic thing 
                         I've ever seen -- in my LIFE!

                                     DOYLE
                         THIS IS FOR YOU, DARLING!

               LATER

               Marylin stands at the punch bowl accepting congratulations.

               Miles approaches and draws her aside.

                                     MILES
                         I'd like to offer my congratulations. 
                         That was a beautiful gesture of 
                         Howard's.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Howard is a beautiful person.

                         Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. 
                         And I have a feeling that someday 
                         soon you'll be taking that diamond 
                         and leaving the rough.

                         Miles. Miles. Miles.

                                     MILES
                         I am thrilled for you, but tell me 
                         this... How'd you get Howard to do 
                         it? I've addressed enough juries to 
                         appreciate the power of suggestion, 
                         but it seemed like he thought it was 
                         his own idea.

                                     MARYLIN
                         It was his idea. It was a gesture of 
                         love and trust. Be happy for me, 
                         Miles.

                                     MILES
                         Well, when this goes south -- promise 
                         you'll have dinner with me?

                                     MARYLIN
                              (She holds a plate of 
                              food for him)
                         Have you tried the duck?

                                     MILES
                         I figure a couple of months. That's 
                         how long it should take for the ink 
                         on the settlement to dry.

               He takes the plate of food from her.

                                     MARYLIN
                         It has bones. Be sure to swallow 
                         one.

                                     MILES
                         Although knowing you as I do -- there 
                         will be no settlement. This time it 
                         will be complete and total 
                         annihilation.

               INT. LEAR JET COCKPIT

               A uniformed pilot and copilot are cruising the corporate jet 
               high above a vast ocean of clouds. The pilot is wearing a 
               headset. After a long moment of listening he shakes his head.

                                     PILOT

                         -- I've heard some -- I've heard 
                         some sick things -- in my --

                         What?!

               The pilot reaches above his head and throws a small toggle 
               switch and the cockpit is Awash with the sound of screaming, 
               laughter and music:

                                     MALE VOICE
                         Oh Casey Jones was the rounder's

                         to fame!

               INT. CABIN OF LEAR JET

               Screaming with laughter, two naked damsels in conductor's 
               caps are pushing Rex Rexroth around the cabin on a miniature 
               locomotive. He is wearing his railroad boxers and bellowing 
               "The Ballad of Casey Jones."

               BACK TO THE COCKPIT

                                     CO-PILOT
                         Who is that guy?

                                     PILOT
                         Rex Rexroth, the mini-mall king. 
                         Getting to be the richest man on the 
                         West Coast, from what they say.

               The copilot shakes his head.

                                     CO-PILOT
                         Jesus.

                         Why're they going to Muncie?

               The pilot shrugs.

                                     PILOT
                         He's thinking of buying Indiana.

               Wrigley enters.

                         I'm sorry I'm late. I was having 
                         lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. 
                         Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is 
                         divorced!

                                     MILES

                         ...and I hear she's richer than

                         Ah, but is she richer than Mrs.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         She could buy and sell you ten times 
                         over.

                                     MILES
                         She deserves every penny. They pay 
                         great athletes a fortune. Well, 
                         Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the 
                         peak of her power.

               He hits the call button.

                         Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.

                         I'd stay away from her, Miles.

                         I know you would, Wrigley. But would

                         I don't feel victorious Miles. I 
                         feel betrayed, abandoned and 
                         humiliated. I have pictures of him 
                         with another woman...

                         can open an erotic art gallery.

                         Did you invite me here to score some 
                         cheap laughs.

                         appreciate you --

                              (Reproachfully)
                         You really think I engineered the 
                         whole thing. You think the marriage 
                         and the divorce was part of some 
                         scheme. You came here to celebrate 
                         because you think I'm without morality 
                         or soul. You --
                              (With difficulty)
                         sound like my mother.

                         Yes, I -- well, I'm not really...

                                     MILES
                         Not hungry, huh? Neither am I.

               A long pensive moment.

               Miles reaches across the table and takes her hand. She lets 
               him. He strokes it.

               INT. CAR

               Miles drives. Marylin sits silently looking out the window.

               Miles pulls up to the huge house.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Thank you. And good-night.

               He takes her hand again.

                                     MILES
                         Marylin --

               She puts a finger to his lips.

               Sadly, Miles relinquishes her hand.

               She exits the car and walks up to the front door. Miles 
               watches her go.

               INT. BEDROOM - MASSEY MANSION

               We hear Court TV on in the background. Miles alone in bed,

               The woozy track finds the cadaverous hand at the end of the 
               arm with an IV tube swinging from it. Miles stands next to 
               the arm. He's holding an assault type weapon.

               He gazes stuporously about, reaching for the ringing phone.

                         I don't blame them for betraying me. 
                         I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my 
                         father. You see, Miles, I'm going to 
                         tell you something about me. Something 
                         you may or may not know. I suck!

               We hear the SCREECH of Tires.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (yelling at someone)
                         Screw you, asswipe!

                                     MILES
                         Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- 
                         drunk?

                                     MARYLIN
                         A little.
                              (Scream)
                         You get out of the car. That's right, 
                         Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!

                                     MILES
                         You shouldn't be driving. Where are 
                         you?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills 
                         hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in 
                         the Polo...?

                                     MILES
                         I live right near there. The 800 
                         Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- 
                         come here right now before -- just 
                         come here.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and 
                         pick up a blended for --

                                     MILES
                         No. Don't stop.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Okay Miles.

               INT. DEN - MASSEY MANSION

               Marylin sits in the den. She's had some coffee and, although 
               teary and disheveled, is no longer psychotic.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I just cried when I got home. Somehow, 
                         your disdain for me -- I'm pretty 
                         tough Miles, but I'm human. All my 
                         life people have been ascribing these 
                         terrible motives to me. I used to 
                         think they were jealous, or they 
                         didn't understand, but... I dunno. 
                         Maybe others see something in me. 
                         Something I'm not even aware of. 
                         Anyway, thank you for letting me 
                         come here. I guess I was a little 
                         drunk.

               She takes the coffee cup and has a sip. She looks like a 
               lost waif.

                                     MARYLIN
                         You have a very nice home, Miles. 
                         Very inviting.

                                     MILES
                         Thank you.

                                     MARYLIN
                         You have wonderful art. I love that 
                         lithograph. Hockney?

                                     MILES
                         Yes. I just got that, actually. It 
                         was a gift.

                                     MARYLIN
                         From a -- girlfriend.

                                     MILES
                         No. No. I don't have a... no. It was 
                         from a client.

                                     MARYLIN
                         No kidding. I'll bet you have some 
                         very grateful clients. What'd Rex 
                         buy you?

                                     MILES
                         Rex sent me two humidors full of pre-
                         Castro Cubans.

               Marylin looks at a photograph Miles has on a side table.

               A WOMAN AND TWO SMALL BOYS.

               The Woman has her arm around one of them. The other stands 
               close to her. Smiling, but awkward and tentative.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Is that you?

                                     MILES
                         Me. Yes.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Oh. And that is -- mom?

                                     MILES
                         Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.

                                     MARYLIN
                         You look like you were a very 
                         sensitive child. You have expressive 
                         eyes.

               Miles walks over to look at the picture.

                                     MILES
                         Hmmm...

                                     MARYLIN
                         And your mother was very beautiful. 
                         She must be proud of you.

                                     MILES
                         She never particularly cared for me.

                                     MARYLIN
                         She didn't love you?

                                     MILES
                         No. She loved me. She would never 
                         not love her son. She just didn't... 
                         I wasn't her "type." She said I was 
                         a very, colicky baby. You know? 
                         Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't 
                         eat well? We got off to a bad start, 
                         and she never seemed to recoup --

                                     MARYLIN
                         She held that against you?

                                     MILES
                         Apparently she was very disappointed.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Boy. Boy, oh boy.

               Marylin looks at the picture again. And yes -- you can see 
               how hesitant Miles was. Marylin is moved. A flash of something 
               genuine crosses her face.

                                     MARYLIN
                         And here I thought my mother was...

                                     MILES
                         Your mother was.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Oh right. You met Patricia.

               She takes a sip of coffee. Regards Miles.

                                     MARYLIN
                         We're damaged goods.

                                     MILES
                         No, we're not!

                                     MARYLIN
                         We are, Miles. You know I'm right. 
                         There's something "off" about you 
                         and me Miles. And maybe it isn't 
                         because of these women -- maybe they 
                         were just extremely insightful and 
                         recognized our "deficiencies" very 
                         early on. Maybe...

                                     MILES
                         That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch 
                         and yours is a psycho. I can't believe 
                         you're saying this, Marylin! There's 
                         nothing wrong with us. We're 
                         attractive and charismatic and 
                         successful and... I like us.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen 
                         to me. I'm sure you have a very 
                         fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm 
                         depressing.

                                     MILES
                         No.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Thank you for the coffee. It's very 
                         robust.

               She stands. Picks up her purse. Walks over to him with an 
               outstretched hand.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Friends?

                                     MILES
                         Don't go. Stay with me for a while.

               He doesn't release her hand. Instead he draws her to him, 
               and kisses her. She kisses him. He kisses her back. She...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Mile and Marylin -- making love.

               LATER

               They are in post coital wrap.

                                     MILES
                         I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. 
                         I'm never speechless.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not 
                         used to losing control with such -- 
                         volume.

                                     MILES
                         And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- 
                         there's something I want to ask you.

                                     MARYLIN
                         What is it Miles?

                                     MILES
                         I want... I want to...

               She waits, puzzled.

                                     MILES
                         I want to be your -- your wife.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Huh?

                                     MILES
                         No... That wasn't right. I want YOU 
                         to be MY wife.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Did you just propose to me?

                                     MILES
                         Yes. I am. What else could those 
                         words mean? I believe we belong 
                         together and we can make one another 
                         happy. And we should be happy because 
                         happiness is better than the 
                         alternative which is -- just jump in 
                         any old time, Marylin. You have more 
                         experience at this than I do.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes.

                                     MILES
                         Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes, Miles. I accept.

                                     MILES
                         You do?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Do you want me to sleep on it?

                                     MILES
                         No.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Do you want to sleep on it?

                                     MILES
                         No ma'am. I have been asleep all my 
                         life up to this moment. Marylin, 
                         will you marry me?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes. Again.

               They kiss.

                                     MILES
                         I don't have a ring!

                                     MARYLIN
                         I know.

                                     MILES
                         I have a watch.

               She laughs. Kisses him.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm happy.

               INT. CHAPEL

               Miles and Kenneth wait. Dressed in suits. Miles looks nervous.

                                     KENNETH
                         I'm happy for you, pal.

                                     MILES
                         Thanks, buddy.

                                     KENNETH
                         Is she Asian?

                                     MILES
                         Asian? No.

                                     KENNETH
                         Well... I'm still...

               Wrigley, rushes in, carrying a briefcase.

                                     MILES
                         Wrigley?

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Miles.

                                     MILES
                         Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. 
                         Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         The plastic surgeon! I read about 
                         you in LA Style.

                                     MILES
                         Do you have it?

                                     KENNETH
                         I have it.

                                     MILES
                         You have the pre-nup?

                                     KENNETH
                         No. I have the ring. Was I supposed 
                         to have a pre-nup?

                                     MILES
                         No. You have the ring. Wrigley has 
                         the pre-nup.

                                     KENNETH
                         Oh. I thought maybe --
                              (He sees someone)
                         Gee!

               Marylin enters. She looks outstanding. Her friends, Sarah 
               Sorkin and Ramona Barcelona (who is now visibly pregnant) 
               accompany her.

                                     SARAH
                         Dr. Beck!

                                     KENNETH

                         You know each other? Of course you 
                         do.

                                     RAMONA
                         You're Dr. Beck? I have an appointment 
                         to see you in March. Right after I 
                         lose the babyweight. Which of course,

                                     MARYLIN
                         Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- 
                         this is Miles Massey.

                                     SARAH
                         Hello Miles.

                                     RAMONA
                         Congratulations Miles.

                                     MILES
                         Hi. Hello.
                              (To Marylin)
                         Marylin. You know my young associate, 
                         Wrigley.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I do. He was at my divorce and my 
                         wedding. What would a marital related 
                         event be without Wrigley?

                                     WRIGLEY
                         It has become a tradition, hasn't 
                         it?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I loved the berry spoons.
                              (Wrigley beams)
                         I didn't have any. Thank you.

                                     MILES
                         Well, Wrigley brought something else 
                         for you today, darling.

               Wrigley pulls a sheaf of papers from the briefcase.

                                     MILES
                         This -- is the Massey Pre-nup.

               Wrigley hastily pulls a ballpoint from his pocket and clicks 
               it. Miles grabs the pre-nup, and as he turns to Marylin, his 
               tone softens.

                                     MILES
                         Marylin, you're welcome to examine 
                         it, but as you know -- it's iron 
                         clad.

                                     SARAH
                         It is. It's famous.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't 
                         get her.

                                     MILES
                         We wanted Ruth here for your 
                         protection as well --

                                     WRIGLEY
                         The Judge is here. Over here, Judge 
                         Munson.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce 
                         hearing?

                                     MILES
                         Yes. Short notice you know, but I 
                         think there's nice closure to it. 
                         Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as 
                         always.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         What's up with you two.

                                     MILES
                         We're getting married.

               Judge laughs.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         What's the gag?

                                     MILES
                         A gag? No.

               Marylin looks at the pre-nup. Then pulls Miles aside.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Excuse me, Judge Muson.

                                     JUDGE
                         You got it, Patty.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (To Miles)
                         You brought a pre-nup to our wedding?

                                     MILES
                         Yes.
                              (She isn't having the 
                              expected reaction)
                         It's for your protection, sweetheart. 
                         You're the one with the -- the...

                                     WRIGLEY
                         -- the coin?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles. I don't want to sign this. I 
                         want this marriage to be different. 
                         Okay. Judge Munsen and Wrigley are 
                         here, but other than that...

                                     JUDGE
                         Should I go out for a smoke?

                                     MILES
                         No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, 
                         if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit 
                         from the marriage.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Sadly)
                         Oh Miles!

                                     MILES
                         What I mean is, your wealth is 
                         completely protected.

               As if a lead veil had been drawn across. She looks deep into 
               his eyes. Into his soul.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles. Listen to me. You are about 
                         to become my husband. I don't want 
                         to be protected from you. I want to 
                         be protected for you.

                                     WRIGLEY
                              (Moved)
                         Ohhh...

                                     MILES
                         But?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I want this to be a marriage based 
                         on love, trust and community property. 
                         That's all I've ever wanted.

                                     SARAH
                         But Marylin, without this, you're 
                         completely exposed.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I want to be exposed.

                                     RAMONA
                         You're vulnerable.

                                     MARYLIN
                         It's about time.

                                     JUDGE
                         You're a sitting duck.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (To Miles, with great 
                              affection)
                         Quack.

               INT. CHAPEL

               Miles and Marylin stand before the alter.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         Do you, Miles Herbert Massey of Massey 
                         Meyerson take Marylin Hamilton-Rexroth-
                         Doyle?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         "Doyle", to be your lawful wedded 
                         wife to --

                                     MILES
                         I do, yah I do, uh huh --

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         Let me finish!

               She glares at Miles.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         -- Jesus! Haven't you ever been 
                         married before?

               Chastened, Miles bows his head.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         -- To have and hold, to love and to 
                         cherish, till death do you part?

               There is a long beat, through which Miles stares at his shoes.

               Marylin looks at him.

                                     MILES
                         -- I do.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         And do you, Marylin Hamilton-Rexroth 
                         Doyle, take Miles Herbert Massey of 
                         Massey Meyerson, to be your lawful 
                         wedded husband, to have and to hold, 
                         to love and to cherish, till death 
                         do you part?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I do.

                                     JUDGE MUNSON
                         I now pronounce you man and wife.

               Wrigley bursts into tears.

               THE MARRIED MASSEY MONTAGE

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MASSEY HOUSE - MORNING

               Miles and Marylin asleep in bed. The ALARM RINGS. Miles wakes, 
               turns to his beautiful wife -- kisses her good morning.

               She gives him a sleepy Smile.

               Miles dressing for work. Marylin, in a Sabia Rosa bathrobe 
               places a tray with coffee next to him. He holds up two ties 
               for her-approval. She selects one. He puts it on.

               Miles and Marylin reading Newspapers while eating breakfast. 
               She serves him a bowl of fruit and indicates Wrigley's berry 
               spoons. They laugh heartily.

               Marylin waves good bye as Miles backs drives to the office. 
               She waves at the gardeners who blow palm fronds around the 
               lawn.

               MILES OFFICE

               He has managed to fill his credenza with pictures of married 
               life. Due to its brevity -- these pictures are uneventful, 
               the Massey's wear the same outfit in most of them.

               Miles works. He is interrupted by the voice of his SECRETARY.

                                     SECRETARY
                         I have Mrs. Massey on line one for 
                         you.

               Miles picks up.

                                     MILES
                         Mom...?

               He laughs and laughs. We hear Marylin's laughter coming 
               through the receiver.

               Miles exits a flower store with a bouquet of tulips. Marylin 
               at the doorway, greets Miles as he arrives home.

               As Miles changes into his casual after work outfit, (khakis?) 
               Marylin sits at the edge of the bed. He's telling her about 
               his day, and she is rapt with attention.

               The Massey's have a candlelit dinner of fish and pasta. The 
               tulips are in the middle of the table.

               Miles and Marylin snuggle on a couch and watch Seinfeld. 
               Miles in bed on the new Frette Linen. A few too many pillows, 
               but he's making it work. Marylin enters the bedroom in a 
               nightshirt that is the perfect combination of innocence and 
               nastiness. He puts down his book as she gets into bed with 
               him.

               They gaze at one another -- the picture of contentment and 
               impending lust.

               EXT. MASSEY MYERSON - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               Miles is addressing the young associates.

                                     MILES
                         For the first time in my life, I 
                         stand before you naked... 
                         vulnerable... and in love. Love. A 
                         word matrimonial lawyers shy away 
                         from. Ironic isn't it -- that I have 
                         been frightened of this emotion which 
                         is, in a sense, the seed of my 
                         livelihood. But today, I am here to 
                         tell you: Love should cause us no 
                         fear. Love should cause us no shame. 
                         Love... is good.
                              (He lets it sink in)
                         Let me ask you a question. When our 
                         clients come to us confused, angry, 
                         hurting because their flame of love 
                         is fluttering and threatens to die -- 
                         should we seek to extinguish that 
                         flame, so that we can sift through 
                         the smoldering wreckage for our paltry 
                         reward? Or should we seek to fan 
                         this precious flame -- this most 
                         precious flame -- back to loving, 
                         roaring life?

               The young associates look confused. Wrigley raises his hand.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Extinguish?

                                     MILES
                         Should we counsel fear -- or trust? 
                         Should we seek to destroy -- or to 
                         build? Should we meet our clients' 
                         problems with cynicism -- or with 
                         love?

                                     MILES
                              (another raised hand)
                         Kramer?

                                     KRAMER
                         Build?

                                     MILES
                         The decision of course, is each of 
                         ours. For my part, I have made the 
                         leap of love, and there is no going 
                         back --

               Herb Myserson sits in the back of the room. He watches, 
               breathing heavily.

               INT. DEN - MASSEY HOUSE

               Miles and Marylin watching a cable movie crowded together on 
               the small sofa.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll 
                         move to the...

                                     MILES
                         No. Stay. I want you close to me. 
                         This couch is wrong. It's not a 
                         "married couch."

               He surveys his surroundings with a critical eye.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Honey, I could sit...

                                     MILES
                         In fact, this is not a married house -- 
                         it's a bachelor pad.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Hardly. You have six bedrooms

                                     MILES
                         I know. But I've converted most of 
                         them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- 
                         a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- 
                         Honey, want you to go out, as soon 
                         as you feel up to it -- and buy 
                         married things. Woman things. 
                         Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make 
                         this your house.

               He hands her a credit card.

                                     MILES
                         Here's my card. Spend as much as you 
                         want. We get mileage.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Well, I suppose I could "girly" it 
                         up for you with a little Fortuny, 
                         and some passementerie --

                                     MILES
                         Good.
                              (Beat)
                         Are those foods?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Fabric and fringe.

                                     MILES
                         Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not 
                         right away -- There's a room right 
                         off the bedroom -- It would be perfect 
                         for a nursery.
                              (He takes her hands)
                         It's a walk in humidor right now -- 
                         but if I took out the refrigeration 
                         unit --

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles.

                                     MILES
                         I think a nursery should be right 
                         off the master suite. My parents put 
                         mine in the guest house. Apparently 
                         they did have a Fisher Price intercom, 
                         but my mother turned it off when I 
                         was seven months old because I was 
                         so --

               She stops him with a kiss.

                                     MILES
                         You want children, don't you?

               INT. QUATRAIN ANTIQUES - DAY

               A pricey antique store near Melrose.

                                     RAMONA
                         You said 'yes' didn't you?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I said yes.

               She picks up an antique Chinese bowl.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Is this Ming?

                                     SARAH
                         It's not Ming. It's Tong.

                                     RAMONA
                         Is Tong older than Ming?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I think Ming is older than Tong.
                              (To the Salesman 
                              hovering nearby)
                         What is this?

                                     SALESMAN
                         That is a Chinese Prayer Bowl. It's 
                         Chen dynasty.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Ok. I'll take it.

               He sets it aside next to the formidable pile of loot the 
               girls have accumulated.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I can't do this anymore. Let's get 
                         some lunch.

                                     SARAH
                         What about rugs? I thought we were 
                         stopping at Mansour?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Right.

                                     SALESMAN
                              (To Marylin)
                         And will this be check or --?

               She hands him the Platinum Visa.

                                     SALESMAN
                              (Glances at it)
                         Very good, Mrs. Massey.

               He trots off with the card.

               Marylin absently fingers an antique guided candelabra.

                                     MARYLIN
                              (Sigh)
                         Well. He said to "make the house 
                         mine."

                                     RAMONA
                         Oh boy. If he only knew.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yeah. I guess. You know --

                                     SARAH
                         What?

                                     MARYLIN
                         He's not what I expected. He's very -- 
                         he's so -- happy.

                                     SARAH
                         But you're going through with it?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've 
                         never been the first wife. Rex was 
                         married before me.

                                     SARAH
                         So what?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles is different. He's still so 
                         idealistic.

                                     SARAH
                         Well, that's about to change big 
                         time.

                                     MARYLIN
                         He has no cynicism or anger. For 
                         once I'm not the repository of rage 
                         at some other woman.

                                     SARAH
                         Soon, you'll have your own rage!

                                     MARYLIN
                         I guess.

               INT. FLOWER STORE - EVENING

               Miles is buying a huge bouquet of flowers. As he exits he is 
               stopped by a WOMAN. She is in her 40's but looks older.

                                     WOMAN
                         Wait. I know you.

                                     MILES
                         Yes?

                                     WOMAN
                         You're Miles Massey! You probably 
                         don't recognize me. The drugs made 
                         me put on weight and grow facial 
                         hair.

                                     MILES
                         Excuse me?

                                     WOMAN
                         You ruined my life you sonofabitch. 
                         Gimme those.

               She grabs the flowers. Pulls petal off one of the roses and 
               eats it.

                                     WOMAN
                         But my brother got you. He got you, 
                         you slimeball.

               A NURSE runs over.

                                     NURSE
                         Emily!

                                     MILES
                         What are you...
                              (To the nurse)
                         Is she yours?

                                     WOMAN
                         Howard Doyle is my brother? You know 
                         my brother, Howard Doyle. You do 
                         know my brother, don't you?

                                     NURSE
                         I'm sorry, Sir. Emily. Give the man 
                         back.

                                     MILES
                         Yes, I know Howard Doyle.

                                     WOMAN
                         He tricked you. With a phony wife 
                         and a fake pre-nup. Howard Doyle. He 
                         got you. You married Marylin, didn't 
                         you? You thought she had money. HA 
                         HA HA. Howard Doyle made you think 
                         that because of what you did to me. 
                         And to Marylin Rexroth. Yeah. I heard 
                         all about it. My brother Howard Doyle 
                         got you.

               INT. RUTH RABINOW'S OFFICE

               Ruth calmly watches Miles ranting around her office.

                                     MILES
                         He divorced his wife -- he married 
                         Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- 
                         and he -- remarried his WIFE? What 
                         kind of sick --

                                     RUTH
                         Marylin was friends with Howard and 
                         Amanda Doyle. They don't like the 
                         way you operate. They helped her.

                                     MILES
                         He never ate the pre-nup, did he!

                                     RUTH
                         I have no idea what Howard Doyle 
                         eats. I'm not a damn dietician.

                                     MILES
                         Did Marylin end up with money?

                                     RUTH
                         She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask 
                         her? Anyway, I assume she signed the 
                         highly over rated Massey pre-nup.

                                     MILES
                         I don't have a pre-nup

               Miles hangs his head. Ruth sighs sympathetically.

                                     RUTH
                         ...The fault, dear Brutus, is not in 
                         our stars...

                                     MILES
                         Don't give me that crap. That's MY 
                         crap.

                                     RUTH
                         And it's good!

                                     MILES
                         I'll have you suspended. I'll have 
                         you disbarred.

                                     RUTH
                         Don't threaten me, Miles. I did 
                         nothing illegal.

                                     MILES
                         ...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?

                                     RUTH
                         That's attorney client privilege.
                              (As she goes back 
                              into her work)
                         Sorry, Miles. But as a great and 
                         clever man once said, What's good 
                         for the goose --

               INT. MASSEY HOUSE - NIGHT

               Marylin greets him at the door.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Hi.

                                     MILES
                         Hello Marylin.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I have a surprise for you.

                                     MILES
                         I bet.

               She brings him inside. The place has been massively 
               accessorized. Antiques, rugs, lamps and assorted tasteful 
               chatchkies. There is a new Biedermeyer couch in the den.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Ta Da.

               Miles looks at it, expressionless.

                                     MARYLIN
                         You don't like it?

               He stares at her -- a very dark look.

                                     MARYLIN
                         You don't like me?

                                     MILES
                              (Flatly)
                         I love you. I want to have your baby.

                                     MARYLIN
                         What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too 
                         much?

               She retrieves all the receipts from her purse.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles. I have a very good relationship 
                         with all the salesmen. I can return 
                         everything.

                                     MILES
                         Can you Marylin? Can you return the 
                         trust? Can you return the hopes? The 
                         dreams? Can you just...
                              (Bitterly)
                         SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles? You're scaring me.

                                     MILES
                              (Pulls himself together)
                         I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's 
                         chic and timeless and elegant and 
                         eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It 
                         is YOU.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Marylin is on the phone with Ruth.

                                     MARYLIN
                         But Ruth -- things have changed -- 
                         yes -- yes I understand. But you see -- 
                         I couldn't file, did I? And maybe I 
                         wasn't going to file. Maybe -- maybe 
                         Ruth -- Yes. Okay.

               OUTSIDE BEDROOM - MASSEY HOUSE - NIGHT

               The bedroom door is closed. Marylin knocks repeatedly.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles? Open the door, Miles. Please 
                         open the door. I want to talk to 
                         you. Miles? I'm coming in. Here I 
                         come.

               She pushes the door open. No Miles in sight. On the bed, 
               scrawled on a piece of mMm stationery, taped to one of the 
               mMm Frette pillows -- a note which reads -- "If you prick 
               us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If 
               you poison us, do we not die? AND IF YOU WRONG US SHALL WE 
               NOT REVENGE?"

               INT. KENNETH'S HOUSE

               Kenneth stares at the chessboard. Court TV is on the 
               background.

               TV SCREEN

               COURT TV REPORTER

               We are back at the Trial of New Jersey v. Medrano. Mr. Medrano 
               is accused of killing his wife, Alicia in 1992. He claims it 
               was suicide. Let's return to the courtroom.

               See the action in the courtroom --

               The Prosecutor shows the jury an extremely large handgun.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         How far would this gun have to be in 
                         order to inflict a wound without 
                         leaving powder burns on the scalp.

                                     EXPERT WITNESS
                         Approximately three feet.

                                     PROSECUTOR
                         And how could Mrs. Medrano shoot 
                         herself in the back of the head from 
                         a distance of three feet?

                                     KENNETH
                         Really long arms?

               He moves a piece.

                                     MILES
                         They won't get a conviction. The 
                         husband called it in as a suicide. 
                         The forensic guys weren't thinking 
                         murder. I'm sure some of the evidence 
                         was compromised.

                                     KENNETH
                         It's your move, Miles.

                                     MILES
                              (Sadly)
                         I already made my move, Kenneth.

               INT. MASSEY HOUSE

               A private yoga class. Marylin, Sarah and Ramona are in the 
               plow position. The yuppie Sikh instructor places his weight 
               on Sarah.

                                     SARAH
                         Vishu! Knock it off. That hurts.

                                     VISHNU
                         Breathe through it.

               Sarah tries a few deep breaths. Marylin concentrates hard.

                                     VISHNU
                         That's good, Marylin.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I don't even know where he is. He 
                         looked so devastated. If I could 
                         just talk to him for a few minutes.

               SFX DOORBELL

                                     MARYLIN
                         Was that the bell?

                                     RAMONA
                         It sounded like a bell.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'll be right back.

               Marylin walks to the door. Opens it. Two POLICE OFFICERS.

                         We have a warrant for your arrest.

               Marylin is photographed front and profile. She is finger 
               printed; she is searched and relieved of her jewelry; and 
               finally, she is throw into a holding tank with several other 
               women -- trapped. She clings despondently to the bars.

                         You can go now, Mrs. Massey. Someone 
                         made bail.

               Marylin exits.

               INT. RUTH'S CAR

               Marylin sits next to Ruth.

                         Forgery and Fraud?

                                     RUTH
                         You used his credit card.

                                     MARYLIN
                         He told me to -- he said he wanted 
                         me to --

                                     RUTH
                         Quite a little shopping spree. How 
                         do you spend six figures in less 
                         than six hours? Oh, never mind I've 
                         seen it before. I've seen everything.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Do you think he set me up? Do you 
                         think that was his intention?

                                     RUTH
                         Like I know his intention? Or yours 
                         for that matter?
                              (Sighs)
                         I should join Sam. I'm too old for 
                         this bullshit.

                         He never even asked. He just assumed --

                                     RUTH
                         He was right, wasn't he?

                                     MARYLIN
                         So. Now what?

                                     RUTH
                         Now? Well, Marylin, now you cut a 
                         deal or find out how Jean Harris 
                         made it work for her.

               INT. MASSEY HOUSE - DAY

               Miles opens the door. Marylin is standing there.

                                     MILES
                         Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!

                                     MARYLIN
                         May I come in?

                                     MILES
                         I don't know. Maybe I should grab my 
                         mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have 
                         little experience with "the criminal 
                         mind."

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'd just like to pick up a few of my 
                         things

                                     MILES
                         I don't believe you have "things."

                                     MARYLIN
                         On the contrary. We're married and 
                         we have no pre-nup, so a case could 
                         be made that everything in here is 
                         mine.

               Marylin walks into the den. Sits on the new sofa.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Comfy!

                                     MILES
                         What do you want?

                                     MARYLIN
                         I want to nail you ass.

                                     MILES
                         Are you threatening me, because I'm 
                         sure that's a violation of the terms 
                         of your bail.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm reporting you to the IRS.

                                     MILES
                         The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting 
                         a refund.

               He laughs. She looks at him, dead serious.

                                     MILES
                         I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported 
                         every dollar I've ever made. Try 
                         again, girlfriend.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm not talking about dollars, 
                         studmuffin. I'm talking about --

               She opens a humidor and takes out a Cigar.

                                     MARYLIN
                         STUFF.
                              (Chomping on the Cigar)
                         Got a light?

                                     MILES
                         What kind of "stuff?"

               She reaches into her purse. Pulls out a Dunhill and expertly 
               lights the cigar.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Arty Farty stuff.
                              (Pointing to the

                         Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. 
                         Watches and mileage on private jets. 
                         Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from 
                         grateful clients.

                                     MILES
                         Those are gifts.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Salary. Unreported income.
                              (Glancing at his watch)
                         By the way, what time IS it on 
                         Bellagio Road?

                                     MILES
                         You can't prove anything.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I don't have to. That's what the IRS 
                         guys do. And they do it with great 
                         zeal. See, they work at these tortuous 
                         civil service jobs, and when five 
                         hundred dollar an hour boys like you 
                         take their trade out in luxury 
                         goodies, these saps feel.. well, 
                         they feel like saps. And they feel 
                         bitter and they feel vengeful and 
                         they feel WRATH.
                              (Puffing on the cigar)
                         What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?

                                     MILES
                         You're out of your league, Marylin. 
                         Rexroth was a primate. I'm a 
                         professional.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I know. So am I, right? And so is 
                         Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue 
                         Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid 
                         graduate of Southwestern University -- 
                         very tenacious, and never more so 
                         than when he's dealing with an 
                         unscrupulous colleague.
                              (She stands to leave)
                         I think it's only fair to warn you: 
                         I'm going to file an action, Miles. 
                         And after a decent interval I plan 
                         to have Ruth seek an injunction that 
                         will forbid your approach within 500 
                         feet of my house.

                                     MILES
                         Meaning my house.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I believe the residence will be part 
                         of the settlement.

                                     MILES
                         Did our marriage ever mean anything 
                         to you?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Drop the bogus forgery charge and 
                         I'll forget about your generous 
                         friends slash clients.

                                     MILES
                         That's blackmail.

                                     MARYLIN
                         That's marriage.

               She gives him a peck on the cheek. As she leaves:

                                     MARYLIN
                         You'll always be my favorite husband.

               Miles sits dejectedly on the new sofa looking at the 
               paintings. He looks at the watch. And the cigars. And the 
               picture of his mother.

                                     MILES
                         Pity you can't be here. You'd enjoy 
                         this.

               CLOSE ON A BAG OF FLUIDS

               We pull back from the milky yellowish bag of fluid to show 
               that a nurse is unhooking and removing it from under Herb 
               Meyerson's wheelchair where it collects drainage.

               She now places it up on the IV gantry and connects, and swaps 
               the now empty drip under the wheelchair to collect drainage. 
               We are once again in Herb Meyerson's gloomy office, its 
               venetians blocking most of the light and making Herb a dark, 
               enigmatic figure.

                                     HERB
                         This woman has humbled, shamed and 
                         disgrazed the entire foim.

               A reverse shows Miles standing in front of Herb's desk.

                                     MILES
                         Yes Herb,

                                     HERB
                         Counseluh, this foim deals in powuh. 
                         This foim deals in p'seption. This

                         to the music..

               He waves his free arm to the beat of music unheard.

                                     HERB
                         -- of the hoidy-goidy.

                                     MILES
                         I understand Herb... I just... for 
                         the first time in my career -- I 
                         don't know what to do. I'm a patsy. 
                         A sitting duck. I'm lost.

                                     HERB
                         Lost! I'll tell you what you can do, 
                         you can --

               He brings himself up short and turns to the nurse.

                                     HERB
                         -- leave us.

               She heads for the door.

                                     HERB
                         -- You can act like a man. Let me 
                         tell you sumpn, smart guy. You tawt 
                         you had it all figgud out. Trust.

                         gonna talk to you about the goddamn 
                         LAW.

               He climbs unsteadily to his feet and tries to pace, 
               gesticulating, with the IV swaying dangerously behind him.

                                     HERB
                         -- We SOIVE THE LAW! We HONUH the

                         counseluh, we OBEY THE LAW --

               He pauses to let this sink in.

                                     HERB
                         -- but conseluh -- This is not one a

               CLOSE ON

               An edgy looking gangster, JOE. He is perspiring heavily. He 
               breathes through his mouth with the rasping wheeze of an 
               asthmatic.

               His labored breath rattles as he stares across the table at 
               someone off. At length, a voice:

                                     VOICE
                         ...Are you Joe?

               Still staring, but perhaps by way of answer, the gangster 
               raises an inhaler, sticks it in his mouth, and squeezes. 
               WHUSH.

               A reverse shows Miles seated across a small round table in a 
               seedy low-lit clam house. Photos of Ted Kennedy and the Pope

                                     MILES
                         Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. 
                         Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, 
                         neutralize a, uh, business associate 
                         by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle 
                         Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.

                                     GANGSTER
                         Is that... one person?

                                     MILES
                         Here's her picture...

               He is shoving an envelope across the table.

                                     MILES
                         ...and the address where she's 
                         staying. It's the residence of a Mr. 
                         Massey. Uh, Dumbarton. Massey. Uh, 
                         it's not Mr. Dumbarton's house. Though 
                         he's not involved. And because of an 
                         impending legal action this needs to 
                         happen within a certain... time frame. 
                         Uh... on an expedited basis.

               The gangster stares expressionlessly. He raises the inhaler 
               again and, with his eyes still on Miles, squeezes. WHUSH.

                                     GANGSTER
                         You're in a rush.

                                     MILES
                         Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.

               A long beat. Finally, Miles explodes

                                     MILES
                         She won't suffer, will she?

               He bites a knuckle, gazing fearfully at the gangster. The 
               gangster stares impassively back.

                                     GANGSTER
                         ...not unless you pay extra.

               INT. REX REXROTH MANSION

               An enormous oak paneled room. Furnished with chairs sofas 
               and a huge circular bed. A fire roars in the far corner. On 
               the wall above the bed a film loop is being projected -- 
               soft core pornographic images.

               On the bed, Rex is surrounded by three naked beauties, smeared 
               in cola dust and wearing conductor caps.

                                     REX
                         I've been working on the railroad --

                                     TARTS
                         All the livelong day!

                                     REX
                         I've been working on the railroad

                                     TARTS
                         Just to pass the time away!

                                     REX
                         Can'tcha hear the whistle... the 
                         whistle... AWWWWWWW.

               Rex hunches over, clutching his left arm.

               One by one, the girls stop dancing and stare. There is a 
               somber silence, broken by another.

                                     REX
                         Awwwwwww --

               The girls are all watching now. One of them steps forward.

                                     TART
                         -- Whatsa matter, Rexie?

               INT. KENNETH'S HOUSE

               A guest room. Dark, dirty and filled with empty bottles of 
               expensive French wine.

               We hear a phone ringing in a different room. It rings several 
               times.

               The figure on the bed stirs, rolls over, moans, clamps a 
               pillow over his head.

               The ring of the distant telephone is interrupted and we hear 
               a muffled voice:

                                     VOICE
                         Hello. Yes, he's here. Just a minute --

               We hear approaching footsteps and Kenneth enters the 
               background, knotting a bathrobe. He turns on the light in 
               the room.

                                     KENNETH
                         Miles. It's for you.

               The figure on the couch pulls away the pillow. It is indeed 
               Miles Massey. He blearily takes the offered phone.

                                     MILES
                         Hello. Yes -- what?! Yes -- I see --

               After another listening beat he drops the phone away. He 
               remains staring dully out into space.

                                     MILES
                         My God.

                                     KENNETH
                         What?

                                     MILES
                         That was Marvin Untermeyer.

                                     KENNETH
                         Yes?

                                     MILES
                         He was Rex Rexroth's personal 
                         attorney.

                                     KENNETH
                         What do you mean, was.

                                     MILES
                         Rex just had a massive coronary. In 
                         the middle of a business meeting. 
                         He's dead.

               Kenneth is mildly puzzled.

                                     KENNETH
                         I'm sorry to hear that. But you 
                         weren't close, were you?

                                     MILES
                         Marvin says that Rex's will is four 
                         years old. He never redrafted it.

                                     KENNETH
                         Yes.

               Miles voice is still flat, expressionless:

                                     MILES
                         Everything goes to Marylin.

               He looks up a at Kenneth.

                                     MILES
                         She's rich. We're still married. We 
                         have no pre-nup.

                                     KENNETH
                         So, that's good, right?

               MINUTES LATER

               Miles paces with the telephone. He punches numbers with the 
               thumb of the hand holding the phone; his other hand holds a 
               coffee cup from which he takes trembling slurps.

                                     VOICE
                         This is Joe. Wuddya need?

               Then a beep.

                                     MILES
                         Joe. This is Mr. uh... friend of -- 
                         we met. This is to instruct you it's 
                         No Go! Do you understand me?! NO GO 
                         on Marylin Rexroth Doyle -- No Go.

               He slams down the phone.

                                     KENNETH
                         Who was that?

                                     MILES
                         That was -- oh, shit. What if he's 
                         on his way over there?

                                     KENNETH
                         Huh?

               Consumed with remorse, Miles moans.

                                     MILES
                         Marylin! What have I done?

                                     KENNETH
                         I don't know, but don't call me 
                         Marylin.

               MILES CAR

               Miles drives, speeding, taking corners hard while punching 
               numbers into his car phone.

                                     MILES
                         Get her out, buy some time; get her 
                         out --

               INT. MASSEY MANSION - NIGHT

               In the bedroom, the phone starts ringing. A hand enters to 
               pick it up. We follow the hand up to reveal

                                     MARYLIN
                         Hello?

               MILES SPEEDING CAR

                                     MILES
                         Marylin?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Miles? Miles! Where have you been? 
                         I've been trying to get in touch.

                                     MILES
                         You have to leave the house 
                         immediately!

                                     MARYLIN
                         I will, Miles. I will leave. But 
                         Miles --

                                     MILES
                         No buts. Now. Out.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. 
                         It's true that my initial intention 
                         was to...

                                     MILES
                         Please! Leave the house.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I fell in love Miles.

                                     MILES
                         So did I. Now pack up a few basics 
                         and --

                                     MARYLIN
                         You do? You do love me?

               MASSEY MANSION

               Marylin hangs up the phone.

               She walks slowly around the room, pausing at the mantelpiece 
               to pick up a framed picture of Miles, which she 
               contemplatively regards.

               We pan with her continued walk to bring Joe into frame. He 
               stands with his back pressed to the wall. She's started for 
               a moment, but quickly recoups:

                                     MARYLIN
                         Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.

                                     JOE
                         Mr. Dumbarton.

               She shows him the picture of Miles.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Is this Mr. Dumbarton?

                                     JOE
                         No...

               She cocks an eye at him.

                                     JOE
                         That's his lawyer.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Triple!

                                     JOE
                         Who's the pigeon?

               We faintly hear a car screeching to a halt.

               EXT. MASSEY MANSION

               Massey exits the car. He clutches a can of mace.

               INT. MANSION

               We hear a key scrape in the lock. The front door swings open 
               onto a dark foyer as Miles tiptoes in.

                                     MILES
                              (Whispers)
                         Marylin?

               DINING ROOM

               Miles tiptoes through, looking warily about. He backs through 
               the swinging doors connecting to the kitchen. Finds himself 
               face to face with Joe.

                                     MILES
                         Joe! Thank God you're in time. You're 
                         not in time. I'm in time. Thank God 
                         I'm in time.

               Joe stares at him.

                                     MILES
                         It's a no go! Get it? No one any the 
                         wiser. Okay!

               He makes a cow-herding motion with his hands.

                                     MILES
                         You can go home now! Goodbye! Thanks 
                         so much!

               Joe takes out his gun.

                                     MILES
                         No no! No contract! It's all over.

               This has no effect on Joe who is unscrewing his silencer.

               Miles is exasperated. Suddenly -- Marylin appears.

                                     MARYLIN
                         It's a no go, Joe.

                                     MILES
                         Marylin!

                                     MARYLIN
                         It's okay Joe.

               Joe glances at both of them with barely concealed contempt.

                                     MILES
                         Wait! He works for YOU?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Now. But first, he worked for you.

                                     MILES
                         You were going to have this thug...?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Wait just a second there. You sent 
                         him here. You unearthed this 
                         pestilence.

                                     JOE
                         You're calling me a pestilence? That's 
                         a hoot!

                                     MARYLIN
                              (To Joe)
                         I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- 
                         but, we changed our minds.
                              (To Miles)
                         Did you really mean what you said on 
                         the phone. It wasn't because you 
                         found out about Rex?

                                     MILES
                         Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. 
                         I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No 
                         matter what happened to you.

                                     MARYLIN
                         That's true.

                                     JOE
                         Lemme tell you something. You are 
                         the pestilence. I'm the exterminator.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay 
                         you the twenty thousand.

                                     MILES
                         It was fifty for you.

                                     JOE
                              (To Miles)
                         That's cause you're a lawyer. I gave 
                         her the lawyer discount.
                              (Looks at Marylin)
                         But I shouldn't of. Cause you're a 
                         whore. A whore who worships the 
                         dollar.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Well, actually, all whores worship 
                         the dollar, if you want to get 
                         technical.

                                     JOE
                         Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like 
                         you. And my clients? Whores just 
                         like you.

                                     MILES
                         Were you with a firm?

                                     JOE
                         Kaplan.

                                     MILES
                         Kaplan? I know Kaplan. Wait. You're 
                         Joe Gittelson? I knew you looked -- 
                         You were great -- we studied you.

                                     JOE
                         Twenty years in "matrimonial law" 
                         and it made me sick.
                              (He wheezes)
                         I broke up homes and families, never 
                         givin' it a second thought. Till one 
                         day. I had an epiphany. You know 
                         what that is?
                              (They nod)
                         Came with a damn stigmata if you can 
                         believe that! I said to myself -- 
                         Joe -- everyone you see wants blood. 
                         Everyone wants their ex's dead. So 
                         why jerk around with rest. You wanna 
                         best serve your clients? Kill em.

               Joe is raising the gun at Miles. Miles sprays him with Mace.

               BANG -- Joe fires blindly, scrunching his eyes against the 
               chemical, sucking for breath like a jet engine revving for a 
               take-off.

               SLAM -- Marylin elbows him in the face, breaking his nose. 
               She finishes with a solid groin kick. It slows him down, but 
               doesn't stop him.

               Joe stumbles a bit, but regains his footing.

               BANG -- Joe is rampaging around the room, still firing, 
               thumping at his chest with his free hand for his inhaler. 
               Marylin runs to Miles. He takes her hand and they run toward 
               the door, seeking egress.

               BANG -- still firing, he pulls out the inhaler but blindly 
               bobbles it.

               Joe reaches with his gun hand to keep the inhaler from 
               falling. He momentarily bobbles both gun and inhaler.

               Miles pops up in front of him.

                                     MILES
                         Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.

                                     MARYLIN
                         I'm not leaving you. I took self 
                         defense

               Joe recovers and raises the gun to his mouth as he points 
               the inhaler at Miles.

               He squeezes -- WHUSH -- Miles squints against the asthma 
               mist and lets out a horrified:

                                     MILES
                         Joe!

               BANG! The off-screen gunshot is followed by the sound of a 
               body dropping heavily to the floor.

               Silence.

               Marylin runs over to Miles. They look sadly down at the floor.

                                     MILES
                         WE told him it was no go...

               INT. MASSEY MYERSON CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               Wrigley sits bouncing the steepled fingers of one hand against 
               the other.

               Miles sits gazing sadly out the window.

               The room is empty.

               There is the whir of ventilation.

               The click of the door attracts both their attention and brings 
               them to their feet.

               Marylin walks in, chic and beautiful as ever, followed by 
               Ruth, who sits next to her, places her attaché case on the 
               table top, and snaps its clasps.

                                     RUTH
                         Alright.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Ruth.

               Miles and Marylin are looking at each other. Quietly:

                                     MILES
                         Hello Marylin.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Hello Miles.

                                     MILES
                         Hard to believe this is the way it 
                         will end up for us.

                                     MARYLIN
                         It's not something I wanted either.

                                     MILES
                         But then -- I guess -- something 
                         inside me died when I realized that 
                         you'd hired a goon to kill me.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt 
                         when I realized you'd hired the goon 
                         to kill...

                                     RUTH
                         Now you both wait a minute. Nobody 
                         hired anyone to kill anyone.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Hear, hear.

               There is an uncomfortable shifting in seats. Wrigley looks 
               at Miles.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         Apparently, from what I can gather, 
                         a burglar broke into your house -- 
                         became despondent over his lifestyle 
                         and shot himself.

               Miles is still looking at Marylin.

                                     MILES
                         Where does that leave us?

                                     RUTH
                         We've outlined a settlement...

               She pushes a piece of paper across the table.

                                     RUTH
                         We think it's more than generous.

               Miles ignores the paper, which lies unclaimed on the middle 
               of the table. He looks at Marylin.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         My client is prepared to consider a 
                         reconciliation.

               Marylin looks a Miles.

                                     MARYLIN
                         How could I trust you, after... after 
                         all of this.

               Miles, staring at Marylin, cuts in:

                                     MILES
                         You wounded me first, Marylin.

                                     MARYLIN
                         Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?

                                     MILES
                         You're forgetting Howard Doyle?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Forgery? Fraud?

                                     MILES
                         Income tax evasion?

                                     MARYLIN
                         Murder?

                                     MILES
                         Murder!

                                     MARYLIN
                         I don't see how we can ever find our 
                         way back from...

               Miles, with his eyes still on Marylin, reaches into his suit 
               coat. He withdraws a piece of paper, spreads it flat on the 
               table in front of him and, still gazing at her:

                                     MILES
                         You know... there's nothing in the 
                         Massey pre-nup that says it can't be 
                         executed after the parties wed.

               He decisively clicks the button on a ballpoint pen, looks 
               down at the paper in front of him and scribbles his name.

               He pushes the paper across the table toward Marylin.

               Gazing at him, seeking the truth in his eyes, she absently 
               picks up the paper.

               There is a long silence. We hear only the hum of ventilation, 
               and Wrigley's quiet snuffling.

               Ruth is looking down her nose through her glasses -- over 
               Marylin's shoulder -- at the sheet of paper. Marylin however, 
               looks only at Miles.

                                     RUTH
                         It's the Massey pre-nup --

               Marylin rips the paper in half.

                                     RUTH
                              (bored)
                         O-kay. I'm going back to the office

               Wrigley sobs openly.

                                     RUTH
                         Come on Wrigley, I'll buy you a drink 
                         and an anti depressant.

                                     WRIGLEY
                         No one will ever love me that way.

                                     RUTH
                         Not if you're lucky. No.

               Miles rises slowly to his feet.

               He puts his knuckles on the tabletop and leans forward.

               Marylin rises slowly to her feet.

               She leans forward.

               They kiss.

                                     MILES
                         Let's go home.

               EXT. MASSEY HOUSE - DAY

               We hear a SMASHING -- BREAKING.

               Gardeners look up briefly from the leaf blowing -- but quickly 
               prioritize and continue blasting sycamore leaves from one 
               end of the yard to the other.

               TRACK THROUGH HOUSE TO

               INT. MASSEY BEDROOM

               The smashing is becoming louder.

               AN AXE

               Breaks the beautiful wood panelling in the room next to the 
               master suite.

                                     MILES
                         Wait. Just wait for one minute. Sweet 
                         Jesus, are you crazy?

               CONSTRUCTION WORKER LOOKS UP

               he's the one wielding the axe. His co-worker casts a look in 
               our direction.

               MILES

               reaches under the rubble and removes one box of Cohiba 
               Especials.

                                     CONSTRUCTION WORKER
                         Sorry, Mr. Massey. Thought you cleared 
                         that shit out.

                                     CONSTRUCTION WORKER #2
                         You know, man... those things'll 
                         kill ya. I know all you old boomer 
                         potheads like em. They're illegal, 
                         and you get to put em in fancy boxes -- 
                         but -- shit man! It's still tobacco.

                         You know, sweets, he's right.

               Miles casts a rueful look at the cigars.

                         Fine. They were created during a 
                         dictatorship.

                         What if something happened to you? 
                         What would I tell little Gus when he 
                         asked "what was my daddy like?"

               Miles looks at the box, then at his wife. He tosses the box 
               to the concerned construction worker.

                         Here, buddy. These are for you.

               The construction worker gives him a very hostile look.

                         Great. Now I can die.

                         Well. You'd say "they devoted a whole 
                         semester at Harvard to your Dad. But 
                         your Mom was the one that ever only 
                         nailed his ass."

                         Sweet.

                         I thought so.

                                                                  FADE OUT:
