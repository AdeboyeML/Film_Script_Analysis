1 	EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN  DAY	1

	A speedboat cuts swiftly through the ocean swells beneath the
	looming cliffs of ISLA SORNA.


2 	EXT. BOAT - DAY 							2

	Illegal Costa Rican parasail operator ENRIQUE CARDOSO helps
	Americans BEN HILDEBRAND and twelve-year-old ERIC KIRVY --
	already wearing life-vests -- strap themselves into a two-
	person PARASAIL HARNESS.


3 	EXT. BOAT - DAY 							3

	Ben and Eric clamber onto a makeshift PLATFORM that hangs over
	the back of the board. Dangling from Ben's neck is a CAMCORDER.

				BEN
		You make sure to get us as close as you can,
		okay? If it's a good trip, I'll give you a 
		little extra. 

				ENRIQUE
		Don't worry. I take you close. But not too 
		close.
			(rubbing Eric's head)
		You don't want them to eat you.

	Enrique heads toward the driver's seat and a large SECOND-HAND
	WINCH bolted to the deck.

				ENRIQUE (CONT'D)
		Ready, amigos?

	Ben and Eric nod excitedly and give the thumbs up. Ben lifts the
	camcorder to the record the action.

	Enrique jams the down the throttle down, and with a loud RAOR, the
	speedboat shoots forward. Soon the boat is whipping across the 
	rolling ocean.

	Strapped together, Ben and Eric lean back over the passing
	water, intently watching for Enrique's signal.

	As the boat picks up speed, Enrique eyes the speedometer.

	Ben grabs the end of the RIPCORD attached to the harness. He and
	Eric braces themselves.

	Enrique finally signals with a pulling motion. He pulls
	the winch, Ben yanks the cord and - 

	WOOOSH! A brightly colored PARASAIL blossoms behind the boat,
	hoisting Ben and Eric aloft. In a big BLOCK LETTERS on the
	parasail is stitched "DINO-SOAR."

	THE TOWNLINE unsold rapidly from its enormous reel.

	BEN AND ERIC climb higher and higher.

	ENRIQUE keeps an eye on the clients. When they reach a certain 
	height, he LOCKS OFF the reel.

	High overhead, Ben and Eric are floating in wonderful, quiet
	splendor. The motor of the boat now sounds strangely distant.

	Down below, the boat enters a think blanket of FOG.

	Eric points excitedly at the islands as Ben films him with the
	camera.

	Then, a sudden TUG on the thing line cause Ben to drop the camera,
	which now dangles from his neck.

				ERIC
		What was that?

	A second tug...and now the faintest of screams.

	Ben and Eric look down to find that the boat has disappeared
	into the low bank of FOG.

	By the time the boat emerges on the far side of the mist...THEIR
	IS NO SIGN OF ENRIQUE. The deck is splattered with blood.

	As Ben considers the driverless boat...

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		Ben!

	Ben glances over at Eric, staring in horror at something 
	below. Following his gaze, Ben finds that their boat is only
	moments away from crashing into A LARGE REEF.

	Sticking out of the water, the imposing reef is being battered
	by waves.

	AS THE BOAT SMASHES INTO THE REEF, it splinters into a
	number of pieces.

	A panicked Ben turns to Eric.

				BEN
		Unclip your line!

	Eric and Ben frantically unclip their lines. Catching an
	updraft, the parasailers float upward.

	A strong wind sends them wafting over the daunting cliffs
	of ISLA SORNA...


4 	EXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - DAY 					4

	TWO PLASTIC DINOSAURS enter the frame and do battle accompanied
	by a child's ferocious sounds.

				CHILD (O.S.)

		RRRRROW! GRRRRRR!

	WINDER TO REVEAL -

	CHARLIE, a three-year old boy, plays in a sandbox with his
	favorite toy dinosaurs. ALAN GRANT squats next to him and
	watches with great delight.

	ELLIE SATLER stands over them, an INFANT in her arms -- a
	picture of the perfect family.

				GRANT
		Oh, actually, Charlie, those two are
		herbivores. They wouldn't be interested in
		fighting each other. But these...
			(picking up two other dinosaurs)
		See, these are carnivores. And this one here
		-- see its claws -- this one here uses its
		claws to gouge at the throat of its opponent

	As Grant demonstrates with some GRUNT and GROANS of his
	own, he only succeeds in frightening the boy.

				ELLIE
			(interrupting)
		Uh, Alan?


				GRANT
		Hmm?

				ELLIE
		He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a
		little older?


				GRANT
		Oh, right.
			(back to Charlie)
		Happy dinosaurs.

	He bounces them along the sandbox edge.

	Then, the sound of a CAR ENGINE turning off and a door
	SLAMMING is heard.

				ELLIE
		That must be Mark.
			(calling out)
		Mark, were back here!

	Ellie and Grant turn to see --

MARK DEGLER coming through the gate carrying a briefcase. He's their age, handsome but not annoyingly so, with a friendly,
	balance demeanor.

	He and Ellie kiss tenderly on the lips.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		Good day?

				MARK
		Keeping the world safe.
			(re: baby)
		Here, let me take her.

	Ellie hands off the baby.

				ELLIE
		Mark, this is Alan Grant.

				MARK
		Nice to meet you, Alan. I've heard a lot about
		you.

	The two men shake hands, and we now realize it is Grant
	who is the stranger in this household. Little Charlie runs to
	his father, showing his dinosaur.

				CHARLIE
		Daddy, this is a herbabore.

	Grant smiles uncomfortably, a third wheel.


5 	INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT 					5

	WINDEN to a PARROT in a large cage. Grant is teasing 
the bird with a cookie, holding a it just out of reach.

				GRANT
		What's my name? Come on, Jack, say it. Is my
		name Alan? Say my name.

		The bird doesn't respond.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		He used to know me.

				ELLIE
		Sorry, Alan it's been six years.

	Grant shrugs, gives Jack the cookie, and heads towards the table.
	The three adults are finishing their dessert and coffee. The
	The children have been out to bed.

	An awkward moment of silence. Uncomfortable smiles. Then --

				MARK
		More coffee?

				ELLIE
			(relived)
		Yes. Great.

	Mark stands and collects their cups.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		So, Mark's working at the State Department
		now.

				GRANT
		Really? 
(To Mark)
What do you do there?

				MARK
			(with mock bravado)
		I could tell you about it, but than I'd have to
		kill you.

				GRANT
		Indeed.

	Mark smiles, nodding. Then he goes into the kitchen. Another
	uncomfortable silence.

				ELLIE
	So what are you working on now?

				GRANT

	We have a new site in Montana. At least until
	the money runs out.

				ELLIE
		Anything good?

				GRANT
		Raptors, mostly.

				ELLIE
		My favorite.

	Grant leans forward, realizing Ellie's one of the few people he
	can talk to about this.

				GRANT
		You remember the sounds they made?

				ELLIE
		I try not to.

				GRANT
		We've done cranial scans, and raptors
		actually had a quite sophisticated
		resonating chamber. I have a theory that
		their ability to vocalize is the key to their
		social intelligence. The way they can work
		together as a team.

				ELLIE
		You think they could talk to each other?

				GRANT
		To a degree we never imagined.

	And from the cage in the corner of the room...

				JACK
		Bullshit!

	Both look back at the parrot. ELLIE smiles.

				ELLIE
		You taught him that.


6 	EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT 					6

	Ellie and Grant head toward the rental car parked in the
	driveway.

				ELLIE
		Good luck with the fund raising.

				GRANT
		It was never easy, but before Jurassic Park,
		you could find money. Somewhere. Now fossils
		are out. Everyone wants to see a real live
		dinosaur.

				ELLIE
		Times change Alan. But you're the still the
		best. I mean that.

				GRANT
		The last of my breed.

	A long moment passes between them as both consider where
	they've ended up.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		I'd better get going.

				ELLIE
		Let me know if I can help, Alan. Youre bad
		about asking for help, but please ask me.
		Anything, anytime.

				GRANT
			(deep down knowing he never
			 will)
		Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.

				ELLIE
		Goodbye, Alan.

	Not sure what the right thing to do is, they finally end up with
	a friendly hug. They keep it short.

	Grant gets in his car. Starts the ENGINE.

	He's about to pull off when Ellie knocks on the window. He rolls
	it down.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		When I met you, I thought that one day
		millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs
		became extinct. Wiped out. But you told me
		otherwise. When conditions changed,
		dinosaurs changed. They became other things.
		They evolved.

				GRANT
		A well-accepted theory.

				ELLIE
			(simply)
		Alan don't be afraid to evolve.

	Grant hears her, but Ellie knows it didn't really get through.
	A forced half-smile, than Grant waves goodbye.

	Ellie watches as he drives off.


7 	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY 						7

	The last stop on Grant's fund-raising tour, it's a public
	lecture hosted by some foundation. There are SCIENTISTS and
	STUDENTS here, but also a lot of DINO-FANS, some even with
	costumes.

	Grant finishes his speech to what was a full house -- some
	ATTENDEES are grabbing their coats and sneaking out. This
	wasn't the exciting guest speaker they were all expecting.

	A new slide comes up. Just black and white, and indecipherable.

				GRANT
		It's through the painstaking study of the
		Interior chamber in multiple specimens that
		we can determine this exciting correlation
		between the larynx and the upper plate. That
		lets us theorize -- theorize, mind you -- that
		the raptor might have been capable of bird-
		like vocalizations. Which as you can
		imagine, would be a tremendous breakthrough.

	He's finished, but no one seems to notice at first. Then the
	SYMPOSTUM LEADER stands up, leading a smattering round of
	APPLAUSE.

				SYMPOSTIUM LEADER
		Thank you very much Dr. Grant. Now does
		anyone have a question?

	Nearly every hand goes up. Grant doesn't seem surprised.

				GRANT
		Does anyone have a question that doesn't 
		relate to Jurassic Park?

	Quite a few hands go down.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		Or the incident in San Diego, which I'll
		remind you, I did not witness.

	Now most of the hands are down. Picking one of the few
	remaining...

				MALE STUDENT
		Your theory on raptors is good and all, but
		isn't all this conjecture kind of moot?

	The STUDENT'S BUDDY nods in agreement.

				MALE STUDENT (CONT'D)
		I mean, once the U.N. and Costa Rica and
		everyone decides how to handle the second
		island, scientist will just go in and look
		for themselves.

				TOO-CLEVER SCIENCE REPORTER
		Isn't paleontology itself in danger of
		extinction?

	Recognizing those as fighting words, the symposium leader is
	about to step in. But Grant will take this himself.

				GRANT
		No, and let me be perfectly clear on this
		point. Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago.
		What's left of them is fossilized in stone
		the actual scientists spend years to
		undercover.
								   (MORE)

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		what John Hammond and InGen created are
		theme park monsters. Nothing more, nothing
		less.

		The class clearly disagrees with his assessment.

				ANOTHER STUDENT
		You're saying you wouldn't want to study
		them if you had the chance?

				GRANT
		No force on this earth or in heaven could get me on
		that island.


8 	INT. DERELICT COCKPIT - DAY 					8

	Looking through the cracked windshield of a junkyard plane, we
	see someone spray painting red circles on the outside of the
	glass.


9 	EXT. AIRCRAFT GRAVEYARD - DAY 					9

	NASH, a wry, intelligent mercenary pilot and soldier, is
	painting huge eyes the windows of a wrecked plane. Finished, he
	tosses the paint can through the open windows and walks quickly
	away from the plane.

	We now see that RED TEETH are painted on the craft's nose. It
	looks absurdly like some angry beast.

	We are one the edge of a dry lake bed, part of an aircraft
	graveyard. Wrecked planes lie all around.

	We hear a phone RINGING...


10 	INT. CARGO PLANE - DAY 					       10

	A RINGING satellite phone rests on a stack of gun cases.

	UDESKY, the leader of this crew, answers it. 

				UDESKY
		Udesky.
			(beat)
		Yes sir. we're good to go. I'll lock it down as
		soon as you drop me the payment.

	With the phone still to his ear, Udesky wanders out of the
	craft...


11 	EXT. CARGO PLANE - DAY 					       11

	Udesky looks over at Nash and COOPER, another mercenary.

	Cooper's the quiet muscle of the bunch, a weapons specialist. He
	finishes loading a massive gun, essentially a hand-cannon. It's
	aimed at Nash's grimacing aircraft.

				UDESKY
		That's right, two of the very best I could
		find. No, I haven't worked with them
		personally, but they come with the highest
		recommendations.

	Then --

	Cooper FIRES at the grimacing aircraft. A projectile rockets
	into the plane and EXPLODES with a fireball.

	Nash and Cooper exchange a satisfied smile.

				UDESKY (CONT'D)
		You've got nothing to worry about, sir. This
		is going to be a piece of cake.

	Pieces of the demolished craft come raining down.


12 	EXT. EXCAVATION BASE CAMP, PT. PECK LAKE, MT - DAY 	12

	CLOSE ON a man's hand, carefully scraping the stone away from a
	dinosaur fossil. We follow his hand back as he wipes off his
	sweaty brow, revealing him to be BILLY BRENNAN, 25, an
	associate professor and site manager. He's a charmer.

	Looking past him, we see CHERYL, 21, a junior at junior of State. She's one
	of a dozen COLLEGE STUDENTS working at the site, and the one
	most smitten with her supervisor.

				CHERYL
		Billy? I don't think I'm doing this right.

	He scoots over, lying down beside her. Checks her work.

				BILLY
		You need to go slowly. See, just take it little
		at a time.

	She's not listening, just watching his eyelashes.

				CHERYL
		I can never tell what's bone and what's rock.

				BILLY
		Technically, it's all rock. The calcium in the
		bones is replaced during fossilization. But
		you can feel the difference. See? Rough,
		smooth. Rough, smooth.

	He runs her bare fingers over the two different patches, showing
	her. After a pause, she runs her finger along his
	stubbly chin...

				CHERYL
		Rough.

	...and along his lips.

				CHERYL (cont'd)
		Smooth.

	Billy may not have started this flirtation, but he's not ending
	it either. It's then that a

	SHADOW

	falls across them. Billy looks up to see...

				BILLY
		Dr. Grant!

	Grant has just returned, a bag over his shoulder.

				GRANT
		Mr. Brennan.

										CUT TO:


12A	EXT. WALKING TO THE MAIN TENTS - DAY 			12A

	Billy takes one of Grant's bags, talking as they go.

				BILLY
		How was your trip? Profitable?

				GRANT
		We'll be broke in four weeks.

				BILLY
		Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.

	The cross into one of the tents, which only has two "walls". On
	a dust-taped table, a dusty Macintosh is feeing data into a
	strange machine the size of a dorm refrigerator. A mechanical arm sweeps
	back and forth across a tray of fine sand.

				GRANT
		You rented an automated litter box.

				BILLY
		It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan
		data from the raptor skull, than the computer
		breaks it into thousands of slices which this
		thing prints, one layer on top of the other.
		It's the future of paleontology.

				GRANT
		Not if it can't dig.

	The arm stops and suddenly the tray of sand shakes, dropping
	through holes in the bottom to reveal an object the size of 
	a person's fist.

				BILLY
		I give you a raptor's resonating chamber.

	Grant hates technology, but he can't help but be amazed by the
	result. He lifts the strange object up, shaking out the
	remaining sand.

	Billy puts it to his lips and blows through it like a conch shell.
	The resulting SOUND is unique and piercing, the cry of an 
	non-existent animal. Grant is speechless with excitement. And so he
	uses it again and again, producing different SOUNDS and
	variations.

	In the distance, flocks of birds rise to the sky and fly off.

	Billy looks up to see a MAN and a WOMAN getting out of 	
	a Cadillac. Cheryl is pointing them in the direction of the 		
	tent. 									

				BILLY (cont'd) 				
			(falsely casual) 					
		Oh, I forgot to tell you. Some visitors 			
		wanted to come by and talk	to you. I 
told them you'd be happy to see them. 
		maybe even have dinner with them. 						

				GRANT 					
		Absolutely not. 						

				BILLY 						
		They're here. 							

				GRANT 					
		What? 								

	Only now does Grant realize these two people
Who were walking up to them.
Putting on a friendly smile, Billy goes up to them.				

				MAN 						
		Dr. Grant? 							

				GRANT 					
		Yes? 								

				MAN 						
			(extending his hand)					
		Paul Kirby. Kirby Enterprises				 	
			(reaching into his pocket) 	
		My card. 							

	PAUL KIRBY is a talkative optimist with				
	no "off" switch. His wife AMANDA KIRBY, just
as friendly, is harder to read. There seems to be			
	exhaustion behind her eyes. 					

				GRANT 					
		What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby? 				

				PAUL 						
		Well sir, I am a great admirer
of yours, and I have an extremely interesting 
proposition to discuss. Would you let my wife 
and I take you to have dinner tonight? Our treat.					

				GRANT 					
		You know, I've been traveling and I'm very 		
		tired. Maybe some other time. 				

				PAUL
		I guarantee it'll be worth your while.

	Behind Kirby, Bill furtively rubs his thumb and fingers
	together, indicating the guy is loaded.

	Grant musters a weak smile.

				GRANT
		It's be my pleasure.


13 	INT. HELL CREEK BAR AND GRILL, JORDAN, MT - NIGHT 	13

	Theyre only halfway through the entree, but Grant is ready to
	bolt. It's only Billy who's keeping him from being rude. They walk
	over to Paul and Amandas table and sit down.

				PAUL
		First off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts,
		Amanda and I have admired your work for
		years.

				AMANDA
		It is truly, whats the word? Inspiring.

				GRANT
		Thank you.

	It's everything Grant can do just to be polite. He desperately
	wants to leave and get back to his dig.

				PAUL
		Amanda and I, well, we just love the outdoors.
		Heck we've been on pretty much any adventure
		tour they can come up with: Galapagos, K2,
		the Nile...

				AMANDA
		We even have two seats reserved aboard the
		first commercial moon flight.

	Billy nudges Grant.

				GRANT
		Hmmm.

				PAUL
		Now, for our wedding anniversary this year
		we wanted to do something really special,
		something...

	He places his hand on his wife's.

				AMANDA
		...once-in-a-lifetime.

				PAUL
		We've arranged for a private airplane to
		take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want
		you to be our guide.

	The Kirby's look to Grant as if they've offered him an amazing
	gift. But Grant just sighs and smooths the tablecloth.

				GRANT
		That's a very nice offer, Mr. Kirby, but I'm
		afraid I'm much to busy. If you like I can
		refer you to a number of highly qualified...

				PAUL
		No, no, see Dr. Grant, you're the best. You've
		seen these animals in the flesh. No one else
		has come close to you.

				GRANT
		I'm flattered, but I've taken this little
		adventure tour. And with the air
		restrictions they've imposed after the
		incident in San Diego, you cant fly low
		enough to see anything of interest.

	Paul is momentarily stymied, but Amanda rallies.

				AMANDA
		You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I
		have special permission to fly low.

				BILLY
		How low?

				PAUL
		Well, I'm no aviation specialist. But I do
		know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone
		else.

				AMANDA
		From what I understand, it's pretty much
		whatever we want.

				GRANT
		That's hard to believe.

				PAUL
		Let's just say that through my business --
		imports/exports, emerging markets -- I've
		made some friends in high places. In this
		case, the Costa Rican government.

				AMANDA
		Dr. Grant, you don't know how important it is
		for us to have you come along. It would make
		all the difference.

	Grant is trying to find another way to say no, when Paul pulls
	out his checkbook.

				PUAL
		And of course, we're prepared to make a
		sizeable contribution to your research here.

	Billy looks at Grant. Don't say no.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		I can write all kinds of numbers on this
		check. Just tell me what exactly it would
		take.

	We HOLD ON a conflicted Dr. Alan Grant.

		  		  CUT TO:

14 	EXT. SKY - DAY 							14

	NNNNNRRRRRRNNNNNRRRRR...

	A SMALL AIRPLANE - a Beechcraft Kingair 200 Turboprop, to be
	exact - cruises through clear blue skies.


15 	INT. PLANE - DAY 							15

	Grant re-settles, trying to get comfortable. Billy is across
	from him, finishing cleaning his camera lenses before putting
	them back in the ragged case.

				GRANT
		Even with what I pay you, you could get a
		better bag.

				BILLY
		No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago
		some buddies and I went hang gliding off
		these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me
		right into the side. BOOM!

				GRANT
		That does sound lucky.

				BILLY
		It was this strap alone that saved my life.
		Got caught on a rock as I was falling.

				GRANT
		Reverse-Darwinism. Survival of the most
		idiotic.

	Because he hasn't really said it...

				BILLY
		Listen Alan, I really appreciate you
		bringing me along.

				GRANT
		The bones will be there when we get back.
		That's the nice thing about them. They never
		run away.
			(beat)
		And besides, you got me into this. I don't
		intend to be alone with these people.

	ON PAUL AND AMANDA

	sitting near the front of the plane. Paul draws a long, nervous
	breath and looks at Amanda. She seems just as tense.

	Finally finding a comfortable position, Grant puts his hat over
	his eyes, ready to take a nap.

	Done with his camera, Billy turns to someone just off screen.

				BILLY
		So how do you know the Kirby's?

	and we reveal...

	Mercenary Cooper, the weapons specialist we met earlier. He's
	wearing sunglasses so dark you can't tell whether he's staring
	at you or fast asleep.

	He doesn't answer. Did he even hear? And then --

				COOPER
		Through our church.

				BILLY
		What Religion?

				COOPER
		Uhthe one that worships God and believes in being
		Good. 



16 	EXT. SKY - DAY 							16

	The plane continues onward.


17 	INT. PLANE - DAY / HOURS LATER 					17

	Grant slowly wakes in his chair, groggy. All the other
	passengers are fast asleep. Then Grant turns to his right.

	A RAPTOR

	sits besides him. The dinosaur eyes him curiously, then opens
	his mouth...

				RAPTOR
		Alan.

	And than it STRIKES.


18 	INT. PLANE - DAY 					       		18

	Grant wakes up with a start, disoriented. Billy is leaning over
	him.

				BILLY
	Alan. We're almost there.

	The adrenaline still surging through him, Grant turns and looks

	THROUGH THE WINDOW.

	Clouds obscure the view, than parts reveal

	ISLA SORNA

	rising majestically out of the water.


19 	EXT. SKY - COUNTINUOUS DAY 					19

	We watch the plane descend sharply to the island.


20 	INT. PLANE - COUNTINUOUS DAY 					20

	In various combinations, Grant and Billy, Paul and Amanda look
	out the windows at the amazingly green island.

	Cooper looks out through a window of his own.


21 	INT. COCKPIT - COUNTINUOUS DAY 				21

	Here we find the rest of the crew from the junkyard. Nash is
	piloting.

	A VOICE comes over their radio headsets.

				RADIO VOICE
			(Spanish accent)
		Unidentified aircraft approaching Isla
		Sorna, this is San Juan approach. You are
		flying in restricted airspace. Immediately
		turn to the coordinates two-zero-zero. I repeat
		redirect to...

	A look from Nash then Udesky switches off the radio.


22 	EXT. PLANE - COUNTINUOUS DAY 				       22

	The plane now descends to a mere hundred feet above the
	treetops.


23 	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS DAY 				       23

	Paul puts his hand atop Amanda's as they stare intently out the
	window.

	Billy looks to Grant.

				BILLY

		Admit it. You're excited.

	Grant will admit nothing.

	Calling back from the cockpit...

				UDESKY
		Cooper! Yell up if you see anything!

				COOPER
			(yelling back)
		No, I thought I'd keep it to myself.

	Suddenly Grant spots...

				GRANT
		There. There! An Apatosaur. Look at the
		coloration.

EXT. ISLA SORNA  GRASSY FIELD  CONTINUOUS DAY

	An Apatosaur is grazing on the grass.

INT.  PLANE  CONTINUOUS DAY

				BILLY
			(amazed)
		I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see
		skin.

				GRANT
		Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right
		you can see...

	But Paul just waves him away with a hand, staring intently out
	his window. We HOLD ON Grant a moment, thinking that odd.


24 	INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS DAY 				       24

	Udesky puts down his binoculars.

				UDESKY
		South shore is clear. The rest is rock.

				NASH
		Are we on?

				UDESKY
		We're on.


25 	INT. MAIN CABIN - CONTINUOUS DAY  			       25

	Looking out the window, Grant notices they're flying awfully
	low. Just then, he hears a MECHANICAL HUM and a LOW RUSH from
	outside. Now wanting to believe --

				GRANT
		That's not the landing gear?

	Paul, Amanda and Cooper don't respond.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		What you're...
			(realizing)
		You can't land.

	Paul turns back to him.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant if you'd just sit tight, we'll
		explain this all in a jiffy.

				GRANT
		This plane can not land!

				AMANDA
		It's going to be all right. Just...

	Grant is out of his seat, heading for the cockpit. He'll wrestle
	the controls if he has to.

	Cooper grabs him, pulling him back. Grant starts to struggle,
	but he's certainly no match. A well-practiced fist hits him
	dead on.

	CUT TO BLACK.


26 	OVER THE DARKNESS 						26

	we hear Amanda's voice, strangely distant but amplified.

				AMANDA
		Eric! Eric! Are you there honey? Ben!
		Erriccc!

	Her calls continue as we FADE UP to...


27 	INT. PLANE - DAY 							27

	GRANT'S P.O.V. -- blurry and disorientated. He finds himself lying
	on the floor of the plane.

	Seeing him come to, Billy helps him slowly get up. Grant's head
	is pounding.

				GRANT
		Tell me we didn't land.

	By his expression, we see Billy would have to lie.

				BILLY
		I think they're looking for someone.


28 	EXT. LANDING STRIP, ISLA SORNA - DAY 			       28

	The jungle has almost reclaimed this patchy vine-covered
	runway. The airplane is parked at one end.

	Nash, Udesky, and Cooper are checking their weapons.

	Amanda is at the edge of the tarmac calling into the jungle on a
	BULLHORN.

	Billy and a groggy Grant emerge from the airplane. Paul trots
	over.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant, are you alright? I'm sorry we
		had to be so...

	The three mercenaries are now walking into the jungle with
	their guns.

				GRANT
		What the hell is going on? What are they
		doing?

				PAUL
		Establishing a perimeter. Making it safe.
		These guys are really good. One of them was a
		Green...

				GRANT
		Mr. Kirby, trust me, on this island, there is
		no such thing as safe. We have to get back in
		this plane...

	Grant looks to Amanda, who shouts through a bull horn.

				AMANDA
			(on-bullhorn)
		ERRR-IIIC!

				GRANT
		And tell your wife to stop making so
		much noise! We're food to these damn 
animals.

				PAUL
			(yelling)
		Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad
		idea!

				AMANDA
			(on the bullhorn)
		What?

				PAUL
			(pointing broadly at Alan)
		He says it's a bad idea!

				AMANDA
			(on the bullhorn)
		What's a bad idea?

	As in on cue, there is a DEAFENING ROAR from the jungle.

	Everyone turns toward the sound and freezes.

				PAUL
			(to Alan)
		What was that?

	Grant doesn't answer, still listening to the reverberations. 
Then a couple shots are heard.

				BILLY
			(low)
		Is it a rex?

				GRANT
		I don't think so.

	Billy and Paul breathe a small sign of relief.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Sounds bigger.

	Nash and Udesky come RUNNING out of the jungle, headed for
	the plane.

				UDESKY
		We gotta go, now!

				PAUL
		What's the problem? Can't you guys...?

	As Udesky and Nash sprint past Paul in interrupted by a
	second, closer, DEAFENING ROAR. He pales.


29 	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 				       29

	Udesky waits by the door, hustling everyone inside. Nash
	hurries into the cockpit. Everyone scrambles to a seat. Amanda
	climbs next to Paul.

				AMANDA
		We can't just...

				PAUL
		Don't worry, honey. We'll circle around and
		come back.

	Udesky closes the door.

				BILLY
		What about the other guy?

				UDESKY
		Coop's a professional. He can handle himself.

	A blood-curdling SCREAM echoes through the jungle followed by
	MACHINE GUN FIRE.

				NASH
			(yelling back)
		We're going!

	Udesky climbs into the copilot's seat, and Nash revs the engine.


30	EXT. RUNAWAY - DAY						30

	The plane starts down the runway.


31	INT. PLANE - DAY							31

	The passengers bounce in their seats as the plane picks up
	speed down the overgrown strip.


32	EXT. RUNWAY - DAY							32

	Suddenly, two hundred yards ahead of the plane,

	COOPER

	emerges from the jungle. He stands in the middle of the runway.
	waving one arm wildly. His second, badly injured arm hangs
	limp by his side.

				COOPER
		Come on, Nash. Slow down, buddy.


33	INT. THE COCKPIT - DAY					       33

	Nash spots Cooper, shoots a glance at the airspeed indicator.

				NASH
		Coop, you know I can't do it pal.

	He slams down full throttle in an attempt to reach flying speed.

	Seeing that Nash has no intention of stopping, Paul shouts from
	the cabin.

				PAUL
		What are you doing? That's Mr. Cooper!


34	EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY				34

	We are looking down on Cooper from behind. As the plane
	approaches,

	A SHADOW

	falls over the injured mercenary. Then with brutal speed, an
	ENORMOUS BEAST seizes him in its massive jaws and lifts him
	into the air.

	From this angle we get only a glimpse of a long crocodilian
	snout, powerful clawed forearms and spiny sail rising from the
	creature's back.


35	INT. THE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS - DAY			       35

	All eyes are on the creature as it devours Cooper. Amanda turns
	away in horror.

				AMANDA
		Oh, my God! Paul, my God!


36	INT. THE COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS - DAY			       36

	Looking through the windshield, we see the creature is directly
	in the path of the plane.

	Nash pulls back on the stick. The plane rises.

	The left propeller clips the flank of the enormous
	dinosaur, SNAPPING the blade.

	Blood sprays the windshield and side windows.


37	EXT. RUNWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY 				37

	The turboprop banks into the jungle, out of control.


38	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 					38

	The passengers are thrown about as the craft CRASHES through
	trees, tearing off a wing and pieces of the tail.

	Finally coming to rest in the jungle canopy, the plane settles
	in the trees.

	SILENCE.

	The passengers slowly recover and have a look around. Foliage
	blocks most windows, making it impossible to see out.

				BILLY
		Is anyone hurt?

	Checking themselves, everyone seems pretty much intact.

	Still thinking of himself as in charge...

				UDESKY
		Quiet! We're okay. Let's everybody just stay
		put.

	He attempts to turn on the cockpit radio, but it's dead.

				NASH
		Who's got the sat-phone?

				PAUL
		Right here!

	Paul hands the bulky phone up to Nash, who dials out.

	Grant unstraps himself, climbs to the back to the side door and shoves.
	The door opens a few inches before hitting a branch.

	He looks out the and lets out a quiet gasp as the ground reels

	THIRTY FEET BELOW.

	He quickly shuts and latches the door.

	CLOSE ON the sat-phone. pressed against Nash's ear.

				RECORDED VOICE
		We're sorry. All circuits are busy. Please
		try your call again later...

				NASH
		Shit!

				PAUL
		What is it? What's the matter?

	Amanda SCREAMS.

	A huge reptilian face appears in the cockpit window. Everyone
	else SCREAMS now.
	
	The plane LURCHES - and we hear a deep GROWL.
	
	The passengers hold tight, paralyzed. Nash buckles himself into
	his seat.

	Suddenly, the plane is YANKED from the side to side. Battered this
	way and that, the terrified passengers tightly grip their 
	seats.
	
	Finally, the horrible sounds of WRENCHING METAL as the nose of
	the plane is RIPPED RIGHT OFF.

	Nash and Udesky are suddenly sitting in open air. The nose of
	the plane is tilting downwards, the jungle floor far below.

	The passengers hang almost vertically in their seats,

	Debris tumbles out the open end of the plane, some of it
	striking Nash in the head.

	Udesky unbuckles his seat belt and climbs back up into the
	cabin. Nash follows.

	Suddenly, a long snout with dagger-like teeth pushes past the
	cockpit seats, opens wide, and

	CLAMPS DOWN

	on Nash's legs.

	The pilot CRIES OUT in agony. The others passengers grab onto
	his arms, trying to pull him back. But it's no use. The dinosaur
	rips Nash out of their grasp and down the aisle.

	Nash desperately grabs on to the seat cushion, then watches in
	horror as the fabric RIPS AWAY. He's pulled out of the plane and 
	dropped to the ground. A giant foot steps in the way as the snout
	of the creature reaches down and quickly devourers the screaming
pilot.

	It's horrifying sight, but no one can turn away.

	Pleased with the appetizer, the creature comes back for the
	main course.

	Grant tries to force open the jammed rear door. Billy tries to
	help, but the door won't budge.

	The dinosaur JAMS its snout into the fuselage and lunges for
	Amanda in the first row. She yanks her legs back as the jaws
	SNAP SHUT.

	Behind Amanda, Billy reaches forward, UNSNAPS her seat belt
	and pulls her into the next row back.

	The others unstrap their belts and crowd into the rear of the
	passenger compartment.

	The shift in weight sends the fuselage tipping backwards.


39	EXT. JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS - DAY				       39

 	The plane breaks free of the tree limbs and DROPS tail-first to
	the jungle floor.

	It SLAMS hard, then flips over onto its roof.


40	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY				       40

	The passengers are prowled on the ceiling of the plane, dazed
	by the impact. Everyone is cut and bruised.

	Out of the open cockpit, they see two approaching dino feet.

	A window near Amanda fogs over with condensation. when it
	clears, she finds herself looking right into enormous eyes.

	Then all hell breaks loose as the plane is SLAMMED across the
	jungle clearing.

	The passengers are hammered against the walls of the plane,
	tumbling like socks in a dryer. Debris, seats and luggage fly
	everywhere.


41	EXT. JUNGLE FLOOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY			41

	The plane comes to an abrupt halt as it SMASHES into a tree.

	A gargantuan FOOT steps on the fuselage and FLATTENS it like a 
	paper tube.


42	INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS - DAY					42

	Inside, windows EXPLODE, raining glass over the passengers. As
	the walls compress, Udesky becomes trapped in the rear of the 
	plane, the others in front.

				BILLY
		Over here!

	Udesky dives into the narrowing gap, and Billy pulls him the
	rest of the way through.

	Billy is as terrified as the rest of them, but he thrives under
	this rush of adrenaline.
	
	Then a huge CLAW digs into the skin of the fuselage and begins
	to slowly PEEL the plane open. Grant looks up in dread at the
	widening tear.

				GRANT
		This way!

	Grant leads the group out the open end of the cockpit. They
	make a mad dash for the jungle.

	A tremendous ROAR causes Billy to look behind him. He can't
	help but steal a glimpse of this terrifying, but utterly
	fascinating, animal.

	Grant yanks him forward.


43	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY						       43

	With Grant in the lead, and Udesky taking up the rear, the group
	tears through the jungle.

	Concealed by the dense undergrowth, the unseen dinosaur bears
	down on them -- mowing down the young trees which TOPPLE all
	around them.

	Grant spots a grove of

	HEAVIER TREES

	and leads the group into it.

	The dinosaur cannot fit between the trunks. It ROARS at
	the fleeing humans, searching desperately for a route after
	them.

	The group continues their relentless pace, putting as much 
	distance as they can between themselves and the beast. Paul
	Kirby looks like he's about to have a heart attack. Even Billy
	is gasping for air.

	They stop, thinking they've outrun it.

	Grant directs the group through some underbrush and into --


44	EXT. CLEARING - CONTINUOUS - DAY				44

	Our friends stop dead in their tracks. Amanda stifles a cry.

	Before them lies an immense unmoving SAUROPOD.

				GRANT
		Don't worry. It's dead.

	Then a full-grown bull

	TYRANNOSAURUS

	rises up behind the carcass. It was feeding, its mouth mottled
	with blood and carrion.

	Grant FREEZES.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Nobody move a muscle.

	Remember: the T-Rex tracks motion.

	Obeying, the group FREEZES for a few long beats. Then Udesky
	takes off running.

	And T-Rex ROARS.

	Everyone runs. T-Rex is right behind them.


45	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							45

	Dashing back the way they came, the group suddenly comes face
	to face with --

	THE FIRST MONSTER.

	We now get our first full unobstructed view of the gigantic
	creature, SPINOSAURUS AEGYPTICUS. Over forty feet long and
	twenty-five feet high, the dinosaur has a bony sail along its
	back. Its head is crocodilian with rows of long, curving teeth.
	Sinewy six foot arms terminate in three fingers hands with
	fourteen inch claws.

	Nowhere else to run, the group scatters into the brush as the
	two behemoth predators rush forward, their ROARS thunderous.

	Paul and Amanda scramble into one direction, Billy and Udesky in
	the other. But Grant can't go anywhere - his foot is stuck 
	between two branches.

	He manages to free himself as the two dinosaurs approach.
	They'll have to deal with each other before eating the humans.

	Grant dives down between two fallen trees as the Spinosaurus and T-
	Rex circle one another like gladiators, each searching for the
	other's weakness.

	Laying flat on his back, Grant lets out a terrified GASP as the
	giant foot of Spinosaurus lands across the two trunks mere
	inches from his face.

	Spinosaurus lunges forward, powerful jaw open wide.

	T-Rex sidesteps the assault, its tail knocking down small
	trees as it spins out of the way.

	In the tress, Paul and Amanda scurry again for cover.

	Between the fallen trunks, Grant attempts to get away on his
	hands and knees.

	T-Rex presses the attack, slamming its tail into the flank of
	its adversary. Spinosaurus is knocked back, and Grant is again
	forced to duck for cover.

	As Spinosaurus struggles to regain its balance, T-Rex dives
	forward. Spinosaurus is driven backwards as T-Rex tries to
	grip its throat.

	Amanda yanks Paul out of their path. They Scramble over to
	Billy.

	Now on its side, Spinosaurus fights back ferociously. It slashes
	at T-Rex with its long arms and razor sharp claws, then finally
	kicks the animal with one mammoth foot.

	Tyrannosaurus staggers back, wounded.

	Down below, Grant is splashed by the blood pouring from the
	dinosaur, as he slowly makes his way towards his fellow humans.

	Spinosaurus lunges for the T-rex with gaping jaws and manages to
	topple T-Rex off its feet and sends the falling dinosaur to the
	ground.

	With an earth-shuttering CRASH, the dinosaur lands between
	Grant and the rest of the group.

	The companions scurry out of the way, but as they do so, the
	head of the T-Rex now lands almost directly on top of them.

	Plastered against an immense tree, the group watches in horror
	as T-Rex starts to rise but is thrown back down as Spinosaurus
	latches onto its throat.

	Spinosaurus crushes the life out of its adversary, and T-Rex
	opens and closes its jaw a mere inches from our terrified 
	friends.

	Finally, Grant reaches the others.

				GRANT
		Come on!

	Spinosaurus lets out a victorious HOWL, and the blood-drenched
	professor leads the group through the undergrowth.


46	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							46

	Winded from running, Paul is caught off-guard as a furious
	Grant slams his back against a tree. Only one thing he wants to
	know --

				GRANT
		Why did you bring us here?

	Paul is too startled to speak. Udesky tires to step in, but
	Grant gives him back a look.

				AMANDA
		Our son is on this island. We need your help
		to find him.

	Still crunched against the tree, Paul pulls out a photo from his
	shirt pocket.

				PAUL
		This is him. Eric. Hes thirteen now. He's
		just about the greatest kid in the world.

	Letting go of Paul, Grant takes the photo, a Sears-style
	portrait of the boy we saw Parasailing at the beginning. He
	shakes his head, disbelieving. He hands the photo to Billy.

	The group splits into two sides -- Paul and Amanda, Grant and
	Billy -- with Udesky stuck between. Dialogue overlaps in
	places.

				AMANDA
		He's with a man named Ben Hildebrand.

				BILLY
		Who's that?

				PAUL
		Her new boyfriend.

				AMANDA
		A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted
		to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben
		found a guy who would take them parasailing.
		They never came back.

				PAUL
		We called everyone, did everything we could.
		Because of all the controversy over this
		island, no one will step in. Costa Rica says
		it's a no-fly zone, it's their own damn fault.
		Guys at the U.S Embassy -- our U.S. Embassy --
		said we should "accept the inevitable." You
		believe that?

				GRANT
		So you hired these mercenaries.

				UDESKY
		We prefer "recovery specialists." We do
		overseas custody issues and...

				GRANT
			(interrupting)
		Then you duped us into coming here.

				PAUL
		We needed somebody who knew the lay of the
		land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.

				GRANT
			(disbelieving)
		I have never been on this island!

				PAUL
		Sure you have. You wrote that book...

				BILLY
		That was Isla Nublar. This is Isla Sorna.
		The second island.

				PAUL
			(low, to Udesky)
		I didn't know, there were two islands.

				AMANDA
		Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You
		saved those kids.

				GRANT
		A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we
		were better prepared and better armed.
			(finally)
		How many days have they been missing?

	A look between Amanda and Paul.

				PAUL
		Eight weeks.

	Grand and Billy are speechless. It might as well be eight years.

				GRANT
		After what you've seen today, you really
		think your son could be alive?

				AMANDA
		He's smart, Dr. Grant. And he knows so much
		about dinosaurs.

	Before anyone else can talk, Grant puts his hand out. He wants
	everyone to shut up while he plans their next move.

				GRANT
		No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we
		can from the plane. Then we head for the
		coast. There may be a boat left, something to
		get us off this island.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.

				GRANT
		You can stick with us, or you can go and look for
		him. Either way you're probably not getting
		out of here alive.

	With that he leaves, A beat later, Billy follows. He has
	genuine sympathy for the Kirby's, but he's logical enough to
	know Grant is right.

	BACK WITH PAUL AND AMANDA

	They look to Udesky.

				PAUL
		What do we do?

	Udesky is clearly at a loss, but for everyone's reassurance he
	tries to mutter some brio.

				UDESKY
		Well, I think we should start searching for your
son. In the direction they're going.

				PAUL
		Excellent.

	They follow after Grant and Billy.


47	EXT. PLANE CRASH SITE						47

	The five survivors search through the wreckage, trying to find
	anything useful. The task is grim. Mindful of Grant's 
	warnings, they move quickly and quietly.

	Udesky picks up a gun out of the swampy water. The barrel is bent
	almost 90 degrees, unless.

	Billy finds his camera, intact.

	Digging a change of clothes out of his suitcase, Paul steps
	around the side of the plane to change. He's in his underwear
	before he notices Amanda is also there changing.

				PAUL
		Sorry.

				AMANDA
		Nothing you haven't seen before.

	A beat. Amanda looks over as they get dressed.

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		How much weight have you lost?

				PAUL
		Twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I've been
		swimming at the Y.

				AMANDA
		You hate to swim.

				PAUL
		People change.

	A nod to mean, that's the truth.

				PAUL (CONT'D)
		You look good.

				AMANDA
		So do you.

	They make brief eye contact, which Amanda breaks.

	Around the side, Billy is taking photos of a giant footprint the
	dinosaur left in the mud during its attack on the plane. Grant
	looks over.

				GRANT
		How would you classify it?

				BILLY
		Obviously a superpredator.
			(best guess)
		Suchimimus. that snout.

				GRANT
		They never got that big.

				BILLY
		Baryonyx?

				GRANT
		Not with that sail.
			(Billy gives up)
		Spinosaurus Aegypticus.

				BILLY
		I don't remember that on InGen's list.

				GRANT
		That's because it wasn't on their list. Who
		knows what else they were up to?

	Billy looks past Grant to see Paul approaching. He's struggling
	with the straps on his backpack. turning in circles.

	Billy regards him with suspicion.

				BILLY
		So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2,
		did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?

				PAUL
		Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.

				BILLY
		About a thousand feet above it, actually.
			(closer)
		Most mountain-climbers remember how tall
		that mountains were.

	Paul knows he's caught.

				GRANT
		There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?

				PAUL
		There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint
		and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate
		Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The
		"plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces
		accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like 
		that.

				BILLY
		I don't suppose that check you wrote us is
		any good.

				UDESKY
		He paid us half up front. Cash.

				PAUL
		Mortgaged everything we had to do it. Even
		the store. and if we make it off this island
		with my son, I swear, I'll make good on the
		money I owe you. I don't care if it takes me
		the rest of my life.

	Grant and Udesky exchange a dubious glance.

				UDESKY
		However long that is.


48	EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY						48

	Amanda, Paul, Billy, Udesky and Grant walk through the jungle.

				AMANDA
		Eric!

				GRANT
		Quiet!

				PAUL
			(loud whisper to Amanda)
		Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous
		territory.

				AMANDA
		Well we should split up or something. We can
		cover twice the area.

				PAUL
		No, Dr. Grant says...

				AMANDA
		Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...

				PAUL
		Well what's the use of hiring an expert if
		your not going to listen to him?

				AMANDA
		Because "Dr. Grant" isn't looking for Eric.
		Dr. Grant is looking for the coast.

				PAUL
		Fine...and when the Tricyclatops comes after
		you, don't come crying to me.

				AMANDA
		Oh, don't worry about that.

				PAUL
		What?

				AMANDA
		Nothing.

				PAUL
		What did you say?

				AMANDA
		Nothing.

				PAUL
		What did you say!

				AMANDA
		Just drop it Paul!

	The Kirby's conversation trails off into the jungle. Udesky
	moves up next to Grant and Billy.

				UDESKY
		If they split up, I'm going with you.

	And as they continue forward, Billy spots something in the
	trees ahead.


49	EXT. JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY					49

	A parasail chute is caught in the branches of a tree. A yellow
	life vest hangs limply from a branch.

	Paul rushes over, unsnags it, and examines the label.

				PAUL
		Young adult.

				AMANDA
		Eric...

				UDESKY (O.S)
		Hey. Got something here.

	All turn to see Udesky holding up a camcorder encased in a
	waterproof shell.

				AMANDA
		That's Ben's!

	She grabs it from Udesky and pops open the housing. She tries
	the power switch on the camcorder, but the battery's dead.

	Udesky pull out a flashlight from his pack and looks to Amanda.

				UDESKY
		Here, give that to me.

	And as Udesky fiddles with the flashlight, Grant and Billy
	consider the parasail.

				BILLY
		It looks intact.

				GRANT
		We should take it with us to signal any planes.

				UDESKY (O.S)
		I think I've got it.

	Udesky has rigged the wires on the flashlight so that the
	batteries can be used to power the camcorder.

	He brings a live wire to back of the camcorder. A red power
	light comes on.

				AMANDA
		It works!

				UDESKY
		I don't know for how long.

	Udesky swings the tiny screen out and pushes play. The others
	crowd around.

	ON THE SCREEEN

	Eric and Ben play frisbee on the beach.

				PAUL (O.S.)
			(excited)
		That's him. Thats Eric!

				AMANDA (O.S.)
		I filmed this the morning they left.

	Ben catches the frisbee, checks his watch and motions to Eric.

	Eric runs over, and Ben puts his arm around him as they run to
	the camera.

	Paul reacts to this image but holds his tongue.

	THE VIDEO SCREEN -

	The image now CUTS to a shot from aboard Enrique's boat
	speeding towards ISLA SORNA -- the start of the movie. Eric
	points excitedly at the island and smiles at the camera.

	We replay the opening moments of the movie from Ben and Eric's
	perspective, soaring high until...

				ERIC
		Ben!

				BEN
		Unclip the line!

	THE JUNGLE -

	A PAN from face to face of all watching this tape with a
	mixture of hope and nausea.

	ON SCREEN -

	Angle again with Ben's legs in the foreground. Falling fast.

				BEN (CONT'D)
		Hand on! Hang on buddy!

	Now the camera penetrates the jungle canopy and the picture
	and sound become complete chaos: SCREAMS from the both,
	branches BREAKING, flashes of Ben and Eric's frightened faces
	as the camera is buffeted in all directions.

	With a lurch the terrifying descent in finally over, and the
	jungle floor is just ten feet away, swaying back and forth
	beneath Ben and Eric's feet.

				BEN (CONT'D)
		Are you ok, buddy?

	There's GURGLING to his voice. Ben may be more hurt than he's
	letting on.

				ERIC
			(through his sobs)
		I don't know. I think so.

				BEN
		We're okay. It's going to be okay. Here, get
		ready. I'm going to unhook you.

	The sound of PUMPLING is followed by the sight of Eric DROPPING		
	into the frame, landing on the ground rolling. He stands and
	looks back up at Ben.

				ERIC
		I'm all right

				BEN (O.S)
			(weaker)
		We're going to get out of this, pal.

	And on that, the power and picture fade away.

	BACK ON PAUL AND AMANDA - overjoyed.

				PAUL
		See? He's okay. He's alive! Everything's
		going to be all right now.

	Amanda brings a hand to her mouth, silently nodding her head.

	Grant and Billy exchange a dubious look, than begin pulling the
	parasail out of the tree. As they do so, the sail gets caught on
	a branch.

	They pull harder. The branch bends, but the sail won't come
	loose. One last tug and than, SNAP. The branch breaks, the chute
	falls away to reveal

	A SKELETON.

	It swings down directly at Amanda. She SCREAMS.

	Finally, the others are able to pull her away. As they untangle
	the lines, the men are able to get the first view of the remains
	of Ben Hillenbrand, still caught in his harness.

	Amanda's knees buckle. Regaining her balance, she runs off into
	the jungle.

	Paul quickly follows.

				PAUL (CONT'D)
		Amanda!


50	EXT. THICKNESS - DAY						50

	Reeling, Amanda comes to a stop in an area with thick
	undergrowth. It's danger here, very still and quiet.

	She tries to calm herself, but each effort to suppress just
	makes her more emotional. She's surprised as Paul wraps an arm
	around her to comfort her. But she doesn't fight it.

				PAUL
		I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for
		the things I said about him.

				AMANDA
		No, it's...

				PAUL
		I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...

				AMANDA
			(frustrated)
		Its not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out
		here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.

	Saying it aloud, the reality sinks in for both of them

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		I guess I was hoping that with Ben around,
		there'd be someone to keep him safe.

	Checking in on clients, Udesky stops at the edge of the
	thicket. Something raises the hairs on the back of his neck.

				UDESKY
		Dr. Grant!

	He nods for the others to take a look at this. They head over,
	Grant at the rear.

	As he approaches, Billy is packing up the rest of the chute in a
	backpack. He stops short from what he sees.

	Looking down, we CIRCLE across the jungle floor. Here we find a
	strange, hollowed-out construction made of sod and branches.
	Maybe six feet around.

	Just now noticing the others' stare, Paul looks down into one
	of the bowls at his feet, a half-buried nest. It's filled with
	football-sized eggs, laid in a spiral.

	And this isn't the only nest. Amanda counts twelve in all, laid
	out in an oddly symmetrical pattern.

	The last to arrive, Grant identifies the species in a horrified
	instant.

				GRANT
		Raptors.

And as he says the words, off in the distance, we hear
	the cry of some herbivores, around by the chorus of
	snarls.


							SMASH CUT TO:

51	EXT. FUTHER IN THE FOREST - DAY				51

	The party blasts through the forest, trying to keep up with
	Grant. They haven't even had time to ask --

				AMANDA
			(to Paul)
		Whats a raptor?

	Paul has no idea.

				UDESKY
		They don't look that big. I mean,
		comparatively.

				GRANT
		If we came across one, we might live.

				PAUL
		Well that's good.

				GRANT
		But you never came across just one.

	From the back --

				AMANDA
		Wait! Where's Billy?

	They all stop. The only one not there is --

				Grant
		Billy! Billy!

				AMANDA
			(almost sotto)
		I thought we weren't suppose to yell.

				BILLY (O.S)
		Here!

	He comes in from the left. Excited, he explains to Grant --

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		I got some great pictures of the nest. You
		know this proves raptors raised their young
		in colonies.

	Furious with his student. Grant just keeps moving. There's no
	time to stand around and argue.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		This speaks to a larger social structure, the
		possibility of Darwinian altruism. It
		changes everything.

	A beat. Trying not to sound presumptuous --

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		We could co-write a paper.

				GRANT
		Ah yes, the first rule of academics. Publish
		or perish.


52	SCENE PREVIOUSLY OMITTED					52


53	EXT. RIDGE - DAY (HOURS LATER)					53

	Much fatigued, the five now mach upward towards a crest.

	Panting and flushed, they reach the top of the ridge and gaze
	into the distance.

	A jungle valley stretches before them. Not far off in A VAST
	COMPOUND - comprised of several buildings. One building alone
	seems to cover several acres.

	The weary group breathes a sigh of relief.

				PAUL
		I bet there's a very good chance Eric's in
		there. I'd bet my bottom dollar.

	Udesky and Grant share dubious looks and continue down into
	the valley.


54	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - DAY					54

	The group emerges from the jungles and enters the compound.
	They walk through an overgrown parking lot, littered with
	abandoned vehicles. Some are lying on their side. Others are
	overturned completely.

	They're not going to be driving anywhere.

	A troubled Grant peers through a windshield, partially caved
	in, like some giant head butted the glass. (Think back to Lost 
World)

	And the group finally approaches the front doors of an
	enormous building. As they head up the front steps, we see
	something in the distance behind them:

	CAT-LIKE MOVEMENTS

	on the high ridge. To fast to see what it was. But too ominous
	to dismiss.


55	INT. BUILDING LOBBY - DAY					55

	Our friends now find themselves in a sparse, one quietly
	opulent corporate lobby now in the process of being reclaimed
	by the jungle/ Roots and ivy poke through the floor and walls.

	In the waiting area, the cushions of a sofas and chairs have been
	gnawed at and pulled apart. Dusty coffee mugs and filled
	ashtrays lie on the table. The water has turned brackish in a
	near by cooler.

	Sudden FLAPPING. We look up and see BIRDS nesting in the
	rafters. It is an eerie, haunted place.

				PAUL
			(calling out)
		Eric! Are you here?

				AMANDA
		Eric!

	All listen for a response. Nothing. Paul and Amanda exchange a
	despondent look.

	Sitting on the reception counter is an official-looking
	telephone. Everyone has the same thought, but no one dares.
	Finally -

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		What the hell.

	Amanda puts the receiver to her ear. Nada.

	With Grant in the lead, they head deeper into the building.

	Unseen by the group, a fleeting SHADOW flits across the lobby's
	dirty windows with terrifying speed.


56	INT. CORRIDOR - DAY						56

	A couple vending machines stand at the one end of this long
	hallway covered with vines.

	Paul notices them and pulls change from his pocket.

				PAUL
		Let's see. I've got about a dollar seventy-
		five. How about you guys?

	Billy SMASHES IN the window of one machine with his boot.
	Picking through the glass, he pulls out some candy bars and
	chips. He checks the expiration date. 	


	CONTINUED:								56

				BILLY
		Thank God for preservatives.

	He tosses the food to the others.

	Paul now turns to his own vending machine and SMASHES it with
	his heal. The glass refuses to break.


57	INT. HATCHING LABORATORY					57

	Grant and Billy push through a set of doors to see
	
	A CAVERNOUS HATCHING FACILITY

	filled with much of the same equipment we recognized from the
	first island, although the sheer size of this place dwarfs any
	of the facilities seen previously.

	As the group walks down the ramp and onto the floor, they begin to
	absorb the incredible array of technology: enormous cryonic
	freezer, their plug pulled years ago; empty incubators; tanks
	of formaldehyde with dinosaur fetuses and body parts.

	Machines with intricate tubing and wing arms stand beside
	conveyer belts cris crossing the room at different levels.

				AMANDA
		This is how you make dinosaurs?

				GRANT
		This is how you play God.

	Billy looks around the lab. He can't help but be impressed.

				BILLY
		Okay if I take pictures?

	Grant nods.

	Billy sets his lucky camera back down on the worktable. Two years
	from now, astute observers of the DVD will not that Billy
	doesn't actually take his camera from the bag; he was carrying
	it because there wasn't any room inside.

	Billy pulls a new roll of film from the bag and zips it shut.

	ACROSS THE LAB

	Amanda is passing a large cylindrical tanks with half-formed
	embryos floating in formaldehyde -- genetic experiments gone
	awry. Finally she reaches

	A GIGANTIC MANIFIED RAPTOR HEAD

	floating in the one tank.

	Something about this specimen catches Amandas attention. She
	bends forward, getting very close to the glass. She peers right
	into the eyes of the nightmarish creature. Then --

	AN ACTUAL RAPTOR

	lunges at her form behind the tank. She SCREAMS.

	Fortunately the raptor can't get between the closely spaced
	tanks. Amanda runs.

				PAUL
		Amanda!

				GRANT
		Back out! Move!

	And as the group races through the lab the Raptors find a
	larger gap between the tanks.


58	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY				58

	Paul leads the way, checking the door for possible escape
	routes or hiding places. Twenty feet behind,

	THE RAPTOR

	rounds a corner, bolting after them. Paul ducks in the closest
	door.

				PAUL
		In here!


59	INT. DINO KENNEL - CONTINUOUS - DAY				59

	The group slams the door behind them and quickly takes in the
	room.

	There are several rows of oversized steel cages, apparently
	used for containing young dinosaurs. Many of the cage doors are
	standing open.

	The group races down a lone aisle. Close behind, the raptor
	BURSTS into the room, ROARS.

	As the Raptor gains ground, Udesky and Billy run into one of the
	open cages, SLAMMING the door behind them.

	Grant, Paul and Amanda duck into another. Before they can
	swing the cage door shut behind them, however, the raptor SLAMS
	into it, driving the door into the cage.

	They are forced back against a chain-like wall, trapped in a
	small triangle space by the advancing door. The angry
	Raptor is now inches away through the cage door.

	Then, suddenly, the raptor looks up. We follow its gaze. The top
	of their triangular enclose is wide open.

	The eager raptor climbs up the chain-like door. Catching the
	tail of an idea, Amanda grabs the door and nods to the others.

				AMANDA
		Push!

	They push hard on the cage door, swinging it and the raptor
	right through the opening of the cage.

	Now the raptor is trapped in a small triangular space, the door
	going right to the ceiling.

	Amanda slides the door's bolt through the chain like wall,
	temporarily trapping the dinosaur.

	The raptor struggles desperately, GRAWLING AND SNARLING, but
	the cage door seems to be holding.

	As everyone rushes back to the door.

	The raptor begins to make a LOW, HAUNTING MOAN.

	As the others head for the door, Grant lingers a step, listening
	to the beast's simple melodic cry. It has the same tones as
	came from the model resonating chamber.

				GRANT
		She's calling for help.


60	EXT. COMPOUND - DAY						60

	The group exits the rear of the lab building and finds itself in
	a large equipment yard. The CALL of the raptor is still audible
	as they head for the tree line.

	Now they moan is ANSWERED from distant jungle quarters.

	The responses quickly MULTIPLY. To the group's dismay, they
	soon find themselves virtually SURROUNDED by raptor CRIES both
	distant and near.

	Grant looks around with amazement. It's vindication of his
	theory on raptor communication, but it couldn't come at a worse
	time.

	Responding to the growls, a herd of grazing HADROSAURS suddenly
	flees across the open space. Then, in the distance behind the
	herd

	A PACK OF RAPTORS

	emerges from the jungles, coming their way.

				GRANT
		Head for the trees!

	From the lab building, the raptor we left imprisoned now BURSTS
	out one of the doors and HOWLS to the pack -- the same cry we
	heard in the lab.

	The raptor pack moves into the hunting formation. One ALPHA-MALE
	RAPTOR. slightly larger than the others, leads the charge up the
	middle.

	Grant risks a looks back. But doesn't stop running.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		THIS WAY!

	In an effort to escape the oncoming raptors, Grant leads the
	group right into the stampeding heard of hadrosaurs.

	Suddenly, all is chaos. Hadrosaurs race past, splitting up the
	group.

	Letting the others get ahead of him, Grant looks back. Much to
	his dismay, the raptors are ignoring the hadrosaurs.

	Indeed, the pack weaves its way through the herd -- the raptors
	only want them.

	In the chaos of the stampede, everyone loses sight of each other.

	Up ahead, Billy trips and falls. As he rolls the strap on his
	camera bag breaks. He doesn't notice it's missing until he's
	already back on his feet and running.

	Amanda and Paul keep close to each other. Further back, Grant
	spots Billy's fallen camera back. He grabs it as he runs past.

	Looking back, Billy sees that Grant now has his back...

				BILLY
		ALAN!

				GRANT
		KEEP GOING!

	They lose sight of each other in the rush.


61-19	OMIT									61-69


69A	EXT. EDGE OF THE JUNGLE - DAY					69A

	As the hadrosaurs WHIP PAST, Paul and Amanda climb up into a
	tree. A raptor leaps at Paul, barely missing his leg.

	Trying to pull Paul up, Amanda nearly loses her balance. This
	time, Paul catchers her.

	Billy climbs up a nearby tree of his own in sight of Paul and Amanda.

	Udesky has nearly reached a tree of his own when he finds
	himself

	HEADED OFF

	by a raptor. He turns to the other way, but finds

	THERE ARE MORE RAPTORS.

	He picks up a fallen branch as these dinosaurs cautiously
	approach. Not more than a few feet away, the leader of the trio
	stops, peering at him.

	Udesky swings hard, but the dinosaurs feints. From behind him,
	another raptor slashes at the back of his legs, severing his
	muscles. Udesky CRIES OUT and drops to the ground.

	IN THE TREETOPS

	Paul, Amanda and Billy can hear him.

				PAUL
		Udesky.

				AMANDA
			(Listening)
		He's this way.

	From here, the thick branches overlap, forming a kind of
	"second floor" above the ground. It's not easy, but you can move
	from branch to branch, tree to tree.

	ON THE FLOOR

	Unable to walk, Udesky attempts to crawl away from the animals.
	The effort clearly causes him great pain. Strangely, the
	raptors suddenly don't seem interested in him anymore.

	Rather, they're "talking" among themselves. Udesky is amazed to
	find him self still alive.

	Suddenly, one of the raptors SLASHES at him again. But it's
	delicately not a mortal blow, just a very painful one. Udesky
	CRIES OUT, louder this time.

	IN THE TREES

	Hearing the new cry, Paul, Amanda and Billy move faster, now
	finally seeing Udesky on the ground. He's face-down, barely
	moving but still MOANING.

	The raptors are gone.

	In the lead, Amanda starts to climb down. But Paul grabs her,
	holds her back.

				PAUL
		It's not safe.

				AMANDA
		We have to help him.

				BILLY
		He's right. A predator wouldn't leave a kill
		wounded.

				AMANDA
		He's not a kill, he's still alive.

	She breaks from Paul's grip and drops to the ground. She's only
	a foot away from the tree when

	ALL FOUR RAPTORS

	lead out from their hiding places. They almost catch her as
	Billy and Paul pull her back up on the limb

	The raptors stare up at them, angry their plan didn't work.

				PAUL
		They couldnt climb up, so they were trying
		to get us to come down.

				BILLY
		They set a trap
			(amazed)
		They actually set a trap.

	Bored with waiting, the raptors go back to finish off Udesky,
	making a meal out of it. Up in the branches, the survivors are
	horrified and sickened.

	Then, from the deep in the forest, a new RAPTOR CRY. The feasting
	raptors look up, listening, then suddenly run off into the dark
	jungle.

				PAUL
		Where's Grant?


69B	EXT. ELSEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE - DAY				69B

	Climbing higher in a tree, Grant is just feet above a growing
	pack of raptors. He scales one branch, the next, finally
	reaching a perch that the dinosaurs can't jump to.

	LOOKING DOWN

	The entire pack is now standing still, watching him. In the
	center, the Alpha Male lets out a sort of BARK. Responding to the
	cry, the other raptors CALL BACK.

	As terrified as he is, he can't help but be fascinated by their
	communication. Like a hellish bird song, there's a rhythm to it,
	a structure. They're clearly talking about something.

	Under his breath, Grant is able to mimic its patterns.

				GRANT
		What does that mean? What are you saying?

	Of course they can't answer. They just keep using the same
	"phrase."

	Ready to ditch Billy's camera bag in order to climb higher --
	he's had to hold it by the strap -- Grant finds his hand covered
	with a runny slime. He looks down at the camera bag, and that's
	the source. It's oozing out the bottom.

	He unzips the bag to find

	A BROKEN RAPTOR EGG

	inside, the white and green yolk still dripping from the pieces
	of the shell. There's another intact egg beside it.

	This is what the raptors where chasing.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		God damn you, Billy.

	Ever the scientist, Dr. Grant tests a theory even in the face of
	danger: he holds up the intact egg so that the raptors can see it.
	They suddenly go crazy, howling the same phrase but LOUDER.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		It means, "Give us the egg," doesn't it? "We
		want the egg."

	He gently drops the bag to the ground. Although the raptors are
	interested, pulling out the unbroken egg, they're still by no means
	placated. The song may have changed, but they still want Grant
	dead.

	They begin to jump at him, eventually, hopping up on each
	others backs. It's only a matter of time till they reach him.

	Grant moves to climb higher, but sees no branches he can reach.
	And than he hears the low CREAKING. A CRACK. The branch he's
	on is starting to give in.

	He looks down at the face of his enemies, knowing he'll be
	their next meal. And then,

	A SMALL CANISTER

	lands at the base of the trees, immediately SPRAYING out a thick
	cloud of oily fog. It's the first of

	FIVE CANISTERS

	that land in the area, creating a thick cloud. It's not just
	smoke though something far more caustic.

	As it hits the raptors they immediately recoil, those closest
	to the canisters SHRIEKING in pain. Tumbling in the dirt.
	There may be a pheremonal element to the mist as well -- they
	seem panicked, disoriented.

	Pack mentality takes over, and after the first ten raptors take
	off running, so do the rest, some tripping over their feet
	blindly.

	This may be dino-tear gas, but it's not good for humans either.
	Up in the tree, Grant's eyes immediately burn from the vapor
	He squints to see through the fog, where he spots

	A HUMAN SHAPE

	at the edge of the smoke

				VOICE
		Come on! They'll be back!

	Grant half-climbs, half-falls out of the tree, rushing to get
	through the heaviest of the smoke.

	A SMALL DIRTY HAND

	grabs his, pulling him along.


69C	EXT. JUNGLE - LATE DAY						69C

	Eyes swollen from the gas. Grant stumbles, barely able to see as
	the other person pulls him along. It's only now we can identify
	his rescuer as

	ERIC KIRBY,

	the boy he was brought to rescue. A lot has changed in the last
	eight weeks. It's not just dirt and muck -- he's the filthiest
	child you've ever seen -- something primal has come out in him.

	Something wild.


69D	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - TWILIGHT				69D

	On the far side of the tipped over vehicle, Eric pulls open a
	hatch -- his hiding place. The door opens part way.

	Eric motions for Grant to follow.


69E	INT. INSIDE THE BUNKER - TWILIGHT				69E

	Squeezing in sideways -- it's very tight fit -- Grant finds
	himself in a space no bigger than the inside of a Datsun. lit by
	a small battery-powered lantern. This is where Eric has been
	hiding.

	The minute Grant's inside, Eric goes back to work re-sealing
	the door. This 13-year old boy has become astonishingly
	efficient at staying alive.

				GRANT
		Eric...

	The boy holds up a hand. He listens for a moment. He doesn't
	hear anything outside.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Eric, your parents are both here.

				ERIC
		In Costa Rica?

				GRANT
		On the island.

	Eric truly can't believe it. He hoped to be rescued but...

				ERIC
		They'll never make it. I mean, they can't
		manage when the cable goes out.

				GRANT
		You'd be surprised what people can do when
		they have too.

	Eric studies his guest, finally certain he recognizes him.

				ERIC
		You're Alan Grant, aren't you?
			(off surprised reaction)
		I read both of your books.

				GRANT
		Which one do you prefer?

				ERIC
		The first one. Before you where on the island.
		You liked dinosaurs back then.

				GRANT
		Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.

	Grant takes a better look around Eric's tiny hideaway,
	impressed with what he's been able to scavenge. Among the many
	items we see another smoke canister, some battery-powered
	lanterns and lots of candy wrappers. This kid's been living on
	chocolate for weeks.

				ERIC
		When InGen cleared out, they left a lot of
		stuff behind.

				GRANT
		Any weapons, radios?

	Eric pulls up a long cattle prod to show Grant.

				ERIC
		Found this, but the battery's dead.

				GRANT
		It's a wonder you aren't. I'm amazed, Eric. I 
		barely lasted 30 hours. You lasted eight
		weeks.

	The line catches Eric strangely. It's the first moment of true
	emotion we've seen him in.

				ERIC
		Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.

				GRANT
			(trying to be positive)
		The important thing is we both made it.
		That's something we have in common.

	Eric rips into a candy bar. After a moment, he realizes he
	should offer one to his guest as well.

	Grant takes it. A lone beat. Than, Grant just has to know...

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Did you read Malcolm's book?

				ERIC
		Yeah.

				GRANT
		What did you think?

				ERIC
		I dunno. I mean, it was kind of preachy.
		Chaos-this, chaos-that. And like, to me, the
		guy seemed kind of high on himself.

	Grant smiles.

				GRANT
		That's two things we have in common.


69F	EXT. TREETOPS - NIGHT						69F

	The trio is where we left them, perched up in the branches.
	They're far from safe, but nothing's after them for a
	while.

	In Billy's eyes, we can see a storm of guilt raging. But he
	hasn't said anything. Won't say anything.

				AMANDA
		We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr.
		Grant are out there somewhere.

				PAUL
		I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit
		of good right now. For every scary thing we
		saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times
		more of 'em at night.
			(to Billy)
		Am I right?

				BILLY
		I dont know.

				PAUL
		I thought you were an expert.

				BILLY
		Dr. Grant was.

				AMANDA
		Well Dr. Grant isn't here, so we're going to
		have to figure out what to do ourselves.

	Amanda is impressed by her own determinations. A long beat.

				AMANDA (cont'd)
		So what do we do?

	No one has the faintest clue.


69G	EXT. DEEP IN THE FOREST - NIGHT					69G

	VARIOUS SHOTS; The creatures of Isla Sorna walk past in the
	shadows, some looking up at the light in the trees.

	Suddenly, one of the creatures is attacked by another. We hear
	ROLLING, SNARLING, HISSING, just seeing the outline of the
	fight. Just as fast as it began, the fight is over, the winner
	snakes on the loser.


69H	EXT. TREETOPS - NIGHT (LATER)					69H

	Everyone's moved to different branches, trying to settle in for
	the night. Paul keeps looking over to the tearful Amanda, about
	to say something. He finally does.

				PAUL
		I just want you know, Amanda. It's not
		your fault what happened.

	Amanda looks over, not sure what his absolution.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		Eric has always been headstrong, and you
		throw Ben Hildebrand into the mix and well...

				AMANDA
		Well what?

				PAUL
		Well damn it. I don't speak ill of the dead.
		What I'm trying to say is, its was just a crazy
		accident. The exact same thing could have
		happened if he was with me. You can't go
		beating yourself up about it.

	Realizing he's trying his best, Amanda cant stay angry with
	him.

				AMANDA
		This wouldn't happen if he was with
		you. I mean, you drive five miles below the
		speed limit. I totaled three cars in fives
		years.

				PAUL
		That one time was just the bumper.

				AMANDA
		He would have been, safe. Completely,
		entirely, suffocatingly safe.
			(beat)
		I would have him to see more of the world than
		Enid, Oklahoma. I wanted to see more of the
		world than Enid, Oklahoma. And so yes, it's
		my fault that this happened. I'm sorry that
		you have to be here.

	Really looking at her...

				PAUL
		I'm not sorry at all.


69I	EXT. INGEN COMPOUND - DAY					69I

	Morning on Isla Sorna. A low mist hangs tight to the forest
	floor as Eric seals up his hideaway for hopefully the last time.

	They start walking. Eric pulls something out of his pocket,
	shows it off to Grant.

				ERIC
		Know what this is?

				GRANT
			(takes it)
		A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.

				ERIC
		Mine's new.

	Grant hands it back.

	Eric is becoming more and more a normal thirteen-year old boy.
	There's an innocence to him that's coming back.

				GRANT
		How much of this island have you explored?

				ERIC
		I stayed pretty close to the compound,
		Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's
		where they'd start.

				GRANT
		We need to head for the coast.

				ERIC
		Are you sure?

				GRANT
		Why?

				ERIC
		Closer you get to the water, the bigger
		things get.


69J	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69J

	Billy and Amanda wait for Paul as he comes out of the bushes,
	hiking up his shorts.

	Trying to take charge...

				BILLY
		We need to stick to the plan. Head for the
		coast.

				AMANDA
		What about Eric and Dr. Grant?

				BILLY
		Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's
		alive, thats where he's headed.

				AMANDA
		What about Eric?

	Billy represses his instinct to say Eric's dead.

				PAUL
			(rationalizing)
		He's probably has a better chance by the coast
		as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs
		would live in the center of the island.
			(to Billy)
		Right?

				BILLY
		Sure.


69K	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69K

	As Grant and Eric walk, both stop, hearing a strange sound. But
	for a change, it's not an ominous one.

	It's a human one.

	A phone is RINGING, very faintly. Without a word to each other,
	Grant and Eric decide its coming from the right.

69L	EXT. JUNGLE - CONTUNUOUS DAY					69L

	Paul is picking the briars out of his socks as they hike,
	risking tripping on every step. Then Amanda stops short. She's
	the first to hear it:

	THE SAME RINGING.

	After a beat, everyone else can hear it too. And recongnition
	finally lights on Paul's face...

				PAUL
		My phone.

	Suddenly, Paul frantically searches his pockets as the others
	anxiously watch.

				AMANDA
		You had the phone the whole time?

				BILLY
		Where is it?

				PAUL
		I don't know. I don't have it with me.

				AMANDA
		When did you have it last?

				PAUL
		I don't remember

				AMANDA
		Think.

	And Paul wracks his memory...

				PAUL
		The plane. I got a call on the plane, put it in
		my coat pocket, and...

	Bust suddenly, he stops, his face is lighting with an awful
	realization. Amanda couldnt bear the wait...

				AMANDA
		What?...WHAT!?

				PAUL
		I loaned it to Nash. He must have had it on
		him when he...

	The hideous implication of his words slowly sink in.


69M	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY							69M

	Still following the faint RINGING, Grant and Eric turn to find

	A SAIL

	moving through the low trees. We recognize it as the back of a
	spinosaurus. We might think it's any random spinosaurus,
	except for the RINGING coming from somewhere inside it.

	Grant and Eric press back against a tree, keep perfectly
	still as they hear the THOOOOMB, THOOOOMB, THOOOMB of the
	creature's footsteps reverberating. It's tail RUSTKES against
	the brush.

	It's moving behind them, and it's close.

	We hear the RINGING move from left to right as it passes. So
	far, its has no idea they're there.

	Looking across the clearing, Eric is startled to see

	PAUL AND AMANDA

	are no more than 20 yards away, also hiding. An involuntary
	reflex, Eric calls out...

				ERIC
		Mon! Dad!

	Grant immediately covers the boys mouth. But it's to late.
	The dinosaur has stopped. We still can't see it. We don't know how
	close it is.

	Paul and Amanda spot Eric with Grant. They're a thousand
	emotions at once: relieved, disbelieving, terrified, overjoyed.
	They want to run to him, to yell out to him, but the monster is
	close.

	Grant takes his hand off Eric's mouth. They both stay
	completely silent.

	All this time, the sat-phone is RINGING.

	Than it stops.

	And after an agonizing beat, the beast moves. At first we're
	not sure which direction it's headed, but finally we can tell
	its moving away.

	Once the sail is finally out of sight, Eric breaks from Grant's
	hold and dashes to his parents' arms. They coop him up. Hug
	him, kiss him, their affection unquenchable. He's crying.

				AMANDA
			(reassuring him)
		Sweetheart, you're okay.
			(reassuring herself)
		You're okay.
			(disbelieving)
		You're okay.

				PAUL
		Never had a doubt. Never did. Us Kirby men,
		we stick around, huh?

				ERIC
		We do.

	Looking at her grubby son, Amanda licks her shirttail, trying
	to rub his face clean.

				PAUL
		Honey, there's not enough spit in the world
		for that.

	She LAUGHS. It's the first times she's laughed in two months.

	Billy crosses the distance to Grant.

				GRANT
		We need to keep moving.

				BILLY
		Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry
		about the...

				GRANT
		Billy, I can't talk to you now.

	He walks off. Billy follows him.

				BILLY
		Please, okay? Just yell at me. Call me an
		idiot. An asshole. Stupid. Tell me I screwed
		up because I know I did.

	Grant doesn't respond.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		I thought if we could get a raptor back
		to the mainland, we could get serious money
		for it. Enough to fund the digging for 10
		years. More. Whatever it took.

	Grant shakes his head, disgusted, But doesn't stop.

				BILLY (CONT'D)
		You have to believe me. I did it with the
		best intentions.

				GRANT
			(finally turning on him)
		Some of the worst things imaginable have
		been done with the best intentions. You
		rushed in with no thought to the
		consequences, to yourself or anyone else.
			(finally)
		You're no better than the people who built
		this place.

	Grant keeps walking, leaving Billy with his guilt.


70	INT. CANYON BUILDING - DAY					70

	The group enters a structure with giant windows designed to
	look into the canyon beyond -- only there's nothing to see but a
	thick fog.

	Toward the center of the room, a spiral staircase that leads to
	a lower level.

	With Billy lagging, Grant approaches the stairs and peers down
	the circular opening in the floor. There is not much to see, just
	fog, a glint of sunlight.


71	EXT. RIVER CANYON - DAY						71

	Step by step, Grant leads the group down a rusty spiral
	staircase below the observation room. The stairs end in a lower
	level. Although we're technically outside, this whole place feel
	strangely enclosed.

	There's a thick fog at this level -- clouds, really -- but far
	below we can see the river. And at its banks, a barge.

				GRANT
		We climb down to the barge and follow the
		river out to the ocean. With any luck, the
		Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.

				ERIC
		Then we go home?

				AMANDA
		Then we go home.

	Grant leads everyone down a RAMP to --


72	EXT. LANDING - DAY							72

	A catwalk branches off, a SET OF STAIRS continuing down the
	along the canyon wall.

	Grant starts down the stairs. He's only taken a few steps down
	the rusty staircase suddenly

	BREAKS BENEATH HIS FEET.

	Paul grabs him in the nick of time. The staircase vanish into
	the fog. CLANFING AGAINST the canyon wall. After a few more
	seconds of silence, they hear the CRASH far below.

				AMANDA
		You okay?

	Grant nods and looks in the other direction.

				GRANT
		How about if we try this way?

	Their only other option is a precarious catwalk that
	disappears into the mist.

				AMANDA
		Do you think it goes all the way across?

				GRANT
		One way to find out.

	The only way to get his-near-fall is to push ahead. But his
	stomach turns at being so high.

	Amanda follows. The catwalk creaks and groans, listing
	slightly. She freezes mid-stride.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
			(glancing back)
		We'd better do this one at a time.

	Amanda steps of and Grant carefully pushes forward,
	disappearing into the thick fog.

	The others listen to the CREAKING of the catwalk until it STOPS
	ABRIPTLY.

	SILENCE.

				PAUL
		Dr. Grant?

	More silence. Then, out of the fog, a distant voice call out --

				GRANT (O.S.)
		Come on over. One at a time.

	Amanda steps tentatively forwards. Eric is clinging to her.

				AMANDA
		Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.

				PAUL
		We're not going anywhere, I promise.

	As Paul holds Eric, and Amanda shares a look.

				Amanda
		We're all together now, Eric.

	Eric reluctantly releases her mother. Amanda starts to cross.


73	EXT. REVER CANYON - FAR WALL - DAY				73

	Grant has stopped at a lateral support across the
	catwalk, trying to get the sense of where they are and what
	purpose this place may have served.

	Seeing that the support beams are brace high arched walls of steal
	mesh, it becomes obvious that we are inside this vast
	construction.

	Amanda emerges from the mist and turns back to the catwalk.

				AMANDA
			(calling out)
		Okay! Come on, Eric!


74	EXT. LANDING - DAY							74

	Eric is next to go across. He's still tentative.

				PAUL
		How 'bout if I...

				ERIC
		No, I can do it.

	Billy and Paul look on as Eric disappears into the vapor.

				PAUL
			(muttering to himself)
		That's it Eric. Nice and easy...


75	EXT. CATWALK - DAY							75

	Eric slowly gropes his way forward. He feels a GUST OF WIND and
	a HEAVY THUD ahead on the catwalk which now sways beneath
	him.

	Regaining his balance, Eric peers forward, but the fog prevents
	him from seeing more than fifteen feet ahead. There is an EERIE
	SILENCE. Eric calls out timidly.

				ERIC
		Mom?


75A	EXT. RIVER CANYON - FAR WALL - DAY				75A

	Across the canyon, Grant moves across the later support. With
	his hand on the railing, he sends a white, hardened substance
	dropping into the mist.

	Looking up, Grant notices a large strut, covered with the same
	substance. Realizing what it could be.

				GRANT
		Oh, my God.

				AMANDA
		What is it?

				GRANT
		A bird cage.

	Then, the sound of Eric SCREAMING.


75B	EXT. CATWALK - DAY							75B

	Eric watches as A LOOMING SHAPE emerges from the fog -- a
	nightmarish vision stalking purposefully forward.

	A FULL GROWN PTERANODON,

	standing over seven feet high, walks upright on clawed feet, his
	thirty foot wings folded bat-like at his side.

	The creature sees Eric and fixes him with a demonic glare.

	Eric CRIES OUT and dashes back down the teetering catwalk.

	The Pteranodon ruses to its feet, spreads its thirty-foot wings
	and flies directly at him.

	AT THE OTHER END OF THE CATWALK

	Hearing Eric's SCREAMS, Paul charges onto the catwalk,
	searching in the fog.

				PAUL
		Eric!

				BILLY
		It won't hold!

	Suddenly,

	ERIC

	emerges from the fog, racing toward his father. And then
	
	THE PTERANODON

	swoops out of the fog, opens its giant rear claws, and snatches
	the terrified boy from the catwalk.

	Paul Kirby watches in stunned, abject horror as the Pteranodon
	carries Eric directly overhead --

				PAUL
		ERIC!

	The flying reptile struggles with the boy's weight. Paul
	watches helplessly as Eric is carried high across the canyon.

	Paul runs back alone the catwalk in a desperate attempt to keep
	Eric in sight.

	Billy stays behind, moving back up the platform to try to
	keep the dinosaur in view. With a new idea, he races back up the
	stairs to the observation room. He has a way to save Eric.

	When he reaches the canyon wall, Paul turns a corner and runs
	along another enclosed catwalk leading deeper into the canyon.

	Grant and Amanda now come pounding down the catwalk trying to
	catch up with Paul.

				AMANDA
			(shouting)
		Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?

				PAUL
			(shouting back)
		I'm trying! That thing took him down this
		way!

				GRANT
		Split up!

	THE PTERANODON

	carries Eric deeper into the canyon. The creature's wings beat
	steadily overhead, and the WIND is fierce. Eric looks down and
	sees the river far below.

	The Pteranodon swoops over an isolated outcropping of rocks at
	the end of the canyon and drops Eric into --


75C	EXT. PTERANODON NEST - DAY					75C

	A large bowl of mud and branches the size of a satellite dish.
	Eric lands right on top of a pile of dinosaur bones picked
	clean. Mixed among is one human skull.

	Before Eric has time to cry out, he looks up to find

	SIX PTERANODON HATCHLINGS

	closing in on him with sharp-edged beaks.

	He picks up the human skull and whips it to the hatchlings.
	They easily duck it and keep coming.

76	EXT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS DAY			76

	Grant looks up to see Billy leaning out over the edge of the
	observation platform. He suddenly realizes what Billy is about
	to do.

				GRANT
		BILLY! WAIT!

	Billy SHOUTS BACK, an excited-terrified grin on his face.

				BILLY
		I CAN GET HIM!

				GRANT
		NO!

				BILLY
		I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES!

	Billy jumps off the railing and

	DROPS TOWARDS THE CANYON BELOW.

	Grant, Paul and Amanda watch as Billy FALLS past them like a
	stone, plummeting towards certain death. But then --

	THE PARASAIL CHUTE

	blossoms above him.

	Not only does it slows Billy's descent, but he even manages to
	catch an updraft and begin to rise.

	He struggles to control the parasail, swooping dangerously
	close to the canyon wall, barely avoiding it.

	Up ahead he catches sight of Eric and steers towards him.


77-80	OMIT									77-80


81	EXT. PTERANODON NEST - DAY					81

	Eric struggles to keep away from the hatchlings. But there's
	no way out of this nest.

	Billy SWOOPS overhead, but he's too high to reach Eric.

				BILLY
		ERIC! HOLD ON!

	He circles around to make another attempt.


82	EXT. ENCLOSED CATWAY - DAY					82

	Paul rounds the corner and finally catches sight of Eric in the
	nest, some fifty feet below, fighting off the hatchlings.

				PAUL
		Hang on, Eric!

	Paul sees an outcropping he could jump onto from here. It's a
	big leap, though, he might not make it. He steels himself up for
	the jump, then chickens out.

	Grant and Amanda come up behind him. Suddenly,

	A SECOND PTERANODON

	CRASH LANDS on the catwalk enclosure about them -- right next
	to a gaping hole in the mesh. The catwalk GROANS with the
	extra weight.

	The pteranodon JAMS its head through the hole, SNAPPING at
	them.


83	EXT. CANYON - IN THE AIR - DAY					83

	Billy circles, making his approach.

	In the nest, Eric kicks at the hatchlings, but they're
	undeterred. Billy and Eric will only have one chance.

	As Billy swoops past, Eric jumps and grabs onto his boot. He is
	yanked up and out of the nest. But than, MOTHER PTERANODON
	shoots past, tearing out a piece of the parasail in its beak.


84-85	OMIT									84-85


86	EXT. OVER THE RIVER - DAY					86

	The pteranodon who landed on the top of the catwalk continues to
	SNAP through the hole in the enclosure.

	Finally the reptile's massive weight proves to much, and the
	entire section of the catwalk BREAKS FREE of the canyon wall
	and FLIPS OVER LATERALLY.

	Amanda, Grant and Paul are able to hang on, but so is the
	pteranodon, who now climbs their way.


87	OMIT									87


88	EXT. OVER THE RIVER - DAY					88

	His parasail badly damaged, Billy tries to keep aloft. Heading
	as low as he dares, he yells to Eric --

				BILLY
		Let go!

	Terrified, Eric falls into the river safely. He surfaces,
	immediately swimming to shore.

	Trying to gain altitude, Billy bends hard to the right. But the
	rigging is too badly damaged. He flies right into the canyon
	wall, hitting hard.

	Instead of tumbling down to the river, he finds himself
	swinging from his harness - the parasail snagged on a rock
	spire above him.


89	EXT. BROKEN CATWALK - DAY					89

	Paul, Grant and Amanda struggle to stay away from the
	pteranodon as it moves towards them.

	Suddenly. the far end of this inverted section of catwalk
	detaches from the canyon wall and

	SWINGS DOWNWARD.

	The force of the action sends the three tumbling directly
	towards the pteranodon.

	Miraculously, they manage to avoid its open beak. But they
	are all sent plummeting toward the river below.


90	EXT. RIVER - DAY							90

	They hit the water hard, resurfacing moments later. The
	current is carrying them downstream.


91	EXT. CANYON WALL - DAY						91

	The two pteranodons who were pursuing Billy now land on nearby
	ledges and consider how best to dispatch their prey.

	Billy frantically tries to unhook his harness, but the tension
	is so tight from his own weight that he can't loosen the
	buckles.


92-93	OMIT							  92-93


94	EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY					      94

	Paul and Amanda emerge from the water by the canyon wall and
	find their son hiding behind a rock, searching the skies for
	Billy.

	Amanda takes Eric tightly in her arms, and Paul urges them to
	keep moving. Up ahead, the mesh of the aviary meets the river.

	Wading the shore, Grant now scans the canyon, searching for
	Billy. It doesn't take long to spot him.

95	EXT. CANYON WALLL - DAY						95

	Billy continues to struggle with the harness but to no avail.

	The doomed young man is suspended high up on the canyon wall
	like a modern Prometheus, an entire FLOCK of pteranodons
	gathering around him preparing to peck away his liver. And
	everything else.

	A MAMMOTH PTERANADON has landed beside him and looks him
	straight in the eye.

	The gigantic creature lunges at him. Billy dodges away as best
	he can. The pteranodon's frustrated bite severs a crucial
	juncture on Billy's harness, and Billy is able to wriggle free.


96	EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY						96

	Eric, Amanda, Paul and Grant watch in amazement as Billy is the
	last to PLUNGE DOWN into the river.

				GRANT
		He made it!

	Billy bobs to the surface and spots the group downstream. He
	waves and begins to swim towards them. Soon he nears the shore
	and gets to his feet, wading as he comes.

	Grant, Paul, Amanda and Eric hurry to meet him.

	Grant is overjoyed to see him alive. But his smile quickly
	fades as he sees

	THE ENTIRE FLOCK OF PTERANODONS

	diving down from above in angry pursuit of their lost prey.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Billy, look out!

	Billy glances behind him. He races forward, motioning fro his
	companions to turn around.

				BILLY
		Get back! Get back!

	Just then Billy is knocked down by the lead pteranodon. It
	strikes from behind with a brutal, calculated beak to the head.
	Billy stumbles and falls to the ground.

	Grant rushes forward with Paul right after him. Amanda takes
	Eric to safety down river.

	Billy SCREAMS as the ENTIRE FLOCK of pteranodons now swarms
	around him, picking him apart with their beaks and claws.

				GRANT
		Billy!

				PAUL
		It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.

	Grant can't take his eyes off Billy, whose BLOOD stains the
	water rushing by.

	And now several pteranodons are heading their way. Difficult
	as it is to leave Billy behind, Grant and Paul make a run for it.

	Just as the pteranodons are about to swoop in for the kill, Alan
	and Paul dive back into the river...


97	EXT. THE RIVER - CONTINUOUS DAY				97

	...and resurfaces on the far side of the mesh aviary wall, GASPING
	for air. Just behind them, the mammoth

	PTERANODON

	CRASHES into the mesh. It tears at the steel, actually ripping
	it in one place.

	At the dock up ahead, Amanda and Eric have found a rusty,
	waterlogged barge that's somehow still floating. Carrying a
	tarp-covered cage, the boat was meant for transporting dinos
	up and down the river.

	Amanda pushes them away from the dock as Alan and Paul climb
	on board.


98	EXT. ON THE BARGE - CONTINUOUS DAY				98

	The current takes the craft downstream, letting us get our
	first good look at the incredible
	
	AVIARY.

	It's a vast, domed mesh structure that spans the entire canyon.
	In all, a feat of remarkable engineering and unmistakable
	hubris.

	Catching their breath, our four survivors look at the cage they
	were caught in.


99	EXT. DOWN RIVER - DAY / LATER					99

	Yanking the starter rope one final time, Paul finally gets the
	engine to turn over, PUTTERING along. Amanda is beside him,
	bailing water.

				PAUL
		My own kid was right in front of me and I
		didn't do a damn thing.

				AMANDA
		You couldn't have made that jump.

				PAUL
		I should have tried. It should have been me
		on that beach back there, not Billy.

				AMANDA
		How would you have helped Eric?
			(he can't answer)
		He needs you, Paul. He needs us.

				PAUL
		He could have died.

				AMANDA
		But he didn't. And neither did you. And I'm
		glad about that.


99A	UP ON THE BOW							99A

	Grant is beside Eric, keeping watch, but also feeling the weight
	of Billy's death.

				ERIC
		Do you have any kids?

				GRANT
		No. Although I've studied them in the wild.

	Eric looks over, not sure what that means.

				GRANT (CON'T)
		I have a theory that there's two kinds of
		boys. Those who want to be astronomers and
		those who want to be astronauts.

				ERIC
		I want to be an astronaut.

				GRANT
		See, I was the opposite. I never understood
		why anyone would want to go into space. It's
		so dangerous. You do one thing wrong and
		you're dead. The astronomer -- or the
		paleontologist -- get to study these amazing
		things from a place of complete safety. And
		truthfully, everything you really need to
		learn, you can learn it from the ground.

				ERIC
		But then you never get to go in space.

				GRANT
		Exactly. The difference between imagining
		how things might be and seeing how they
		really are. To be able to touch them. That's
		what Billy wanted to do.

	The barge starts to round a bend. On the bow, Grant and Eric
	are the fist to see something remarkable. Eric GASPS,
	unprepared. We don't know yet what they see.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		I can blame the people who made this island.
		But I can't blame the people who want to see
		it. To study it.

	At the rear of the barge, Paul just now sees what's ahead. Awe-
	struck, he slows the motor and motions for Amanda to take a
	look. And so do we.

	UP AHEAD

	The setting sun illuminates an incredible valley filled with
	dinosaurs. We see armored ANKYLOSAURS with clubbed
	tails. Duck-billed CORYTHOSAURS. We float under the gigantic,
	arching necks of eighty-foot BRACHIOSAURS.

	With the mist from the river and the play of light, we're
	witnessing a kind of primal Eden.

				GRANT (cont'd)
		How's a boy suppose to resist this?


100	EXT. FURTHER DOWNSTREAM - NIGHT				100

	A FULL MOON passes behind clouds. THUNDER quietly rumbles, and
	LIGHTNING flickers in the distance.

	Paul is still at the wheel. The river is narrower here, and
	cautions must be taken to avoid the banks.

	As the barge begins to round another bend. a FAMILIAR HIGH-
	PITCHED SOUND pierces the darkness. Muffled but unmistakable,
	it is the RINGING SAT-PHONE.

	All exchange looks of sheer PANIC, expecting Spinosaurus to
	leap out at any moment. Grant scans the river banks.

				GRANT
		Keep quiet.

	Paul cuts the motor, and time seems to stop as the four stand
	posed for action.

	The barge finishes rounding the curve, and the ringing grows
	LOUDER. The suspense is excruciating until finally...

	Their eyes widen at some horrifying sight, more horrifying
	than anything they've yet seen.

	SEVEN MOUNDS OF DINOSAUR DUNG sit on the patch off treeless flat
	ground just beyond the river bank.

	As our friends consider the sight, an idea comes to them all of them
	almost simultaneously.

	With Eric still in the boat, Amanda, Paul, and Alan jump into
	the river and rush to the bank.


101	EXT. RIVER BANK - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT				101

	The three companions sprint towards the source of the RINGING.

				GRANT
		Find it before it stops ringing!

	And bracing themselves and hocking their breath, they PLUNGE
	their arms into their respective dung-heaps. After a few
	moments of this disgusting search...

				PAUL
		I've got something. I think I've got
		something!

	All turn to Paul. Clearing away the clinging defecation, he
	holds up to a beeper. And still the phone RINGS.

	Returning to their bleak task, they shovel the excrement with
	their arms. Finally:

				AMANDA
		I've got it! I've got it!

	Grant snatches the RINGING SAT-PHONE from Amanda's hands,
	presses a button, and puts it to his ear.

				RECORDED VOICE (ON PHONE)
		You too can own a time share in beautiful
		Guadalajara. Enjoy a meal in one of our four
		star restaurants, explore our coral reefs, or
		just walk on the beach...

	The Kirbys hear the recorded voice and let out a collective,
	heavy sigh. Grant shuts off the phone.

	In all the excitement, none of them notice a fierce horned
	CARNOTAUR right behind them. The giant creature ROARS, ready
	to eat them.

	But as it gets in close, it smells them. Even a dinosaur won't
	eat something that is covered in shit. After a beat, the
	Carnotaur turns and walks away, back into the jungle.

				PAUL
		Can't help but be a little offended.


102	EXT. BACK ON THE BARGE - NIGHT					102

	CLOSE ON the cleaned satellite phone's display. The battery
	level indicator is FLASHING.

				PAUL
		Whatever you do, don't call the U.S. Embassy.
		They won't do a God Damn thing.

				GRANT
		Well, we don't exactly have a Costa Rican
		phone book here, so it will have to be
		somebody we know in the states. Someone we
		can absolutely count on to send help.

				PAUL
			(to Amanda)
		Stan.

				AMANDA
		I wouldn't trust Stan with a snowball in a
		blizzard.

	Paul glares at her. Now Eric notices something odd in the
	river.

				ERIC
		What's that?

	The others look down in the murky water. Just below the
	surface,

	A SHIMMERING WAVE OF SILVER

	passes beneath the boat.

	Then a SINGLE FISH jumps from the water. And another. And
	another.

				GRANT
		Bonitas.

				ERIC
		Something must've scared them.

	Another roll of THUNDER, this time much closer.

				GRANT
		Get the motor going.

	Paul moves the motor and pulls the start cord. The engine
	sputters but won't come to life.

	And now the phone BEEPS. The battery is getting even weaker.

	Grant makes a quick decision and DIALS.

				AMANDA
		Who are you calling?

	But Grant ignores the question. RING. RING.

				GRANT
		Pick up! Pick up!


103	INT. ELLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT				103

	Wearing his jammies, three-year old Charlie awkwardly picks up
	the phone with both hands. He has the mouthpiece next to his
	lips, but the earpiece is hanging out in space.

				CHARLIE
		Hewwo?

	INTERCUT

	Recognizing who it must be...

				GRANT
		Charlie? Charlie. Get your mother. Right
		away!

	A long silence. Charlie bites his lip, looks around.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Charlie? Are you there?

				CHARLIE
		Hewwo?

	The sat-phone BEEPS again, this time much LOUDER.

	Amanda and Eric watch Grant, realizing their fate may hang on
	this single call. Paul struggles without success to start the
	motor.

	Then, unseen by the group, a

	GIGANTIC FIN

	rises from the water just fifty yards from the barge. It's
	headed right to them and closing fast.

				GRANT
			(desperate)
		Charlie! It's the dinosaur man! Go get
		mommy, okay?

				CHARLIE
		Okay.

	Not sure what to do with the phone, Charlie makes a logical
	choice and hangs it back up.

	He walks away to his mom.


104	EXT. BARGE - NIGHT [END INTERCUTTING]			104

	Grant realizes he's been cut off. He's about to redial when

	WHAM!

	The barge is RAMMED, sending everyone tumbling. Grant manages
	to stay on top of the wheelhouse, but he loses grip on the
	phone, which falls on deck.

	SPINOSAURUS

	rises from the water, towering over the barge. As lightning
	FLASHES and thunder CRACKS, the dinosaur lets out an ear-
	splitting ROAR.

	It lunges at Grant with gaping jaws. Grant leaps out of
	the way just in time as the dinosaur

	RIPS OFF

	the entire wheelhouse.

							            CUT TO:


105	INT. ELLIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT				105

	Charlie leads Ellie into the room. Hands her the phone. Of
	course, it's just a DIAL TONE.

				ELLIE
		Was somebody on the phone?

				CHARLIE
		Dinosaur man.

	Ellie looks at him with confusion, then quickly checks the
	Caller ID box besides the phone. It's international, and not a
	number she recognizes.

							          BACK TO:


106	EXT. THE BARGE - NIGHT						106

	Grant stays one step ahead of the Spinosaurus as the beast rips
	apart the quickly-sinking boat.

	It spits out the wheelhouse and bites down on the stern of the
	boat, ripping off a chunk.

	Grant is heading up to the other three when he hears the sat-
	phone RING.  He spots it, just about to fall into the water.
	Dives for it, answering...

				GRANT
		ELLIE!


106A	INT. ELLIES LIVING ROOM - NIGHT					106A

				ELLIE
		Alan?

	She can hear the Spinosaurus ROAR.

				ELLIE (CONT'D)
		Alan? Alan!

	But he's cut off by a SECOND ROAR, the sound of someone
	SCREAMING.

	And then the line goes dead.

	Ellie pales. Charlie looks at her with a smile.

				CHARLIE
			(imitating)
		Raaaar!


106B	EXT. BACK ON THE BARGE - NIGHT					106B

	Dropping the dead phone, Grant scrambles towards the front of
	the boat and joins Paul, Amanda and Eric, who have taken refuge
	in the dinosaur cage.

	The fearsome beast now lifts the stern of the boat clear out of
	the water.

	The cage SCRAPES across the deck and SLAMS into the gunwale,
	toppling off the barge and

	INTO THE RIVER.

	Grant and the Kirbys are still inside.


107	EXT. THE RIVER - UNDERWATER - NIGHT				107

	The cage sinks. The closest to the door, Paul manages to get out.

	The other three aren't as lucky. The cage rotates as it descends
	and lands on the river bottom with the door side down, trapping
	them inside.

	In the cold murky depths, they pull frantically on the bars.
	Debris and equipment float around them.

	Paul surfaces out of the breath and disoriented. Spinosaurus
	pushes past the boat. If anyone is going to save his family, it
	has to be him.

	And so he dives.

	Pushing with all his might, he manages to tip the heavy
	structure, just enough so Amanda, Eric and Grant can get out.
	Paul himself isn't so lucky.

	Spinosaurus grabs the cage and Paul, throwing both straight up
	out of the water. Paul flies twenty feet away, further from the
	shore.

				AMANDA
		PAUL!

				ERIC
		DAD!

	Spinosaurus is going after the heroic Mr. Kirby, who dives,
	swimming underwater. He's trying to lead it away from his
	family.

				GRANT
			(looking around)
		Up! Up!

	He points to a heavy crane assembly, designed for lifting cages
	off the large boats. Now well accustomed to fleeing on
	command, Amanda sends Eric up first, climbing the scaffolding
	like a jungle gym.

	All the while, they're trying to spot Paul.

	Grant is the last to climb, reaching the first section as
	Spinosaurus returns from the water, SLAMMING into the base of
	the crane. The whole assembly SHUDDERS, threatening to rip into
	the water.

				ERIC
		Where's Dad?

				AMANDA
		Just hold on.

	Try as it might, the beast can't climb the crane. So instead it
	RAMS it, SHAKES it, trying to knock them off. Eric slips, but
	Amanda catches him.

	About to shed his bag to climb higher, Grant finds one last
	hope. It's the resonation chamber model. A beat before he
	decides: It may not be the best choice, but it's the only choice.

	He blows through it, the same EERIE PITCH we heard before. On
	the third try, he's able to approximate the "egg" cry he heard
	the raptors give. He keeps it up, repeating over and over.

	Spinosaurus stops for a beat, confused How this sound could be
	coming from a non-raptor. But then keeps SMASHING.

	We can hear the mounting bolts STRAIN. Soon the whole crane
	will tip.

	But not before a MATCHING CRY is heard in the jungle. Grant
	stops, not certain he heard it. But there it is AGAIN.

	He keeps blowing.

	The crane is close to tipping when a single RAPTOR appears
	from the darkness, CHIRP-BARKING at the Spinosaur, who simply
	bats away.

	But then MORE RAPTORS come. And even MORE. Soon there are
	dozens gathering, circling.

	Grant stops signaling. All three survivors watch with
	horrified fascination, knowing their fate is perilous no matter
	which side wins.

	Looking at his adversaries, Spinosaurus ROARS. And suddenly
	the raptors attack.

	Spinosaurus easily handles the first few, but like ants they
	just keep coming. They climb up his back, slicing, into him with
	their razor-sharp claws.

				GRANT
		Jump! Swim for the far shore!

	All three drop from the crane arm into the water.

	Meanwhile, the fight continues. Spinosaurus rallies, shaking
	off many of the raptors, but they just keep coming. Their
	hooked claws dig in, scraping the meat to the bone.

	Spinosaurus puts up a brave fight to the end, but finally
	collapses, dead. The raptors continue to shred it to ribbons.
	Then one of the raptors looks over to see the survivors
	swimming away.

	But a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. It goes back to
	its meal.


107A	EXT. FAR SHORE - NIGHT						107A

	Grant is trying to move them along. still headed downstream.
	But Eric won't budge another foot.

				ERIC
		We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.

				AMANDA
		I know. I know. I want to look for him too.

				ERIC
		then we should...

	She kneels down, facing him. She's just as upset as he is, but
	motherhood carries the burden of remaining calm.

				AMANDA
		Let me tell you a few things about you Dad,
		okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave,
		and he loves you ever very much.

				ERIC
		He loves you too.

				AMANDA
		Okay. He loves us very very much. And I know
		that right now more than anything, your Dad
		would want to know that we're safe. Okay?

	Eric nods.

				AMANDA (CONT'D)
		We're going to get out of this, and
		everything's going to be all right, I promise.

				A VOICE
		Listen to your mother.

	Out of the darkness steps Paul Kirby. Amanda is knocked over
	with surprise. Eric runs to him, nearly tackling him.

				PAUL
		Good thing I've been swimming, huh?

	Amanda hugs him and Eric so tightly they can't breath.


									CROSSFADE TO:


108-109	OMIT								108-109


110	EXT. BEACH - DAY							110

	The foursome sit back on the wide beach, one facing
	each direction, keeping watch. A light rain is falling, but they
	don't seem to notice.

	Trying to keep his boy's spirit up...

				PAUL
		You remember when we went fishing last
		summer? And I was trying to put the boat in
		and the trailer sank? And then the tow truck
		came and tried to pull it out, but it got
		dragged in? And the truck driver threatened
		to knock your Dad's lights out? So I said I
		was the governor and he believed me?

	Eric really smiles, remembering the day.

				ERIC
		Yeah.

	Amanda is smiling too. She had completely forgotten the
	incident.

				PAUL
		That was a fun day.

	To Paul, after some consideration....

				AMANDA
		We should try fishing again.

				PAUL
		You mean it?

				AMANDA
		I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows?
		Things might turn out differently.

	Her hand takes his, gently brushing off the wet sand, fingertips
	touching. It's a small thing, but it's a start.

	Sensing his cue to leave, Grant gets up and starts walking down
	the beach. Eric hurries to follow him. He speaks
	conspiratorially, not wanting to alarm his parents.

				ERIC
		The lady you called, how do you know she can
		help us?

				GRANT
		She's the one person I could always count on.
		And she's saved me more times than she
		realizes. I owe her everything.

	A long beat as they walk.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		It's strikes me now I never told her that.

				ERIC
		You should.

				GRANT
		You're right.

	As they keep walking, Grant notices something rammed against
	the rocks ahead. It's a speedboat, its hull ripped open from the
	impact.

	And it's not just any boat either -- it's the same Dino-Soar
	boat that was pulling the parasail. Eric hasnt seen it yet, so
	Grant stops him.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		Eric, do you know what happened to the boat?
		that brought you here? Why did it crash?

				ERIC
		No. I couldn't see.

				GRANT
		Do me a favor. Go back to your parents for a
		minute, would you?
			(pre-empting objections)
		They look worried.

	Eric nods and heads back to Paul and Amanda. Grant forges on,
	approaching the speedboat wreckage. He doesn't know what he'll
	find, but he needs to look.

	Almost reaching his parents, Eric stops. Looks out over the
	ocean, where he sees

	TWO LIGHTS.

	He doesn't say anything for a moment, trying to make sure
	they're real. They are. And they're coming closer.

				ERIC
			(excited)
		Mom! Dad!

	They look up to see the distant lights, just now making out
	full forms...

				PAUL
		Helicopters. Helicopters!

	He SHOUTS with joy. Paul, Amanda and Eric wave their arms,
	making as much motion as possible. The helicopters -- big
	military choppers -- change direction, heading straight for
	them.

	Paul and Amanda embrace, then kiss, the moment getting the best
	of them

	AT THE SPEEDBOAT

	Grant looks in, prepared to see anything in the wreckage. But
	the cabin is surprisingly intact, just a little blood. There are
	three gashes on the driver's seat back. Grant measures their
	spacing with his fingers.

				ERIC
			(yelling over)
		Dr. Grant! Helicopters are coming!

	Grant looks down to the wet sand around him, finding a trail of
	three-toed tracks.

				ERIC (CONT'D)
		We're safe!

				GRANT
			(to himself)
		No we're not.

	THE FIRST CHOPPER.

	flies right overhead. Paul and Amanda are confused, until the
	second helicopter starts to land -- the first on is there to 
	cover them.

	Grant YELLS at the first chopper, trying to wave it away. But
	the noise of the blades is DEAFENDING.

				GRANT (CONT'D)
		NO! STAY BACK! THEY'RE IN THE TREES!

	At the treeline, the upper branches are shaking. At first, it
	looks like it's just the wind off the chopper, but
	something more is happening.
	
	A PTERANODON

	flies up out of the trees, the first of twenty. It's a gorgeous
	and terrifying sight.


110A	INT. FIRST CHOPPER - DAWN					110A

	Terrified, the Costa Rican CHOPPER PILOT veers away, but the
	pteranodons are already on him. They SMASH at the windows,
	grabbing on the skids, The chopper rolls wildly.

	One over-eager pteranodon sticks his head up to high, getting
	decapitated by the blade.


110B	EXT. BEACH - DAWN							110B

	As the second chopper touches down on the beach, Eric, Amanda
	and Paul load in. Grant is running their way.


110C	EXT. BY THE TREES - DAWN						110C

	Meanwhile, the first copper is losing the battle even as it
	climbs higher. The helicopter suddenly tips, falling, SMASHING
	into the trees with a massive fireball.


110D	INT. SECOND CHOPPER - DAWN					110D

	Seeing the explosion, the SECOND CHOPPER PILOT takes off. Eric,
	Amanda and Paul are on board, but Grant is still running up.
	The helicopter passes right over him.

				AMANDA
			(to the pilot)
		You have to go back! We can't leave him!

	Seeing a ladder release by the door, Paul throws the lever. A cord-
	and-steel-ladder unfurls, dragging across the sand.


110E	EXT. THE BEACH - DAWN					   110E

	Grant chases after us, catching a rung just as it goes over the
	water. Behind him, pteranodons are circling the wreckage of
	the first chopper and starting to go after the second.

	Buffeted by the wind, Grant climbs the ladder up towards the
	chopper. A pteranodon flies up right behind him, trying to
	bite. It catches Grant's shoulder.

	Grant spins to the far side of the ladder. The pteranodon goes
	to bite him again, but finds it head caught between the rungs.
	As it tries to free itself, it just gets more entangled.

	The entire ladder starts to lift, caught by the updraft from the
	creatures wings.


110F	INT. SECOND CHOPPER - DAWN					110F

	Up with the pilot, Amanda sees the other pteranodons are headed
	back to the island, unable to keep up.

				AMANDA
		They're not following.

	In back, Paul and Eric get the ladder mechanism to begin to
	retract. It reels Grant in faster. It also reels in the
	pteranodon, which may be caught, but is still plenty dangerous.

	As Grant reaches the cabin, they shut off the ladder engine.
	The pteranodon is still working its way free, pulling itself closer
	and closer.

				GRANT
			(shouting over the noise)
		We have to cut it! Find something sharp!

	Everyone checking the cabin for a knife, anything sharp.

	Finally, Eric hands Grant the raptor claw.

	Grant uses it to rip the line. The fibers break and fray, but
	the pteranodon keeps coming closer.

	Paul throws a wrench at the pteranodon, WHACKING it straight
	in the head. It felt good, and damn if it didn't slow it down a
	little.

	Grant has cut through the cord. He started on the second when
	the pteranodon SNAPS at him, going for his hand. There's
	nowhere for Grant to cut without the pteranodon getting him.

	And idea, Grant very deliberately places in his hand on the line,
	pulling away at the last moment. The pteranodon itself bites
	through the line.


110G	EXT. OCEAN - DAWN							110G

	The pteranodon falls away from the helicopter, catching wind
	just before it hits the water.

	It circles and flies back to Isla Sorna.

	As horrifying as the creature was a moment ago, it's suddenly
	beautiful again. Each motion of its giant wings is a small
	symphony.


110H	INT. COPPER / FLYING - DAWN					110H

	Sitting between his parents, Eric looks back at the island in
	the distance.

				ERIC
		What do you think is going to happen with the
		dinosaurs?

				GRANT
		The population will Stabilize eventually.
		They'll adapt to fit different roles.

	ON PAUL AND AMANDA

				PAUL
		Either that, or the government will firebomb
		it back to the Stone Age.

				AMANDA
		I would completely support that.

	ON ERIC AND GRANT

	looking back at the island.

				ERIC
		I hope they don't. I want to come back
		someday.

	And Dr. Grant realizes...

				GRANT
		So do I.

EXT. OCEAN  DAWN
The helicopter flies away across the ocean, leaving the island behind.

				   THE END
