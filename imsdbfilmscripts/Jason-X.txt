JASON X - Revised Rough Draft


	JASON-X
	BY TOD FARMER
	REVISED ROUGH DRAFT
	MAY 24, 1999

	FADE IN:

	DARKNESS.

	A scream rises to an ominous crescendo as we SHOCK CUT INTO -

	MONTAGE of fast moving clips.  Death, destruction, fear.  All images 
	taken from the previous ten Friday The 13ths.  

	AGAIN, DARKNESS.

								OPEN ON:

	The year is 2455. The place is Old Earth. Barren, void of life, a 
	hazardous and violent planet. The sky is blood red with spiked clouds of 
	dark gray.  It is beautiful, but frighteningly foreign.

	BLUE LIGHTNING CRACKLES as several figures rush through a DUST STORM 
	below. 

	Small groups of people, wearing thick dusters, goggles and masks, work 
	nearby. Some dig in the cracked earth, others take assorted readings 
	with strange devices.

	This is an archeological expedition.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  DARK PLACE

	The dust storm rages outside. Two figures are looking closely at a small 
	object buried in the dirt. One of them pulls a device out of their pouch 
	and slowly, gently picks up the object. The other uses a magnetic tool 
	to remove the dirt.

				FEMALE VOICE
		Careful . . .

				MALE VOICE
		I know.

	They take off their masks and goggles. They are both young. ADRIENNE 
	female (17) watches as STONEY male (18) studies the object closely.

				STONEY
			(reading)
		Not guaranteed, if used After 2198.

	CLOSE UP of the object. It's an unopened condom.

				ADRIENNE
			(smiles)
		You thinking what I'm thinking?

	Stoney tosses the high tech equipment over his shoulder and rips open 
	the condom as Adrienne rips her clothes off.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	They are in a half buried mini-van.  It rocks violently from the raging 
	storm outside and from the raging lust inside.

	BACK INSIDE THE VAN.

				ADRIENNE
			(breathless)
		What about Kkinsa?

	STONEY is desperately trying to take off her bra.

				STONEY
		It's over between us. You're the
		only one for me!

	METAL SCREECHES! THE FLOOR COLLAPSES!

	They fall some ten feet, RUBBLE RAINING down on top of them.

	INT.  DARK CORRIDOR

	A rusty metal ladder. Debris everywhere. Half inch layers of dust cover 
	everything. Dead. Lifeless.

				STONEY
		You okay?

	Adrienne sits up, shines her light down the long metal corridor. She 
	turns her light on STONEY then sees something over his shoulder.

	SHE SCREAMS A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM.

	We PULL BACK, out of the tunnel, through the van as the sounds of the 
	storm drown out ADRIENNE'S SCREAM.

								CUT TO:
	EXT.  BASE CAMP

	The digging and readings have stopped. A group approaches a time scarred 
	shuttle and begin loading their packs into the cargo belly.

	FAT LOU (40), rail thin, possible female, pilot, appears at the top of 
	the shuttle ramp.

				FAT LOU
			(yelling over the wind)
		Let's go! Time to load up!

	YLLO(33), a professor of archaeology lowers his veil. 

				YLLO
			(yelling)
		I'm missing two!

				FAT LOU
		Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have
		left this rock an hour ago!

				BOEMAN
			(eyes a device)
		North three clicks.

								CUT TO:

	EXT. MINI-VAN - DAY

	YLLO and the rest of the group run into view. BOEMAN (18), husky, 
	physical; holds out a device and checks the reading.

	He points to the rusted out mini-van sitting on its belly.

				BOEMAN
			(yelling)
		There!

	KICKER(30), bulky, short on temper, rushes up wearing futuristic 
	military garb -

				KICKER
		Yo, Teach, what the fuck?

				YLLO
		We're missing two of the kids!

				KICKER
		Get your ass back to the shuttle.
		I'll check it out.

	KICKER moves past the group and into the Van.

				YLLO
		Not without me!

	The rest of the gang look at each other and climb into the Van.

	INT. ANCIENT CORRIDOR

	YLLO and the others climb down a rusted ladder. Metallic walls, 
	graffiti, cluttered floors. No Stoney or Adrienne. A sign from the 
	ceiling states -

	CRYSTAL LAKE RESEARCH FACILITY.

	They all take off the goggles and masks. The rest of the group consists 
	of DELONGPRE(18) good looking, smart ass; JANESSA(17) sexual, scheming 
	AZRAEL(17) SMALL, COCKY; KKINSA(16), insecure, problematic; 
	THORGAN(17), a nerd but doesn't know it.

				YLLO
		Amazing! But, how . . I've been coming
		here for ten years. We never picked this up on
		our . . . KAY-EM?

	KAY-EM 14, a cybernetics science droid, removes her veil. She's 
	gorgeous, but there's something off about her look. Something synthetic.

				KAY-EM 14
		The air's laced with type two ozone,
		it reads as a solid.

				THORGAN
		Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.

				KAY-EM 14
		In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved
		their facilities underground to escape . . .

				KICKER
		All right, all right, enough with the history
		lesson. Lets find these two quick . . so I can kick
		some little punk ass.

	Kkinsa shines a flashlight around the dark tunnel.

				KKINSA
		I have an idea, why don't you go find
		them and we'll get the hell out of here!

	KKINSA turns and finds herself face to face with - -

	A CORPSE! Easily two-hundred years old it hangs from the wall, impaled 
	through the forehead by an iron spike. 

	KKINSA SCREAMS!

	Kicker yanks a weapon from his back, locks and loads as 

	JANESSA falls back and lands in the lap of another corpse. She screams! 

	KAY-EM 14 SCREAMS at the top of her lungs. Everyone looks at the droid.

				KAY-EM 14
		Was that out loud?

				DELONGPREE
		Thorgan, have you been screwing with . . .

	THORGAN grabs the head off the CORPSE, with the spike through it's head.

				THORGAN
		Cool! This is an automatic "A".

	Azrael dumps the contents of his bag on the ground, an old boot, some 
	cds, and an ancient box of PLAYTEX . . . starts shoving the corpse into 
	his pack.
				AZRAEL
		I've got my project. What are you losers
		gonna do?

				KICKER
		Back to the shuttle! All of you!
		I'll find them.

				YLLO
		Relax, Soldier boy, this is amazing.
		These remains are two hundred years old.

	Yllo's light hits a sign hanging from the ceiling. DANGER. STAY OUT.

				BOEMAN
		Creepy.

				THORGAN
		Cool.

				KKINSA
		Okay, I'm outta here.

				YYLO
		Kay-Em, any thoughts?

				KAY-EM 14
		Girth is better than length and
		women prefer a shaved scrotum during
		oral sex.

	Yllo glares a Thorgan.

				THORGAN
		I'm trying to give her some personality.

				YLLO
		Well stop messing with her. I don't want
		a science droid with a personality. Now
		let's find them and get back. I want to
		get clearance to stay back and study this . . .

				KKINSA
		No way! I'm not staying here any longer . . .
		I have a life you know.

	A radio crackles.

				FAT LOU(V.O.)
		Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze!
		Get your ass back hre!

				YLLO
			(into radio)
		Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it.
		You won't believe what we found.
			(calls out)
		Adrienne! Stoney!

	Yllo rushes past the corpse. The others reluctantly follow. They pass 
	another hanging sign - Danger - THEY PASS ANOTHER CORPSE LYING ON THE 
	FLOOR, it's torso separated from it's legs. And this is just the 
	beginning. As they move down the corridor there are bodies everywhere.

				BOEMAN
		There was a hall of a battle down here.

	S they move further they break a laser beam . . . sparks fly. A WARNING 
	VOICE sounds.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Dan-danger. Do not enter-er.

	But the group keeps moving. 

				KKINSA
		I feel compelled to ask why we are
		ignoring that.

	A corpse lies on the floor before them, it's skeletal hand beneath a 
	warning written in ancient blood . . .

	HELP ME . . .

	Suddenly another CORPSE LEAPS at them, screaming like a banshee! 
	Everyone SCREAMS - It lands on Kkinsa, who totally freaks trying to get 
	the corpse off her. 

	DELONGPREE and YLLO help Kkinsa fight the rotting corpse. They hear 
	hysterical laughter and look up to see -

	ADRIENNE and STONEY . . . emerge from the shadows laughing 
	uncontrollably.

				DELONGPREE
		Damnit!

				YLLO
		What the hell are you two doing?!

	Kkinsa eyes Adrienne, then glares at Stoney.

				KKINSA
		You're toast, mister.

				YLLO
		You're both toast!

				ADRIENNE
		You gotta see this!

	They turn down the right corridor, passing beneath ceiling consisting of 
	a jumbled mess of jagged metal.

				THORGAN
			(re: ceiling)
		That's a strange design, don't you think?

				KICKER
		We don't have time for this shit.

	As they pass we see a section of the jagged metal ceiling twitch and 
	squeeze together. That can't be a good thing . . .

	STONEY and Adrienne stop at a huge metal door. Above the door . . . 
	CRYOGENICS LAB.

	Adrienne points to a small window in the door.

				DELONGPREE
		Yeah, so? I had Cryo 101 last year.

				ADRIENNE
		Check it out.

	With a smirk, Adrienne wipes the condensation from the small window in 
	the door. Drawn from the inside, in blood, is a final warning -

	A SKULL AND CROSSBONES 

				KKINSA
		So don't open the door.

				ADRIENNE
		Look beyond it, yesterday's news.

	Yllo pushes his way to the window.

	Shocked faces.

	INSIDE the blue tinted room we see a huge domed Cryo cylinder. It's 
	massive, but our attention is pulled to the corner of the room. Curled 
	up into a ball, is a body - female, young.

				YLLO
		Is that?

				KAY-EM 14
		The room's still operational.
		She's perfectly preserved.

	Yllo's face lights up, grabs his radio.

				YLLO
			(into radio)
		Fat Lou, bring the ship to the
		following coordinates. Call Grendel,
		have them power up the labs, we're bringing
		in the find of the century!

				KICKER
		Now wait a minute! I don't think you
		should open that door.

				YLLO
		This is a science excursion corporal.
		Just stay out of the way.

	Yllo turns to the kids. He's very excited.

				YLLO
		Okay, no screwing around. This is the real
		thing. Do exactly what I say. Okay Thorgan, 
		open it up.

	Thorgan pops the cover from a control panel and hooks up a small gadget.

				KKINSA
		You're opening the door?
		What about the . . . ?

	She points to the skull and crossbones. 

				DELONGPREE
		I'm thinking we should call in some
		experts.

				YLLO
		This is your find people. You want to
		give your credit away?

				DELONGPREE
		I was just saying . . .

				THORGAN
		The cryo unit leaked. The computers
		sealed the room. No airborne viruses
		no hazardous materials. I've shut down the
		until. Alright, stand back. 

				KAY-EM 14
		Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses
		will render you unconcious.

				DELONGPREE
		Knock you on your ass pal. 

	They don their face masks as  . . . Fshhhhhshshsh. The metallic door 
	cracks open causing a powerful backdraft. The freezing cold air mixes 
	with the air outside the chamber creating a strange gray gas. Ice 
	crystals crack and fall to the floor.

	EXT.  CRYO CELL

				YLLO
		Kay-Em!

	Kay moves into the room ahead of the others.

	INT.  CRYO CELL

	CLOSE ON KAY-EM'S EYES

	They are not human. Mechanical, digital, but alluring. They dilate, open 
	up. Colored lasers shoot forth, slicing through the gas, scanning the 
	body.

	--which itself is slumped over. An icicle of frozen blood from, the 
	wound in her shoulder, props the body up.

	The other enter the icy chamber.

				DELONGPREE
		I speak on behalf of the group
		when I say . . . that's fucked.

				KAY-EM 14
		Female, nineteen years old, eight months . . .
		34-26-34 . . . bitch is built like a brick
		shit house.

				YLLO
		Thorgan?!!!

				THORGAN
		Sorry. I'll fix her when we get back.

				KAY-EM 14
		Time of hibernation 2049.
		Crystallization at seventeen percent.
		Suggest extensive Nanotech. Chances of
		rejuvenation eight-one percent.

				KKINSA
		What's going on?

				DELONGPREE
		She's dying.

				JANESSA
		Bitch looks dead to me.

	The RADIO CRACKLES . . .

				SERGEANT BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Yllo, Sergeant Brodski. Get your ass
		back to the shuttle!!

				YLLO
		Janessa, stretcher.
			(into radio)
		Keep your shirt on, sergeant. We have
		a medical emergency here not tot mention the
		discovery of a lifetime.

				SERGEANT BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Kicker! Get them the hell out of there!

	Janessa removes a Metallic cube from her backpack, clicks a button and a 
	flat stretcher expands and hovers a few feet off the ground.

	Kicker grabs Yllo.

				KICKER
		We're outta here!

	Yllo pulls away, leans over the frozen girl, grabs the frozen string of 
	blood and -CRACK-breaks it off.

				YLLO
		Fine, grab that end.


	Kicker sighs and helps Yllo lift the frozen girl and place her curled 
	body on the stretcher.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As thorgan stands at the massive Cryo-Unit -

				THORGAN
		Hey check this out!

	Protruding from the door is the tip of a machete.

				THORGAN
		This caused the leak and there's an
		occupant. 

	Thorgan yanks the door open.

				KICKER
		Don't touch that!

	Gas rolls out. Suddenly ALARMS SOUND and LIGHTS STROBE.

				KKINSA
		This is bad, no?

				THORGAN
		Relax, it's only a  glitch in the
		system. 

				JANESSA
		First field trip and you think
		you're a Scientist. Move out of the
		way geek. 

	JANESSA moves to look inside the chamber. 

	As the gas and steam clear - we hear the sound of CRACKING ICE, see a 
	jagged mass of frozen crystals . . . and within it . . . a body. A chunk 
	of ice CRACKS and falls tot he floor then THE MASK of JASON VOORHEES 
	looms forward!

	JANESSA screams as JASON'S BODY, stiff as a board, CRASHES to the ground 
	sending ice shrapnel everywhere!

				DELONGPREE
		Jesus, used to make the suckers big
		didn't they?

	Again, Kay-Em's eyes scan the frozen body.

				KAY-EM 14
		Subject was dead prior to incubation.

	Yllo moves to get a good look at Jason.

				YLLO
		My God, look at him. Why would they freeze
		a dead body?
			(a beat)
		Alright, load him up, and let's get out
		of here!

	OVER HIS SHOULDER - HALL

	A pair of three foot metallic spiders drop on thin wires to the floor.

	BACK INSIDE 

	One of Boeman's gadgets starts to BEEP.

				BOEMAN
		Er, guy? I'm picking up some movement.

	FZZZZT . . . Azrael screams as a laser slices into the room. His left 
	arm falls to the ground!

	Kay-Em rushes to him. Her finger pops open. A needle appears. She 
	injects him. The drugs take immediate effect.

				AZRAEL
		Cool . . . check out my arm.

	CLINK - CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK.

	HALL

	The metallic spiders, lasers attached to their bodies, CLANK towards our 
	heroes. 

				YLLO
		Kicker!

				KICKER
		Defense droids. I'm on it.

	Kicker slams the Cryo door shut as lasers slice into it.


				KKINSA
		There goes prom night.

	Kicker clicks at a gadget attached to his forearm.

				KICKER
		They're only class two. I can
		handle this. No problem.

				AZRAEL
		Not a problem?!

	Kay-Em injects him again.

				AZRAEL
		I'm missing a fucking arm heeeerrrr-
			(re:shot)
		Oh, that's dreamy.

	The lasers begin strategically slicing through hinges.

				JANESSA
		Okay rent-a-cop, do your shit.
		I gotta date tonight.

				KICKER
		Stand back!

	He pulls a gadget from his pack, punches in a series of buttons.

				YLLO
		We have to get these two back in one piece!

	Kay-Em turns to the frozen girl.

				KAY-EM 14
		Subject is critical. Needs nano stabilization
		immediately.

				YLLO
		Kicker! Do something!

				ADRIENNE
		Oh Gawd! I wish it would stop doing that.

	At her feet, Azrael's arm twitches spastically.

				AZRAEL
			(drugged up)
				That is soooo cool!

	Kicker cracks the door and tosses his gadget.

	KAFOOM!

				KICKER
				Come on!

	Kicker throws open the door and starts BLASTING! Yllo and the kids 
	follow him into the hall, the two stretches in tow. They disappear 
	around the bend - towards the exit.

	A beat then . . . screaming. They run back into view. Behind them - -

	CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK, CLINK.

	A dozen laser wielding spiders make chase! Some are old and rusty, other 
	slump over and short out, but those that work . . . work well.

	INT.  LONG CORIDOOR

	Kicker is running backwards, BLASTING with his weapon. Lasers FLASHING 
	all around our group. 


				KKINSA
		Have I told you guys how much I hate this class?

				KICKER
		We need another exit! I'll hold 'em off!
		Teach, find a way out!

				BOEMAN
		I'm on it!

				KICKER
		Sorry kid, leave this to the pros.

				BOEMAN
			(re: gadget)
		Left at the end of the hall!

	A laser strikes the body of Jason Voorhees, breaking off a chunk of ice.

				THORGAN
			(reading from device)
		They're not after us. Their sensors are
		locked in on . . . him!

	Thorgan points to JASON'S STRETCHER.

				KICKER
		Leave him behind!

				YLLO
		No! He's coming with us!

	They round a corner . . .

				BOEMAN
		Here. We're one meter from the surface!

				KICKER
		Then duck.

	CHA-CHUNK . . he cocks his grenade launcher and fires at the ceiling.

	KABLOOM!! Rocks and falling debris reveal the violent surface above.

				DELONGPREE
		It's too high!

	Kicker rolls around the corner and starts blasting!

				KICKER
		Make it happen!

				JANESSA
		They're just subclass B droids.
		I'm so not impressed.

				BOEMAN
		Stoney, you catch.

	Stonet leaps, grabs the lip and tosses his feet up and over in a very 
	acrobatic move.

	Boeman kneels, cups his hands to make a step. He begins tossing his 
	friends up to Stoney as Kicker makes war in the hall!

	Soon, Boeman and Kicker are the only two left.

				BOEMAN
		We're clear! Let's go!

	Boeman leaps up, grabs the lip and pulls himself to safety. 
	He spins around and holds his arm out for Kicker.

	Kicker leaps, grabs Boeman's hand. Boeman strains to pull him up as 
	spider's cover the floor below them, then -

	A spider crawls up Kicker's leg - a spike shoots out into Kicker's 
	thigh. He screams.

				KICKER
		They've got me! Let go!

				BOEMAN
		No!

	Boeman ROARS and pulls harder. Kicker's pack RIPS from his body - the 
	spiders falling with the pack.

	EXT. SURFACE - DAY

	The sand storm is raging on the surface. Kicker lands on top of Boeman.

				BOEMAN
		That wasn't so bad.

	Kicker bites the pin from a grenade, tosses it into the hole.

				KICKER
			(yells)
		This will be!

	The others dive for the ground as -  - 

	KAFOOM! A FIREBALL rises up out of the hole!

				THORGAN
		Nice touch.

				BOEMAN
		And you said high school was boring.

	Our team fights the winds and rushes up the ramp of the waiting shuttle.

	FAT LOU is waiting at the ramp. He looks at the two stretchers.

				FAT LOU
		Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .

				YLLO
		Just get us to the ship!

	Azrael stops in a panic!

				AZRAEL
		Oh shit I forgot my arm!

				ADRIENNE
		Here. Dumbass.

	She hands him the severed limb as they race up the ramp.

	The door closed, the SHUTTLE LIFTS OFF THE GROUND and soars into the 
	sky.

								CUT TO:

	EXT.  ORBIT AROUND OLD EARTH - LATE

	THE SHUTTLE maneauvers through the junk that now floats in orbit. Old 
	satellites, the front quarter of a Space Shuttle, etc.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

	Navigating through the debris, FAT LOU grabs a radio mike.

				FAT LOU
		This is Beowulf approaching from
		sector fifteen.

	Through the front windshield we see - - 

	GRENDEL, a class IV Catamaran Transport. It looks like two huge 
	torpedoes attached by three thin walkways. Not new, but by no means old.

				BERNIE(V.O.)
		I've got you, Beowulf. Proceed with docking.
		And by the way, Brodski's pissed.

	INT.  DOCKING BAY

	The shuttle doors open revealing SERGEANT BRODSKI and six E-X GRUNTS 
	standing with weapons at the ready.

	As the group gather their equipment and begin to move the two 
	stretchers, Brodski stepsi n front of YLLO.

				BRODSKI
		What the hell were you thinking?

	YLLO ignores him, turns to his team.

				YLLO
		Get them in the lab!

				BRODSKI
		Not so fast Yllo! There's a protocol here.

	The E-X Grunts step in front of kids.

				YLLO
			(to the grunts)
		Back off!

				YLLO
			(back to the kids)
		Get them to the labs . . . Now!

	The team moves through the Grunts.

				YLLO
		What the hell are you doing?

	Brodski looks down at the stretcher with the young woman's body on it.

				BRODSKI
		My god! This is way over your head, pal.
		We need to call some experts and . . .

				YLLO
		I am an expert!

				BRODSKI
		You're a teacher.

				YLLO
		Brodski I'll talk slow so you can understand me.
		She's thawing. If we don't get her to the lab,
		she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking
		head!

				BRODSKI
		What if they're carrying? Did you even check?

				KAY-EM 14
		Subjects scan virus clean . . .

	Brodski attempts to shove Kay-Em out of his way . . . BUT she stands her 
	ground . . . grabs his crotch.

				KAY-EM 14
		Mmm, you like the rough stuff don't you, big boy?

	Brodski and Yllo look at Thorgan.

				BRODSKI AND YLLO
		Thorgan!!

				THORGAN
		Sorry . . . I'll fix her . . . I promise.

				BRODSKI
		How do you know that piece of cursed rock down
		there doesn't carry something metal tits can't
		detect?

				YLLO
		Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.

				BRODSKI
		Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.

				YLLO
		I don't give a shit. This one's prime for
		decryonization. We're brining her back.

				BRODSKI
		I still think we should send for a team of
		real scientists.

				YLLO
		I am a scientist you asshole! This could be
		the most important discovery in 400 years. Do
		you have any idea what a find like this could
		mean?

				BRODSKI
		Right now, I care only for the safety of this
		crew. You don't know anything about these two -

	The stretcher with JASON moves by them. Brodski looks down.

				BRODSKI
		Jesus what the hell is that?

				YLLO
		That's exactly what we need to find out.
		Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you
		where discovery is concerned. Now step aside.
		I have a medical emergency to deal with.

	Reluctantly, Brodski steps aside. As the kids follow, Azrael bumps into 
	DALLAS, one of the E-X GRUNTS. Azrael glares at him, brandishing the 
	severed limb.

				AZRAEL
		Watch it punk, I'm armed.

				DALLAS
		Punk?

	Dallas slaps Azrael across the back of the head as he passes.

				AZRAEL
		You'll pay for that.

	Dallas and the grunts laugh.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

	FAT LOU and BERNIE, a synthetic pilot existing only from the waist up in 
	his pilot's chair, set course for home.

				BERNIE
		Gravitation nominal. Thrusters engaged.

				FAT LOU
			(into radio)
		Grendel to Grendel's mother, we are enroute.

				GRENDEL'S MOTHER(V.O.)
		Copy that, Grendel. Computer ovverides deployed.
		See you in two days.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  LABS

	Dark, quiet, until the lights glare on.

	LAB ONE doubles as a Medical Research center and Sick Bay. GLASS JARS 
	filled with some of the strangest creatures ever seen cover the back 
	wall.

	Yllo and the students bring the girl in. Their movements are hurried and 
	economical . . .but they're excited.

				YLLO
		Get her prepped for the soup.
			(to Adrienne)
		Take the other one to lab two.

				ADRIENNE
		Yllo, this is my find. My project.
		I want to be in here.

				YLLO
		I know, dear, but this is too big a 
		discovery. I need you to prep the second
		body.

				ADRIENNE
		But, I want . . .

				YLLO
		This is a discovery that we will all share.
		We have to work as  a team. Now go. Stoney
		go with her.

	Thorgan and Delongpre lift the Girl onto the rejuvenation table.

	Stoney whispers something to Kkinsa before he exits with Adrienne.

	Kkkinsa nods and wheels a huge SCANNING MACHING over to the Girl. She 
	starts the scan as Delongpree and Thorgan cut the clothes off their 
	"find".

				THORGAN
		Have I told you guys how much I love this class?

	Delongpree brushes some of the melting crystals from her face.

				DELONGPREE
		She's beautiful . . .

	Thorgan cuts her shirt off.

				THORGAN
		Damn! Talk about your hard nipples.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne and Stoney push Jason into the lab.

	LAB TWO is smaller and less high-tech than LAB one. They shove JASON'S 
	body onto the EXAM TABLE. 

				ADRIENNE
		Fucking Yllo! Thinks he can push me aside.
		This is my find!

	She removes chucks of ice from JASON'S FACE.

				STONEY
		You know even though we both found this guy ,
		I'll let you take the credits. You can take it 
		from here.

				ADRIENNE
		Oh thanks . . . fine go. It's just another
		dissection. You'll only get in my way.

				STONEY
		Cool. Besides, you're into this shit.

	Stoney leaves Adrienne alone with Jason . . . and he is THAWING.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo walks around the room, overseeing all the action. He's excited and 
	cocky.

				YLLO
		Hands on training is rare. You should consider
		yourself lucky.

				AZRAEL
		Lucky?!

	Azrael sits in a large machine. This is . . .

	The NANO-TECH 2000. It can repair non-fatal injuries with the use of 
	Nano-Technology. 

	Azrael is scanned by the NT-2000 and so is his injury. It goes into 
	action as articulated mechanics begin to re-attach his arm.

				AZRAEL
		Another hour and I'd have lost
		the arm.

				JANESSA
		Oh, was that the hand you beat off with?

				AZRAEL
		I better get extra credit for this shit.

				YLLO
		Delongpree, Status. How you doing?

	Delongpree cuts her underpants from her body and tosses them over his 
	shoulder.

				DELONGPREE
			(swallows hard)
		I'm Okay.

				STONEY
		Well she's definitely a blond.

				JANESSA
		Oh that's scientific.

				DELONGPREE
		You think all girls from the past
		looked this good?

				JANESSA
		She's not that great.

				THORGAN
		400 years . . . I bet she'll be horny.

				YLLO
		Okay, people, we need to Learn everything
		there is to learn about our two guests. And
		if all goes well, I'll mention each one of
		you when I make my nobel prize speech.

				DELONGPREE
			(underbreath)
		Yeah, right.

	Delongpre presses a button on the table. The edges of the table RISE UP 
	to create a clear dome around the table. A hot gel-like substance shoots 
	out of small tubes. The FROZEN BODY is covered in the NANO-GEL.

	Thorgan checks a monitor.

				THORGAN
		Everything looks good.

	Yllo smiles - gushing self-satisfaction.

				YLLO
		Turn up the heat.

	Adrienne is wearing a metal eyepiece while staring at a computer screen. 
	No hands. 

				ADRIENNE
		Done. Crystallization remains
		seventeen percent.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne scans Jason with a machine identical to the one Kkinsa was 
	using in LAB ONE.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Crystallization at sixty percent
		Subject classification . . . deformity.

				ADRIENNE
		Put it on the screen.

	A monitor lights up with a scan of Jason's body. The internal organs are 
	distorted and bloated. She keys into the next lab. 

	Back to lab one.

				ADRIENNE(V.O.)
			(over speaker)
		Guys, check out beef-cakes scan.

	Jason's 3-D scan appears on one of the big monitors.

				ADRIENNE(V.O.)
		Look at the brain.

	Within Jason's skull is a brain the size of a golf-ball.

				JANESSA
		It's just like Thorgan's.
		What do you think this means?

	Thorgan grabs his crotch.

				THORGAN
		This is what it means right here.

				JANESSA
		Small brains make your balls itch?

				DELONGPRE
		And what's with the headgear?

				KAY-EM 14
		The mask is an artifact from a
		sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.

				BOEMAN
		Hockey.

				KAY-EM 14
		A medieval sport where two teams
		club one another with elongated
		sticks. Very sexy.

				YLLO
		What do you expect from a culture that
		sucked its planet dry of resources.

	She eyes Stoney. He smiles knowingly.

				KKINSA
		This bores me.

				DELONGPRE
		She's red. Body temp 98.6. This
		is so cool.

				YLLO
		Prep defib and start the cell 
		reconstruction.

	KAY-EM 14 presses a series of buttons. A long needle punctures the 
	GIRL'S NECK. Jason's scan is replaced by the girl's. We see 
	Nanotechnology going to work replacing her wounds and damaged cells.

				THORGAN
		Cool!

	Kkinsa and Stoney back out of the room unnoticed.

				YLLO
		Is she stable?

				KAY-EM 14
		Subject is stable and cell
		reconstruction has begun.

				DELONGPRE
		Now what?

				YLLO
		We wait. I need about fifteen.
		Call me if there are any changes.
		If she farts I want a full report.

				AZRAEL
		Don't I deserve a sick day or some
		shit like that?

	Yllo exits.
								CUT TO:

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	The door swishes open. Stoney enters with Kkinsa close behind. Kkinsa 
	raises her hand.

				KKINSA
		Adrienne?! Of all people!

				STONEY
		You're jealous.

	Stoney moves back. Kkinsa moves close hand raises above her head.

				KKINSA
		Adrienne?!

				STONEY
		It's over between us. You're the
		one I want.

	Kkinsa grabs the back of her shirt and pulls it over her head.

				KKINSA
		Bed!

	A bed slides out from the wall, hitting Stoney in the back of the legs, 
	causing him to fall on the bed. Kkinsa straddles him. Stoney grabs her. 
	The two fall into a feverish kiss.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne is prepping various medical tools. JASON'S BODY is laying on an 
	autopsy table. Steam rises from his body as thick ooze drips from his 
	thawing flesh.

	She turns on a computer monitor.

				ADRIENNE 
		Prepare organ vats.

	Two metal sinks hiss as liquid nitrogen flows.

				ADRIENNE
		Okay big boy . . . 

	She picks up a long, sharp chrome tool and walks over to Jason's body.

				ADRIENNE
			(continuing)
		. . . let's see what you're made of.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  YLLO'S CABIN

	Yllo enters and approaches a computer console. The door behind him 
	opens. Janessa enters.

				JANESSA
		All this science shit, makes me horny.
			(removes her shirt)
		Take off your cloths, we don't have much
		time.

	She drops her shirt to the floor. Yllo retrieves it, hands it back.

				JANESSA
		You're quicker than usual.

				YLLO
		Later.

				JANESSA
		You prefer an apple?

	He forces her into the hall, closes the door, locks it. He returns to 
	the console.

				YLLO
			(to console)
		Secure line. Perez, Joshua,
		Solaras Space Lab. Connect.

	EXT.   SOLARAS SPACE LAB - EST.

	A huge cylindrical ship, floats quietly. We hear a BEEPING sound.

	INT.   SOLARAS SPACE LAB - PEREZ QUARTERS

	Joshua Perez rolls over, clicks on a light. He fumbles for a button, 
	presses it. A wall monitor lights up revealing Yllo's face.

	INTERCUT AS NEEDED

				PEREZ
		You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?

				YLLO
		We just left old Earth. You'll never believe
		what we found.

	Yllo inserts a disk into the console.

				YLLO
		I'm sending you the files.

				PEREZ
			(testy)
		Yeah, yeah if this is another ancient
		Farrari . . .

		YLLO
		Trust me. I'm bypassing regular channels.
		See what kind of payday we're looking at.

				PEREZ
			(begins download)
		Alright, I'm . . .
			(reacts to file)
		No way . . . is this a joke?

	Yllo smiles.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne leans over JASON'S THAWING body. Oozing goo drips from the 
	slab.

	She is inches away from his steaming mask. She taps it with her tool.

	She begins working at the straps of the mask, cutting the overgrown 
	flesh away.

	INT.  YLLO'S CABIN

	Yllo studies a monitor. On screen: a document entitled, EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS 
	OF DISCOVERY. He talks on the secure line.

				YLLO
		Hypothetically, how much are we talking?

				PEREZ(V.O.)
		If you're for real, you're looking at a million
		credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include
		touring and guest lectures. When can you get them
		here?

				YLLO
		I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?

				PEREZ(V.O.)
		See you then . . . doctor.

	Yllo's face glows with thoughts of fame and fortune.

					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  HALL OUTSIDE YLLO'S QUARTERS

	Janessa has hooked up a small device to the door. She's heard every 
	word.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Kkinsa rips off Stoney's shirt. Stoney grab her and rolls on top of her.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	CLOSE ON JASON'S HAND - it curls, the frozen joints CRACKLE.

	Adrienne turns from Jason's mask. A large wad of goo hits the floor. She 
	turns back to her work. Slicing flesh away from the mask.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Stoney and Kkinsa kiss passionately as they wrestle to get each other's 
	pants off.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne tries to pry the Mask off . . . but it holds firm.

	She stick s a long sharp tool into an eye hole. We hear disgusting 
	noises as she probes JASON'S EYE SOCKET.

	She removes the tool, and on the end is Jason's eye!

	Holding it close she looks at it. It is bloated and distorted. She drops 
	it in a specimen jar and takes it over to her work station.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Kkinsa rolls on top of Stoney. She holds his arms down as she whispers 
	in his ear.

				KKINSA
		How bad do you want it?

	Stoney gets his arms free and rolls on top of her.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	JASON'S LEG JERKS!

	Adrienne turns again, then approaches.

				ADRIENNE
		Interesting. Record. Thawing has
		caused possible muscle spasms.

	She frowns at the disgusting ooze. A mixture of swamp waters, blood, and 
	other thawing bodily fluids, puddle around Jason's body.

	She moves back to her work station and picks up JASON'S BLOATED EYE. She 
	takes out an autopsy laser and cuts through the center of the eye.

	The laser slices through the fatty tissue as thick black goop drips out 
	of the eye. Adrienne stares into a microscope. This is all very 
	interesting.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Stoney lies on top of Kkinsa.

				KKINSA
		Yes . . . yes . . . that's it!

	. . . a moment, then both GASP as he enters her.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	JASON sits up!

	CLOSE on ADRIENNE as she studies the dripping eye. She puts the laser 
	down and turns to the slab and freezes.

	JASON IS GONE!

	She spins around only to find Jason standing behind her. He grabs her by 
	the throat! She can't scream. She kicks wildly as he studies her.

					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Delongpre, Boemen, Kay-Em 14 and Thorgan wait and watch girl in the 
	NANO-GEL. Thorgan is getting impatient. He can't find something.

				THORGAN
		Anybody seen the reticulator?

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Adrienne is thrown into a work light. The room goes dark. 

	INT.  LAB ONE

				DELONGPRE
		Try next door, there was one there
		yesterday.

	Thorgan exits.

	INT.  LAB TWO'S OBSERVATION ROOM

	The lights go. Thorgan looks around. Through the thick glass, where 
	JASON is killing Adrienne, is blackness.

				THORGAN
		Wakey wakey love birds . . . Yllo's
		gonna be pissed if he catches you fooling
		around instead of working.

	Thorgan roots through a drawer, his back to the glass.

	ANTE ROOM

	Through the glass beside him we see Adrienne screaming. But NO SOUND. 
	All rooms are air tight. Her head is smashed on the glass!

	Still screaming, her face recedes back into the darkness as Thorgan 
	looks over his shoulder.

				THORGAN
		Bye, lovebirds . . . Stoney, you dog.

	He exits.

	BACK TO JASON

	As he - -

	DUNKS Adrienne's head INTO ONE OF THE METAL SINKS. Her body goes limp. He 
	pulls her head up and stares at her frozen head, eyes open, mouth locked 
	in a scream.

	He thumps the head against a wall. IT SHATTERS! Jason drops the body 
	with a thud then turns to the - -

	DISSECTION TOOLS. He chooses a long silver cleaver.

	JASON'S BACK!

	EXT.  LAB ONE CORRIDOR

	Jason walks into the corridor from LAB TWO, steam still rising from his 
	cold body. He heads away from LAB ONE as soon as he's out of sight, YLLO 
	appears.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Delongpre wakes as Yllo enters.

				YLLO
		All right, lets do this. Thorgan
		begin the Defib program, Delongpre,
		ready the drainage units. Boerman get the
		others in here.

	Boeman grabs a wall mike.

	INT.  STONEY'S CABIN

	Kkinsa straddles Stoney.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		We've got a heartbeat!

	Her back arches in ecstasy.

				KKINSA
		No shit, we've got a heart beat!

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Stoney, you copy? She's awake.
		You coming?

				STONEY
		Hell yeah I'm coming!

				KKINSA
		No . . . not yet!

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Yes, right now!

				STONEY
		YES !!!

				KKINSA
		NO!!! NO!!! NO!!! YES!!!

				STONEY
		YES!!!!!!

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Stoney, put your pants on and get
		your ass down here!

	They jump up grab their clothes and rush to the door. Stoney hits the 
	door release and the door SWISHES open revealing - -

	JASON VOORHEES!

	Standing in the hall. He swings the silver cleaver.

	Stoney sidesteps as Kkinsa SCREAMS. Stoney SLAMS his palm into the door 
	panel. The door SWISHES to close but Jason's hand reaches out and stops 
	it.

	ENGINES WINE as JASON STRUGGLES to force the door open.

	Stoney keeps POUNDING the panel, trying to make the door close but 
	Jason's too strong!

	Jason grabs Stoney by the arm, jerks him into the doorway and releases 
	the door.

	The door closes! Splitting Stoney from forehead to crotch!

	Splashed with blood, Kkinsa falls to the floor cowering . . .
	mumbling nonsensically. 

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo, Janessa, Thorgan, Boemen and Delongpre anxiously huddle around the 
	Frozen Girl's body. Probes dangle in the gel.

				YLLO
		It's time.

				DELONGPRE
		What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?

				YLLO
		I've waited long enough.
		Kay . . . you know what to do.

	Kay presses buttons. We hear the whine of something powering up . . .

	Brodski enters the lab.

				YLLO
		What the hell are you doing?

				BRODSKI
		My job.

				YLLO
		Fine, just stay out of my way.
			(turns to Kay)
		Hit it. 

	An electrical noise flares THE SCREEN TO WHITE:

								SMASH CUT TO:

	INT.  DARK CORRIDOR

	OUR VIEW FROM A JERKY POV

	Running, freshly killed bodies at our feet. HEAVY BREATHING.

	Small fists beat against a door.

				GIRL'S VOICE
		Mom! Dad! It's loose! He's loose!

	The door swishes open revealing the dead bodies of a couple in their 
	forties.

	CLOSE ON THE GIRL

	We recognize her as the frozen girl. Her name, RIZZO (18), pretty.
	She screams. Turns.

	HER POV

	Standing at the end of the corridor, back lit and ominous is JASON 
	VOORHEES! He marches towards her.

	She runs. Snatches a headset from a wall mount.

				RIZZO
		Help me! Anyone! Somebody help me!

	STATIC from the radio. Jason closing.

	She reaches down and grabs a shot gun from a dead Security Guard. Chick-
	chick. KABLAM!

	Jason keeps coming.

	She runs.

	As she rounds a corner, we  see - -

	CRYOGENICS LAB

	She opens the door and enters the cold room. Slips on the wet frozen 
	ground, nearly falls.

	ON JASON as he rounds the corner, sees the open door.

	INT.   CRYO LAB

	Jason enters, his machete held ready. He stares at the Huge Cryo unit. 
	Door open. Otherwise the room is empty.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Hey!

	Jason turns. Rizzo is standing in the hall, the shotgun ready.

				RIZZO
		You son of a bitch!

	KABLAM! Jason slides backwards on the slick floor.

	KABLAM! Further, he nearly falls. 

	KABLAM! He stumbles, falls backwards into the cryo-unit.

	Rizzo slams her palm onto a console, the Cryo-unit door closes, JASON 
	INSIDE.

	RIZZO tosses the gun to the floor and types on a keypad.

	Steam HISSES, engines hum to life. The Cryo-Unit, Bucks violently.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Cryo-Unit activated.

	Slowly the unit goes silent, still. Rizzo stares at it, approaches 
	slowly, staring at the fogging glass -


	KA-CHING!

	The MACHETE BURSTS THROUGH THE GLASS, slicing into Rizzo's shoulder!

	ALARMS SOUND. The cryo lab's main door SLAMS shut.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Cryo-Unit leak. Lock down in progress.
		Security measures on line.

				RIZZO
		Nooooooo!

	She rushes toward the door. It won't budge.

				RIZZO
		Somebody! No!

	CHSHSHSHSHSH!

	Gas filters into the room from the leak in the Cryo-Unit.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Subject in computer unit has reached
		full incubation.

	Rizzo begins to fade. She stumbles.

				RIZZO
		No . . . 

	Cryo gas rolls along the floor . . .

	As blood pours from her wound, she reaches her bloody hand to the glass 
	window and draws -

	A SKULL AND CROSSBONES.

	-then passes out.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	RIZZO'S EYES pop open. She gasps for breath. Coughing and splitting the 
	Gel-like substance. She's sitting in a foot of gel, naked; Yllo, Brodski 
	and the kids around her.

				THORGAN
		That one did it!

	Yllo moves close to Rizzo.

				YLLO
		We should expect a moment of
		disorientation.

	WHAM! Rizzo punches Yllo in the nose.

				DELONGPRE
		Spunky . . .

				YLLO
		She broke my fucking nose!

				KAY-EM 14
		Again proving that your ancestors were savages.

				BRODSKI
		I like her already.

				KAY-EM 14
		Live signs full strength. Heart rate above normal - 

	Rizzo's disoriented, confused. Gel slops all around her.

				RIZZO
		Where..? Who . . .?
			(shock)
		I'm alive. You brought me back.

				YLLO
			(rubbing his nose)
		Obviously so.

	Rizzo looks down at her body, gel dripping off her naked flesh.

				RIZZO
		What the hell is this shit?

	Delongpre gives her a blanket. She covers herself.

				RIZZO
		How did I get here, how did you bring me back?

				YLLO
		Nanotechnology.

				RIZZO
		Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.

				YLLO
		We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.

				RIZZO
		30? How long was I out?

	Rizzo finally takes a good look at where she is. Something is very wrong 
	in her world.

				YLLO
		The year is 2455. You've been frozen
		for the past four hundred years.

	Rizzo gasps -- a shocking revelation.

				YLLO
		Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some 
		questions...

				RIZZO
		JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!

				THORGAN
		The hockey player? He a friend of yours?

				RIZZO
		Hockey player? He's not a ...

				THORGAN
		He's dead! Everyone's dead! Old Earth is dead!

				RIZZO
		Old Earth?

				YLLO
		We need to do some tests...I'd like to ask you a
		few questions.

				RIZZO
		But...I...400 years?

				YLLO
		That's right, now if you could...

	Delongpre frowns at Yllo and moves to Rizzo.

				DELONGPRE
		It can wait. Let's get you cleaned up.

	Delongpre helps Rizzo off the table.

				YLLO
		Wait a minute...I need...

				BRODSKI
		Give it a rest Yllo. She needs some time.

				DELONGPRE
		Come on.

	INT.  LAB FOUR

	Rizzo stands at a small window looking out into space. Cleaned up she is 
	quite beautiful.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo?

	Rizzo is startled. She looks around.

				RIZZO
		Yeah?

	Delongpre comes through the door with a plate of food. 

				DELONGPRE
		I thought that after 400 hundred years,
		you just might have a little bit of an appetite.

	He puts the food on a small table and moves to the window.

				DELONGPRE
		You're on Grendel, a class IV Catamaran 
		transport.
		It's basically a school bus. We're on our way 
		back to Earth II.
		It's finals week.

	She turns back to the window.

				RIZZO
		You're telling me I'm a friggen class project?

	Delongpre flinches, expecting to be hit.

				DELONGPRE
			(a beat)
		Sort of. I mean, no, not really ...

	She collapses onto the bed.

				DELONGPRE
		I'll give you a moment alone. Do you
		want me to come get you when we start
		the dissection?

	Rizzo shrugs. She's lost everyone and everything. She's lot 400 years.

	Delongpre backs out of the room, closing the door behind him.

	Rizzo stares at the pile of her old clothes. She reaches into the pocket 
	of her tattered jacket and removes a set of keys. The key chain holds a 
	picture...a picture of her parents. She sits on the bed and starts to cry.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	As Delongpre enters all eyes turn to him.

				YLLO
		Well?

				DELONGPRE
		She needs a little time.

				YLLO
		More time...shit, she's had 400 years...

	Yllo laughs at his own joke.

				DELONGPRE
		That's really funny.

				YLLO
		I'd want her statements before we reach porch.
		Jesus, women.

				DELONGPRE
		Yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything
		she went through?

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Dissection?

	Theyturn. Rizzo approaches Delongpre and Yllo.

				RIZZO
		Jason? He's on this ship?!

				YLLO
		Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in
		400 years...except for you, of course. Look if 
		you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking
		and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the
		publicity.

				RIZZO
			(glares)
		Are you finished?

	Yllo nods then --

	WHAM!

	Rizzo punches him again.

				YLLO
		God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!

				DELONGPRE
		Oh I like her a lot.

				BRODSKI
		I'm with you kid.

				RIZZO
		Where is he?

				BRODSKI
			(points)
		Lab two, relax. What's the matter?
		He's dead.

				RIZZO
		No, you're dead! You're all dead!

	She shoves Delongpre out of the way and out the door.

	INT.  LAB TWO - MOMENTS LATER

	The others enter to find Rizzo leaning over Adrienne's headless body.

				YLLO
		Jesus!

				JANESSA
		Oh my God! Adrienne?

				THORGAN
		What have you done?

				RIZZO
		What have I done?! Idiots.

	Thorgan throws up.

		BOEMAN
			(into a mike)
		Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an
		emergency!

				DELONGPRE
		Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?

				RIZZO
		I'll tell you where he is. He's walking
		around this ship, killing anything that
		moves.

				JANESSA
		Maybe she tripped.

	Brodski and Kicker burst into Lab Two, they react to the carnage.

				BRODSKI
		Jesus, God!

				KICKER
		Oh man, what the hell happened?

				RIZZO
		Jason! Can't you see? He did this.

				YLLO
		Impossible! He was dead before he entered
		Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could
		be alive.

				RIZZO
		I didn't say he was alive.

	He's dressed in full military garb, a huge gun strapped to his hsoulder.

	STALKING POV

	Something watching Azrael, his back to us. Azrael moves. The stalker

		What the?!

	JASON VOORHEES 

	SLASHES THROUGH another alien, splitting it down the middle.
	Then another.

				DALLAS
		He's good.

	Azrael smiles knowingly. He takes aim and lets loose a blast at Jason. 
	Aliens scatter as the blasts hits Jason dead on. Dallas joins in
	unloading on the hulinking terror.

	THeir assault has no effect on Jason whatsoever.

				DALLAS
		That sucks. Why won't he go down?

				AZRAEL
		Pause play.

	Suddenly the aliens freeze in place. Jason stares at them, then turns to 
	Dallas and Azrael.

				DALLAS
		He's not part of the program.

				AZRAEL
		Hey cool. They brought ancient
		hockey guy back to life.

	Jason walks up to them. Titls his head like a dog hearing a high-pitched 
	whistle.

	Why aren't they running.

				AZRAEL
		Hey! We're playing a game here.
		Get off the court!

	Jason raises his silver blade high.

				DALLAS
		No, we're playing a game...not you numbnuts...

	SLASH! The blade slices through Azrael's shoulder to the bottom of his 
	rib cage. Blood spurts
	as his right side pulls away from his body. Azrael does not seem hurt, 
	only pissed.

				AZRAEL
		Asshole that does not count as a kill.

				DALLAS
		Yes it does.

				AZRAEL
		Oh, come on!

	JASON is confused. He spins and slashed taking Dallas' head clean off. 
	The head falls to the ground, then Dallas speaks.

				DALLAS
		Okay, enough of this shit.

				AZRAEL
		Alright, asshole.

	The sound of an ENGINE SHUTTING DOWN.

	Jason finds himself standing alone on a huge open court, all white, 
	sterile.

	No creatures, no Dallas or Azrael. A both ends of the white garganuan 
	room we see a small tinted glass.

	Azrael's voice booms over a loud speaker.

				AZRAEL(V.O.)
		Clear off the court, asshole.

	INT.  BOOTH ONE

	Azrael sits before a huge console wearing a virtual reality suit.

	INT.  BOOTH TWO

	Dallas is in his own suit from the opposite booth.

				DALLAS
		I don't have all day, kid.

				AZRAEL
		Yeah yeah I better call the labs,
		see what the hell is going on.

	Jason stares at the tinted glass of Azrael's booth.

				AZRAEL
			(into mike)
		Lab...this is AZ in the game grid.
		Your guy got out and runined our game.

	INTERCUT AS NECESSARY:

	INT   LAB TWO

	The reaction to the broadcast.

				YLLO
		Azrael can you repeat that?

				RIZZO
		Get him out of there!

				AZRAEL
			(into mike)
		I said the guy in the mask is in here
		ruining our game.

	Jason starts to close in on Azrael's pod.

				AZRAEL
			(continuing)
		Send someone to the grid to pick
		him up. He looks lost.

				YLLO
		That's impossible.

				RIZZO
		I told you! Get them out of there!
			(grabs mike)
		Get out of there! Get out of there now!

				AZRAEL
			(into mike)
		All right fine, we'll head back--

	Suddenly, JASON shoves his fist through the glass.

				DALLAS
		Jesus!

	The sounds of Azrael's DEATH broadcast over the lab.

	When Jason retrieves his hand, he holds a bloody mass of Azrael's 
	insides.

	IN THE LAB, Brodski takes charge.

				BRODSKI
		Dallas! That you? Come back!

				DALLAS
			(into mike)
		Sarge! Get the fuck down here!
		We got a real shitstorm in the --

	DALLAS fights to get out of his virtual reality suit and get himself 
	into combat mode...BUT...

	JASON hears the movement. Turns, flings his silver blade.

	It flies across the room, throught the glass and impales Dallas' throat 
	to his chair.

	The blade shrots out the electronics in the grid and plunges the room to 
	black.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	As the connection goes to static.

				BRODSKI
			(into mike)
		Dallas?! Dallas?! Do you copy?

	Nothing. Finally...

				RIZZO
		He's dead. They're both dead. You
		don't understand what is on this ship.
		This is a being that kills. That's what
		he does. That's all he does. And he is very
		good at it.

				BRODSKI
		Kicker, Sven. Get into the grid and tell
		me what the hell is going on!

	She gets up and heads for the door.

				DELONGPRE
		Where are you going?

				RIZZO
		We have to get off this ship.

	Yllo who has been losing control takes on the lead again.

				YLLO
		That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.

				RIZZO
		Why don't you get it? He's going to kill
		us all!

				BRODSKI
		I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever
		your ancient hockey player can throw at us.

				RIZZO
		Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship...
		and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the
		only way you're going to live.

				DELONGPRE
		You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future.
		We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of
		the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more
		advanced than what you're used to.

				RIZZO
		I hope so.

	EXT.  GAME GRID CORRIDOR

	Sven and Kicker approach the door. Casually, weapons slung low. The 
	doors hiss open, the black maw of the game grid on the other side.

				KICKER
		Damn. Are they playing?

				SVEN
		Dallas?! Azrael!

	Their combat sense perks up a bit. Something's not right. They turn on 
	their lights and ready their weapons.

	INT.  GAME GRID

	WIDE:  Hard beams of light search for anything.

	Sven, as his beam hits Azrael's pod.

				SVEN
		Oh shit.

	From inside pod as Sven and Kicker approach. THe blood splattered inside
	 the glass glows in the throws of their lights.

	Kicker breaks off to inspect the other POD Sven tries to hold down his 
	lunch.

				SVEN
		Sarge, this is bad. The kid's
		His guts are ripped out.

				BRODSKI
			(over radio)
		Dead?

				SVEN
		Oh yeah.

	Kicker reaches the other POD. the darkness looms behind him as he finds
	his friend.
				KICKER
			(into radio)
		Sarge, this is Kicker. Dallas got
		it to. Real slice and dice. What
		should we do?

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Everyone is in shock except Brodski...he's a pro.

				BRODSKI
		Report to weapons. We're going
		on a hunt.

	KICKER IN THE GRID

				KICKER
		Roger that.
			(to himself)
		Time to kick some ass!

	From behind him a shape materializes. A hand reaches out of the 
	darkness.

	KICKER JUMPS! Spins around with his weapon at the ready!

	IT'S SVEN!

				SVEN
		Sorry!

				KICKER
		Don't friggen do that!

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Brodski is in assault mode.

				BRODSKI
		Yllo, what's your head count?

				YLLO
		Looks like we're missing two.
		Stone and Kkinsa.

				JANESSA
		You know, Stoney's done everyone
		on this trip but me..what's up with that?

	Brodski scans the room - a tactical assessment.

				BRODSKI
		This place should be safe. Get them
		back here. I don't want to be hunting
		around and kill one of your kids by accident.
		As much as I've dreamed of doing that.

	Brodski goes to Rizzo while Yllo buzzes Stoney's cabin.

				BRODSKI
		I need to know what you know about this guy.

				RIZZO
		Don't go out there. You can't win.
		We need to get off this ship. That's
		all there is to it.

				BRODSKI
		Not an option. I'm going to hunt this
		son of a bitch down.

	Rizzo shakes her head. She can't get through to this guy.

				BRODSKI
		I've been a grunt for fifteen years.
		There's not a problem I can't fix with
		enough ammunition.

	Yllo is getting no response.

				YLLO
		Stoney! Stoney if you can hear me,
		get your ass down to the lab immediately!
			(beat)
		I'm going to see if I can find them.

	Yllo opens the door and Kkinsa is there! Half-naked, covered in blood. 
	Janessa SCREAMS and the others gasp.

	Kkinsa falls to the floor..whimpering, in shock. Boeman rushes over
	to her with a blanket.

				KKINSA
		Sstoney's dead!

	They all look to each other, searching for what to say or do...Rizzo 
	puts her head in her hands...not again.

	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Brodski double-checks his sidearm as Yllo follows him down the hall.

				YLLO
		ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab,
		couple of hours no more. Let them take a
		look at our friends.

				BRODSKI
		Not a chance.

				YLLO
		JUst don't go in there half cocked.
		You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and
		ask questions later.

				BRODSKI
		You got that right.

	They arrive at the door of the WEAPONS ROOM.

				YLLO
		This thing could be worth a great deal....
		scientifically...not to mention what the fat cats
		on Earth II would pay for it! Look, I'll split it with
		you 50/50...

	The door opens. The E-X Grunts are all there. Weapons in a rack on one 
	wall. They are in various states of battle dresss. Yllo follows Brodski in. 
	Brodski turns and faces him, his men behind.

				BRODSKI
		You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch!
		If that...that thing is out there, it's
		dead! You got it!!!

				KICKER
		Fuckin A...

				BRODSKI
		Now get out of our way...get back to the
		lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats...
		we've got a job to do!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo enters pissed off. The others are standing around not sure what to 
	do.

				YLLO
		That bastard! Boemen turn on the
		tracking monitors.

	Rizzo walks over to Kay-em 14. Thorgon is working on her.

				RIZZO
		Robot huh?

				KAY-EM 14
		Kay-em 14.

				RIZZO
		Barbie from hell...

				KAY-EM 14
		Cybernetics science droid,
		fluent in over six...

				RIZZO
		Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS,
		now how about you help me get
		out of this coffin, Barbie...

				KAY-EM 14
		I'm afraid I cannot assist.

	Rizzo is very frustrated.

				RIZZO
		I'm surrounded by idiots.

				KAY-EM 14
		You need to get laid!

	Thorgon looks up from his work.

				THORGON
		Sorry, I'm working on it.

				DELONGPRE
		Are all twenty-first century girls like you?

				RIZZO
		He'll kill us all. You know that, don't you?

	AN ALARM SOUNDS.

				THORGON
			(re:monitor)
		There's been an unauthorized entrance to the
		Cargo Bay.

				BRODSKI
		Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to
		Lab two and cover out backs.

				YLLO
			(into the mic)
		At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?

				BRODSKI (v.o.)
		I'll try.

								CUT TO:
	INT. CARGO DOOR - MIDSHIP

	kicker, sven, CONDOR, BRIGGS, and GEKO are locked and loaded. Dressed in 
	full armor,
	packing massive high tech weaponry, they are a sight to see. Jason may 
	have met his
	match.

				BRODSKI
		Alright, the teach requests we take this guy
		out at the knees. I say shoot to kill.

	The boys fidget with excitment. Bout time they see some action.

				BRODSKI
		So after you've killed him, put one in his knee
		so we can say we tried.

	The men LAUGH and high five.

				BRODSKI
		Go to infrared, stay in radio contact.
			(into headset)
		Teach you there?

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo walks in and sits at a bank of monitors. Through one, we see the 
	team standing at the cargo doors.

				YLLO
		Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		You just keep an eye out.

				YLLO
		Yeah yeah. Got it.

	Yllo removes his head set and quickly turns to a separate console. He 
	has his own agenda.

	INT.  CARGO DOOR - MIDSHIP

				BRODSKI
		Let's move out.

	The doors HISS open.

	INT. CARGO BAY

	A massive room. Boxes stacked hihg, some to the ceilin,g creating a 
	maze.

				BRODSKI
		Two teams, Port, starboard.

	They split up.

	INT. LAB ONE

	The kids are standing at a schematic of the ship. Several small blips 
	are entering the cargo area.

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Kicker, anything?

				KICKER(V.O.)
		Negative.

	Rizzo stands over Thorgan to see the monitor.

				THORGAN
		Each blip represents a trained killer.
		It's men like that fought off the pirates
		on Earth II, battled Jauntuns on the solar 
		moons...

	For the moment, Rizzo looks distantly hopeful.

				RIZZO
		So, you're saying thse guys have like,
		lasers and stuff? They could hack him
		to pieces?

				THORGAN
		Exactly.

	INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

	Briggs and Geko move side by side. Condor brings up the rear. Suddenly 
	he is jerked out
	of view. 

	CLOSE ON CONDOR'S FACE, jason's hand around his throat. SNAP. The eyes 
	go dead, the neck broken.

	INT. LAB ONE

	Rizzo sees something. Her hopes fade.

				RIZZO
		WHAT'S IT MEAN WHEN ONE OF YOUR BLIPS 
	DISAPPEARS?

	All eyes turn to the schematic as one of the blips FLICKERS and FADES.

				KAY-EM 14
		E-x Grunt Condor has flatlined.

				BOEMAN
			(into mic)
		Sergeant, this is Boemen...

	INT.  CARGO BAY - STARBOARD

	Sergeant Brodski stops.

				BOEMAN(v.o.)
		You've lost Condor.

				BRODSKI
		Briggs, Geko, talk to me!

	INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

	Briggs and Geko stare at each other.

				BRIGGS
		He was...he was right here!

	BACK TO BRODSKI

				BRODSKI
		DAMNIT to hell! We're coming to you!

	INT.  LAB ONE 

	A BLIP flashes for a second on the screen.

				THORGAN
		You see that?

				BOEMAN
		Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed
		fuselage.

	INT. CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

				BRIGGS
		Got it.

	BRIGGS and GEKO split up, moving around a large metallic tank.

	BRIGGS INFARED POV

	Gun ready, he moves around the crated fuselage slowly.

				BRIGGS
		I don't see anything.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	The blip flashes again.

	INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		He's right there! In front of you!

	INFARRED POV reveal GEKO moving toward him.

				BRIGGS
		That's GEKO. mAYBE you kids should
		stay out of this.

	Briggs removes his gogles only to find Jason standing before him, 
	holding Geko's body...impaled
	onto his silver blade.

	BRIGGS fires...screams.

	INT.  LAB ONE

				BRIGGS(V.O.)
		He doesn't show up on...

	PAINFUL GURGLES then two more blips disappear.

				THORGAN
			(turns)
		Jesus, is this what it was like on your...

	Rizzo is cowering on the floor, her hands over her ears. She's sweating, 
	convulsing.

				BOEMAN
		Sergeant, you've lost two more men!

	INT. CARGO BAy - PORTSIDE

	Brodski and his remaining men double-time-it to the slaughter. Briggs 
	and Geko lie dEAD
	AT THEIR FEET.

				KICKER
		Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?

				BRODSKI
		Teach! Where the hell are you?!
		Where's our visuals?!!

	INT. LAB TWO

	Yllo is talking on  aseparate mike. Unwaakre of the slaughteri n the 
	next room.

				YLLO
		Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the
		Solaras Space Lab.

				FAT LOU(V.O.)
		I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.

				YLLO
		We've got a situation here! Just do
		as  you're told!

				FAT LOU(V.O.)
		Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon
		as we've passed Tara's rings we'll
		make the course correction.

	BACK TO YLLO.

				YLLO
		Thank you.

	Yllo disconnects, and turns to the other console.

				YLLO
			(into mic)
		Ok Sarge, what's your status?

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three

	INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE

	GUNFIRE ERUPTS!

				SVEN(V.O.)

	INT. LAB ONE

	CHEERS from everyone except Rizzo who knows better. She shakes her head.

				THORGAN
		Yes!

				RIZZO
		Listen up duck fuckers, you can't
		kill this thing.

				BOEMAN
		Duck fuckers?

				RIZZO
		He's either unconcious or playing dead,
		whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay,
		you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.

				DELONGPRE
		Outta here?

				RIZZO
		Isn't there an escape POD on this ship?
		Something?

				THORGON
		There's a shuttle.

				RIZZO
		Alright, been nice knowing you.
		Who's with me?

				KKINSA
		I'll go.

				BOEMEN
		Yllo said stay here.

				KKINSA
		Fuck Yllo!

				BOEMEN
		They got him! You're not leaving!

	INT. CARGO BAY - MIDSHIP

	Sven is kneeling over Jason's body. 

				SVEN
		Big sucker too.

	Suddenly, Jason reaches up, grabs the back of Sven's head and SLAMS it 
	into his mask.
	Sven's forehead shatters.

	ON BRODSKI

	As he races around a crate. Sven's body is within sight. His killer 
	nowhere to be seen.

				BRODSKI
		Kicker? Where are you?

	Elsewhere we hear GUNFIRE followed closely by a SCREAM!

	ELSEWHERE

	Kicker crawls across the floor, blood spews from his mouth.

	PULL BACK TO RVEAL

	He's been split in half at the wait...his entrails dragging behind him..
	SHUNK! A machete throught the back of the neck puts him out of his 
	misery.

	INT. LAB ONE

				RIZZO
		Do something!!!

				THORGON
		Don't look at me! I'm in high school!

	INT. CARGO BAY

	Brodski runs. He's spooked. Twisting and turning in every direction.

				BRODSKI
		Find Crutch! Set up an ion field
		around the cargo bay. We'll torch
		the sucker! Yllo...you're a dead man!

	Brodski races toward the Cargo exit.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	ON MONITOR

	We see Brodski racing towards us. We also see Jason, lying in wait, 
	hidden by one 
	of the crates.

				YLLO
		Sergeant!

				BRODSKI
			(stops)
		What?

	Yllo considers then.
				YLLO
		Nothing.

	On the monitor we see Brodski move forward. He never saw Jason coming.
	BRODSKI SCREAMS.  Yllo turns his head.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	The kids stand in shock, silently staring at one another, listening to 
	the
	static of the dead communications. Boeman reaches over and clicks off 
	the radio.
	Silence.  Rizzo leaps to her feet.

				RIZZO
		Lesson number one, kiddies. You wanna
		get home safely then we get off this boat.

	Kkinsa starts t cry.

				KKINSA
		I don't understand...what does he want?

				RIZZO
		He wants to kill you...and me...and everyone
		on this ship.

	Rizzo looks at everyone.

				RIZZO
		Any questions?

	A side door HISSES OPEN. Yllo enters.

				YLLO
		You're not going anywhere.

				RIZZO
		You wanna die?

				YLLO
			(ignores her)
		Are we locked down?

				BOEMAN
		That door's the only way in or out and it
		won't open without the code.

				YLLO
		Then we wait. We're docking with Space Lab
		in less than an hour.

				RIZZO
		What good will that do?

				YLLO
		They can deal with this sort of thing.

				RIZZO
		More soldiers?

				YLLO
		Scientists. Very intellegent men.

				RIZZO
		That's great. I bet they'll kick Jason's
		ass at a spelling bee!

				JANESSA
		Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out
		and let us handle this?

				YLLO
		Try to calm down. Just think, you're going
		to be famous!

				RIZZO
			(to kids)
		Guys, please come with me!

				YLLO
		4You're not going anywhere.

	Rizzo starts for the door but Yllo grabs her arms, holds them behind 
	her.

				DELONGPRE
		Now hold on! We should hear her out!

				THORGAN
		She's obviously dealt with this guy before.

				YLLO
		Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!

				DELONGPRE
		No shit. I got no problem with that.

	Janessa readies a hypo.

				THORGAN
		Maybe if we knew a little bit more about
		what we're delaing with here...

	Janessa moves behind Rizzo with the sedative.  Suddenly Rizzo throws her 
	head back, Salmming it into Yllo's nose. He CRIES OUT in pain.

	Janessa lunges with the syringe but Rizzo snatches her wrist, grabbing 
	the hypo, burying it into Janessa's left breast.

				RIZZO
		tNighty-night.

	Janessa collapses.  Yllo rushes Rizzo again, but this time Boeman 
	stands, blocks his path.

				CRUTCH
		Leave her be.

				RIZZO
		Ok, who do I gotta fuck to get off this boat?

	Thorgan timidly raises his hand.

				RIZZO
		Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship.
		Come with me.

				THORGAN
		Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space?
		We'll die oout there.

	Rizzo rushes the door. There's a code box on the wall.

				RIZZO
		How do you open the damn door?

				YLLO
		You're crazy!

	Kkinsa punches in the code. The door HISSES open.

				DELONGPRE
		Rizzo, he's out there.

				RIZZO
		Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.
			(looks at Delongpre)
		Last chance.

	The others stare at her. She's crazy.

				RIZZO
		Fine. Bye.

	She and Kkinsa exit, the door SWISHES CLOSED behind them.

				YLLO
			(favoring his nose)
		Pack your shit. We'll disembark in an hour.
		The guys at Space Lab have the necessary
		equipment to contain this thing and then we
		can study it.

	But the kids aren't so sure.

	INT.  LAB TWO

	Yllo enters, makes sure he wasn't followed then approaches a console.

				YLLO
		Computer on line.

	A series of beeps.

				JANESSA(O.S.)
		What are you doing?

				YLLO
			(jumps)
		Jesus! Can't you knock?
			(back to console)
		Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf.

	as Bernie's DIALOG becomes jibberish.

				BERNIE
		En-en-en-en...Eta-Eta...

	Fat Lou stares up in shock just before JASON SLAMS Bernie's torso ontop 
	of her.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	FAT LOU'S upper body has disappeared. In other words, Bernie now has 
	legs.
	Little good they'll do him.

	THROUGH WINDSHIELD.

	Far in the distance we see a tiny space station -- SPACE LAB.
	A monitor reads ...

	SPACE LAB ETA 00:35:59 and counting.

								CUT TO:

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Rizzon and Kkinsa enter.

				RIZZO
		Which way?

	Kkinsa points. They head in that direction. Then Rizzo suddenly stops.

				KKINSA
		What?

				RIZZO
		Ssh.

	Rizzo pulls Kkinsa close to one of the crates.

				RIZZO
		He's in here.

	Kkinsa opens her mouth to scream. Rizzo slaps her hand over Kkinsa's 
	mouth.

				RIZZO
		You scream I'll snap your neck.
		Got it?

	Kkinsa nods. Rizzo releases her.

				KKINSA
			(whispers)
		How do you know?

				RIZZO
			(dread)
		I just know.

	INT.  LAB ONE 

	The crew has packed their essentials and now wait to dock with Space 
	Lab. Yll is standing
	before the others holding Jason's machete.

				YLLO
		We must assume the machete was an
		intricate part of the game of hockey.

				DELONGPRE
		I'm thinking Rizzo was right.

				YLLO
		Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?

				DELONGPRE
		Maybe we should go with them. Like you said,
		your Space Lab connections can deal with this 
	thing.
		At least we'll be safe.

				YLLO
		They are not going anywhere. I cut power to
		the  shuttle.

	The kids and Crutch stare at him. Cold hearted.

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Rizzo and Kkinsa approach. 

				RIZZO
		Open the doors.

	Kkinsa punches in a series of buttons. Nothing.

				KKINSA
		Something's wrong.

				RIZZO
		Keep trying!

	INT.  LAB ONE

				YLLO
		Everyone ready?

	Yllo grabs a mike from a console.

				YLLO
		Fat Lou, what's the ETA?

	STATIC.

				YLLO
		Lou, goddamjnit! Bernie, where's Lou?!

	STATIC.

	Boeman moves to one of the consoles, clicks a few buttons.

	ON MONITOR

	We see the view from the bridge security camera. Lots of blood and the 
	mangled combination of Lou and Bernie.

				THORGAN
		Yuck.

				DELONGPRE
		We're screwed.

				YLLO
		The ship doesn't need pilots to dock.
		We'll disembark and you'll see.
		Everything will be fine.

				BOEMAN
		Uh...that's gonna be a problem.
		The ship's not on auto-pilot.
		We're flying blind.
			(a beat)
		Thirty minutes till impact.

	All eyes turn to Yllo, for guidance, his back to the outer door.

				YLLO
		I guess...we'll have to go to the bridge.

				THORGAN
		But...

	Jason is out there. Then --

	WHAM-WHAM-WHAM!

	The outer door bucks and dents! Everyone jumps!

	WHAM-WHAM-WHAM!

								QUICK-CUT TO:

	INT. SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Over the headsets, Rizzo and Kkinsa hear the SCREAMS.

				RIZZO
		Damnit, he's got them.

	Kkinsa keeps trying the code box. Nothing.

				KKINSA
		Rizzo, I think Yllo must have done
		something. The door won't open.

	INT.  LAB ONE

				YLLO
		It's alright. He can't get in here!

	WHAM! WHAM!!! But the door is starting to give.

	Through the confusion, Crutch moves to one of the consoles. Clicks
	away at the keyboard.

	INT.   SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	The shuttle hums to life.

				KKINSA
		The power's back up!

				RIZZO
		Then open the doors!

				KKINSA
		Thirty seconds.

	INT.   LAB ONE

	WHAM! WHAM! WHAM!

				JANESSA
		What do we do?!!

				YLLO
		Crutch?

				CRUTCH
		Help me up.

	Boeman helps Crutch to the top of a table. Crutch goes to work on a  
	ceiling
	vent, removing screws.

				JANESSA
		Okay, I'm guessing you should hurry.

	The top corner of the door bends...Jason peers through.

				THORGAN
		Jesus, tell this asshole I don't
		play hockey!

				CRUTCH
		Okay!

	Our group starts climbing the table and into the ceiling space.

				YLLO
		Will that take us to the bridge?

				CRUTCH
		It's a maze up there, but yes.

				YLLO
		We'll engage auto-pilot!
		Everything'll be fine!

	With that, the door gives!

	Boeman heaves Crutch into the crawl space then follows himself.  Jason 
	pauses,
	staring at Kay-Em --

				KAY-EM 14
		Heart beat irregular...no blood flow...
		impossible...this....this... does not
		make sense.

	Jason's heard enough. He swings his cleaver, but Kay-Em ducks. Turns and 
	leaps
	through the hole in the celing.

	INT.  CEILING WALK SPACE

	Yllo grips the ledge.

				YLLO
		Move it people!

	Then Yllo screams. Jason has him from below. Boeman grabs his arms.

				BOEMAN
		Help me!

	DeLongpre grabs hold and pulls. Suddenly Yllo is jerked out of their
	grasp. They fall onto their backs breathing heavily.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Yllo leaps to his feet. Jason looms over him.

				YLLO
		Now hold on! Have you considered
		how valuable you are? Credit, fame,
		you can have it all. And ladies. I 
		mean, how long has it been?

	Jason stands there, but his attention isn't on Yllo. It's on the machete 
	sticking through
	Yllo's belt. Jason reaches for it. Yllo backs into a wall.

	Jason slowly removes the machete from Yllo's belt and stares at it. He 
	drops
	the cleaver to the ground.

				YLLO
			(chuckles)
		That's all you wanted?

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	The shuttle doors slide open as we hear over the headset --

				YLLO(V.O.)
		It's okay, he just wanted his machete.

				RIZZO
			(knowingly)
		Three...two...one...

	Yllo screams.

	INT.  CEILING WALK SPACE

	Yllo's SCREAMS turn to GURGLES. All eyes stare at the opening in the 
	walkway, then --

	YLLO'S HEAD LANDS IN BOEMAN'S LAP!

				KAY-EM 14
		Now that's just gross.

	JASON STICKS HIS HEAD THROUGH.  EVERYONE JUMPS, SCREAMS.

				DELONGPRE
		GO, GO, GO!

	They race down the walkway, over huge pipes and through electrical 
	wires, Crutch 
	in the lead.

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Kkinsa enters the shuttle, turns to Rizzo.

				KKINSA
		Rizzo, come on!

	But, Rizzo hesitates. We can still hear the PANICKED SCREAMS over the 
	headset.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Go-go-go-go-go!!!!

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		He's right behind us!

				RIZZO
		Damn!
			(to Kkinsa)
		Close the door! I'll be right back.

				KKINSA
			(panicked)
		What?!!

				RIZZO
		I gotta go back.

				KKINSA
		But?!!

	Rizzo turns and races through the maze of boxes and crates leaving 
	Kkinsa nearly
	insane.

	INT.  CELING WALK SPACE

				KAY-EM 14
		I'm quite sure I wasn't designed for this.

	Crutch comes to a fork in the walkway.

				CRUTCH
		Okay, we need to ...

				BOEMAN
		You forgot didn't you, you old
		fart?

	At the back of the line, Delongpre turns as Jason rounds the bend behind 
	him.

				DELONGPRE
		Shit! Move it! He's coming!

	Delongpre leaps forward creating a pile out of Janessa and Thorgan

				DELONGPRE
		Go!

	Racing forward the group stays just out of Jason's grasp. Leaping
	over and under and through whatever blocks the path.

				DELONGPRE
		Faster!

	Jason swings his machete at DeLongpre! It just misses him.

				DELONGPRE
		FASTER!!!

	Crutch comes to ascreened panel. Boeman kicks it open.
	They leap down onto a catwalk crossing the --

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	They are twenty feet off the ground as --

	Rizzo stops, stares straight up.

	HER POV

	the group races across the catwalk as Json leaps down behind them.

				DELONGPRE
		He's right on my ass!

	Then Jason grabs Delongpre, who screams.

	RIZZO,

	spots a gun left by one of the marines. She snatches it, points it 
	towards
	Jason and Delongpre then aims a little high.

	FZZZT!

	It slices through a metal cord holding the catwalk to the ceiling.

	The catwalk jerks. Everyone tumbles. Jason loses his grip on Delongpre.

	Suddenly, METAL SCREECHES, as the catwalk gives under the weight. It 
	RIPS in half,dumping both
	heroes and Jason.

	RIZZO dives out of the way as a pile of metal and bodies crash to the 
	ground!

	Janessa sits up rubbing her head.

				JANESSA
		That was fun.

	Kay-Em 14 sits up, sings.

				KAY-EM 14
		I got a brand new pair of
		roller-skates, you got a brand new key...

				JANESSA
		Thorgan?!

				THORGAN
		I didn't do it. The fall scattered her
		programming..wait. Where's? Shit!

	He's lying on top of Jason. He scrambles to his feet. But Jason doesn't 
	move.

				THORGAN
		Hey, I think the fall killed him.

	The group slowly gathers around. Jason sits up and swings at Thorgan. 
	Boeman pulls him out of
	the way just in time.

	Jason starts to stand when RIZZO comes up behind him.

	KA-FWAM! She brings the barrel of a high tech gun down on the top of 
	Jason's head.
	He collapses. The surrounded faces look happily suprised.

				RIZZO
		Trust me, it's temporary.

	Boeman takes the gun from Rizzo.

				BOEMAN
		Better let me.

				THORGAN
		Where'd you get the gun?

	Rizzo gestures at what's left of Geko's body.

				CRUTCH
		The bridge is this way!

	They take off running.

				RIZZO
		Wait!

	Everyone stops, turns --

				KAY-EM 14
		There's not enough time.

	Rizzo catches up.

				RIZZO
		Forget the bridge, the shuttle's
		waiting!

				BOEMAN
			(to Kay-Em)
		What do you mean, not enough time?

				KAY-EM 14
			(switches voice)
		You know what you get if you shove
		two bananas up your ass? Two shit covered
		bananas.

				JANESSA
		I think your metal lover's losing it.

				KAY-EM 14
			(normal voice)
		Impact in ten minutes. It will take 
		fifteen to reach the bridge.
			(switches voices, sings)
		Mamma's little baby love shortnin,
		shortnin, mamma's little baby love 
		shotnin bread...

				DELONGPRE
		Well, I'm not hanging out here with Ms. Showtunes.

				RIZZO
		Guys!!! The shuttle?

	The kids look at one another as if this were a stroke of genius.

				RIZZO
		Idiots.

				CRUTCH
		This way!

	Crutch again leads them through the maze. Delongpre stops at
	another Grunt body, removes a chain gun. THorgan takes a high
	tech laser from another.

				THORGAN
		I feel better. Now how do you
		fire this damn thing?

				DELONGPRE
		Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!

				CRUTCH
			(jokingly)
		Just around this bend...

	Jason steps out in front of Crutch, his machete held poised in front of 
	him.
	Crutch runs right up onto the blade.

				BOEMAN
		Nooooo!

	Alrhoguh he's meat on a stick, Crutch doesn't give up. He SLAMS his 
	fists into
	Jason's torso.

	Thorgan turns to fire --Boeman KNOCKS the barrel high.

				BOEMAN
		You'll hit crutch!

	Boeman tosses his weapon to Janessa and leaps on Jason's back, locking 
	his arms 
	around his neck.

				RIZZO
		What are you doing? You can't save him!

	Delongpre smashes the back of Jason's knee with the chaingun.
	Jason topples on top of Boeman. Crutch is thrown free.

	Janessa and Thorgan help Crutch to his feet as Jason sees Rizzo for the
	first time in 400 hundred years.

	It's either love at first sight or one hell of a grudge. He leaps to his
	feet and races towards her.

				RIZZO
		Don't just stand there! Shoot him!

				DELONGPRE
			(to Jason)
		No you don't!

	BRAAAAAAATTTT!

	The chaingun dances Jason backwards. He CRASHES through the side of one 
	of the 
	cargo boxes. EVERYONE STOPS.

				RIZZO
		Don't stop!

	She jerks the gun from Delongpre and races to the crate.

				RIZZO
		You never stop when he's down!

	But the crate is empty.

				RIZZO
		Shit!!!!

	They spin around, searching.

				CRUTCH
			(weak)
		Forget him. Come on.

	Carrying Crutch, they move toward the shuttle bay.

	INT. SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	panel, clicks some buttons, then --

				BOEMAN
		Uh-oh.

				JANESSA
		What?!

				BOEMAN
		Kkinsa! Open the doors!

	INT. SHUTTLE COCKPIT


	Kkinsa sits in the pilot's seat. She's terrified.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Kkinsa! He's coming! Open the doors!

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	DeLongpre shoves Boeman out of the way.

				DELONGPRE
		Kkinsa, open the goddamn door!

				RIZZO
		Yeah, that's it, scare the hell
		out of here, that'll work.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

				RIZZO(V.O.)
			(calming)
		Kkinsa, it's me, Rizzo. He's not
		out here right now, so please let us in.

	Kkinsa doesn't move.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Kkinsa, Crutch is hurt! We need access to
		the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

				DELONGPRE
		Med-kit?

				RIZZO
		I guessed.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

	Kkinsa considers. She reaches for a button marked SHUTTLE 
	DOORS...hesitates.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		We're going to be okay, Kkinsa.
		Just relax.

	INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY

	Kay-Em 14 steps forward.

				KAY-EM 14
		Allow me. I'm trained in all aspects
		of the human psyche.

	Rizzo backs away -- as Kay-Em nears the mike ...

				KAY-EM 14
		Kkinsa, dear, it is I, KAY-EM 14...
		open the fucking door you silly bitch!

	Rizzo shoves Kay-Em out of the way.

				KAY-EM 14
		I didn't say I was good at it.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Oh shit! There he is!

	INT.  CARGO BAY SHUTTLE

	Jason is standing at the entrance to the Cargo Shuttle Bay.

	INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT

	Kkinsa leans forward and presses --

	LAUNCH.

	INT.   CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	The Shuttle ROARS to life and begins pulling away from the ship.

				BOEMAN
		Kkinsa! No!!!

	EXT.   GRENDEL CLASS IV

	The shuttle moves slowly away from the docking position.

	INT.   CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	Rizzo opens fire! Thorgan and Delongpre join in.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As boxes and cargo shatter under the heaby fire. Smoke rises. It's 
	impossible
	to see where Jason is. RIZZO stops FIRING.

				RIZZO
		DON'T WASTE YOUR AMMO!

	But, they don't let up. Boxes explode, crates collapse until -- 
	Thorgan's gun clicks empty.
	Then Delongpre's.

	SILENCE.

	The smoke slowly clears revealing the rubble.

				THORGAN
		Did we get him?

	Suddenly, Jason again steps into the Cargo entrance.

				DELONGPRE
		We're screwed!

				RIZZO
		400 years in the future and these
		pea-shooters are the best you can do?!

	They are trapped. Jason blocks the only exit. He slowly moves towards 
	them.

				RIZZO
		Just make a break for the door.
		He'll get some of us, but that's the
		breaks.

				BOEMAN
		We're not leaving Crutch!

				RIZZO
		We don't have time to argue!

	But Jason has locked in on Rizzo. He moves towards her.

				JANESSA
		Okay, tell you what. You die, we'll run.

	Rizzo and the others back into a corner. Jason has them. There's nothing 
	they
	can do.

	Rizzo holds the gun steady, waiting for point blank range. 

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

	THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

	SPACE LAB, which was only a dot the last time we saw it, suddenly looms 
	toward us.

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Collision eminent.

	EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

	The left side of Grendel SMASHES into the side of Space Lab!

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	Suddenly everything shifts toward the bridge. Boxes, cargo, kids, and 
	Jason!

	EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

	Grendel SLIDES along SPACE LAB, ripping huge chunks of metal from both.
	SPARK fly. There are interior EXPLOSIONS on Space Lab, then --

	KA-FOOM!

	Space Lab EXPLODES!

	INT.  CARGO SHUTTLE BAY

	The entire ship shifts upwards. Cargo, crew, and Jason fly into the air.

	ELECTRICAL fires sprout up all over. Cargo boxes SHATTER, contents 
	SPILLING.

	RIZZO loses her gun.

	EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV

	Debris from Space Lab TEARS into the side of the ship and beyond.

	EXT.  SHUTTLE

	One huge chunk heads right towards the Shuttle.

	INT.  SHUTTLE

	Kkinsa stares out the window as the huge chunk flies toward her.

	EXT.  SHUTTLE 

	IMPACT! THE SHUTTLE IMPLODES! ONE BRIGHT RED FIREBALL.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Everything piled and in tatters. Our heroes slowly regain their 
	bearings.

				BOEMAN
		Everyone okay?

				THORGAN
		I think I broke my arm.

				KAY-EM 14
		I seem to have misplaced mine.

	Kay-Em 14's right arm is missing, wires sticking out of the stump.

				JANESSA
		You geeks wanna gimmie a hand?

	Janessa is buried beneath a pile of rubble. Boeman helps her to her 
	feet.

				DELONGPRE
			(quiet)
		We lost crutch.

	Rizzo stands and watches as the other sgather around Crutch's body.
	It's battered and twisted all out of place. Boeman falls next to the 
	body.

				BOEMAN
		Goodbye old friend.

				RIZZO
		Okay, he was a great guy, now
		let's move out.

				BOEMAN
			(snaps)
		Could you show a little compassion?!

	Rizzo stares at Boeman.

				RIZZO
		Look, I'm sorry. I really am, but aren't you
		forgetting about ...

	SUDDENLY a pile of rubble EXPLODES.

	Jason rises, his back to them.

				DELONGPRE
		Back to the labs!

	But Jason has other plans. Seemingly unfazed by the past events he 
	rushes after them.

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Dam-damage port side 59 percent.
		Decompression 40 percent. Gravity-y rotors
		failing.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Our kids race toward the door, Jason right behind them --

	Thorgan slams the door panel with his good arm. SPARKS fly.
	The door won't open.

				THORGAN
		Oh shit.

	They turn as Jason looms toward them, then --

	EVERYTHING STARTS TO FLOAT

	Cargo and debris. Our heroes. Jason.

	The loss of gravity and Jason's steamrollering momentum SLAMS him into 
	the 
	cargo doors, BREAKING them open and sending him tumbling backwards.

				JANESSA
		This is just great.

				KAY-EM 14
		Engage magnetics.

	Kay-Em 14's left hand magnetically locks to the Cargo frame a

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jason grabs Rizzo's ankle. Boeman, floating close, punches Jason in the 
	back of the head.

	Still holding Rizzo's ankle, Jason topples, spinning the two out of 
	frame.

	The force of the punch sends Boeman in the opposite direction.

				THORGAN
		This is crazy, we can't do anything like this!

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Rizzo KICKS Jason in the top of the head, sending him SLAMMING into the 
	ceiling.

	A SEVERED ARM

	floats past DeLongpre. There's a chain gun still clutched by the  hand.
	Delongpre grabs both and turns the gun on Jason.

	BRAAATTTT...

	Jason is sent further back, but the force of the chaingun SLAMS 
	Delongpre into a back wall.
	He's knocked unconcious.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As Thorgan manages to grab Kay-Em 14 around the neck.

				THORGAN
		Grab my hand!

	Janessa takes his hand and in turn reaches out and snags the unconcious 
	dELONGPRE'S FOOT.

				JANESSA
		Boeman, can you reach DeLongpre?
		We'll push you in.

	CARGO - MIDSHIP

	Jason is floating toward the other end of the Cargo Bay,
	unable to stop himself.

	BOEMAN

	reaches for DeLongpre. Inches away. Finally he grabs Delongpre by the 
	locks of his
	hair, pulls himself closer.

				DELONGPRE
		Hey! That hurts.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Rizzo is floatin g up near the ceiling. She manages to grab hold of a 
	hanging piece of
	busted catwalk.

				DELONGPRE
			(to Rizzo)
		Push off toward us.

				JANESSA
		Forget her, she's a pain in the ass.
		Let her hang there.

	Crutch's body floats into our heroes, his intestines spilling from his 
	open gut,
	tangling around our heroes.

				THORGAN
		I'm gonna spew.

				JANESSA
		That ought'a help the situation.

				DELONGPRE
		Do it Rizzo! We'll catch you.

	RIZZO'S POV

	Rizzo stares at the human rope that consists of Thorgan, Janessa, 
	Boeman, and Delongpre.

				RIZZO
		What if you miss?

				DELONGPRE
		What if we don't?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	AS JASON steadies himself against a wall, focuses in one Rizzo, then 
	pushes off with his feet.

	HE ROCKETS toward her!

				DELONGPRE
		He's coming right at you!

	Rizzo spots Jason and pushes off! But her aim was HURRIED...
	and bad. She's gonna miss them.

	Boeman flips in the air!

				BOEMAN
			(to Delongpre)
		Grab my feet!

	Delongpre does and Boeman reaches out and snags Rizzo. The momentum 
	spins the human
	chain into a near wall --KAFWAM-- nearly breaking it apart.

				JANESSA
		Okay that hurt.

				BOEMAN
		Thorgan, pull us in.

	Jason SLAMS into the ceiling, then careens off of the wall --

	As Thorgan pulls the group out of the Cargo bay.

				THORGAN
		What now?

	They watch as Jason grabs a hold of the walkway.

				JANESSA
		Shit. He's gonna send himself right at us.

	Jason takes aim.

								QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE

				COMPUTER VOICE
		System repair activated. Back up power on line.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Jason again ROCKETS THROUGH THE AIR -- when

	GRAVITY IS RESTORED.

	He drops to the cargo floor like a rock! Falling cargo -- huge crates, 
	gargantuan machines,
	a forklift -- buries him.

	Our heroes tumble to the ground.

				JANESSA
			(to Rizzo)
		Get off of me!

	They stand slowly, eyeing the rubble.

				THORGAN
			(rubbing his arm)
		You think it killed . . .
			(off Rizzo's stare)
		Yeah, I guess not.

				JANESSA
		Let's just get out of here.

				BOEMAN
		The ship's in bad shape. Back to
		the labs. Let's check out status.

	INT. SHIP CORRIDORS

	Our group makes their way back toward the labs.

	ELECTRICAL fires are everywhere. Systems are shorting out all over the 
	ship.

	INT. LAB ONE

	Rizzo, in the lead, enters the lab, when the ship BUCKS and QUAKES! A 
	portion of the hall
	collapses behind her.

	INT. CORRIDOR

	Boeman and the others dive back out of the way.

				BOEMAN
		Shit!

				THORGAN
		The hull's imploding!

				BOEMAN
		Rizzo! Can you hear me?!

	INT.  LAB ONE

				RIZZO
		Yeah. Are you guys okay?

	Boeman peers through a crack in the collapsed hull.

				BOEMAN
		There's a red lever on the wall
		beside you. Pull it!

	Rizzo turns, spots the red lever. EMERGENCY PRESSURIZATION STABILIZER.
	It's bolted.

				RIZZO
		It's locked!

				BOEMAN
		Then break it! If you don't pull it, the ship's
		going to depressurize!

	Rizzo kicsk the metal leg from a table. BASHES the bolt with it, until 
	it breaks.

				BOEMAN
		Hurry Rizzo! You have to reverse
		the pressurization.

	She grabs the lever...then hesitates. Backs away.

				BOEMAN
		What are you doing?!!

				RIZZO
		If the ship goes, so does Jaso.

				BOEMAN
		Rizzo pull the fucking lever!

				RIZZO
		No.

				DELONGPRE
		Rizzo?!

				RIZZO
		It's better this way. If we were rescued
		Jason would just get off the ship. You want
		him on your precious Earth II?

	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Boeman and the other start tearing the debris out of the way!

				THORGAN
		Hurry! She's lost it!

				JANESSA
		So what else is new?

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Boeman climbs through a hole in the rubble. He grabs the lever.

				RIZZO
		Boeman don't. You know I'm right.

				JANESSA
		Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!

	Boeman yanks the lever.

	As the others climb into the lab --

				COMPUTER VOICE
		Depressurization inconclusive.

				KAY-EM 14
		We've lost too much pressure. An hour, tops.

				JANESSA
			(to Rizzo)
		You happy? You've killed us all!

	Thorgan rushes over to the big Nano-tech machine. Places his broken arm 
	on the slab.
	The machine quickly goes to work.

	A schematic of his arm appears on the wall.

	Janessa stares at him.

				JANESSA
		What's the point?

	Delongpre shrugs.

				DELONGPRE
		So that's it then.

	It seems it is.

	Janessa stands over Yllo's decapitated body. It's obvious their 
	relationship
	went beyond just teacher/student. There is a loud METALLIC WHINE from 
	the ship's
	hull.

				RIZZO
		What's that?

				BOEMAN
		THat's the sound of deep space attacking the
		integrity of the ship.

				KAY-EM 14
		No...
			(signing)
		That's the sound of the men working
		on the chain gang.

				RIZZO
		Are there any other shuttles?

				JANESSA
		No.

				RIZZO
		Teleportation? Some way to beam us the
		hell out of dodge?

				THORGAN
		You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?

				JANESSA
		A little late to be thinking about
		escape, isn't it?

				KAY-EM 14
		I'll never experience my fantasy of
		three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod.
		Damn.

				THORGAN
		Am I in there?

				KAY-EM 14
		Sory...

				RIZZO
		Hey.

				DELONGPRE
		That's a good fantasy, though.
		Kinky, but good.

				RIZZO
		Hey!!

	All heads turn to Rizzo. She's staring at a schematic of the ship. The 
	left hull
	of the two hulled ship is lit up with blinking light denoting the 
	various 
	system failures. Rizzo points to the right hull.

				RIZZO
		What's this?

				DELONGPRE
		It's the engine, reactors, audiometers,
		it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.

	Rizzo points at the thin walk-ways connecting the two hulls.

				RIZZO
		Can we get through these?

				THORGAN
		Sure but what good will that do?

				BOEMAN
		When the left hull goes, so will the
		right.

				RIZZO
		What if we blow the walkways first?
		Leave Jason over here to go up with
		the ship?

	They stare at her.

				JANESSA
		You know, Yllo seemed to think we could
		catch this guy alive, well, he'd be worth
		millions.

	The others stare at her as if she were crazy.

				RIZZO
		Any connection between your reality and mine
		is purely coincidental.

				JANESSA
		I'm just saying.

				RIZZO
			(to others)
		Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit.
		Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up
		the doors and blow the walkways?

				DELONGPRE
		We'd need charges.

				BOEMAN
		We could convert fission transistors.

				THORGAN
		We're not supposed to do that.

				BOEMAN
		What are you gonna do, tell me?

		DELONGPRE
		The engine room will have molecular welders.
		We could seal up the hull.

	A moment of consideration. Could this actually work?

				JANESSA
		YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big
		guy distracted with a blow job.

				THORGAN
		Would you?

				KAY-EM 14
		Now this is getting exciting.

				DELONGPRE
		Remember to roll his balls around a bit.

				RIZZO
		You got a better plan?

	Obviously they don't. They got to work. Boeman grabs a number of devices 
	from under
	a cabinet.

				BOEMAN
		I'll need system four converters.

				THORGAN
		They're back here.

				DELONGPRE
		How many?

				BOEMAN
		Bring 'em all. Let's move!

	Thorgan's still hooked up to the Nano-Tech machine.

				THORGAN
		Hey! I'm not ready.

				BOEMAN
		Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley
		one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there.
		Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.

				JANESSA
		You're so bossy.

				THORGAN
		You're leaving me here alone?

	Delongpre tosses the chaingun next to him.

				DELONGPRE
		Don't blow your foot off.

	They climb through the hole in the corridor and disappear.

				KAY-EM 14
		It's just you and me, then.

				THORGAN
		Come here, might as well fix that arm.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Boeman, Janessa, Delongpre, and Rizzo slowly move through the piles of 
	debris.
	Still burning cargo creates a ghastly image of flickering shadows.

				DELONGPRE
		See anything?

	They move toward the rubble that had buried Jason before.

	CLOSE on the rubble.

	There is an obvious hole dug out from the middle.

				DELONGPRE
		I think I speak on behalf of the group
		when I say this is bad news.

				BOEMAN
			(into headset)
		Thorgan? You coming?!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Thorgan is fooling around in the back of Kay-Em 14's head. The nano-tech 
	maching is 
	doing a full diagnostics.

				THORGAN
			(into headset)
		Almost done.

				KAY-EM 14
		Ow!

				THORGAN
		Oh, hush. I disengaged your pain programming.

				KAY-EM 14
		Sometimes I just wish I had a kitten.

	INT. WALKWAY ONE

	Boeman enters, throws his pack to the ground and goes to work ttaching a 
	device to
	the wall of the huge glass connector.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Janessa enters and goes through the same motions.

	INT. WALKWAY THREE

	Delongpre and Rizzo attach a device to the wall.

				DELONGPRE
		Put your finger here.

	SHe does so. Delongpre connects several wires. Rizzo looks nervous. 
	Delongpre notices.

				DELONGPRE
		My father wanted me to be a businessman.

	Silence.

				DELONGPRE
		That's why I'm here.

				RIZZO
		So, you thought you'd be cool. Go against
		your father's wishes? Yeah, that's grown up.

	Delongpre looks at her like she's crazy.

				DELONGPRE
		My father's company imports and exports. Archaeology 
		is part of the business. We happen to get along just 
	fine,
		smartass. Look, why don't you bust somebody else's 
	balls
		for a change.

				RIZZO
		I thought you meant...

				DELONGPRE
		You thought I meant...too tough to apologize, huh?
		You must have been a very lonely girl.

	Silence. Neither speaks.

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Thorgan rips a metallic sink from the wall. It CRASHES to the floor.

				THORGAN
		Sorry, sorry.

				KAY-EM 14(O.S.)
		Who are you apologizing to?

				THORGAN
		Good point.

	INT.  WALKWAY ONE

	Boeman attaches another charge. He's sweating. Nervous. Keeps looking
	over his shoulder. Standing alone on this long walkway is a creepy 
	sight.

	INT.  WALKWAY TWO

	Janessa stops working, listens.

	KA-THUMP -- There's anoise in the Cargo Bay.

	She covers the mike on her headset and calls out.

				JANESSA
		Thorgan, you little shit, is that you?

	No answer. She quickly turns to her pack and pulls out the bottle of 
	tranquillizer
	and a monster syring.e She fills this rhino syringe with a massive 
	dosage. Enough to
	bring down a Rhino...or Jason maybe?

	She starts moving down the walkway toward the Cargo Bay.
	Surely she's not that stupid.

	INT.  WALKWAY THREE

	Rizzo is staring at Delongpre as he works on another device.
	Then --

				RIZZO
		When I was four, the ocean quit producing
		life. Too many pollutants. Nuclear testing,
		the occasional terrorist bombing...the
		atmosphere was shit by the time I was eight.
		We moved underground when I was twelve.

	Delongpre stares at her. He doesn't want to speak and screw up this
	rare moment of sharing.

	INT.   CARGO BAY

	Janessa enters. Looks around.

	The cargo bay is dark and looming. Lights flicker. Emergency lights
	strobe. It's hard to make anything out.

	We hear Rizzo speaking Off Screen.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		My father was an army Scientist.
		Genetics. The army thought they could
		develop humans able to survive the Earth
		we had created

	Janessa moves through the debris.

	ANOTHER POV

	We see Janessa come into view.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Jason seemed to have the right stuff.
		Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell
		damage, didn't matter. He just kept
		going.

	INT.  WALKWAY THREE

				DELONGPRE
		Were you close to your father?

	Thorgan interrupts over the headset.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Delongpre? What did you do with the
		chain gun?

	Delongpre frowns.

				DELONGPRE
			(into mike)
		It's on the table where I left it!
		What the hell are you doing?!
		Hurry up!

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		I'm on my way.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Thorgan, quit screwing around and
		come on!

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		I'm coming, I'm coming.

				DELONGPRE
		Sorry, you were saying?

	INT. CARGO BAY

	WATCHER'S POV

	JANESSA approaches the pile of debris where Jason was buried.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		I got along great with my father,
		my mother too. Dad and the others thought
		they could learn a great deal from this 
		thing the army had been keeping on ice for
		over a hundred years.

	Janessa moves the debris around with her foot.

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		They were all wrong. They couldn't control
		him.

	INT. WALKWAY THREE

				DELONGPRE
		And what happend to ...?

	Rizzo begins to tear up.

				RIZZO
		I couldn't save them.

				DELONGPRE
		Well, we'd be dead without you.
		You know that, don't you?

	She stares at him.

				DELONGPRE
		It's true.
			(chuckles)
		You caused enough stink that we
		were at least a little cautious.
		Of course this is the first field
		trip I went on that had a body count.

	She gives him a  half smile.

				DELONGPRE
		I'm not much, but I promise, I won't
		let this guy get you.

	Another half smile. It's a sweet gesture, but what can this guy really 
	do?

	INT. CARGO BAY

	JASON'S POV

	He watches Janessa from a  distance. Moving slowly and silently toward 
	her.

	She stands and turns as --

	SERGEANT BRODSKI grabs her!

	She SCREAMS.

	He's covered in blood from a gaping wound in his gut.

				BRODSKI
		Where is everybody? What happened?

				JANESSA
		Damnit! You scared the hell out of me!

				BRODSKI
		Give me a break! What happened?

				JANESSA
		Jason. He's what happened. Then 
		Grendel hit Space Lab.

				BRODSKI
		Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands
		on Yllo.

				JANESSA
		Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too.

				BRODSKI
		Takes more than a steelbalde to take
		this old dog down.

	KA-THUNK! 

	JASON"S MACHETE THRUSTS though Brodski's gut. Jason spins Brodski around 
	and tosses him to the floor!

				BRODSKI
		Yup, that ought'a do it.

	Jason turns on Janessa.

	She stands frozen in fear.

	Jason raises his machete and --

	JANESSA

	Lights a flare, blinding Jason for the moment. Then she sinks the Rhino 
	syringe 
	into his chest! Jason stumbles...falls hard on his ass and sits there 
	staring
	at her.

				JANESSA
		Well go on! Pass out!

	Jason tears the syringe away and tosses it aside.

				JANESSA
		Shit.

	Jason starts to climb to his feet. Janessa turns to run.

				BRODSKI
			(weak)
		He-help me...

	He holds his hand out to her. Then--

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		I'm blowing Walkway One. Hold on.

	KA-FOOM! The SHIP BUCKS!

	Janessa runs, leaving the sergeant behind.

	INT.  CARGO BAY - OUTSIDE WALKWAY THREE

	Delongpre closes the door, then --

				DELONGPRE
		We're blowing three. Hang on.

	He throws a switch!

	INT. CARGO BAY - BRIDGE SIDE

	Boeman vaults over a pile of rubble.

				BOEMAN
		Janessa, we're on our way to you!

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Holding hands, Delongpre and Rizzo enter. They stop...stand...stare.

	The walkway is empty. Janessa is gone.

	Boeman rushes up behind them.

				BOEMAN
		Where is...?

				DELONGPRE
		You tell me! She's only set one
		charge. And it's not finished!

	With that Janessa tears into the walkway. She's out of breath. She can 
	barely speak.

				BOEMAN
		Where have you been?!!

				JANESSA
		He....He...

				DELONGPRE
		He's coming!!!

	THEIR POV

	JASON moves through the debris. He's coming straight for them.

				BOEMAN
		Run!!

	They race down the length of the walkway. Jason right behind them.

				RIZZO
		We can't lead him into the other hull!

				BOEMAN
		We don't have a choice!

	Boeman slams the door panel. The door slowly rises.

	Jason approaches, stops, stares at his future victims. If he could smile
	with anticipation...he would. He raises his Machete --

	Then stops. Lowers it.

	CHA-CHUNG. CHA-CHUNG. CHA-CHUNG.

	He turns his back on our heroes. They crane their necks to see what has 
	pulled
	his attention.

	THORGAN marches down the walkway with KAY-EM 14. The new and imporved 
	KAY-EM 14.

	Where her severed arm had once been, a chain gun is now attached. A 
	laser cannon is
	mounted over her shoulder. Her body has been reinforced with steel from 
	around the lab.
	Sinks, trays, you name it. She's the junk yard man's terminator. Then --

				KAY-EM 14
		Do I have to?

				THORGAN
		Yes, I've reprogrammed you.
		You are very brave. Bad ass.

				KAY-EM 14
		Oh, alright.

	KAY-EM 14 INTERNAL SCAN POV

	We see a somewhat computerized image of Jason through Kay-Em's personal 
	scan.
	One the display we see:

	SUBJECT: DEAD
	CHANCES OF FUNCTION: 100 PERCENT
	DOES NOT COMPUTE . . . DESTROY SUBJECT

				KAY-EM 14
		Come on, boy. Let's see if we can
		open up  can'a whoop ass!

	BRAAAATTTT! The chain gun rings! Jason is SLAMMED into the HULL DOORS.

				DELONGPRE
		Holy shit!

	JASON jumps up and rushes at Kay-Em who catches him and tosses him down 
	the walkway --

	BRAAAATTT! Kay-Em opens up again. Kay-Em's weaponry shoves Jason out 
	into the cargo
	bay witha  blur of bullets.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				BOEMAN
		What are we waiting for?!!
		Come on!!

	Our heroes rush down the walkway toward the cargo bay. Boeman and 
	Delongpre go to
	work setting the charges.

				BOEMAN
			(to Janessa)
		Where the hell were you?!!

				JANESSA
		He came for me, I had to run!

				THORGAN
			(into mike)
		Kay-Em, you okay?

	INT. CARGO BAY

				KAY-EM 14
		Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.

	And with that, Kay-Em BLOWS the now standing Jason into another wall 
	with the laser 
	cannon.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

				BOEMAN
		Toss me a chip.

	Delongpre pulls a trinket from his pack and pitches it to Boeman.

				BOEMAN
		Thorgan, you're brilliant.
		Have I told you that lately?

	Thorgan is standing at the end of the walkway staring into the cargo 
	bay.
	He looks sad.

				THORGAN
			(quietly)
		See you around.

	INT.  CARGO BAY

	Kay-Em 14 marches toward the downed Jason, and starts singing an old Sea 
	Shanty.

				KAY-EM 14
		She's the Yellow Rose of Taegu,
		the girl that I adore. Her cunt
		it smells like cock juice; she's
		a good two-dollar whore. You may
		talk to me of Seoul girls or whores
		from Tokyo, but the yellow rose of 
		Taegu beats them all, I'd you know.

	BRATTTT!!!

	Kay-Em blows Jason into --

	INT. HALL BETWEEN LABS AND CARGO

	She kicks him down the long corridor.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO 

	The hull SCREAMS from the exterior pressure. The ship RUMBLES.

				BOEMAN
		I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.

				DELONGPRE
		Then stop talking and work faster!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Jason BURSTS through the debris that had been blocking the Lab!
	Kay-Em enters behind him.

				KAY-EM 14
			(still singing)
		She was a young and charming girl;
		her age was scarce sixteen.

	JASON rushes KAY-EM 14!

				KAY-EM 14
		She took me in and she kicked out
		a sailor and marine.

	KA-CHING!!!!

	His machete bounces off of Kay-Em's new armor.

				KAY-EM 14
		She had no titties on her chest;
		that didn't bother me,

	WHAM!

	Kay-Em 14 back hands Jason across the room. He crashes into the glass
	speciments. Goo and formaldehyde covering him.

				KAY-EM 14
		For what she had between her legs
		was big enough for three.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Boeman and Delongpre are finishing up.

				BOEMAN
		Okay, Janessa, give me your last charge.

	Janessa looks around, then --

				JANESSA
		I...I don't know what I did...

				DELONGPRE
		You lost the charge?

				JANESSA
		He was chasing me!

				RIZZO
		Can we blow it with just two?

				BOEMAN
		If we don't sever the hull completely
		she'll drag us down with her.

				DELONGPRE
		Then what do we do?!

				BOEMAN
		I don't know!

	INT.  LAB ONE

	Kay-Em stands over Jason. And for the first time in ten films Jason is 
	in bad shape.
	But still climbs to his feet...slowly.

				KAY-EM 14
		Why you low life, scum sucking,
		rat dick blowing, sum bitch.
		Your mamma must'a had some huge balls.

	Of course, as anyone knows, you don't diss Jason's mother.

	Jason leaps, tacking Kay-Em 14! They roll into another glass case. 
	Glass, formaldehyde and specimens
	rain down on top of them.

	Having lost his machete, Jason BASHES at Kay-Em with his fists. OVER and 
	OVER. He
	catches a rhythm. Kay-Em is trapped below.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

				DELONGPRE
		Well, it was a good plan.

	They look at one another -- hopless. Then --

				BRODSKI(O.S.)
		You stupid bitch!

	Everyone jumps as Sergeant Brodski leans against the walkway door frame.
	He's bound his wounds with a make-shift tourniquet wrapped around his 
	mid-section.

				BRODSKI
		Damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!

				BOEMAN
		Sergeant? We thought you were...

				BRODSKI
		Yeah, yeah.
			(to Janessa)
		Well, what have you got to say for yourself?

				JANESSA
		I don't know...sorry?

				RIZZO
		Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.

				BRODSKI
		Bomb?

				BOEMAN
		Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.

	The sergeant tosses his pack to the ground.

				BRODSKI
		How much you need?

	INT. LAB ONE

	WHAM...WHAM...WHAM... A RAIN of firststaking on this droid from the 
	future.

	Finally, Jason stops. Straddling KAy-Em 14 he stares at his kill...until 
	--

				KAY-EM 14
			(condescending)
		That was very good. You should
		feel very good about yourself
		right now. Good effort.
			(tough voice)
		How could you hit a girl you sumbitch?!

	Kay-Em 14 places the chaingun over Jason's chest.

	BRAAAATTTT!!!!

	Jason is blown across the room!

				KAY-EM 14
		Okay, dip shit. Time to finish
		you off so I can go home and boink
		your momma with a corndog. The kinky
		bitch.

	Chaingun and laser cannon UNLEASH A MASSIVE DISPLAY on the fleshly body 
	of
	JASON VOORHEES.

	The top portion of Jason's mask shatters!

	hIS RIGHT LEG IS TURNED INTO A PILE OF MEAT, then blown clean off for 
	good measure!
	Jason falls on his ass!

	He raises his machete arm. A last ditch effort. Could he be that lucky?
	To throw a machete and stop this onslaught?

	CHA-CHING!

	NOPE.

				KAY-EM 14
			(singing)
		Bang, bang Maxewells silver hammer
		came down upon his head. Doo-pee-
		do-do. Bang, bang Maxewell's silver
		hammer made sure that he was dead...

	Jason climbs to his one good leg but i t only serves as a better aim
	for Kay-Em 14.

	KA-FOOM! The laser cannon blows Jason's left arm to hell.

	KA-FOOM! KA-FOOM!

	Two more blasts send Jason flying through the back wall and sliding 
	across the floor.

	KAY-EM 14'S INTERNAL SCAN POV

	This time, Jason's body doesn't move.

	SUBJECT: DEAD
	CHANCE OF FUNCTION: ZERO PERCENT
	MISSION OF OBJECTIVES: COMPLERED

				KAY-EM 14
		Oh...my...god. What have I done?
			(crying)
		Thorgan!

	Kay-Em turns and races down the hall.

				KAY-EM 14
		Thorgan I'm a murderer!

	INT.  WALKWAY TWO

	Boeman and Delongpre hustle to set the final charge.

				BRODSKI
		Blowing the walkway? You come up
		with that yourself?

				BOEMAN
		Rizzo did.

	CHA-CHUNG...CHA-CHUNG. Kay-Em steps into the walkway. She's covered in
	blood.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em!

				BOEMAN
		What are you doing back?!!

				KAY-EM 14
			(sad)
		Sumbitch won't be giving us
		anymore trouble.

				RIZZO
		You killed him?

				KAY-EM 14
			(regret)
		Blew half his skull away, one leg,
		one arm and left his entrails
		stretched across the lab. And look
		at me! I'm covered in his filthy blood!

				THORGAN
		You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.

				KAY-EM 14
		A real mamma's boy that one.
		Dissed his mamma and he nearly
		threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.

				RIZZO
		His mother?

				BOEMAN
		What?

				RIZZO
		I don't know. Nothing.

	Suddenly the ship's hull SCREAMS. The ship BUCKS. Everyone tumbles.

				BOEMAN
		Hurry up people! We're running out
		of time.

	INT.  LAB ONE 

	Jason's body is propped up against a machine in the same position we saw 
	it before. This
	mass of torn flesh doesn't move.

	The ship BUCKS again.

	The machine HUMS to life. BUZZING and BEEPING. Suddenly a laser scans 
	Jason's
	body.

	PULL BACK TO REVEAL

	Jason is leaned up against the Nano-Tech machine.

	INT. WALKWAY TWO

	Thorgan runs wire to each device.

				THORGAN
		As long as they're connected we can 
		blow them all simultaneously from
		a safe distance.

				BOEMAN
		Two more charges to go.

	INT. LABE ONE - NANO-TECH MACHINE

	We see a schematic of Jason's battered body on the monitor. Nano-
	technology
	is already at work.

	Hoses and wires now encircle Jason's body. We follow one of the hoses 
	until it ends
	over --

	A WASTE BEND

	nside we see pile of bullets. Stuff falls from the hose. Bullets from 
	the chaingun,
	bullets from  every previous Jason movie. A broken machete blade drops 
	to the pile.
	The tip of an arrow. A couple of knives. A pair of pliers. An ink pen. 
	The skeleton
	of a fish.

	The scanning lasers move to the stump at Jason's shoulder. We see the 
	image as a new arm, fuzzy
	adn distorted, is being constructed.

	On the schematic, we see Jason's internal organs being repaired.

	By now  we've figured out ...nothing good can come of this.

	INT.  WALKWAY TWO

	Kay-Em 14 hits a button. The door begins to slide down slowly.

				THORGAN
		Done!

				BOEMAN
		Let's move out!

				BRODSKI
		Kid, you ever thought about the marine corp?

	Delongpre calls fromthe far end of the walkway, welder in his hand.

				DELONGPRE
		I need another minute. Come on!

	ON OUR HEROES

	Suddenly there is a GRINDING SOUND. Engines WHINE from behind them.

	The group stops and turns.

	The cargo door is starting to smoke. It SQUEALS as it slowly opens.

				BRODSKI
		Well fuck me.

				KAY-EM 14
		No, fuck me.

	The door opens and Jason steps into the walkway.

	But he's no Jason we've ever seen before. His leg and arm are now
	SHINY METAL. His clothes are BLACK, no longer tattered. His mask is 
	CHROME.
	We can't see them, but we know...his insides are in better shape than 
	ever.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em? Re-engage killer instinct.

				KAY-EM 14
		Yeeee-haw!!!!

	BRAAAATTTTT!

	Kay-em firs. But, this time it doesn't seem to faze Jason. SPARKS fly as
	bullets vounce off of his metal limbs.

	Jason swings his new improved machete. It CLANGS off of Kay-Em's armor, 
	removing a hunk of metal.

	Jason grabs her and swings her into the glass walkway. Glass CRACKS.
	One of the wires, connecting two charges severs.

				BOEMAN
		Shit!

	Kay-em does a back flip, kicking Jason in the chest. He's shoved 
	backwards.

	Boeman attempts to splice the wires back together as the battle ensues.

	IT'S MASSIVE! Intellectual synthetic droid verses psychotic metallic 
	killer.
	SPARKS FLY. GUNFIRE SOUNDS. Then Kay-Em does a round house kick, but 
	Jason uses 
	his machete as a shield. Kay-Em's leg is nearly sliced off at the knee.

	She stumbles...falls to the ground.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em!!!

	Boeman splices the wires together.

				BOEMAN
		Done!!

	Then turns to see Jason approaching.

				BOEMAN
		RUN!!

	But Jason's too close. He grabs Boeman.

	ON KAY-EM

	As her body separates from her legs mid-thigh. CHCHHHHH!
	THRUSTERS IGNITE from her lower thighs.

	As Jason raises his machete to do Boeman in --

	KA-FWAM! Kay-Em slams into him! Knocking Boeman free.

	Jason and the now hovering Kay-Em go at it again.

	CHANG! CLANG! CLUNK! Metal against metal. Kay-Em hovers up the walls, 
	over Jason's 
	head...but Jason has come into his own with these new body parts. She's 
	no match. Finally --

	JASON EMBEDS HIS MACHETE IN KAY-EM'S THROAT

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jason rears back and shoves his fist though Kay-Em's chestplate! his 
	fist from Kay-Em's
	chest and wraps his metallic hand around he throat.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em! Get away!

	Thorgan moves toward his robotic love but Boeman grabs him and pulls him 
	down
	the hall.

				KAY-EM 14
		That's the best you can do?

	Jason yanks his machete from the side of Kay-Em's neck. Severing her 
	head
	from her body. It flies down the hallway behind the kids.

				KAY-EM 14
		Is that it? Come back and fight like a man!

	JASON 

	Turns his glare on our heroes racing toward Delongpre at the other end.

	DELONGPRE

				DELONGPRE
		Done!

	Delongpre lifts his welder's mask to call to the others when he sees 
	JASON.

				DELONGPRE
		Shit, hurry!

	OUR HEROES

	Run toward the door. But, Thorgan stops.

				BOEMAN
		What...?

	Thorgan turns, runs back toward Jason.

				BOEMAN
		What are you doing?!!

	Thorgan is running to retrieve Kay-Em 14's head. It lies between he and 
	Jason.
	He'll never make it!  Thorgan hits the floor, slides and scoops up the 
	head.

				KAY-EM 14
		I think I'm going to throw up...

	BUT IT'S TOO LATE.

	Jason raises his machete from his belt and --

				RIZZO(O.S.)
		Hey, dickhead!

	JASON TURNS AS --

	KA-CHUNG!!!! Rizzo nails him with a metal ar.

				RIZZO
			(to Thorgan)
		Go!

	Jason stumbles backwards then whirls on Rizzo.

				RIZZO
		Oh, yeah, you remember me.

	He sure does.

	She turnsa dn runs.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As the others race into the engien room they turn to watch.

				BOEMAN
		Hurry!

				DELONGPRE
		Faster! Don't we have another gun?

	Rizzo catches up to Thorgan but they have a long way to go
	and Jason is gaining.

				JANESSA
		They're not gonna make it. Close the door
		before he gets us all.

				DELONGPRE
		They'll make it.

				JANESSA
		Close the fucking door!

				DELONGPRE
		NO!

	JANESSA leaps forward and hits the switch. The door begins sliding 
	slowly shut.

				DELONGPRE
		Damnit!

	Boeman hits the button again.

				DELONGPRE
			(glares at Janessa)
		Forget it. I had to rewire it.
		Once it's started it won't stop.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	JASON

	TWENTY PACES BEHIND

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM

				DELONGPRE
		Get ready to blow it.

	Rizzo dives, slides under the closing door.

	Thorgan follows her lead, but his slide doesn't have the same force. He 
	stops with the door
	coming down on his lower back.

	Luckily, Delongpre snatches his arms and yanks him through.

	The door closes!

				DELONGPRE
		Now!

	Boeman turns the switch.

	INT.  MIDSHIP WALK WAY

	The charges BLOW! A FIREBALL rushes toward the running JASON!

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM

	CLOSE ON DOOR

	AS KA-FWAM!!!

	JASON'S BODY IMPRINTS IN THE NOW SEALED DOOR.

	EXT. GRENDEL

	The walkway explodes, severing Grendel into two separate hulls. 
	The left damaged hull, sinks out of view as the engine side begins
	to pull away. Then --

	KA-FOOM!!

	Grendel's LEFT HULL finallay EXPLODES!! They barely amde it.

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM

	The right hull BUCKS from the force of the blast. Our heroes are 
	aireborne for a moment 
	then crash to the floor.

				BRODSKI
		Damage?

	Boeman climbs to a console.

				BOEMAN
		Minimal.

				RIZZO
		We made it?

				DELONGPRE
		I think...I think maybe we did.

	CHEERS

	Thorgan looks into Kay-Em 14's severed head.

				THORGAN
		Kay-Em we made it!

				KAY-EM 14
		Oh, goody. I'm so pleased.
		I'd clap if I could.

	Boeman CLICKS on a console keyboard.

				BOEMAN
		I've changed the course for Earth II.
		And I sent a distress signal.

				VOICE(V.O.)
		Roger, Grendel. What's the problem?

				BOEMAN
			(into mike)
		Our ship has been damaged, most of
		the crew dead. We need evac.

				VOICE
		Copy that Grendel. Rescue enroute.
		You should hit EARTH II orbit in fifteen
		minutes. Rescue ETA twenty minutes.

	CHEERS!

				BOEMAN
		We're going home people.

	More CHEERS.

	Rizzo turns to find Delonpre staring at her.

				DELONGPRE
			(big smile)
		See? We're not so bad.

				RIZZO
		Not so bad.

	There's that moment when we think the two might kiss. She takes a step
	toward him. Yes, they are going to kiss --

	BOOM!

	WARNING LIGHTS. WARNING ALARMS. The sound of SUCKING WIND. AS JASON,
	still very alive shoves his fist through the imprinted door with his
	metal hand!

	As he rips a bigger hole to gain entrance our heroes are fighting to 
	hold
	on to anything.

	The Hole is sucking everything not tied down out into space.

	Boeman is the first to reach the reactor room door.

				BOEMAN
		This way!

	He pulls Sergeant Brodski through the door as -- 

	JASON

	Fights his way through the opening in the hull.

	The engines BUCK and begin to SMOKE.

				BOEMAN
		The pressures cause the engines to overheat!
		Hurry!

	Delongpre helps Rizzo and Thorgan to safety.

	Janessa crawls across the floor digging her fingers into the steel mesh.

	SERGEANT BRODKSI

	Lying in the door's threshold reaches out and snags her hand.

				JANESSA
		Pull me in!

				BRODSKI
		I'm pulling, damnit!

	But Jason grabs Janessa's ankle and jerks. She's pulled from the 
	Sergeant's
	grasp.

	She flops around in the sucking wind as Jason watches. He lets go.

	She flies toward the hole, slams into it.

	Everything goes quiet for a moment. As he body has sealed the hole then 
	--

	SHHHHHHHHOOOOOK!

	She's sucked into space in a most grotesque manner.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				BRODSKI
		Well, that's a shame.

	INT. REACTOR CORE

	Hug cylindrical machines run the length of this enormous room.
	They HUM quietly as our group enters.

				BRODSKI
		We need weapons.

				RIZZO
		Weapons? All this technology and
		what good has it done?!

				DELONGPRE
		It bought us some time.

				BOEMAN
		And now we're all out of it.

	Everyone stares at Boeman. He's standing at another console.

				BOEMAN
		The ship's depressurizing, the engines
		overheating. When it  reaches the core,
		we're done.

				RIZZO
		Done?

				THORGAN
		Kaboom.

				DELONGPRE
		Again?! Jesus!

				RIZZO
		Why am I not surprised?

	Thorgan still clutches Kay-Em 14's severed head.

				KAY-EM 14
		You must shut down the engines.

				DELONGPRE
		Then do it. The rescue ship can
		find us here right?

				BRODSKI
		Can't shut em' down from here.

				BOEMAN
		Somebody's gonna have to go back
		to the engine room.

				DELONGPRE
		You ain't catching my ass in there again.

	Brodski, still bleeding, pale, struggling to stand --

				BRODSKI
		I'll go.

	The kids give him the "are you crazy?" stare.

				BOEMAN
		You're too weak. I'll go.

	KA-FWAM! Everyone jumps but this time it's only Rizzo. She broke a metal 
	stand and has
	yanked one of the legs free.

				RIZZO
		You know, this future shit sucks.
		I'll fucking do it.

				DELONGPRE
		You?

				RIZZO
			(mumbling)
		Wait around on your asses all day.
			(turns to Thorgan)
		I'll need a distraction.

				THORGAN
		What kind of a distraction?

	INT. ENGINE ROOM

	JASON is pounding on the reactor room door. A difficult act with the 
	continued pressure 
	trying to suck him into space.

	THEN
				RIZZO
		HEY!

	Jason turns to find Rizzo standing in the doorway behind him. 

				RIZZO
		You want some of me?

	Jason whirls around and lurches toward her clinging to machinery as he 
	goes.


	INT.  ENGINE ROOM CORRIDOR

	Rizzo backs slowly as Jason closes in.

	As he reaches the corridor, she turns and runs.

	RIZZO

				RIZZO
		Come on, keep up.

	Jason barrels toward her.

				RIZZO
		You want some of me or not?

	She stops at a door, but doesn't attmept ot open it.

	Jason comes closer..and closeer...but Rizzo doesn't move --

	Jason moves in for the kill, raises his machete, and --

				RIZZO
		Take your best shot --

	SLASH!

	RIZZO'S CHEST IS SPLIT OPEN!

				RIZZO
			(laughs)
		I'm melting! I'm melting!

	SLASH! Her arm falls to the ground!

				RIZZO
		See now that was stupid.
		Persistent, yes, but stupid.

	Jason shoves his fist, through her chest and into the wall.

				RIZZO
		Not this time, asshole. This time
		I'm gonna watch you burn in hell.

	INT.  ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 

	The real RIZZO rips off her virtual reality helmet.

				RIZZO
		Make it fast. He's coming.

	Delongpre is punching numbers into the keypad. Both are wearing 
	headsets.

				DELONGPRE
		Almost got it.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As Jason returns to the engine room, none too pleased at being tricked.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Hurry up, guys. We've got the rescue
		ship on radar.

				RIZZO
		Delongpre! Out of time!

				DELONPRE
		Got it!

	Rizzo jersk Delonpre and both spill into the reactor
	corridor. Rizzo slaps the panel. the door closes!
	Shutting out Jason's image.

				DELONGPRE
		Damn that was close!

	WHAM!

	THE ENGINE ROOM door RIPS in half. JASON CLIMBS through.

	RIZZO AND DELONGPRE RUN!

				RIZZO
			(into radio)
		Guys, he's right behind us!

		THORGAN(V.O.)
		It's okay.

		DELONGPRE
		Okay?!!

		THORGAN(V.O.)
		Just come on, I've got an idea.

	They race down the long corridor toward the reactor room.
	JASON IN PURSUIT.

	INT. DOCKING BAY

	Thorgan is typing like mad at small portable keyboard.
	Boeman stares out the docking bay window.

	HIS POV 

	There's damage, lots of it.

				BOEMAN
			(into radio)
		The docking bay was damaged after the
		explosion. Meet us at the airlock.

	INT. REACTOR ROOM corridor.

				DELONGPRE
		Got it.
			(to Rizzo)
		You ever space walked?

				RIZZO
		Oh sure, all the time.

	They leap through a door, closing it behind them, then keep running.

	BEHIND THEM

	KA-FWAM! Jason barrels right through the door.

				RIZZO
			(into headset)
		Damit, Thorgan, whatever you're doing...
		you'd better hurry!
			(growls)
		I hate the future!

	INT.  REACTOR CORE

	Rizzo and Delongpre enter in a  mad rush. Delongpre closes the door.
	Little good it'll do.

	INT. REACTOR ROOM CORRIDOR

	JASON kicks the door with his metallic leg!

	KA-FWAM! The door shatters and he stumlbes into --

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Forest, cabins, the lake. Everything as we and Jason remember.
	But somehow distroted. A strange hue covers everything.

	No, on second look, it's not exactly the way we remember. The trees are
	strange looking. Not the Pines and Oaks of Connecticut, but something 
	foreign.
	The cabins look a little too advanced to be stuck in the middle of a 
	camp.
	But the image will do.
					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	Thorgan stands at a keyboard clicking away. Boeman is wearing a space 
	suit.
	He's helping sergeatn Brodski into his.

	At the other end of the huge room, Jason wanders ... with confusion.

				THORGAN
		Don't worry. He can't see us.

	Rizzo glances out the docking bay window.

				RIZZO
		Is that...?

	THROUGH WINDSHIELD

	We see a planet much the same color as Earth, but the continents are 
	wrong.

				DELONGPRE
		Earth II.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Suit up.

	Delongpre leads Rizzo to a suit.

				DELONGPRE
		I'll help you in.

				THORGAN
			(into headset)
		Kay-Em, you've saved our lives,
		you know that don't you?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Kay-Em 14's head sits on the floor in the center of room.

				KAY-EM 14
		It was my pleasure, my love.
		Perhaps if all works for the best
		you can rebuild me and we can try that
		doggie style thing again.

	DOCKING BAY

	The others stare at Thorgan...he looks embarrassed to say the least.

				DELONGPRE
		I knew you were a little sick, but Geez.

	ON KAY-EM

				KAY-EM 14
			(singing happily)
		I get no kick from champaign, mere
		alcohol doesn't faze me at all,
		but I get a kick out of you.

				THORGAN
			(under his breath)
		Goodbye, my love.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Thorgan, suit up.

				THORGAN
			(to Rizzo)
		This is gonna work. If he sticks to the
		program. Will he? Stick to the program?

				RIZZO
		His mother was killed before his eyes.
		That's what drove him insane. It'll work.

				DELONGPRE
		That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of
		that future shit.

				RIZZO
		Eat me.

	She smiles as she jersk the helmet out of his hand.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Jason slowly walks beside Kay-Em 14.

					QUICK-CUT TO:

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Jason is walking along the lake when he sees --

	A CAMPFIRE off in the distance. LAUGHTER, SINGING.
	CAMPERS!!!

	He takes off toward the campfire, then hears --

	SPLASHING. 

	He turns.

	HIS POV

	Within the distorted lake, someone is drowning. Could it be a little 
	boy?
	A little Jason from many years ago?

				WOMAN
		Help me!
			(gurgles)
		Jason help me!

	JASON

	Moves toward the beach. Steps partly into the water.

	HIS POV

	THE WOMAN, THE VOICE. IT'S JASON'S MOTHER!

	He turns toward the campfire, back to his mother...what to do?! Then --

	JASON TEARS INTO THE WATER, TRYING TO REACH HER.

				MRS. VOORHEES
		Help me, Jason, please! Help your mother!

	Jason moves closer.

				MRS. VOORHEES
		Don't let me die again!

	As he draws near, she reaches out her hands to him.

	JASON

	Pauses staring at the please for help.

	He stares into her pleading face. HIS MOTHER! After all these years!

	He places his hand over her face, gently, then --

	PUSHES HER UNDER!

	He holds her there.

								QUICK-CUT TO:

	INT. REACTOR ROOM

				KAY-EM 14
		Uh-oh. That's not a part of the program.
		Thorgan, we've got a problem!

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE 

	Camp Cyrstal lake begins to jerk and fade.

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	Everyone is suited up. Delongpre, the last, is adjusting his helmet.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Oh, shit. He's going to see us.

				DELONGPRE
		Well, do something!

	Thorgan grabs the portable keyboard and starts typing away!

	EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Suddenly the image solidifies then a number of the aliens from the game
	grid appear. But Jason's seen these guys before. He tears through them.

	INT. REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

				THORGAN
		Shit!

	Boeman hits the door panel to the docking bay. It begins to slowly rise.

				BOEMAN
		Just a little more time.

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	Jason stands atop a pile of dead alien like some strange Conan in space.
	The image flickers...he  catches a glimpse of our heroes at the end fo 
	the 
	room. He starts toward them.

	Then a huge white fluffy bunny with huge breasts appears before him.

				WHITE FLUFFY BUNNY
			(sings; deep african american voice)
		I'm'a big fluffy bunny...a big white fluffy bunny...

	SWISH! The bunny's head is severed. The image distortss. Again we see 
	our 
	heroes. Jason is closer.

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	The door is halway open. Our heroes start ducking under.

	Jason is almost on them.

				RIZZO
		Thorgan!!!!

	He's clicking away like a mad man.

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	A ROCK BAND appears playing some futuristic metal. Then CHEERLEADERS in 
	scantily clad outfits. Then a MIDGIT in a cowboy hat riding by on a 
	tricycle. We have now entered Thorgan's twisted streams of conciousness.

	Jason tears through the aboe. His goal now clear. The distractions no
	longer fool him.

	A volley ball court appears with naked girls bouncing around.
	A fat man wearing only a spiked leather Speedo. A huge turtle.
	A couple of goats.

	Nothing is stopping Jason.

	INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

	Boeman reaches out and jerks Thorgan into the inner air lock.

	EXT.  CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

	The image finally disintergrates.

	Jason finds himself staring at our heroes. He lunges for the air lock, 
	but --

	Sergeant Brodski dives, hitting Jason in the chest and knocking him to 
	the
	floor.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Sergeant!

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		Get out of here!

	SERGEANT BRODSKI, still in Jason's clutches, kicks at the door panel.

	The door starts to close as Jason begins hacking with his machete.

				BRODSKI(V.O.)
		That all you got?!!

	Jason hacks and hack, stabbing through the space suit, until finally, 
	the tough
	old leather neck is silent for good.

	INT.  AIR LOCK

	The door is sealed.

				RIZZO
		He saved our lives.

	Boemen hits another button, and the outer door begins to open.

				DELONGPRE
		Boeman, the ships not here.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Use the thrusters and you'll
		be fine. We'll huddle together
		out there.

	EXT.  WHAT'S LEFT OF THE GRENDEL

	AS THE OUTER DOOR OPENS, RIZZO UNCOMFORTABLY FIDGETS WITH HER SUIT.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Hey, easy now.

	He points to where her hand hovers over some buttons on her sleeve.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You wanna release your air tanks?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
			(nervous)
		Okay, good tip.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You'll be fine.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters.
		We'll be fine.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around.
		So far so good.

	WHAM!

	Jason starts pounding from the other side.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Don't worry. He can't get through that door.

	Delongpre's right. This isn't some thin interior door or some
	walkway door reinforced by a high school kid. This is an air lock
	door. Built to withstand laser cannons and meteors.

				BOEMAN(V.O.)
		Thrusters.

	CHSHSHSHSH. CHSHSH.

	Our group enters deep space.

	EXT.  WHAT'S LEFT OF GRENDEL

	Rizzo, Thorgan, Boeman and Delongpre look tiny next to the massive
	right hull. They thrust slowly into space.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo, you okay?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		No I'm not okay! I don't
		know what the hell I'm doing!

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You're doing fine. I won't let
		anything happen to you, remember?

					QUICK CUT TO:

	INT. DOCKING BAY

	Jason finally gives up with the massive pounding. He steps back.
	Turns, stares at the sergeants' dead body, then looks at --

	THE DOOR PANEL

	He preses the button

	the ari lock door begins to open. Air is suddenly sucked out of the 
	room!

	Sergeant Brodski's body flies out into space. Everything not tied down 
	races out 
	along with him.

	ON KAY-EM 14'S HEAD

	AS it skitters across the floor --

				KAY-EM 14
		Ahhhhh!

	-- and right out the air lock

	JASON 

	holds onto a machine until the door is open, then lets go!
	He shoots out into space.

	EXT. GRENDEL

	Jason flies out of the air lock.

	HIS POV

	He's rocketing right toward one of the space suits!

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I think I had some when I was eight.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Did you like it?

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I think so, why?

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		He's trying to ask you out on a date.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Shut up, Thorgan!

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Delongpre, you don't even know me.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		I know you.

	Suddenly Rizzo is SLAMMED from behind. She and Jason go spinning away 
	from
	the others.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Nooooooo!!

	RIZZO

	grapples with Jason, but JASON IS JUST TOO STRONG.

	Jason holds HER with his good hand and REARS his metallic hand back. 
	He's
	going to punch a hole right through her helmet, most likely throat her 
	head,
	when --

	WHAM!

	Delongpre rockets into Jason, but Jason's got one of his arms
	sticking through one of Rizzo's harnesses. THe three go tumbling.

	Delongpre clings to Jason's back.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Rizzo, pull away!

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I'm stuck!

	Jason reaches back, grabs Delongpre and jersk him over his head until 
	he's holding Delongpre
	around the thoat. He'll pop his helmet like a cork!

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	AS Thorgan and Boeman thrust towards the tumbling mass...

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		We're too far away!

	BACK TO JASON

	AS he tightens his grip around Delongpre's neck. He can't fight back.

	RIZZO is fighting to untangle her harness. We can hear
	Delongpre CHOKING over the radio.

	The three are spinning even closer and closer towards EARTH II.

	Then, Rizzo reaches down. She grabs Delongpre's leg and CLICKS a button 
	on her sleeve.

	KA-CHSSHSH!!!

	HER AIR TANK BLOWS!

	JASON IS THROWN OFF OF THEM!

	But he's still tangled in Rizzo's hoses. And now she has no air.

	Jason turns...grabs the hoses and begins pulling himself
	toward Rizzo and Delongpre.

	He has them...when --

	WHAM!

	BRODSKI

	Still barely alive barrels into Jason, vlinging to his back.
	He turns, slashes with his knife and severs the hoses.

	Jason and Brodski tumble towards EARTH II.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Rizzo's turning blue. She's about to pass out, when --

	Delongpre pulls a hose from his suit and hooks it into her tank.

	CHSHSHSH...

	AIR BEGINS TO FLOW.

	Rizzo takes a big GASP...coughs.

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		You okay?!

				RIZZO(V.O.)
			(breathing steadily)
		Oh great...yeah, having a great
		time, and you?

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		No thank you, you crazy old woman.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Old woman?

				DELONGPRE(V.O.)
		Well I mean, technically you are old
		enough to be my great, great, great...

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		I get it.

	Suddenly Boeman and Thorgan grab them.  The four survivors huddle 
	together.

				KAY-EM 14
		Hello? A little assistance here?

	They turn to see Kay-Em's head floating close by. Thorgan graps at her 
	and pulls
	her head into his arms.

	THE GROUP CHEERS.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		Kay-em you okay?

				KAY-EM 14
		I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.

				THORGAN(V.O.)
		I missed you too.

				KAY-EM 14
		I love you.

	Those two aren't the only two.

	CLOSE ON RIZZO AND DELONGPRE

	Their glass face masks are touching. They stare into each other's 
	eyes.

				RIZZO(V.O.)
		Chinese, huh?

	They laugh and turn to stare toward EARTH II.

	EXT.  EARTH II -- ORBIT

	Suddenly Jason's body comes into view. It's racing toward Earth II.
	Brodski riding it like Slim Pickens.

				BRODSKI
		Yeee---Haaaaa!!

	Slowly they begin entering the atmosphere.

	Immediately Brodski is engulfed in flames and is gone. He was a good
	man...stay to the end to make sure the job was done right.

	Spread eagle and alone, facing the planet below, Jason continues his
	descent.

	His fingers wiggle as his chrome mask begins to heat up.
	It begins to glow. His metallic arm and leg glow.

	Flames build as he rockets towards Earth II.

	Flesh BUBBLES and OOZES.

	His legs and arms begin to flail as hunks of burning flesh fall from his 
	body!

	EXT.  CAMP SIGHT

	Four kids sit on futuristic sleeping bags around an old fashion 
	campfire.

				KID # 1
		Hey! Check that out!

	They look up and see a blaze shooting towards Earth II.

				KID # 2
		A falling star!

				KID # 3
		It's a meteor dickhead.

				KID # 2
		It's still cool.

	It LIGHTS up the night, then --

	EXPLODES IN A BRILLIANT FIREWORKS DISPLAY!

				KID # 1
		Cool!!!

	From the explosion, one small smoldering chunk falls toward Earth II.

	EXT.  CRYSTAL RESERVOIR

	OUR POV

	As the chunk falls closer and closer we see that it is a glowing chrome
	hockey mask!

	IT HITS THE WATER with a SSSSS!!!!

	BACK TO KIDS

				KID # 4
		Damn! It his the reservoir.

				KID # 1
		Let's go check it out!

	The others agree as they grab their flashlights and head in toward what
	could be a wonderful new discovery.

								DISSOLVE INTO:

	A STREAM.

	The hockey mask washes down the stream, comes to a halt at a pair of
	grusomely charred hands. 

	THE FINGERS,

	TWITCH, curl around the mask, lifting it off camera. AND WE --

	FADE OUT, a familiar KI-KI-KI-KI-HA-HA-HA-HA, resonating as we --

	ROLL CREDITS

	THE END
