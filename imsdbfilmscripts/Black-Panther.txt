           Millions of years ago , a meteorite
           made of vibranium, the strongest
           substance in the universe struck
           the continent of Africa affecting
           the plant life around it.

          The meteorite hits Africa and we see plant life and animals
          affected by vibranium.

                          FATHER (CONT'D)
           And when the time of man came , five
           tribes settled on it and called it
           Wakanda. The tribes lived in
           constant war with each other until
           a warrior shaman received a vision
           from the Panther goddess Bast who
           led him to the Heart Shaped Herb, a
           plant that granted him super human
           strength , speed, and instincts.


          A visual representation of the five tribes emerges as hands
          from the sand animation, and we see them unite , and then
          break apart as conflict arises . Bashenga rises above the
          conflict and eats the Heart Shaped Herb, proceeding to unite
          the tribes .

                          FATHER (CONT'D)

           of Wakanda .

           Four tribes agreed to live under
           the King's rule , but the Jabari
           tribe isolated themselves in the
           mountains.

          We see the Jabari striding off towards the isolated mountain
          region.

                          FATHER (CONT'D)
           The Wakandans used vibranium to
           develop technology more advanced
           than any other nation , but as
           Wakanda thrived the world around it
           descended further into chaos.

          We see images of war and slavery just outside Wakanda ' s
          secretive border .

           To keep vibranium safe , the
           Wakandans vowed to hide in plain
           sight, keeping the truth of their
           power from the outside world.

          We see the protective barrier rise around the Wakandan city ,
          as we pull back on the Earth as it spins, now zooming in on
          another part of the world ..·

          superior strength. T'Challa eludes a salvo of swings, then is
          driven back by the tip of M'Baku's spear against his shield.
          Knocking M'Baku's spear free, T'Challa is HAMMERED ONTO HIS
          BACKbut instantly springs up to dodge more attacks and
          counter with TWOFIERCE KICKS.
          M'Baku spits blood and bangs his chest. The rest of the
          Jabari warriors RESPOND. T'Challa salutes the crowd and they
          respond LOUDER!
          M'Baku charges at T'Challa , knuckle-walking , and slipping his
          assault , T'Challa grabs M'Baku's spear and cartwheels over it
          to land another KICK.
          The two continue to battle, BLOCKINGand TRADINGBLUNT
          STRIKES, until M'Baku delivers a backhand that KNOCKS
          T'CHALLA OFF HIS FEET near the Dora's spears.

          OVERHEAD BLOWSwith his shield, then M' Baku leans with all
          his strength trying to impale T'Challa on the TIPS.
          Clubbing M'Baku to his heels , T'Challa rushes forward for an
          aerial attack only to be met by a VICIOUS KICK to the chest ,
          causing him to LOSE both his shield and spear!

           A misidentified Wakandan artifact
           was stolen yesterday from a British
           museum . We have learned Ulysses
           Klaue plans to sell the vibraniurn
           to an American buyer in South Korea
           tomorrow night .
          There are audible murmurs at the name of Ulysses Klaue .

           Klaue has escaped our pursuits for
           almost 30 years. Not capturing him
           was perhaps my father's greatest
           regret . I wish to bring Klaue back
           here to stand trial .

           do not think about what Klaue took
           from us, from me.

          Killmonger pulls the knife out of his chest, killing himself
          instantly. T'Challa looks down at his cousin's now lifeless

          demolished .

          enter and walk up to the center pit.

           My name is King T'Challa , son of
           King T'Chaka . I am the sovereign
           ruler of the Nation of Wakanda and
           for the first time in our history
           we will be sharing our knowledge
           and resources with the outside
           world. Wakanda will no longer watch
           from the shadows . We cannot , we
           must not. We will work to be an
           example of how we as brothers and
           sisters on this Earth should treat
           each other . Now more than ever ,
           illusions of division threaten our
           very e x istence. We all know the
           truth : more connects us than
           separates us . In times of crisis ,
           the wise build bridges , while the
           foolish build barriers . We must
           find a way to look after one
           another, as if we were one single
           tribe .
          The audience of WORLD LEADERS look around , bemused, wondering
          what Wakanda could possibly have to offer .

           farmers offer to the rest of the
