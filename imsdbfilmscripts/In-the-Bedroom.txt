          EXT. GI'S POINT

          We are in the midst of a field of tall grass wild flowers.
          A long rutted road stretches into the distance. Faintly at
          first and then closer - we hear a woman squealing with
          laughter. We see her legs cut through the grass and fly up a
          hill. Close on her heels is a young man, a good ten years
          younger, in hot pursuit.
          Over the field - across the tops of blades, sits an ancient
          apple tree. We rise out of the grass and see the two young
          people under the tree. They are entwined - in a deep embrace.

                         CLOSER NOW
          We see them in glimpses:
          Their eyes - Lips - Hands
          Finally they part - the woman rests her head on his chest.
          She reaches out and strokes his hand.
          He stares at their fingers mingling together.
          The woman sighs.

          Standing. on the lawn in front of one of them is the woman from
          the opening scene, NATALIE STRUT, prett - eautifl actually
          with a little more sleep. She stands wit two small boys who
          are doing their best to stay warm in the morning air. Her son
          JASON 8 , and his brother DUNCAN 4, who has his face buried in
          his mother's coat--refusing to see or be seen.
          The truck comes to a stop and two men get out. One is young,
          early 20's, and even at this hour his step is lively, his
          face full of warmth. He walks over to Natalie and gives her a
          kiss. The young man from the opening scene, rRANK FOWLER.
          The other man leans back against the passenger door. He is
          in his early 50's. Kind face, good looking, athletic in his
          day - Frank's father, MATT. He smiles at Natalie.
          Natalie smiles back.

          Great!
          Jason starts for the truck. Matt opens the door and the boy
          climbs inside the cab.
          Frank kneels down to Duncan.

                         F
          Hey buddy ... you upset that you're not
          coming?
          Frank reaches out and puts his hand on the boys shoulder.
          Duncan pulls away.
          Frank looks up to Natalie for help.

                         F
          He can come if he wants ...we can manage,

          Sardines are processed at lightening speed. We follow them on their
          journey, which ends with the sealed cans being packed into
          cardboard shipping boxes. They are taped shut by a young man we

          I NT. ATKINS LOBSTER CO-OP - DAWN
          A double-55-gallon-drum wood stove is humping. Several men turn their
          bodies rotisserie-fashion around the thing, while making morning
          small talk - The starting price of lobsters, the prospect of repairs
          to their equipment, and so on.
          A SCARRED HAND scribbles some figures on a wall that has been
          used as a scratch pad for years.
          Two scales are emptied of RED FISH into a PLASTIC PICKLE BUCKET.

          EXT. HARBOR - SAME

          A pair of CANVAS TENNIS SHOES shuffle down a gangway. The
          bucket sways directly over them. A small hand struggles with
          the weight of the thing. A pair of BEACON FALLS waders appear
          - the shoes stop. A strong hand grabs hold of the handle -
          the shoes pick up the pace.

          EXT. HARBOR - S

          Matt & Frank prepare the rig.
          Jason stands on the dock, taking it all in. A field of
          LOBSTER POTS stacked like cordwood and surrounded by a
          collection of SCARRED BUOYS, GRAPNEL and coiled FISHING GEAR
          stiff with sea salt - all so wildly unreasonable as to seem
          exotic.
          Jason's eyes find the hull of "GIGI" an old Boudreau built
          lobsterboat. Starboard side covered in barnacles.

          The sun is fast climbing into the morning sky as "GIGI"
          glides out of the channel and past a LIGHTHOUSE that sits
          Just off the point of a good sized ISLAND.
          Jason shields his eyes with his hand. He gazes out at the
          island. Matt comes up beside him and sticks a baseball cap
          onto his head. The crown reads U.S.S. CONSTELLATION.

          It's beautiful. Isn't an island anymore
          though. It's a city. They have electric
          lights. Artesian wells, even a jail
          lighthouse isn't manned anymore - it's
          run by a computer When I lived there,
          had no ferry then` so we didn't even have
          cars, can you believe that?

          Then we got a little outboard. That was

          was - we lived there until I was about
          your age - then we left and became
          "harbor people".
          Jason seems to be digesting this.

          I a "harbor person"?
          Matt hides a smile about to form.

                         MATT
          Yep, Jason - we all are.
          Jason is full of questions. Matt knows the answers and
          doesn't talk down to him. Something the boy is grateful for.

          At the helm. His eye s inted from glare and cold. He cuts
          back on the throttle s and heads for the winch.
          GLOVED HANDS pull up a BLUE-GREEN BUOY and slide the MANILA
          LINE into the WINCH.
          A POT surfaces and Frank sets it "Doors up" on the edge. He
          opens the doors. His hands work quickly and efficiently. He
          tosses a SMALL CRAB back into the water, pulls out a LOBSTER
          and measures the back. Too small. Then a nice sized LOBSTER
          is pulled out - it's missing the SCISSOR CLAW. He hands it to
          Matt. Baits the trap. Throws the winch and the next pot
          surfaces.
          Matt sits inside, Jason on his lap. He reaches into a WOODEN
          BOX of RUBBER BANDS with a BANDING WRENCH and bands the
          crustacean's remaining CRUNCHER CLAW.
          Jason stares at the disfigured creature.

                         MATT
          Oh boy you see what happened to
          this poor fel ow?

          .what?

                         MATT
          Well, the trap has nylon nets called
          heads--2 side heads at b ends, so the
          lobster can crawl in. The "Bedroom" head
          inside, holds the bait and keeps it from
          escaping--you know the old saying "two's
          company three-s a crowd"?
          Jason nods.

          two in a bedroom and chances are
          something like this is going to happen.
          That's why Frank can't leave these traps
          for more than a day.
          Matt holds up another Lobster and turns it belly-up. There
          are black balls on both sides of the tail.

                         MATT
          Now the older females like this of gal,

          Eggs... .one of these can take out two
          males easy - Then you wind up with
          lobster you can't sell - and as for this
          fine lady, she gets off easy, the state
          says you have to let her go.
          Matt throws her back in the water. Holds up the other one to Jason.

          Can you handle this?
          Jason nods.

          Go ahead now, put it in the tank.
          Jason can't get the thing in the tank fast enough.

          Looking around, you see a big yard, double lot. The grass is
          manicured to per ection, someone takes a lot of pride in
          their garden. In the middle of this sits a two story cape,
          post Hopper/Wyeth, early 20th Century - simple, beautiful,

          The truck backs up into the driveway, Frank j s out, drops

          a steaming hot grill, with a huge assortment of hot-dogs &
          burgers. A spatula flips a patty.
          The sounds of Fenwav park emanate from a chea Dort able
          radio.
          WILLIS GRINNEL, early 50's, a stout, silver-haired man, works
          the grill. Standing next to him is Matt, his best friend for
          forty plus years.
          Matt takes a pull off a can of Moxie. Sets it down and searches
          through a plastic bread bag.
          Willis looks past him, distracted.

          Matt follows Willis's gaze, to the object of his distraction:
          A PRETTY WOMAN IN TIGHT DENIM SHORTS. She-s bent over to wipe
          the ketchup-stained face of Jason (he's wearing Matt's cap).

          ritual of removing the pins from her hair once ma e from the
          shells of tortoises and now the plastics of Dupont.
          Matt lies in bed reading. He lowers his book and watches her
          brush her tresses with on y, delicious strokes. She sets down
          her bsh and turns. Matt ooks back to his book.
          She climbs into bed next to him.

                         RUTH
          She's not divorced yet.

                         MATT
          It's the same thing. Maine has crazy
          laws, that's all...he likes the boys.

                         RUTH

          Then what's he doing with her?

                         MATT
          She probably loves him, Ruth. Girls
          always have. Why can't we just leave it
          at that?

                         RUTH
          Hmmmm. He won't listen to me. I asked him
          three times to dismantle that swing-set.

                         MATT
          Oh, let it stay up. Looks like a young
          couple lives here.

          So to speak.
          Ruth pinches his shoulder.

          Elwyn sits bare chested on a table. Matt finishes bandaging his
          elbow - then listens to his chest with a stethoscope. He is
          careful and thoughtful. Alma looks to him. Worried.

          a mechanic than a doctor, working on old cars with parts that
          have long been discontinued. He nods sympathetically.

          Matt pulls on his jacket. He passes Janelle in the hallway as
          he heads for the back door.

          Matt trots down the gangway and up to where the "GIGI" is

          somewhat of a giveaway.
          Frank rolls his eyes.

          Matt sits across from Natalie and Frank. Sandwiches, iced tea
          and coleslaw are laid out.
          Frank looks to Matt for some kind of acknowledgement of his
          lunch-tÂ°e activities. Matt seems more interested in the slaw.

          by dozens of young parents.
          Ruth doesn't look too tilled to be here.

          He gets a grin from Matt for his trouble. Ruth almost catches
          it.

          unity & balance. Froebel called them "Gifts."
          This is the second gift - a sphere, a cube, and a

          Half a dozen girls age 15 to 18, are gathered in Ruth's
          classroom. Desks and chairs are stacked up for summer recess.
          The girls are in shorts and T-shirts, one with a picture of
          the solar system, and another with the Pink Panther. Bri ht
          bathing-suit straps are visible around some of their nec s:
          This afternoon they were sw' Â°ng. A few look sleepy enough
          to be in bed already. Ruth stands with her arms up- keeping
          time and controlling the dynamics. A single girl sings "The
          Drone"` a low monotone one hears underneath the other voices.
          They sing the Balkan folk song "Oj Savice."

          that village, the prettiest girl.
          Without embarrassment, they shriek they drone, and at their
          ease they whistle. The music transports these girls - who are
          normally pre-occupied with images of MTV and Brad Pitt, to a
          place of pure self. The song ends.

          For some reason this strikes both of them as funny and they

          in the Vietnam War. The theme, if there is one, is definitely

          prominent. They are from Willis' - -, days; The first an

          second a sun faded color photo of : att and Willis. Both ook
          to be in their twenties, both dressed in Navy Whites.
          The trade here is mostly ve early breakfast, and then lunch
          for the men who work at the leather and shoe factories.

                         DAVIS
          You see, we can't appeal bail - It's just
          not set up that way.
          RUTH - -y
          You let that bastard walk out and we're
          supposed to just sit here? Don't tell us
          there's nothing to do about this.

                         DAVIS
          It's not us, s. Fowler. The state's bail
          code is to ensure future court appearances

          In this case Strout's family was prepared to
          put up a substantial amount of property as
          bail - That, along with his ties to the
          community made it hard for us to convince the
          judge of a serious "Risk of Flight".

                         RUTH
          Oh - I see.

                         DAVIS
          It's not just your case. Now you can file a civil
          suit. I recommend it. But not now, wait till
          after the crimminal trial.
          Matt stares at a small cartoonish statue on Davis's desk. It is
          one of those things that were popular in the 70's. A little man
          chasing an ambulance. It reads "World's Greatest Lawyer."

          And when will that be? Next week, next
          month?

                         DAVIS
          Well... honestly - anywhere between twelve
          and eighteen months?

                         RUTH

          trial sometime in October!?

                         DAVIS
          If he was incarcerated the udge would
          move for an October date - basically to
          save the County the cost of housing and
          feeding him as an inmate - But with bail
          the court date, unfortunately, is always
          later.

          But you're confident you'll be able to put
          him away for good then... Right?
          Davis looks uncomfortable with the question.

          Nathan Strout brought up that

                         DAVIS
          Hard to say really. Anywhere between five
          to fifteen years. We think we have a good
          shot at the max - fifteen. Even with good
          behavior, he'd do a full ten.

          Ten years? Five years? Are you out of your
          mind!? He killed my son. Does anyone know
          this?
          Matt looks at his shoes, as Ruth glares down Davis.
          Davis sits back, a little shook up.

                         DAVIS
          I'm sorry, s. Fowler. I understand.
          Unfortunately, in situations like this
          when there is no eye witness, there ...
          well, there's not a lot we can do.

          the door. His finger slides down the length, he kneels down.
          We see what he's looking at. Pen and pencil marks straight
          lines each about two inches apart - each with Frank's name
          and aqe.

          Yes. She told me about a vision she had
          when she found out her daughter had
          died ...she saw herself at a great
          distance from the earth encircling
          it, an endless line - as she got closer
          she saw that it was made up of mothers
          traveling forward. She fell into line,
          and began walking with them. When they
          reached a certain point, the line
          divided. She said she knew - that all the
          millions of women on her side - were the
          mothers who had lost children-she
          seemed to find great comfort in that.

          is devoted to footwear.
          Ruth sits while YVONNE, 45, kneels in front of her, holding
          Ruth's stockinged foot. She slips on a dress shoe.

          The bottom splits and grass spills out onto the drive-way. He
          goes inside and returns with a broom.
          He sweeps the rass into a pile. Picking up handfuls and
          refilling the gay. He takes the broom and sweeps what's left

          We are outside the car as it waits for the Drawbridge to
          close, so it may continue. We hear the following from
          perspective.

          But David says if theyy want him to go out
          to New Mexico or California, he'll go
          back to infantry - he don't care. Long as
          he stays out here. He's not about to--

          boy wanted out so bad -- that he'd taken
          his own life.
          They all look at each other. How did this conversation get so
          depressing?

          Ruth continues sorting the mail.
          She stops on one piece. Seems stunned, repeatedly reading it.

                         THE ENVELOPE
          It's from Publisher's Clearinghouse.
          In oversized block letters, it reads,

          She stares at the piece for a long time.
          Looks off. Smiles. And starts giggling. She can't stop.
          The giggles quickly flow into a deep laughing fit, harder and
          harder as the tears rain down.

          Matt nods, without looking at him.
          Matt looks at Davis's hand moving the change. He becomes
          hypnotized by the sound.
          Davis continues talking. Matt can't hear a word of it,
          though. All he hears is the clinking of the coins in the
          pocket.

          stacked with four high rows of Frank's empty traps.
          Matt pulls up a string of pots. Opens the door and pulls out
          a young male. He flinches and drops it. His finger goes to

          applies it to the finger.

          Natalie springs back, paralyzed with shock.
          She tries to catch her breath, staring directly at Ruth.
          Eyes ablaze, Ruth says nothing.

          THE LIVING ROOM
          Ruth is curled up on the couch.
          Matt stands over her, unsure of which way to go.
          He stares absently into the small mountain of candy in his
          hands - sets it on the coffee table
          He takes a seat at the other end of the couch.

          Raise a buck.
          The bet's to Matt. He stares at his cards for a very long
          time. Willis looks to say something, when Henry hits his arm.
          This stops him.
          Matt looks up. He sees the patience they are all exercising
          for his typical indecisiveness. This bothers him.
          He stares back down at his cards. Stalling, waiting for
          someone to bust him.
          He looks u at Willis - Henry - Carl. They all sort of smile
          uncomfortably. He can't take it.

          No one wants to make the first move.
          This upsets Matt even more.

                         MATT
          O.K. fine!
          He stares back down at his cards.
          Finally it is Carl who speaks.
          There are things of which I may not speak;
          There are dreams that cannot die;
          There are thoughts that make the strong heart weak,
          And bring a pallor into the cheek,
          And a mist before the eye.
          And the words of that fatal song
          come over me like a chill:
          A boy's will is the wind's will,
          And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.
          Matt looks up from his cards into Carl's eyes.
          The two men regard each other.

          The game has ended. Matt says goodnight to Henry and Carl, as
          the two of them pull out of Willis Is driveway. Matt is about to
          leave. Just climbing in the front seat. When Willis puts a hand
          on his shoulder.

          A few minutes later.
          Matt sits alone in the room. Be gets up to examine a picture
          hanging on the opposite wall. He's not particularly
          interested, he's seen it a million times, he's just killing
          time. A corner of the room devoted to Naval memories. A
          pristine version of Matt's U.S.S. CONSTELLATION cap serves as
          the center piece.
          Willis comes down from upstairs.

          door so it is only slightly ajar. He keeps his foot between

          with the desperate eyes.

          that easy?
          Silence.
          He starts it up, slides into reverse. He looks back over his
          shoulder as they back down the driveway. Matt averts his stare.
          Looking down at the gun barrel but not at the profiled face
          beyond it.

          They crawl up the trail, the wheels crunching the gravel, the
          headlights shining into the dense woods.
          The road seems endless. Richard cringes as they bounce over a
          bump.
          Both of them eagerly peer beyond the windshield.
          Finally, at a great distance, the tiny lit windows of a cabin
          come into view. A BLUE CHEVY PICKUP is parked in front of the
          place.

          The Brown Suburban crawls to a stop. Richard keeps the engine
          running. Matt presses the gun hard against his neck. He
          straightens in his seat and looks in the rearview mirror.
          Matt's eyes meet his in the glass for an instant before
          focusing on the hair at the end of the gun barrel.

          He pulls out the two canvas bags. He sets them on the ground.
          He reaches in and pulls out the small suitcase.

          the road ahead.

          The Ford pulls up to the curb. Matt gets out.
          Willis drives away.
          Matt starts walking.

          The STREET LIGHTS suddenly turn off',.
          The world is waking up now.

          In the distance, Matt can see his house.
          The birds all seem to wake at once.
          Matt gazes up into the trees overhead, the first light just
          kissing their branches, the sky now a husky blue. The
          surrounding houses with the windows still dark, asleep.
          He picks up his pace.

          He roves his tennis shoes, his pants, he starts unbuttoning
          his shirt. Now in his T-shirt and boxers, he examines his
          clothes and shoes carefully, before putting them into the
          washer - He pours detergent inside - and starts the cycle.
          He steps to a little sink and washes up.

          The light has been left on, he kills it and heads upstairs.

          And stands in the doorway. He pauses, seeing only
          the orange ember of Ruth's cigarette, in the dark.

          watching him.

          He doesn't move. He says nothing else.

          Sun light creeps in through the curtains, onto Matt's face.

          Matt is cede awake. He stares at the ceiling Reliving it
          His eyes full of an unspeakable sadness.
          The lids heavy. If only he could sleep.
          But he won't. Not today.
          There is a small crack in the ceiling.
          He'll have to fix that.
