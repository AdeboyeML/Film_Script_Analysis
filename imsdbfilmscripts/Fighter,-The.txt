          Abandoned textile mills on both sides, a two-story flat-iron
          style building splits the roads 100 yards ahead. Still hear
          metal scraping against asphalt.. .then it stops.
          BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER OF FRAME, a wheelbarrow filled with 250
          pounds of black asphalt edges into frame, followed by the guy
          sweating, struggling as he pushes it, GEORGE "MICKY" WARD
          JR., 31, short, compact, close-cropped reddish-blonde hair,
          little boy face, glancing over his shoulder, dumps the
          wheelbarrow on old cracked cement.. .picks up a scraping-
          spreading tool on a metal broom stick, and commences to
          spread out the new asphalt. Trying to complete a newly paved
          road to the right which ends in this intersection. The
          scraping tool spreading the new asphalt. Micky sweating,
          dirty from asphalt.
          Now skinny bare arms start shadowboxing around Micky working.
          Only the arms enter frame in combinations, shadow punches.

          He turns and kinda smiles as leans away with the rake, then
          slips and moves with the punches being thrown by RICHARD
          "Dicky" ECKLUND JR., 38, Micky's half-brother, skeleton-like
          arms, backwards baseball cap, shorts, work boots, enters
          frame, shadowboxing around Micky, smiles missing teeth. The
          two brothers play spar, joking, having fun. Micky throws a
          and Dicky play snaps his head back. Then Dicky does it to
          Micky. Then Micky throws an upper cut and Dicky pops his head
          up, broken toy robot.

                         DICKY

          He resets his head, punches Micky.

          watch ...Neary backs Micky up against the ropes, hitting him
          with everything he's got, pounding hard right after hard
          right ...Bam! Bam! Bam! Merchant, "Vicious body shots from

          to trade his way back!"...Neary steps back...Micky slips off
          the ropes and raises his hands over his head, letting Neary
          know he survived. . .And fires a left hook--Right uppercut!
          Lampley, "And Ward hurts Neary with a body shot! Ward hurts
          him again with that left to the body! Neary is wobbled!"
          Micky rocks Neary with another left hook to the body ...Bam!
          Micky follows with a huge left uppercut... Bam!
          Neary stumbles backwards and goes crashing down to the
          canvas! Hear Lampley scream, "Big uppercut by Ward! First
          time in 22 fights that Shea Neary has been down!" Neary gets
          back up to his feet at "Four..." Referee Mickey Vann giving
          him the standing eight-count, "Six... Seven... Eight."
          .Dicky shaking his fist, screaming Micky on, "This is it!
