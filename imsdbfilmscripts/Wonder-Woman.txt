               I used to want to save the
               world...

    The distant SOUND OF TRIBAL DRUMS as we DESCEND planet-

               This beautiful place.

                             DIANA (V.O.)
               But the closer you get, the more
               you see the great darkness
               simmering within.

    Finally, we arrive in PARIS, FRANCE.


2   EXT. LOUVRE MUSEUM (PARIS) - EARLY MORNING                    2

    The LOUVRE MUSEUM -- with its 16th-Century architecture
    and its I.M. Pei glass-and-metal PYRAMIDS -- a place
    where the past and the future meet.

    DIANA PRINCE (30), antiquities expert, strides towards
    the Louvre, passing ARMED MILITARY at guard and alert.

                              DIANA (V.O.)
               And mankind?   That's another story
               altogether.

    A TRUCK pulls up, blocking our VIEW. ARMED SECURITY
    OFFICERS exit, unloading a CRATE from WAYNE ENTERPRISES
    addressed to DIANA PRINCE: CURATOR.


3   INT. LOUVRE MUSEUM - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION             3

    Diana walks down a HALLWAY with Assyrian bas-relief
    sculptures showing the good, and the bad, of humanity
    throughout history. She takes this in.

                             DIANA (V.O.)
               What one does faced with the

    The CRATE is delivered to Diana -- a wall-mounted
    COLLECTION OF ANCIENT WEAPONRY and GREEK ANTIQUITIES
    behind her.

    She eyes the WAYNE ENTERPRISES LOGO warily.

    Now alone at her desk, Diana opens the crate and looks
    inside, stunned.

    REVEAL THE ORIGINAL DAGUERREOTYPE of Diana from BvS --
    She's in her WONDER WOMAN ARMOR, surrounded by a band of
    SOLDIERS -- her friends -- from long ago.

                            DIANA (V.O.)
              I learned this the hard way. A
              long, long time ago. And now I
              will never be the same.

    She holds up the unsigned note accompanying the photo:

    "I found the original.   Maybe one day you'll tell me your
    story."

    She contemplates the faces of her friends long dead. Her
    eyes focus in on a man we'll soon know as STEVE TREVOR.
    She lingers on him, and then drifts to herself.

    Surrounded by HISTORY, Diana is overwhelmed by the memory
    of how this photo -- and Wonder Woman -- came to be --

    THE PAST. Flashes of AMAZONS as they train for COMBAT on
    VARIOUS PLATEAUS extending from the edge of the CLIFFS of
    Themyscira.

    The Amazons train with WEAPONS, CLASHING and TESTING one
    another to their limits.

    DOZENS of ARMORED FEMALE WARRIORS -- AMAZONS -- engage in
    a dazzling array of training exercises. Every Amazon is
    an ageless beauty, between 30 and 50. They spar with BO
    STAVES, KNIVES, SWORDS. Practice ARCHERY, SPEAR
    THROWING, and LASSO from HORSEBACK. It's breathtaking --

    -- and YOUNG DIANA (8), Princess of Themyscira, watches
    it all from the edge of the field. Her eyes blaze with
    admiration.

    ANTIOPE, the demanding GENERAL, oversees the Amazons.
    She wears a distinctive HELMET. At her side, the Amazon
    PHILIPPUS (African, regal).

    Diana fixates on one Amazon in particular, FIERCE and
    POWERFUL -- ARTEMIS. She sends her opponent to the
    GROUND, then SPINS to face another!

                            ANTIOPE
              Yes, the blow was strong, but
              Eliana's footwork betrayed her! A
              battle is like a river-crossing,
              every step must find a safe spot --

    Diana REHEARSES Artemis' moves, her young face set in a
    fierce scowl. She stabs at imaginary enemies, then looks
    up to find --

    Antiope STARING AT HER from across the grounds. She's
    caught! But instead of hiding -- she looks back to
    Antiope: I'm ready to fight! LET ME TRY!

    Antiope shakes her head but smiles -- Diana smiles back.

                            MNEMOSYNE (O.S.)
              Diana!

    Diana freezes, then BOLTS, before MNEMOSYNE (Diana's long-
    suffering tutor) can push through the crowd.

6   EXT. PUBLIC SQUARE (THEMYSCIRA) - CONTINUOUS ACTION           6

    Diana dashes through the crowded   marketplace, hoping to
    lose Mnemosyne, but every Amazon   whose path she crosses
    greets her with a smile or "Good   morning, Princess!"
    "Hello, Diana!" We realize that    Diana is the ONLY CHILD
    in this world.

    Diana races past a MURAL in the public square of QUEEN
    HIPPOLYTA, Diana's mother, triumphantly leading the
    Amazons.

                            MNEMOSYNE
              Diana, come back!

    A young AMAZON GUARD sees Diana coming, holds out her
    hand, STOP! Diana sees up a narrow stairway, grins -- an
    escape! She darts up it and back down another straight
    into a DEAD END.

    Looking for a way out, she sees a long jump she just
    might make. There's a big fall, but Diana loves a
    challenge! She smiles mischievously, runs and LEAPS --

    -- but she's NOT GOING TO MAKE IT! Diana stretches out,
    her face falling as she realizes she's missed the jump,
    when --

    A hand grabs her wrist!


7   EXT. OTHER BRIDGE (THEMYSCIRA) - CONTINUOUS ACTION          7

    Dangling, Diana's pulled up to see: QUEEN HIPPOLYTA,
    ethereally beautiful, holding Diana easily by one arm as
    if Diana weighed nothing. She sits HORSEBACK, the
    mounted QUEEN'S GUARD behind her.

    Diana twists uneasily, smiling up at her mother.

     Hippolyta slowly unfolds the large TRIPTYCH, revealing an
     elaborate PAINTING illustrating the history of the
     Amazons.

                             HIPPOLYTA
               Long ago, when time was new, and
               all of history was still a
               dream... the gods ruled the Earth,
               Zeus king among them.

               Zeus created beings over which the

               his image -- fair and good, strong
               and passionate. Zeus called his

               This was Ares.     The God of War.
     The sky splits open and fire rains from the heavens. Men
     take up arms, falling in line around Ares and becoming
     his ARMY.

        APHRODITE, Goddess of Love, stands beside Zeus and the
        other gods at the shore of a turbulent sea, waving her
        hands as the ocean churns.

        From out of the sea rises: HIPPOLYTA, ANTIOPE, and
        countless other figures -- WARRIOR WOMEN.

                                HIPPOLYTA (V.O.)
                  So the gods made us, the Amazons,
                  to influence men's hearts with
                  love and to restore peace to the
                  world.

        Standing behind Aphrodite on the shore, MEN watch the
        women approach in awe, lowering their weapons.

                                HIPPOLYTA (V.O.)
                  For a brief time, there was peace,
                  even a unity among the world, as
                  the gods and man fought side-by-
                  side against a great evil.

        An ancient war is subtly depicted, but not lingered on.
        If one looks close you'll see: THREE ARMIES -- The gods,
        Amazons, and Atlanteans battling JACOB. Each army in
        possession of a LOTUS.

        ARES cleaves Jacob, then he looks to the LOTUS the humans
        have discarded. He reaches for it --

                                ANTIOPE (V.O.)
                  But it did not last.

        ARES' ARMY OF MEN swing a barrage of weapons at Hippolyta
        and the Amazons, led by the God of War himself.

               Ares refused to give up his hold
               on mankind. Tightening his grip,
               he turned them against us.

     ARES AND HIS ARMY OF MEN lead Hippolyta and the other
     Amazons out of a BURNING CITY in SHACKLES and CHAINS.

                             ANTIOPE (V.O.)
               When Zeus led the gods to our
               defense, Ares killed them, one-by-
               one...

     Ares grabs Apollo from behind, slitting his throat --
     elsewhere, he assassinates Aphrodite -- elsewhere, Hermes --

     HIPPOLYTA breaks the chains between her bracelets!

                             ANTIOPE (V.O.)
               Your mother, the Amazon Queen, led
               a revolt that freed us all from
               enslavement.

     Ares and Zeus CLASH in the eye of a STORM, each at the
     edge of death. Zeus throws his last THUNDERBOLT, hitting
     Ares.

               us a weapon, one powerful enough
               to kill a God... to destroy Ares

     home.

     Hippolyta and Young Diana (8) ride their HORSES to the
     ARMORY, a heavily guarded keep at the top of Themyscira's
     hillside. The QUEEN'S GUARDS follow. Diana's eyes drift
     up at a HIGH TOWER with a single window.

               This is where we keep all the

     including a glowing GOLDEN GIRDLE, LASSO, and at the
     center, an ornately-crafted SWORD. Diana gently touches
     the hilt of the sword, in awe.

     BOOSH!   A FIELD OF ENERGY EMANATES FROM DIANA'S CORE.

     We get the sense that this is just the beginning of her
     true POWER. Still, it's powerful enough to knock Antiope
     off her feet. Diana stumbles back...

     Diana, amazed and elated, realizes that something
     unbelievable has happened. A tiny GOLDEN SPARK in her
     eye quickly fades.

     Diana's ecstatic, scared and confused.   She looks to her
     mother: Did you see that?

     But Hippolyta is worried about the implications of
     Diana's power -- and Diana mistakes it for judgment.

                              HIPPOLYTA
                What have you done?

     Diana looks to Antiope, blood streaming from a cut to the
     head. Diana rushes to her side.

                I'm sorry --

                Stay back.

     Diana looks at the other Amazons, who all stare back in
     silence, even Artemis -- then back to her mother's
     forlorn face, filled with fear. Diana slowly takes a
     step away, feeling frightened, guilty, rejected --

     And Diana runs --

     Hippolyta's face, taking in Diana's actions.


22   EXT. CLIFF (THEMYSCIRA) - CONTINUOUS ACTION                    22

     Diana races up a grassy embankment to a CLIFF overlooking
     the ocean.

     She looks down at her open palms, clenches them shut.

     What was that?   Then --

     An UNFAMILIAR SOUND: a strange gnawing BUZZ.     Diana
     looks upward, quickly spotting --

     A SHAPE on the horizon, moving closer. Something she has
     never seen before: A GERMAN WARPLANE, a Fokker, out of
     control, trailing SMOKE.

     Diana's sharp gaze catches sight of SOMEONE IN THE
     COCKPIT, struggling to escape.

     The PLANE dives down, crashing into the water!

     Without hesitation, Diana DIVES off the cliff, hurtling
     hundreds of feet through the air and into the sea.


23   EXT. UNDERWATER (AEGEAN SEA) - MOMENTS LATER                   23

     The plane SINKS, its PILOT already underwater.

     He struggles to break free from the cockpit, but his
     MESSENGER BAG is caught!

     A loud CREEEEAAAK pierces the water. The PILOT looks up
     to see a deep FISSURE running along the tail. It BREAKS
     free and the engine and cockpit sink like stones.

     As he sinks, he loses breath, the light fading.
     Suddenly, out of nowhere, DIANA APPEARS ON THE PLANE'S
     TAIL, above the surface. The sun blazes, framing her, an
     epic vision -- like an angel.

     The PILOT blinks into the light one last time. The DARK
     DEPTHS closing in on his face as his eyes fall shut.

     Diana DIVES in and grabs the Pilot.

     She braces her feet against the plane and rips him away,
     kicking to the surface.
                                                             17.

     German Soldier #1 REACHES OUT over the side and HIS HAND

     of LIGHT hitting a mirror.

     He briefly sees a flash of a beautiful island --
     startled, he jolts back, the image vanishing into fog.

     He leans back out and there it is again! Beyond the
     protective RING of FOG and reefs -- AN ISLAND! And Diana
     swimming the Pilot toward the beach!

     Stunned, he leans inboard, once again enshrouded in a
     foggy, cold, gray day.

     Diana drags the Pilot onto the beach, his bag around his
     shoulder.

     She gently lays him on the sand and gets her first real
     look at the FIRST MAN SHE'S EVER SEEN. His mouth, lips,
     jaw, hair, stubble -- captivating.

     This is CAPTAIN STEVE TREVOR (30s), rugged, handsome.    An
     American fighter pilot undercover for the British.

     Steve wakes, squinting in the sun, surprised to discover
     Diana's not a hallucination. He takes in the strange
     surroundings, blown back by her breathtaking beauty.

                              STEVE (PILOT)
               Wow.

     She backs away as he sits up, surprised by the timber of
     his voice. Diana studies his eyes. They're so blue.

     They're cut off by the ear-splitting SOUNDS OF SCRAPING

     BATTLE-CRUISER running aground on the protective REEF
     around Themyscira.

     A torrent of FLAMING ARROWS sail from the cliff top, over

     MORE AMAZONS join the others on the cliff, led by ORANA.

     Orana shoots a GRAPPLING ARROW into the rock wall of the
     opposite cliff. She swings down the attached line toward
     the beach, firing ARROW AFTER ARROW at the Germans.

     ON THE BEACH:   Diana and Steve watch her, stunned.

     DAY

     Steve, in his GERMAN PILOT'S UNIFORM, stands on an
     AIRSTRIP next to several other PILOTS and PLANES.

                                STEVE (V.O.)
                  British Intelligence got word that
                  the leader of the German Army,
                  General Ludendorff, was visiting a
                  secret military installation in
                  the Ottoman Empire.

                  According to our intel, the
                  Germans had no troops left, no
                  money, no munitions of any kind...

     Steve discovers this is an immense MUNITIONS FACTORY
     manned by elderly men, women, and children, all of whom
     appear to be slave labor for the Germans in the mass
     production of BOMBS.

                                STEVE (V.O.)

                  Germans had the Turks making bombs
                  for them. And not just bombs...

     Ludendorff   approaches a SCIENTIST, wearing head-to-toe
     protective   gear. Removing mask and goggles, we meet the
     STUNNINGLY   BEAUTIFUL DR. MARU, 40s. She finishes writing
     a CHEMICAL   FORMULA in a NOTEBOOK. She turns, greets
     Ludendorff   with respect and confidence.

               Ludendorff's chief psychopath.
               Dr. Isabel Maru.

     Steve can't help but stare admiringly... until Maru turns
     her head, revealing METAL PLATES on her face, hiding
     damage incurred by her own experiments.

                             STEVE (V.O.)
               Boys in the trenches call her `Dr.
               Poison.'

     Maru leads LUDENDORFF to her lab, to a fully-enclosed
     TEST CHAMBER with a VIEWING WINDOW.

     In the chamber, Steve sees a gruesome site: A PRISONER,
     his terrified face covered by a GAS MASK, his wrists and
     ankles stretched out and restrained by CHAINS. Another
     CHAIN leads from the top of the prisoner's gas mask.

     Out of earshot, Steve watches as Maru shows Ludendorff
     the formulas in her notebook, explaining them.

     Maru closes the notebook and sets it down, then releases
     GLOWING GAS into the chamber. Panicked, the prisoner's
     terrified eyes widen, MUFFLED SCREAMS cry out behind his
     gas mask.

     Enraptured, Maru puts a hand against the window, her
     anxious eyes follow the SMOKE filling the chamber: It
     has to work this time.

     Ludendorff watches, waiting.

     Steve looks on in horror as the prisoner's gas mask
     begins to show slight signs of disintegration: thin
     cracks in the glass, wear on the straps, corrosion on the
     metal -- Maru isn't even aware she's grinning, but then --

     The prisoner realizes the gas mask is resisting the gas,
     protecting him. He calms. Maru's face falls.

     Her eyes dart to Ludendorff who shows obvious signs of
     disappointment.

     Steve watches as a frustrated Dr. Maru pulls a LEVER --
     and the chain connected to the prisoner's gas mask tears
     the mask off, exposing him to what's left of the gas!

     The panicked prisoner screams in pain as he breathes in,
     dying horribly!

     Steve can barely watch, he glances away -- and his eyes
     lock on Maru's notebook.

               able to complete her work,

     Diana enters to find Steve stepping out of a TUB -- his
     back to her -- NAKED. She studies his body as he towels
     himself dry.

     Steve's shoulder has been BANDAGED, but his body is
     covered with CUTS, BRUISES, SCARS from other battles.
     Diana touches her own wound, sympathetic. Steve finally
     turns, startled to see her there.

     look on her face.

     On this still, MOONLIT night, the armory stands
     monolithic amongst the other buildings of Themyscira.

     Diana surveys from an opposing hillside. The building's
     face an impenetrable mountainside, accessible by only one
     main entrance, completely blocked by SEVERAL GUARDS who
     stand watch -- and even if she could take them all on,
     Diana doesn't want to hurt them.

     Studying the building further, she focuses on the SINGLE
     WINDOW in the HIGH TOWER.

     Diana's face darkens with fixed focus. She looks down at
     her feet, back at the space -- calculating it all. She
     turns to the hillside behind her, spots a distant branch
     twisting from a tree. It looks relatively equidistant to
     the armory.

     She takes a step towards it, then another -- and another --
     and Diana leaps into the air, locked on the branch -- but
     she lands far before reaching it!

     As Diana jogs to a stop, her frown fades:      I know that I
     can do this.

     Diana sets off in a dead sprint towards the cliffside --
     she LEAPS over the abyss below. Her face calm as she
     SOARS through the night --

     THE BUILDING BARRELS TOWARDS HER, her eyes widen.
     Thinking fast she GRASPS a SPUR and --

     She SLAMS into the side, holding on. She revels in the
     moment briefly and then sobers: Now what?

     The window is at least 30 feet above her -- below, the
     abyss. The wind MOANS.

     Diana's GRIP TIGHTENS on the spur.

     Suddenly, the SPUR CRACKS!    Diana falls --

     She scrambles against the wall, her hands grasping at the
     stone face. SHARDS FLYING around her, she realizes she's
     strong enough to make her own handholds -- SLAM!

     Shocked, she hangs there for a second, then grins

     moves towards the GODKILLER SWORD. She takes it from its
     SCABBARD, awed by its weight, its sheer power in her
     hands. She holds it tight. It feels right.

     As she leaves, she passes a suit of ancient armor and
     SNATCHES ITS SHIELD.

     Then the LASSO OF HESTIA disappears from its hook.

     Diana, now half-dressed in GREEK ARMOR, admires a glowing
     GOLDEN BELT-LIKE GIRDLE, then looks ahead to something

     FLICKER of fog -- it is gone. Bittersweet. She eyes
     Steve at the TILLER. He looks at his WATCH, still
     ticking, then pockets it.

               The war? Well, which part? The
               Eastern Front in France is 400
               miles long -- from the Alps to the
               Atlantic. Then there's the
               Dolomites in Italy, Turks in
               Arabia -- there used to be a
               Russian Front but they quit last
               year so they could kill the Tzar
               and have a revolution.

     SM #1 runs in the other direction, but Diana retrieves
     the LASSO from inside her coat and uses it to pull him
     off his feet, onto his back.

     As the lasso glows, Diana kneels at his side,
     compassionately placing her hand on his chest.    In her
     mind, his actions are not his fault.

     unruly group of men, MILITARY LEADERS and MEMBERS OF
     PARLIAMENT, shout down SIR PATRICK MORGAN (40s), kindly

     Diana nods -- a beat -- then she proceeds to follow Steve
     down the aisle, running her hand across the rows of
     chairs, nodding and smiling to the dumbfounded men
     staring at her.

                             SIR PATRICK
               Gentlemen! Germany is a proud
               nation who will never surrender.
               The only way to end this war and
               restore world peace is to
               negotiate an armistice.

     nods toward the door, then realizes the room has gone

     Every eye in the hall is fixed on Diana, the only woman
     in a room that doesn't allow women. Diana, oblivious,

      creeping towards the gas mask, enveloping it.

      glass, wear on the straps, corrosion on the metal. It's
      just as it was before.

      Maru, filled with anticipation, wonders: Will it work
      this time? It does. The gas continues, eating away at
      the mask -- the glass cracks apart, the straps sever, the
      metal breaks. A sign of the pain and horror it will soon
      inflict. It is Maru's greatest achievement -- then even
      the glass chamber itself starts to shudder -- and crack!

     The atmosphere is weirdly JUBILANT and GUNG HO. Two
     sikhs ride through the station on bicycles, a WILLFUL
     LITTLE GIRL runs away from her mother, NURSES and WOMEN
     FACTORY WORKERS board the train, solemnly and
     purposefully.

     Diana takes in an array of HUMAN EMOTION. Mothers
     CRYING, fathers PROUD, sons COMMITTED and BRAVE, going
     off to war. GIRLFRIENDS are swept passionately into
     BOYFRIEND'S ARMS. DOGS are scooped up and hugged
     goodbye.

     beat longer than he would expect.

     Diana watches a MAN and his DAUGHTER walk away from an
     ICE CREAM VENDOR, eating an ICE CREAM CONE. Steve spots

               There's nothing we can do about
               that.

                             STEVE
               This is no man's land, Diana. It
               means no man can cross it. This
               is the worst point on the entire
               front. This battalion has been
               here for nearly a year and they've
               barely gained an inch because on
               the other side are Germany's
               deadliest soldiers. Pointing
               machine guns at every square inch
               of this place. This is not
               something you can cross. It's not
               possible.

                             DIANA
               So we do nothing?

               We are doing something. We can't
               save every person in this war.
               Besides, it's not what we came
               here to do.

     She steps away from the group, turning away from them.
     Steve thinks she's upset.

     But when Diana turns back to Steve, he sees her face of
     determination, wearing --

               You shouldn't be worried about
               upsetting the peace accord. Ares
               would never let that happen...

               Of course... It makes complete
               sense. Ares developed a weapon,
               the worst ever devised.

     The tables are crowded with VILLAGERS and all the food
     the Germans left behind. Beer flows. Tea lights
     twinkle. A FEMALE PIANIST plays, singing as couples
     dance. The atmosphere is warm and jovial.

     Diana and Steve stand at the edge of the crowd, unable to
     put the urgency of their mission aside and join in.

     holding each other and then a SINGLE SNOWFLAKE falls.

     sky, sprinkling her hair. She holds out a palm, CATCHING

     Through the trees, still on HORSEBACK, Diana and the team
     see the WELL-GUARDED fortress that is German High
     Command. Steve uses FIELD GLASSES to survey the scene.

     Chauffeured LIMOUSINES go through a HEAVILY-GUARDED
     CHECKPOINT at the gate, behind it, a long line of cars
     delivering well-dressed GUESTS to the ENTRANCE of the
     château, a SINGLE SENTRY stationed there.

     The Chief gets off his horse, hands the reins to Sameer,
     then wanders off into the forest.

     Charlie looks through his scope:    several guards at the
     gate, but only one at the door.

      Pulling herself back up with incredible effort she sees
      that LUDENDORFF HAS THE GODKILLER.

                As magnificent a creature as you
                are, you are no match for me.

      WITH VEINS PULSATING BLUE, LUDENDORFF SWINGS THE SWORD
      DOWN TO DELIVER THE KILLING BLOW --

      But Diana BLOCKS it with her bracelets!

                We'll see about that.

      Ludendorff STRIKES AGAIN AND AGAIN until Diana grabs the
      blade with her BARE HANDS.

      It cuts deep, drawing blood, she CRIES OUT in pain.

      Summoning impossible strength, she grips the blade and
      SHOVES it back with such force that Ludendorff loosens
      his grip. For the first time we see that he is afraid.

      Diana stands over Ludendorff, raising the GODKILLER.

                I, daughter of Hippolyta, came
                here to complete the mission of
                the Amazons by taking your life,
                and ridding mankind and my people
                of you -- forever!

      Diana PLUNGES THE GODKILLER INTO LUDENDORFF'S BODY. His
      body crumbles to the ground, the blue in his veins fading
      away like a light going out!
      ARES IS DEAD!

      She breathes heavy, takes in the victory, reveling in it.
      Her mission accomplished. Her mother would be proud.
      Antiope. All of the Amazons.

      The battlefield is quiet. A storm begins to simmer in
      the sky. Then she hears a GERMAN COMMANDER screaming at
      his troops.

      Her brow knits with confusion.    Diana looks out over the
      airfield -- her face falls.

      HUNDREDS of "HELLMEN" SOLDIERS wearing strange customized
      GAS MASKS emanate from Dr. Maru's lab, working with

       The vehicle SPIRALS towards Diana, spinning end-over-end
       and breaking apart. MARU tumbles out -- lying in front
       of Diana BENEATH THE UPHELD TANK.

       cowers. Her METAL MASK FLAPPING OFF in the wind,
       grotesque and pathetic.

       Diana snarls, her arms shaking with the weight of the
       tank over her head. Her anger threatening to overtake
       her.

       Ares uses his power on Diana's lasso, wraps it around
       her, holding it tight.

       A GOLDEN GLOW begins to emits from Diana, a warmth within

       The lasso CRACKLES with power, building up a SURGE OF
