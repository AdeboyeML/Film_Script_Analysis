                         THE POWER OF ONE


               What if the power of one becomes the
               power of many and the power of many
               becomes the power of one?

1   EXT. SOUTH AFRICAN FARM - DAY (1939)                      1

    A white car sits in the yard of the farmhouse. On the
    door, a decal: "CAPETOWN SANITORIUM." Two men dressed
    in the white uniforms of the sanitorium exit the farm-
    house; one gently guiding a rather frail, troubled
    woman toward the car; the other totes her suitcase.

    The V.O. of a young man narrates:

                             YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
               There comes a time in everyone's
               life when they discover that the
               only person you can truly depend
               on is yourself. That the only
               real power anyone has to get
               anything done is the power of one.
               With any luck you can make it
               through a lot of years before you
               ever have to face the reality of
               that fact.
                      (beat)
               It was a luxury I never had. I
               discovered it the year my mother
               had her nervous breakdown.

    One attendant holds the rear door of the car open for
    the woman. Before entering, she turns one last time
    toward the farmhouse.


2   HER POV                                                   2

    A young BOY looking one part scared, one part sad, and
    one part lost stares back at her, his hand held by a
    large, amiable black woman with tears rolling down her
    round cheeks.

                             YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
               I was all of six.

                                                                3.

    The woman enters the car. The car drives off down the
    road. The Boy watches it disappear behind a plume of
    swirling dust.
                            YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
              My father died before I was born,
              and even though I was raised by
              my Zulu nanny, with my mother,
              depending on her health, in
              nominal attendance, it was
              decided, with her departure, that
              I, too, would depart...
                     (beat)
              ... for boarding school.

    The dust the Boy has been watching reverses itself.
    An unseen vehicle comes up the road.

                            YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
              But before I could be sent out
              into the world one very serious
              matter had to be dealt with.
                     (beat)
              I was a chronic bedwetter. Since
              my nanny was the one responsible
              for my well-being, she did what
              any responsible Zulu mother would
              do. She called on the greatest
              medicine man of her tribe --
              Inkosi Inkosikazi.

    Out of the dust a large black Buick ROADMASTER ROARS up
    the road and into the yard, scattering chickens and
    geese, stopping in front of the wide-eyed six-year-old
    and his tremulous nanny. A huge Zulu jumps out of the
    front passenger seat and opens the rear door. A moment
    passes, and then two splayed, cracked feet descend from
    the car and settle into the dust. INKOSI INKOSIKAZI,
    100 years old, small, black, wizened, hair and beard
    whiter than cotton, a leopard skin draped over his
    shoulders, a beaded fly switch in one hand, a trussed
    chicken in the other, exits the car.

4   EXT. YARD - NIGHT                                       4

    A fire burns bright in the black African night. The Boy
    sits holding the chicken, close by the fire, while Inkosi
    Inkosikazi shuffles around him, drawing a circle in the
    dust with a stick.

                                                              4.
                             YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
               Legend had it that Inkosi
               Inkosikazi was the last son of
               the great Zulu king, Dingaan,
               who fought both the Boers and
               the British to a standstill
               nearly 100 years before, and the
               night Inkosi Inkosikazi was
               conceived stars fell from the
               sky until the sun rose.
    The circle    complete, the old man sits down opposite the
    Boy. From     a leather pouch he produces several bones. He
    throws the    bones on the ground and studies them for a
    moment. He     begins to wave the fly switch back and forth
    in front of    the Boy's eyes, chanting low, softly. The
    Boy's eyes    grow heavy; his lids droop.


5   DREAM - EXT. WATERFALL                                     5

    The Boy and the old man are standing above a great
    waterfall. In the swirling pool far below are ten
    stepping stones linking one bank to the other.

                             YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
               The medicine man instructed me to
               jump off the falls and climb along
               the ten stepping stones, counting
               as I went until I reached dry
               land.

    The Boy jumps, cascading down the   falls and into the pond
    below.  He clambers up the first   rock. It is slippery.
    He falls off and climbs back on,   buffeted by the spraying
    water.  He makes his way stone by   stone toward the other
    side.

                             YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
               Even though it was only a dream,
               I felt as if my struggle to reach
               dry land was terrifyingly real.
               The water was like ice, bone-
               chilling, cold, and as I made my
               way from one stone to the next I
               could feel my strength desert me.
    The progress from one step to the next gets progressively
    harder as the Boy keeps slipping into the swirling water,
    coughing and sputtering.

                             YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
               I was three rocks in when I ran
               out of gas. I couldn't pull myself
               any further. No matter how hard I

                                                             5.
              tried, the current tried harder.
              I felt myself going under for the
              last time.

    The Boy's grip slips off the rock.   He starts to go
    under.

    The fire has gone out. The Boy is still sitting in the
    circle, the chicken still in his lap. His eyes snap
    open. The first thing he sees is Inkosi Inkosikazi
    sitting across from him with a big smile.

    Inkosi Inkosikazi enters the Buick. The Boy and his
    smiling nanny watch. They Boy still holds the chicken.

                            YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
              Inkosi Inkosikazi said the spirit
              of the great Zulu warriors lived
              in me. He told me that whenever
              trouble arose I should return to
              the waterfall and keep stepping
              across the rocks until the trouble
              passed. He said three rocks were
              enough to conquer my problem with
              the night water; that I was very
              brave. He said I was a man for
              all Africa, bound to her by my
              spirit, bound by my dreams.
                     (beat)
              And he let me keep the chicken.

    The Boy and his nanny watch the car go off in a cloud of
    dust.

    The Boy sits on a train looking out the window at the
    veldt and the wildlife moving across in the distance.

    A sack on his lap moves. The chicken's head pops out.
    The Boy gives him some kernels of corn and scratches
    behind his scraggly comb.

                            YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
              Although I was bound by spirit

               and dream to Africa, I was bound
               by heritage and language to the
               birthplace of my grandparents --
               England -- a country I had never
               seen, but one that was to cause
               me eminently more problems than
               bedwetting ever did.

                               YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
               The school I   was sent to was
               attended and   staffed entirely by
               Afrikaaners,   the oldest of the two
               white tribes   of Africa.

     The six-year-old walks timorously through the halls,
     filled with bigger boys -- brash, noisy, hostile. They
     only speak the "Taal" -- Afrikaans. Over and over they
     jostle or verbally deride the six-year-old, knocking his
     books down so that when he bends to pick them up he is
     kicked in the butt. Or pulling his shirt out from under
     his jacket and making it hard to move.
                             YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
               I spoke only English. The hated
               tongue. The language of the enemy
               who had usurped power and stolen
               the country through political
               chicanery and military brutality.

     A mob of boys, led by a big bully, JAAPIE BOTHA, runs
     the six-year-old through the bathroom and into the
     showers, fully clothed. He tries to run out. Jaapie
     Botha grabs him and throws him back in, holding him with
     one ham-fisted hand under the shower head and turning the
     shower on with the other. The six-year-old stands
     miserable as the stinging water pelts him.

                             YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
               During the Boer War of 1896,
               26,000 Boer women and children
               were herded into detainment camps
               by the British, where they died
               like flies from dysentery,

               malaria and black water fever.
               And it seemed I was destined to
               shoulder the responsibility for
               each and every one of those
               deaths.
     The six-year-old in his first soccer game receives the
     ball. He tries to move  upfield, but he is kicked and
     pushed, the ball taken from him. He gets up gamely to
     follow the chase, only to be flattened, blindsided by
     Jaapie Botha.

                             YOUNG MAN (V.O.)
               And no one made this more evident
               to me than Jaapie Botha, a wheat
               farmer's son from the Transvaal.

               The only time I was at peace was
               when I slept. Inkosi Inkosikazi's
               chicken proved to be, like his
               previous owner, a salvation.

     chicken a few grains of corn    and an affectionate scratch
     behind the ear, and goes back    to sleep.

a swastika, using a knife and blue dye. Seeing the six-
year-old, Jaapie turns his attention to him and

          from the English bastards who stole

                        JAAPIE
          With your blood.

Jaapie slaps the Boy across the mouth three times.
Blood flows from his mouth and nose. Jaapie dips his
finger in the blood and smears it across his new tattoo.
He holds up his bloodied fingers.

                        JAAPIE
          We swear allegiance to Adolf
          Hitler. Heil Hitler!

                        ALL
          We swear allegiance to Adolf
          Hitler. Heil Hitler!

                        JAAPIE
          Death to all Englishmen in South
          Africa. Heil Hitler!
The chorus repeats.

                        JAAPIE
          God bless the fatherland.    Heil
          Hitler!

The voices come back to him stronger.

                                                              10.
                              ALL
               Heil Hitler!

     Jaapie grabs the six-year-old again.

                             JAAPIE
               See what we have in store for
               you when Hitler comes, Rooinek.
               Hoy!

     He gives a command. The boys at the far end of the
     room part. The six-year-old's eyes open in terror.


17   HIS POV                                                       17

     20 feet away Inkosi Inkosikazi's chicken, his chicken,
     is hung from a rafter upside down, haplessly flapping
     against his bonds.


18   BACK TO SCENE                                                 18

                              BOY
               No!

     But before he gets two steps towards the chicken he is
     gang-tackled and held. Jaapie picks up a sling and a
     rock.

                             JAAPIE
               For crimes committed against the
               whole Boer people. I, Jaapie
               Botha, the judge and Uberfuhrer,
               sentence you and your Rooinek
               kaffir chicken to death. Heil
               Hiter.!

                              ALL
               Heil Hitler!

     Jaapie starts to swing the sling around and around.     The
     six-year-old struggles to get free.

                              ALL
               Heil Hitler!   Heil Hitler!
     The SLING WHISTLES through the air, faster and faster.

                              BOY
               No!
     Jaapie releases the stone. It flies true, catching
     the SQUAWKING, struggling CHICKEN flush in the chest.
     The flapping stops as blood soaks through feathers.

                                                        11.
Jaapie flings his hand forward, victorious.

                          JAAPIE
          Heil Hitler!

                          ALL
          Heil Hitler!

The Boy takes the opportunity to break loose. He rushes
Jaapie, whose arm is outstretched, putting him off
balance. The Boy catches him low, driving his head into
Jaapie's exposed stomach. Jaapie falls back and gets
the knife used for his tattooing right in his ass.
Jaapie Botha bellows like an enraged bull as he grabs
futiley for the embedded blade. His cohorts laugh,
thinking it tremendously funny, until Jaapie removes
the knife and turns with it, dripping his own blood, his
eyes murderous. The laughter dies. Jaapie's breath
comes hard.

                          JAAPIE
          Hang him up!

A few boys protest.

                          BOYS
          Jaapie!   No!

But Botha is murderous, intent on revenge.

                          JAAPIE
          Hang him!

He waves the bloody knife in the air. Three boys grab
the six-year-old and drag him to where the chicken is
hanging. Two more boys throw a rope over the same
rafter. Others bind the struggling boy, trussing his
hands to his sides.

                        JAAPIE
          You will pay for the deaths of
          our grandfathers and grandmothers,
          our aunts and uncles. All
          Rooineks will pay and you will be
          first. Pull!

The boys who tied the rope now yank it over the rafter.
The six-year-old is hoisted up until he is eye-level with
the chicken.

                        JAAPIE
          In the name of Adolf Hitler and
          the fatherland, I sentence you to
          die, Verdomde Rooinek.

                                                              12.
                               BOYS
                Kill him!   Kill him!   Kill him!

     Jaapie swings the sling overhead, faster and faster.


19   ANGLE ON SIX-YEAR-OLD                                         19

     He watches as Jaapie bears down. As Jaapie is about to
     let the rock fly the door to the room opens and two STAFF
     MEMBERS burst in, surprising in.

                               STAFF MEMBER
                What's this?

     The rock flies from the sling, but Jaapie's attention is
     diverted. His aim is off. The rock grazes the boy above
     the eye. He loses consciousness. The scene FADES TO
     BLACK.

     FADE IN:

20   INT. ST. JOHN'S STUDY - DAY                                   20
     Prince of Wales School, 1950. PK, 17     going on 18, well-
     built, intense, clear-eyed, handsome,    stands in front of
     a seminar and continues reading to 10    students, honor
     students, Headmaster St. John's chosen    few. St. John,
     with the demeanor of an Oxford don and    a mane of snowy
     white hair that reaches his shoulders,    sits off to the
     side, listening.

                              PK
                I came to after being unconscious
                for two days, the rock missing my
                eye by half an inch. After a week
                in hospital it was decided I'd be
                sent to my grandfather's house in
                the English town of Barberton,
                at least until passions at school
                cooled. Jaapie Botha was expelled;
                sent home to his family's farm in
                disgrace.

                              PK (CONT'D)
                       (beat)
                And so the first recorded South
                African casualty of Hitler's
                insanity was not a Boer, nor a
                Rooinek, but a tatter-feathered,
                half-bald kaffir chicken.
     PK finishes. The end of class BELL RINGS. Offstage,
     other classrooms are exiting into the common hall, but
     no one in St. John's study moves. St. John takes his

                                                        13.
glasses off and wipes the lenses deliberately.   After a
long moment he turns to face the class.

                        ST. JOHN
          Very evocative, yes. Particularly
          the image of the chicken. Good
          choice there.

St. John rises, lecturing.

                        ST. JOHN
          Any ideology that needs to attack
          the thing that least threatens it
          is an ideology that will not
          outlive its own generation.
          Inclusion, gentlemen, not
          exclusion, is the key to survival.
                 (beat)
          Something our new government
          should take heed of, eh?

His eyes roam from face to face, fixing his point.

                        ST. JOHN
          Next week we have Mr. Levy who
          will enlighten us on...

MORRIE, a bright-eyed kinetic, speaks up.
                        MORRIE
          Sport and wager in Imperial Rome,
          sir.

                         ST. JOHN
                 (facetious)
          Very apt, Mr. Levy. We look
          forward to the experience.
                 (pause)
          All right.

The boys bolt for the door.
                          ST. JOHN
          P.K.

PK approaches.
                          ST. JOHN
          Well-written.

                        PK
          Thank you, sir.

                        ST. JOHN
          I've received notice from the

                                                              14.
                 Oxford selection committee. You
                 are to appear before them in
                 three weeks. I assume you'll be
                 reading a piece of your fiction
                 as your presentational.
                               PK
                 Yes, sir.

                               ST. JOHN
                 A word of caution. Contemporary
                 to most of these fellows means
                 the seventeenth century. Try and
                 keep your theme, um, classical,
                 if you know what I mean.

                               PK
                 Yes sir. I will.
                        (beat)
                 Will the scholarship be decided
                 at the same time, sir?

                               ST. JOHN
                 Money's a different matter.
                 Different committee.

                               PK
                 Very good, sir.
     St. John picks up a book and opens the pages. He begins
     to read. PK takes it as a cue for his dismissal. He
     goes to exit.

                               ST. JOHN
                 And P.K...

     PK turns at the door.

                               ST. JOHN
                 Good luck tonight.

                               PK
                 Thank you, sir.

     St. John returns to his book.    PK exits.

                                                    CUT TO:


21   EXT. HALL                                                 21

     Morrie waits in the now nearly-empty hall, taking some
     money from another boy and making notations in a black
     book. PK comes up to him.

                                                        15.
                          PK
          How we doing?

Morrie consults the book.

                        MORRIE
          You win and your dream comes true.
          You lose, we're back to bread
          and butter sandwiches till term's
          end. What'd he want?
                        PK
          My appointement before the Oxford
          committee came through.

                          MORRIE
          A snap.

                        PK
          For a brain like you, maybe.

                        MORRIE
          Come on, you'll read one of your
          pieces, they'll be begging you to
          attend.

                        PK
          But will they pay for the
          privilege?

                        MORRIE
          Well let's bloody hope so. It'll
          be a lonely time without you
          there.

                        PK
          Morrie Levy. Is that the voice
          of sentimentality I hear coming
          from you?

                        MORRIE
          Sentimentality my ass.
          Practicality. Where am I going
          to find a sure thing like you to
          make book on at bloody Oxford?

                          PK
          Go on.

He shoves Morrie playfully out the door and follows.

                                              CUT TO:

                                                              16.
22   INT. LONG HALLWAY - CLOSEUP - PK AND MORRIE           22

     as they walk down the long   hall looking straight ahead.
     Sweat dapples PK's face.    Both boys are focused on
     double doors at the end of   the hall. There is the
     distant MUFFLED sound of a   CROWD CHEERING.

                             MORRIE
               You hear Sutcliffe screwed
               Bartlett's sister when he stayed
               with them over holidays?

                             PK
               I don't believe it.

                             MORRIE
               I heard it from Bartlett's own
               lips. He's selling reservations
               for next holiday. A pound for
               one night; three pounds for four.

                               PK
               You register?
                             MORRIE
               For both of us. Took the whole
               holiday.

     The CHEERING crowd grows LOUDER the closer they get to
     the double doors.

                               MORRIE
               You nervous?
                               PK
               No.
                             MORRIE
               Christ! I'm about to have a calf.
               This bloody Boer gets lucky,
               we're in the poorhouse.
     They reach the double doors. Still in CLOSEUP, Morrie
     turns to face PK for the first time.

                             MORRIE
               Now remember. We're not here to
               exhibit our wares. We go in, we
               do the job, we get out. Right?

     PK is so focused his eyes seem to bore through the doors.
     He does not move his head a hair.

                               PK
               Right.

                                                       17.

Morrie and PK draw a deep breath. Together they push
open the double doors. Together they stride into a
floodlit, fully-packed sports arena and head down the
fan-lined aisle to the raised boxing ring in the center.
Schoolboys in their respective school blazers, Afrikaan
and English, yell, whistle and clap. PK and Morrie,
in FULL FRAME, reveal PK in a boxing robe with taped
hands, and Morrie with towel and bucket.

                        ANNOUNCER
          And at the end of six matches in
          all weight divisions, the score
          is Prince of Wales three victories,
          Helpmakeer three victories.

The stands explode with cheers.

                        ANNOUNCER
          And now for the final bout to
          determine which school will win
          the Johannesburg 1950 public
          school boxing team championship.
          In this corner, weighing 140
          pounds, standing 5'8", from the
          Helpmakeer School with a record of
          13-0 on the year, Jannie
          Geildenhaus.
A huge cheer goes up for JANNIE, muscular, bare-chested,
as he dances and shadowboxes for the crowd.

PK enters the ring. He stands, robe on, eyes intent on
Jannie. When the noise subsides the Announcer continues.

                        ANNOUNCER
          And in this corner, representing
          the Prince of Wales School, the
          current Johannesburg Public School
          welterweight champion, also with
          a record of 13-0 on the year, also
          140 pounds, Kid P.K.

Now the English schoolboys cheer for their man, but PK
does not respond. He barely moves. He raises an arm in
bare acknowledgment. His attention stays focused across
the ring on his shadowboxing opponent. PK watches Jannie
dance closely when a low CHANTING begins from outside the
stadium -- African, tribal, mystical harmonies of black
voices building until the white voices inside the stadium
are stunned to silence. The song carries beautifully in
the night. For the first time PK's focus is broken, but
not like the others in the audience, who haven't a clue
as to what's happening. He has heard this before. This
is familiar.

                                                             18.

     This is for him. A distant knowing flickers in his eyes
     like a man who has heard the voice of fate whisper his
     name.

     Over and over, one phrase is indistinguishable -- the
     chorus of the song. "Ono  bi shobi ingelosi." The
     chanting stops as suddenly as it began. A moment passes
     before the crowd begins to buzz with the phenomenon.

     The Announcer attempts to bring everyone's attention
     back to the business at hand.

                             ANNOUNCER
               We thank the native population for
               their spirited display of
               enthusiasm. But now, on to the
               main event. Fighters to center
               ring, please.

     PK, focused again, meets Jannie at the REFEREE.

                             REFEREE
               You both know the rules.     No
               butts, no elbows, no low    blows.
               First man to score three    knock
               downs wins. Let's have     a good
               clean fight. Good luck     to you.
     The fighters slap leather. PK turns back to his corner
     when his focus is broken dramatically by a face in the
     crowd.


23   HIS POV - FRONT ROW - HALF-DOZEN SCHOOLGIRLS               23

     sit; one of them MARIA ELIZABETE MARAIS, 17, with honey-
     blonde hair and lapis-blue eyes, turns her head and
     engages PK's eyes and his heart. She quickly looks
     away. But a  connection has been made -- fire passed.


24   PK                                                         24

     goes back to his corner and takes off his robe.   Morrie
     stands, holding PK's mouthpiece.
                             PK
               First row, third from the left.
               Find out who she is.

     Morrie looks down at Maria.

                             MORRIE
               We're in a bloody war here, in

                                                              19.
               case you forgot. Let's keep our
               mind on that, hey?

     He jams the mouthpiece into PK's mouth as the BELL RINGS.
     PK turns to an onslaught by Jannie, a real brawler.
     Jannie's big, overhand rights almost nail PK until he
     finds his footing and dances away. Jannie comes after
     him hard, his schoolmates bellowing encouragement. But
     PK's far superior boxing skills put Jannie at an immed-
     iate disadvantage. It is a classic battle of a boxer
     versus a fighter. PK's jabs keep Jannie at an arm's
     length, until he closes with a combination. Jannie,
     willing to take three punches to land one, absorbs PK's
     point scoring combinations and tries to land knockout
     punches. When he has had enough punishment he lunges
     into a clinch.

                                JANNIE
               Blery Rooinek.     I'll kill you.

     PK pushes off as Jannie hammers at his kidneys. Backing
     up, PK repays the compliment with two quick jabs to the
     face. PK works Jannie, turning him left then right,
     working the angles, keeping him off balance while he
     racks up the points. Jannie goes left. As PK chases
     him that way his eyes fix on something out of the ring.

     Their presence distracts    PK for a split second, and in
     that split second Jannie    seizes the opportunity. He
     comes across with a big    right hand to PK's jaw. Jannie
     connects. PK goes down     hard. The crowd goes wild.
     Morrie leaps up and down    in the corner.
                                MORRIE
               Get up!     Get up!

     But PK is seeing double.    He shakes his head, trying to
     clear it.

                                MORRIE
               Up!   Up!


27   PK'S POV - JANNIE                                      27

                                                             20.
     him, counting.


28   BACK TO SCENE                                             28

     PK forces himself up.   The Ref checks him.

                                REFEREE
               Okay.   Fight.

     Jannie comes rushing in, banging PK with a series of
     hard rights, but dropping his left each time he throws
     one. PK absorbs the punishment as best he can, backing
     up, dancing away. Jannie is all over him just as the
     BELL RINGS. Jannie goes back to his corner, triumphant.
     PK goes back to his and sits down with a blank ex-
     pression. Morrie goes to work on a small cut over
     his eye.
                             MORRIE
               What are you trying to do,
               bankrupt us? What happened?

     PK turns and looks at the two Africans at the rear door.
     Morrie's eyes follow him, tensing as he sees the two men.

                             MORRIE
               Christ! If they get caught in
               here they're dead.
                      (beat)
               What the hell's going on?

                                PK
               I don't know.

                             MORRIE
               Well, worry about it later. In
               case you haven't noticed, this
               Boer bastard is trying to kill
               you.

                             PK
               You see the way he drops his left
               when he throws the right?

                                MORRIE
               Yeah?

     The BELL RINGS. PK and   Morrie trade a look. Jannie
     comes rushing over and  throws a big right. PK steps to
     his own right side and  pops Jannie right over his dropped
     left hand. He looks at   Morrie again.

                                                               21.
29   ANGLE ON MORRIE                                            29

                             MORRIE
               Thank you, God.

     Jannie comes after PK, paying for each big right he
     throws as PK finds his mark. PK plants one, then two,
     then three punches on Jannie's face. Finally, frus-
     trated, Jannie forsakes all pretense of boxing and tries
     to nail PK with wild, flailing blows. PK bobs and weaves
     and feints. Jannie's punches grow weary. PK begins
     to bear down, driving his man back with rapid-fire com-
     binations until he delivers the coup de grace, a left
     hook to the heart and a driving right uppercut. Jannie
     goes down in a heap. The crowd goes wild. The Referee
     counts him out. Jannie's seconds rush into the ring to
     lift their fallen fighter. Morrie also rushes in,
     followed by the Prince of Wales boxing team. They hoist
     PK up on their shoulders.


30   PK'S POV - MARIA MARAIS                                    30

     rising from her seat, and leaving with the other girls.
     Their eyes meet. Her hint of a smile breaks his heart.
     She disappears in the crowd.


31   BACK TO SCENE                                              31

     PK's eyes rise to the rear exit.   The tall African and
     his companion have vanished.

                                                 CUT TO:


32   INT. LOCKER ROOM                                           32

     The boxing team and a number of their supporters are in
     raucous celebration. Morrie comes bouncing through the
     crowd, until he enters the empty dressing room in the
     rear, where PK is getting dressed. Morrie takes a wad
     of money out of his pocket.

                             MORRIE
               Here you go, pal.
     He hands PK the money.

                             PK
               You're the treasurer of this
               company. You hold it. Did you
               find out what I asked for?

                               MORRIE

                                                22.
          Uh, listen, P.K. You know in this
          world there is no greater proponent
          of sins of the flesh than Morrie
          Levy. But  do yourself a favor on
          this one.  Take my advice. Pass.
                        PK
          Thanks for the advice.    The
          information please.

                        MORRIE
          Do you know who her father is?
          Professor Daniel Marais.
                          PK
          So?

                        MORRIE
          So? He's the Nationalist Party's
          resident intellectual. The man is
          one of the architects of this
          damned system of -- what are they
          calling it? -- apartheid? He has
          about as much use for a Rooinek
          Englishman rutting after his
          daughter as the Queen does for
          balls, pardon my French.

                        PK
          What's her name and where do I
          find her?

Morrie sighs.
                        MORRIE
          Maria Elizabete Marais, Seniors
          Cottage, Room 22, Devilliers
          School. They don't call it
          'Fortress Virgin' for nothing.
          You'll never get in.

PK slips his school blazer on.

                        PK
          You going to take book on that?

                          MORRIE
          Already have.    Three-to-one says
          you don't.

                        PK
          Where'd you bet?

                        MORRIE
          I took a big position you do.

                                                              23.

     PK smiles at his friend and starts to leave.    Morrie
     stuffs some banknotes in his breast pocket.

                             MORRIE
               In case you have to bail yourself
               out.

     PK boxes him around playfully and skips out, running the
     gauntlet of the celebration outside.
                                                   CUT TO:


33   EXT. DEVILLIERS SCHOOL FOR GIRLS - NIGHT                   33

     Indeed, "Fortress Virgin." Surrounded by a high stone
     wall, the school's gothic towers loom medieval in the
     African moonlight. A security guard mans the front gate.
     PK takes a route through shadows and shrubs, searching
     for a way in. He finds one in a tree whose massive limbs
     reach over the wall. In a flash PK is up the tree and
     over the wall.
                                                   CUT TO:


34   EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS                                        34
     PK makes his way through the darkened campus. A few stu-
     dents and some staff are about. PK hugs the shadows as
     best he can. PK passes a statue dominating the quad --
     a Boer family from the last century; the man looking for-
     ward, his gun braced for action; the women and children
     at his shoulder, brave, resolute.

                                                   CUT TO:


35   EXT. SENIOR COTTAGE                                        35

     PK comes up to the cottage where a few girls can be seen
     through the windows studying at lamplit desks or readying
     for bed. Other rooms are already dark. PK slips inside
     the building.

                                                   CUT TO:


36   INT. BUILDING                                              36

     PK moves along the hall looking for room 22.

     He is about to turn a corner when TWO GIRLS chattering in
     Afrikaans come down a staircase. PK backs into a

                                                                  24.
     darkened room to his left. The girls appear        in robes
     with towels and toiletries and step into the       same room.
     One flicks on the light to reveal the shower       room -- 14
     separate cubicle stalls. Still chattering,        the girls
     disrobe.

     pressed hard against the inside wall of a stall with a
     clear view of the proceedings. He holds his breath as
     one of the girls heads towards his stall. Her girl-
     friend cautions her.
                               GIRL
                 Those are always cold.     Use this
                 one.

     The girl turns away to another stall just in time. The
     SHOWERS START. PK allows himself to breathe again. He
     exits quickly.

     Maria Marais sits at her      desk in a nightgown,  working on
     a paper, when there is a      KNOCK on the door.   With her
     mind still on her work,      she opens the door.   Her eyes go
     wide with shock when she      sees PK. He puts a   cautionary
     finger to his lips.

                                  PK
                 May I come in?

     Maria, frozen with surprise, steps back.       PK enters,
     gently closing the door behind him.

                               PK
                 I'm sorry to scare you.
                               MARIA
                        (nervous)
                 You can't be here.

     She speaks in Afrikaan-accented English.

                               PK
                 I didn't know how else to meet you.

                               MARIA
                 I could be expelled.

                                  PK

                                                      25.
          Girls don't usually come to boxing
          matches.

                        MARIA
          We went on a dare. Please.
PK ignores her anxiety.

                        PK
          Did you like it?
                          MARIA
          It was...
                 (beat)
          ... exciting.    You were very good.

                        PK
                 (in Afrikaans)
          Thank you. I'm glad I impressed
          you.

                        MARIA
                 (surprised)
          You speak the Taal.

                         PK
          I'll speak Zulu if it'll help me
          see you again.
                          MARIA
          I can't.

                          PK
          Why not?

                        MARIA
          I need my father's permission.

                        PK
          Is it hard to get?

                        MARIA
          Hard for an Afrikaaner boy.
          Impossible for an English one.

                        PK
          How about your permission?    Do
          I have that?

Maria blushes.

All of a sudden there is a KNOCK on the door. Maria
starts. PK moves quickly behind the door as it opens to
TWO GIRLS.

                                                              26.
                        GIRL #1
          We're having coffee upstairs.
          Want to come?

                        MARIA
          I have to finish this paper.

                        GIRL #2
          Come when you're finished.     We'll
          be up late.
They close the door.    Maria reinforces it with her body.

                          MARIA
          Please go.

                        PK
          You didn't answer my question.
                        MARIA
          There are plenty of English girls.
          What makes me so important?

                        PK
          The way I felt when I saw you.

He is so direct she can only blush deeper.       Her response
is indirect but affirmative.
                        MARIA
          My father will insist on meeting
          you.

                          PK
          I can't wait.

O.S., the outside door to the dorm opens.        A matron's
voice calls out.

                        MATRON (V.O.)
          Lights out, ladies.
                          MARIA

          Good night, Maria Marais.

                        MARIA
                 (in English)
          Good night, PK.

     PK pauses.

               I don't remember telling you my

               And I don't remember telling you
               mine.
     PK smiles back at her. He drops to the ground. Maria
     closes the window and watches him scoot across the

     An ample house. PAN ACROSS a gallery of oil paintings
     depicting great moments in Boer history -- the Great Trek,
     an endless progression of oxcarts heading north, the
     Battle of Blood River against the Zulu armies, the hang-
     ing of Boer farmers by British regulars. Women and
     children herded into a detention camp as their farms burn
     in the background. Boer kommandos sniping at a British
     column on the veldt.

     PAN FROM the pictures TO photographs, sepia-toned, his-
     torical, and DR. DANIEL MARAIS and PK, strolling past the

     of the century, posed stiffly with a rifle in the slouched

               Jan Piet Marais. My uncle. At
               22 he led a kommando for three
               years before your people caught
               him and hung him.

                             PK
               I consider myself an African, sir.

                             MARAIS
               As do I. As do the Zulu, the
               Xhosa, the Pongo, the Ndebele.
               We're all Africans. But all from
               separate tribes, ay?

                                     28.
                 PK
Unfortunately.

              MARAIS
Why do you say that?
              PK
Because it's the whole tribal
idea that creates our problems
here in South Africa.
              MARAIS
The problems of South Africa, my
boy, do not come from tribalism.
They come from counter-tribalism.
From people insisting that natural
laws which have been in place and
operating since God's creation,
should be tampered with. Does
the gazelle sleep with the lion?
Does the rhino graze with the
mouse? The separation of things
is not coincidental. Do you think
a Zulu wants to see his culture,
his sense of identity, replaced by
someone else's anymore than I do?

              PK
No, sir. But I don't think he
wants being a Zulu to mean he is
denied the same rights as
everyone else has.

               MARAIS
Which is why civilization is
defined by the ability to live
under the rule of law. Laws
define rights.

              PK
But do they define justice?
              MARAIS
Ah. Justice. The banner behind
which the English marched as they
gobbled up a quarter of the world?
Justice, my boy, is only relative
to who's in charge.

              PK
And how long they stay in charge
is only relative to how well they
dispense that justice...
       (beat)
... with all due respect.

                                                          29.

Marais fixes PK with a stare.   PK's eyes meet his evenly,
unwavering. Maria enters.

                        MARIA
          Papa, would you like coffee in the
          library or the parlor?

                 (pleasant)
          The library, mein leib.

Maria smiles at PK and exits.   He leads PK towards the
library.

                        MARAIS
          I can't figure out if you're
          brave or foolish.
                        PK
          Why is that, sir?

                        MARAIS
          You come here to ask for permission
          to see my daughter. Correct?

                         PK
          Yes, sir.
                         MARAIS
          And knowing  who I am, what I stand
          for, do you  think this sort of
          discussion  is going to put that
          request in  a favorable light?

                        PK
          I thought a man of your intellectual
          reputation wouldn't want his
          daughter seeing someone who didn't
          think.

                        MARAIS
          Let me give you some advice then.
          You're right. I admire a keen
          mind.  But intellectual reputation
          or not, I am first a Marais, a
          member of the Volk.

                        MARAIS (CONT'D)
          And if you're trying to impress a
          member of the Volk with your
          intellect, don't do it espousing
          liberal ideas picked up in an
          English private school.

                                                             30.
                             PK
               These ideas I picked up somewhere
               else.

     Marais opens the library door.

               No doubt from an expert on race
               relations.

               cactus.

40   EXT. ROCK OUTCROPPING - DAY                                40

     A brilliant African sun beats down on the veldt below.
     On the rock, a seven-year-old PK sits looking somewhat
     sadly over the landscape. A long shadow covers him.
     The CLICK of a CAMERA is heard. PK turns, shielding his
     eyes with his hand against the glare of the sun to a
     tall, white-haired figure, shirtless, in hiking boots
     and kneesocks, holding a box camera.

                              DOC (FIGURE)
               Ja. Perfect.    You will excuse me,
               please.

     DOC, speaking in German-accented English, moves off from
     the sun's glare down to PK's level. On his back is a
     knapsack with a cactus sticking out of it.

                             DOC
               This I do not normally without
               permission do, ja? But to catch
               the expression. After all, it is
               the expression that is important.
               Ja? Without the expression the
               human being is just a lump of meat.
               You have some problems, I think.
               I am Professor Karl von Vollensteen.

     Doc clicks his heels together and bows his head slightly.

                              PK
               I'm P.K.

               be friends. Ja?

     Eighteen-year-old PK narrates.

                              PK (V.O.)
               That was how I met Doc, as he
               insisted I call him. A chance
               meeting between a directionless
               seven-year-old boy and an old
               German professor out collecting
               cacti on the African bush veldt.
                      (pause)
               So began my education.

     Doc and PK walk the veldt across craggy mountain trails,
     down dry river beds, through the jungle, always collecting
     cacti and aloe samples, Doc always talking, always
     explaining.

                             PK (V.O.)
               Doc believed the brain had two
               functions and that the South
               African public school system
               unfortunately dealt with only one.

                             DOC
               The brain, P.K., has two functions.
               It is the best reference library
               ever, which is a good thing to
               have. Ja? But also from it comes
               original thought. In school you
               will get all filled up with the
               facts. Here your brain will learn
               where to look, how to look, how
               to think. And then you will have
               for yourself all the brains that
               have ever been.

     Doc and PK sit high up. PK watches the endless animal
     migration below while Doc points things out across the
     landscape.

                             PK (V.O.)
               Doc knew everything. He had a love
               of learning. But his real passion
               was centered around two things --
               music and cacti.

               fiftieth birthday he gave it all
               up and moved to South Africa.
               From that point on it was all

     icent cactus and aloe garden filled with the samples Doc
     has collected for years. PK and Doc plant another

     in a notebook.

               If God would choose a plant to
               represent Him, I think He would
               choose of all plants the cactus.
               This one plant has all the
               blessings He tried but failed to
               give man. It is true. Look.
               The cactus is humble but not
               submissive. It grows where no
               other plant will grow. The sun
               bakes its back, the wind rips it
               from cliffs, or drowns it in the
               dry desert sand. Not a complaint.
               In good times or bad it will
               still flower. It protects itself
               from danger.

     Doc touches a cactus needle.

               has patience and solitude and
               modesty. In Mexico there is a
               cactus that blooms once in a
               hundred years and then only at
               night. That is saintliness of
               the highest order I think. Ja?
               From cactus comes medicine to
               heal the wounds of men and little
               buttons if you eat one you can
               touch the face of God or stare
               into the mouth of hell. It is
               the plant of patience, solitude,
               love, and madness. Modesty,
               beauty. Toughness and gentleness.
               Of all the plants I think it is

               keep it small. Most people are

               floors with Doc for over a year,
               learning more than I realize even
               today.
                      (pause)
               I also played a lot more 'God
               Save the King' due to my new
               musical celebrity.

     TRACK THROUGH Barberton, a small town on the low veldt,
     in all its colonial backwater splendor.

                             PK (V.O.)
               Barberton was a very proper
               English town with a proper square,
               a wide main street, and the
               colonials' overblown patriotism
               for a homeland most people had
               never seen, hanging in the air
               like fine dust. Not quite seen,
               but there nonetheless.

49   INT. CONCERT HALL                                       49
     PK plays "God Save the King" on the stage. The town's
     population stands -- the men, stoic; the women, dewey-
     eyed, at patriotic attention. Some people file out --
     the men in officers' uniforms of the South African penal
     system and their wives -- Boers. They exit to the dagger
     stares and some undertoned hissing and booing from Her
     Majesty's loyal subjects.

                             PK (V.O.)
               The only Afrikaaners to live in
               Barberton were sent there to work
               at the government prison, just
               outside town. Germany had
               covertly supported the Boers in
               their two unsuccessful wars
               against British rule, supplying
               food and medical supplies as well
               as ample stocks of ammunition.

                             PK (V.O.)(CONT'D)
               Germany was an old friend, a
               trusted friend. And in a country
               where a handshake is a friendship
               and a friendship a bond for life,
               as the war in Europe grew fiercer
               tensions in Barberton heated up.
               Suspicion was afoot. Spies were
               everywhere.

50   EXT. ROAD TO DOC'S COTTAGE - DAY                           50

     Doc and PK walk toward the cottage.   Doc reads PK's
     report card.
                             DOC
               Grammar: satisfactory. Science:
               satisfactory. Mathetmatics:
               satisfactory.
     He looks down at PK.

                             DOC
               P.K., if there is one thing I
               know you to be that is a lot more
               than just satisfactory. Ja?

                             PK
               But I don't want to be known as
               a brain.

                             DOC
               Why not?

                             PK
               Who do you think gets beaten up
               on all the time in school?
                             DOC
               My boy, to be smart is not a
               sin. But to be smart and not use
               it, that is sin number one. And
               as for getting beat up on, use
               your brain to figure out how not
               to be.
     He hands PK the report card, his displeasure obvious.
     As they crest the hill the cottage comes INTO VIEW
     along with a parked Army car and two armed soldiers
     leaning against it. Seeing Doc and PK, the soldiers
     smarten up, raising their rifles and advancing.

     Doc's face grows pale, his lips tight.   PK pulls close to
     him for support.

                             DOC
               Again it begins. The stupidity.
               Do not be frightened.

     Doc puts na arm around PK's shoulder, drawing him close,
     comforting him. One of the soldiers pulls a pair of
     handcuffs out of his pocket as he advances.

51   EXT. BARBERTON PRISON                                      51

     A car pulls up. Doc, in shackles, is escorted from the
     car. PK exits after him. Two guards lead Doc toward
     the doorway to the prison, a square in the looming gates.
     Doc walks, his head held high. PK walks alongside
     holding his hand.

                             BRITISH OFFICER (V.O.)
               Karl von Vollensteen, for the
               failure to register as an alien
               during times of war in accordance
               with His Majesty's government
               orders to do so, you are hereby
               sentenced to be confined at
               Barberton prison for the duration
               of the war with Germany.

     At the door a guard touches PK's   shoulder, holding him
     back. The door opens. Doc goes     through. Just before
     the door closes he looks back at   PK one last time. The
     door slams shut. PK, with tears    streaming down his
     cheeks, is left outside.

                                                 CUT TO:


52   INT. PK'S ROOM - NIGHT                                     52

     Morrie lies in bed, asleep.   PK sits up at his desk,
     writing.
                             PK (V.O.)
               And again I was alone with nothing
               to depend on to see me through
               except the power of one.

     PK puts down his pen and sits, regarding the pages. He
     raises his eyes to a photo on the desk of a boy on a
     rock.

     PK smiles at hidden memories, caps his fountain pen,
     turns off the light. The room is pitched into darkness.

     The seedy side of town. PK carrying a gym bag and Morrie
     looking a bit out of place in their school blazers come
     striding up the alley.

                                                              38.
                              MORRIE
                Look, even if the scholarship
                doesn't come through, my old man
                said he'd lend you the money.

                              MORRIE
                All right. All right. We'll call
                it the 'Levy Carpet Emporium
                Scholarship for Poor but Proud

                God, I hate people who can't be

                I don't know.    Personality
                disorder.

     PK nods in agreement.

                                PK
                Undoubtedly.

     The boys come to their destination marked by a rickety,
     faded sign: "GOLDMAN'S GYM." Excitement shines in PK's
     eyes. He bounds up the narrow flight of stairs.

     and collect themselves before opening the door to the
     gym. They take a breath and enter.

     A down and dirty boxing gym, humming with the rhythm of

men training. Sweat and smoke fill the air along with
the faint scent of blood. Fighters, both black and
white, train with each other. Morrie is amazed.

                       MORRIE
         How do they get away with this?

But PK has his mind on other things. His eyes fix on
an OLD MAN across the room standing by ringside.

                          PK
         There he is.

                       MORRIE
         Christ, he's old.

                       PK
         And he's the best.    C'mon.
PK leads Morrie across the gym. PK passes an African
fighter. He stops training when he sees PK. He turns
to another African fighter, glancing at PK. One by one
the blacks in the gym stop training to look at PK. PK
and Morrie approach the rheumy Old Man yelling at the
two fighters in the ring above him in a thick Polish-
Jewish accent.

                       SOLLY (OLD MAN)
         No, no. God gave you two hands so
         you can knock a man out from
         either side. Left-right.

He moves his creaky body back and forth to demonstrate.
                          PK
         Mr. Goldman?
Solly turns to the boys. A look of bemusement comes over
his face when he sees their blazers.

                         SOLLY
         What?    You boys lost?

                       PK
         I'm the one who called you
         yesterday. From the Prince of
         Wales School?

                          SOLLY
         Oh yeah, yeah.     The champeen.
         Right?
                         PK
                  (smiling)
         Right.

                                                        40.

                        SOLLY
          And who are you?

                        MORRIE
          The champeen's manager.

Solly rolls his eyes to heaven.

                        SOLLY
          Oy gevalt.
                 (beat)
          You know you train here it's not
          like those nice school fights
          you're used to. Three knockdowns
          you win.

Just then, as if to underscore his point, one of the
fighters in the ring gets caught witha solid shot to the
jaw. He hits the canvas inches from where they are
standing. Solly, PK and Morrie all look at him, and then
at each other.

                        MORRIE
          What does it cost for you to train
          him?

                        SOLLY
          For my personal attentinons, Mr.
          Manager? Fifty pounds a month.
          For one of them...
                 (points to the other
                  men working with
                  fighters)
          ... less.

Morrie pulls out a wad of money and proffers it to Solly.

                        MORRIE
          Here's for six months in advance.
          Three hundred pounds.
Solly pushes the money back.

                        SOLLY
          Six months? I don't know your
          boy'll last six minutes.

                        PK
          I'll last.

Solly notices that every black fighter in the gym has
stopped working and is staring at PK.

                        SOLLY

                                                         41.
          What are you staring? Punch,
          don't stare. C'mon. Work or
          you're out.

The blacks go back to work.
                        SOLLY
          That your gear?

                           PK
          Yes, sir.

                        SOLLY
          Go change in the back. We'll see
          if you couldn't find a better use
          for all that money.

                        PK
          Thank you, sir.

PK heads towards the rear.      Solly turns to Morrie.

                        SOLLY
          Why's he want to do this, a nice-
          looking schoolboy?

                        MORRIE
          He wants to be welterweight champ
          of the world.

Solly breaks up laughing.

                        SOLLY
          Oh sure, sure. And I'd like to
          be twenty-five again.

                        MORRIE
          You like to make book on it?

                        SOLLY
                 (joking)
          You giving odds?

                           MORRIE
          You name them.

Solly gives him a long look.

                        SOLLY
          You both meshugah.

Solly walks away.

56   INT. GYM - RING                                           56

     PK is in the ring getting ready to spar with a well-built
     opponent. Morrie stands at ringside with Solly.
                             SOLLY
               Let's just start out nice and
               easy now.

     He hits the bell. The fighters circle. PK's opponent
     starts punching, jabbing, probing. After two feints he
     comes after PK in earnest. PK steps left and peppers
     him with three quick blows to the face. Solly's interest
     is suddenly piqued. Again the fighters circle. Again
     the opponent sets up with jabs and again he attacks.
     This time PK dodges, hits him hard and spins him around,
     hitting him twice more. A smile appears on Solly's face.
     The opponent, angered now, gets more aggressive. PK
     keeps bobbing and weaving, sticking and slipping punches.
     The opponent unloads, banging away at PK with everything
     he has. PK backs up two steps, then shifts positions.
     The opponent's momentum carries him into the ropes. As
     he comes off the ropes PK throws him an eight-punch
     combination, demolishing his opponent. PK steps back.
     The opponent sags. Solly hits the bell, clearly excited.

                             SOLLY
               Never I seen someone so young
               throw an eight-punch combination.
               Where did you learn such a thing?

                             PK
               In prison, sir.

                             SOLLY
               You trying to be a comedian and a
               boxer? Mr. Manager, come to my
               office. We'll talk terms. You,
               get showered, and see me after.
               We'll talk training.
     Solly and Morrie head off toward Solly's office. PK
     watches them go, a small victorious smile on his face.

     marched by, guarded closely. At PK's feet is the metal
     bucket.  The door to Kommandant Von Zyl's office opens.
     A guard summons PK. PK rises, takes his bucket and
     enters the office.

                                                    CUT TO:

     The KOMMANDANT, a brusque man with a salt-and-pepper
     brush cut sits behind his big desk.

                                VON ZYL (KOMMANDANT)
               So you are PK.

                                PK
               Yes, sir.

                             VON ZYL
               I am Kommandant Von Zyl. The
               professor has requested you to be
               his visitor so you can continue
               your studies on piano and he can
               continue with his studies on
               cactus. This is the first
               specimen?

     He alludes to the bucket.
                              PK
               Yes, sir.   Kalanchoe Thrysiflora.
     He holds the bucket up.

61   BACK TO SCENE                                             61

                             VON ZYL
               The professor taught you this,
               ja? Of course to your English
               town he is a prisoner, a criminal.
               To us who respect such learning
               and culture, he is an honored
               guest.

                                                              44.

     He hands PK a pass.

                             VON ZYL
               This pass is good for any time,
               any day. Would you like to see
               him now?

                              PK
               Yes, sir.
                              VON ZYL
               Come.   I will take you myself.
     Von Zyl rises and opens the door for PK.    They exit.

62   INT. PRISON CORRIDOR                                      62

     PK and Von Zyl walk together.

                             VON ZYL
               We have cleared a little plot
               behind the cellblock for the
               cactus. And tomorrow we have
               the professor's piano moved here.
               There is not another instrument
               like it in the territory. Maybe
               one day the two of you can give
               a concert for us, hey?

                              PK
               Yes, sir.

     Just then the sound of GRUNTING and THWACKING fills the
     air. PK passes a room set up as a boxing gym. Through
     a crack in the door he sees a dozen boys being coached
     by some guards. Some guards are also being coached by
     a second man. A third man, LIEUTENANT SMIT, oversees
     the whole training session. PK watches, mesmerized.

                             VON ZYL
               You like to box?

                             PK
               I would like to learn, meneer.
               Are the boys prisoners?

                             VON ZYL
                      (laughs)
               No, no. The sons of the guards.
               See that one there?

                       little pudge boy
                       flailing away)
               That's my son, Danie. It's a
               club. Lieutenant Smit.

     Smit comes over.

                              SMIT
               Sir?

                             VON ZYL
               We have room for one more on the
               squad?
     Smit looks down at PK.

                             SMIT
               He's a little small, Kommandant.
                             VON ZYL
               We'll build him up then.

                              SMIT
               Yes, sir.   But I really don't
               have anyone  to spare to teach him
               right now.   You know, with the
               tournament  coming up.

                             VON ZYL
               There must be someone.

     Smit looks around the hall.

     A crumpled, old BLACK MAN, a lifer with broken, bandied
     legs and a fighter's flattened face, wiping the floor,
     picking up used towels.

               Piet.

     GEEL PIET comes shuffling over, properly submissive.

                              GEEL PIET (BLACK MAN)
               Yes, sir.

                             SMIT
               You teach this boy basics, and
               you teach him good or I knock
               your black head flat, you hear?

                                                          46.

                        GEEL PIET
          I teach him best I know, baas.

                        SMIT
          We train every day. First thing
          in the morning. Miss two
          trainings, you're gone.

                           PK
          Yes, meneer.

                           SMIT
          Come tomorrow.     See this old
          kaffir.

                           PK
          Yes, meneer.     Thank you, meneer.
                        VON ZYL
          Lieutenant, a word?

The two men step off to the side.
                        GEEL PIET
          Don't worry, little baas. Little
          can beat big any day. First with
          the head, then with the heart.
          Little defeat big when little is
          smart. You can remember that?

                           PK
          Yes, sir.
                        GEEL PIET
          No, no. Don't never call me sir.
          'Specially in front of the guards.

                        PK
          What should I call you?

                         GEEL PIET
          Piet.   Geel Piet.

          Kaffir.   Towels.
Geel Piet assumes his submissive posture again.

                          GEEL PIET
          Okay, baas.    Coming, baas.
He winks at PK and shuffles off.     A BELL SOUNDS.

65   EXT. CARNIVAL                                             65

     A bell at the top of a strongman's game sounds. A big
     Boer farmer, mallet in hand, roars in triumph, swinging
     the mallet again and ringing the bell again.


66   ANGLE ON PK AND MARIA                                     66
     walking through the carnival, munching popcorn.

                             MARIA
               You took a big chance talking to
               my father the way you did.

                             PK
               Not really. Going in I was behind
               on points with him. I'm English.
               I attend a politically suspect
               school. I'm a boxer.

                             MARIA
               He likes boxers.

                             PK
               All men like boxers. But not for
               their daughters. So I had to find
               some way to make an impression.

     They get on line for the Ferris wheel.

                             MARIA
               You could have picked a more
               agreeable topic.
                             PK
               And made much less of an
               impression. Talk to someone
               about their passion. Even if they
               disagree they'll remember you.
               It was really the most logical
               strategy if you think about it.

                             MARIA
               Do you spend hours thinking
               about how to deal with me, too?

                             PK
               Days.
                             MARIA
               Know what I think?
                      (beat)

                                                               48.
          You're dangerous.

Their turn comes to mount the Ferris wheel.         They get
into the seat and strap in.

                        MARIA
          When I was little we would go to
          my grandfather's farm in the high
          veldt for holiday.

The Ferris wheel starts to go up.

                        MARIA
          My father would take    me   to the top
          of the highest hill    and   we'd play
          this game, 'What Do    You   See' until
          we ran out of things    to   see. Do
          you ever play that?
                         PK
          No.

                         MARIA
          Want to try?

                         PK
          Sure.

The Ferris wheel stops to let more people on.        Johannesburg
glitters beyond.

                        MARIA
          I see a forest. It goes      on
          forever. There are giant      trees
          which keep getting bigger     and
          bigger over thousands of     years.
          Now you.

The wheel begins to move a little higher and then stops.

                        PK
          I see little trees growing on the
          forest floor, learning to grow
          with the little bit of light the
          big trees let in. Now you.

                        MARIA
          I see the big trees getting bigger,
          their leaves and branches making
          one great green umbrella over all
          of Africa.
The wheel stops again at its highest point.

                         PK

                                                              49.
               I see the sun growing weaker,
               giving off less light. I see the
               big trees dying because they
               cannot live without a lot of
               light. I see the little trees
               take over the forest because they
               learn to adapt.

                             MARIA
               You tell a very good story.
     Her eyes sparkle, making her irresistible. PK leans
     forward. Maria turns her face towards him. Her lips
     part slightly. They kiss tenderly.

     The CAMERA RISES FROM them TO the star-littered sky
     twinkling above. The sky goes from black to grey as
     the CAMERA PANS DOWN.

     Geel Piet is punching at PK, slowly, with a large pair
     of gloves. The seven-year-old bobs and weaves quite
     expertly. Geel Piet stops, winded.

                             GEEL PIET
               You wear out this old man. See?
               See how it can work? How little

               Yes, sir.     But when do I get to

                             GEEL PIET
               You not going to just punch, man.
               You going to combination.

     He demonstrates.

PK does his best to mimic.

                            GEEL PIET
          Oh do we have     a boxer here. Yes
          sir. We build      you to eight-punch
          combination.      The Geel Piet eight.
          Then you catch     afire. One-two.

Doc sets up and swings left, then right.     PK avoids
both swings.

Geel Piet fidgets.   He drops his head, speaking low.

                        GEEL PIET
          If you leave the pail when you go
          plant is a problem, small baas?

                        PK
          I don't understand.

          Is like this. You see how hard
          the life is for the people here in
          prison. Only little pleasure they
          take from this hard life maybe
          sometimes when no one watching
          late at night -- a little smoke.
          Now with the big war in Europe
          tobacco is plenty hard to get
          outside. Inside it is gone.
          We are the forgotten in here.

          We have bunches of leaves at home.

          No, no.   Mustn't do that, little

          What Geel Piet means is it can be
          dangerous. Something the guards
          might not want the people to have.

                        PK
          What's wrong with tobacco? Why
          wouldn't they want them to have it?

                        DOC
          What's wrong is people whose job
          it is to punish. After a little
          while it is all they know how to
          do.

          What should I do?

          This is for you to answer.

The sound of a TRUNCHEON on METAL turns them to the door
where SERGEANT BORMANN, a side of beef with a sadist's
eyes, stands, truncheon in hand. He enters the room and
circles the trio.

                        BORMANN
          I smell something not right here,
          ay, kaffir?
He pokes Geel Piet with his truncheon.

                        GEEL PIET
                 (submissive)
          No, meneer sergeant. Everything
          okay here.

Bormann swings his truncheon into the back of Geel Piet's
knees, buckling the little man to the floor.
                        BORMANN
          I don't fuckin' believe you.

He glares at Doc and PK.
                        BORMANN
          If you're up to something I'll
          find out.

                                                                53.

     Bormann, still eying them suspiciously, exits.     Doc and
     PK help Geel Piet up.

               No, no.  This old kaffir's okay.
               Sorry to make any trouble, little
               baas. We  just stick to the boxing
               now on.  Sorry, sorry.

     Geel Piet goes hobbling off, picking up towels.     Doc
     and PK go to exit. At the door PK turns.

                              PK

     Geel Piet turns.

     Geel Piet breaks out a smile he usually keeps to himself
     and exits. PK looks up at Doc who tossles his hair
     approvingly.

     PK in the ring is about to start sparring.    Solly gives
     him instruction as Morrie stands by.

                             SOLLY
               Now at the end of the Geel Piet
               eight you do this... one-two...
                      (he punches
                       the air)
               One-two-three... the Solly Goldman
               thirteen. Okay?

     PK nods. Solly hits the BELL.   The sparring begins.      PK
     works his way in.

                                                              54.

                            SOLLY
               That's it. That's it. Move him
               around. Jab jab. Slip slip.
               Now.
     PK pours it on, laying in the Geel Piet eight.   Solly is
     silently counting.

                             SOLLY
               And... one-two... one-two-three.

     PK fires the last three punches like lightning and backs
     up.

                             SOLLY
               That's it. That's it. Now work
               around the defense. Jab jab.
     The opponent becomes aggressive.   PK starts dancing,
     slipping punches.

                             MORRIE
               How do you get away with this,
               Mr. G? Why don't they close you
               down? I mean, there are laws about
               blacks and white boxing each other.

                             SOLLY
               In a public match. Not in a gym.
               Not yet anyway. The Boer is a
               funny people. Outside the ring
               the black is not equal. Inside he
               is. But only in private, not in
               public. So I keep my mouth shut,
               the police go a little blind, and
               that's that. It's a crazy world,
               huh?

     A WHISTLE from across the gym draws Solly's attention.
     He and Morrie turn to his office where his assistant
     stands with the tall black man from the Schoolboy
     Championships. Solly's face takes on a serious ex-
     pression. He rings the bell. He turns to Morrie.

                             SOLLY
               Work him on the heavy bag.

     Solly heads for his office.

     PK stops, relaxing. Morrie throws a towel over his
     shoulders. One of Solly's ASSISTANTS comes over.

         The man who promotes all the

         Nguni.

         And you trust him?

                       SOLLY
         In thirty years I know him,
         number one on the list.

                       MORRIE
         You're both out of your minds.

                       PK
         Did he tell you why he wants the
         match?
                       SOLLY
         I told you what he told me.

                       PK
         Just talking boxing -- how do I
         match up with Mandoma?

                          SOLLY
         Pretty even.
                          MORRIE
         I mean besides    getting thrown out
         of school and    into jail, do you
         know what else    happens you do
         this? He's a     pro. The minute
         you fight him    you're a pro.

                       SOLLY
         There's no purse being offered.

                       MORRIE
         That's a good career move. Risk
         everything to gain nothing. Very
         sound business sense.

                       PK
         Tell Mr. Nguni I'll think about
         it.

PK exits with Morrie steaming behind. They head for
the locker room, PK clearly perturbed.

          Right.

                Man like that should be running

               You have heard my request?

               That the Onoshobishobi Ingelosi

               not. The legend of Onoshobishobi
               Ingelosi is very powerful among
               the people. They see you box the
               Boer and always you win. They
               have heard the stories from
               Barberton. The people live with
               little hope. They must see if the

POLICE exit, threatening.

The Police laugh. Police #2, satisfied Nguni's papers

78   INT. OXFORD BOARD OF EXAMINERS ROOM - DAY                 78

     The Oxford Board of EXAMINERS, eminent academics all, sit
     four across at a lecture table, looking absolutely musty
     with learning. Across from them PK sits, a folder in his
     lap. One man, PROFESSOR LEWIS, peruses the file in front
     of him.

                            LEWIS
              According to your submission you
              have ambitions to be a writer and
              the welterweight boxing champion of
              the world.

     Lewis reads the last sentence with a tinge of amusement
     in his voice.
                               PK
              Yes, sir.

              Don't you   find seeking a career as
              a pugilist   and reading for a
              degree at   Oxford a bit, how shall

          Lord Byron was a boxer, sir. And
          I've never heard anyone question
          his intellectual integrity.

One of the other Examiners coughs theatrically to hide
his smile. Lewis looks down the table at the man.

                        LEWIS
          I do not recall Lord Byron
          actually engaging in matches for
          money.

                        PK
          Actually, sir, there are several
          recorded instances of Lord Byron
          engaging in matches for quite
          large sums of money.

                        EXAMINER #2
          Quite right. Yes. In   a letter to
          his wife Shelley makes mention of
          just such a thing. For  hundreds
          of pounds, actually.

Lewis has heard enough.
                        LEWIS
          Let's move along, shall we? As
          your presentational you've
          requested to read from a work of
          your own fiction.

                          PK
          Yes, sir.

                         LEWIS
          Well, then, let us hope we'll be
          treated to the stirrings of
          another Byron.

His sarcasm is not lost on PK.   PK ignores it, opens his
folder, and begins to read.

          the Death of Geel Piet.

          His name was Geel Piet -- yellow
          Peter. He was a mix of half the
          blood in Africa -- Dutch,
          Portuguese, Zulu, Sotha, and who
          knew what else. His father

               born. His stepfather threw him

               Capetown when he was nine.

               the art of camouflage, a master of
               the invisible. In this he strove
               to be perfect, and in the end it
               was his quest for perfection that
               provoked anger from above and
               killed him.

         He's right. Wunderbar.    You are
         the smartest of us all.
Geel Piet smiles as he lifts the watering pot to exit.   A
truncheon stops him. All turn to Sergeant Bormann.

         A kaffir smarter than all of us?
         You are a strange German,

He takes Geel Piet's hand.

                        BORMANN
          You are going to stay with me.

He forces Geel Piet's hand closer and closer to a cactus
with long thorns.

                        BORMANN
          And I will find out all your
          secrets once your friends are
          gone. One slip...

He pushes Geel Piet's hands onto the cactus needle.        Geel
Piet does not cry out.
                          BORMANN
          I have you.

He lets go of Geel Piet's hand.     Geel Piet removes it
from the cactus, bloodied.

                        BORMANN
          Get out of here.

Geel Piet takes his watering can and goes.

          You see, Professor, they are not
          like us. A white man would scream
          bloody murder.

Doc and PK glare at Bormann.    He smirks and walks away.

PK and Geel Piet appear before various tribal leaders,
talking, agreeing, shaking hands.

          Having obtained the cooperation of

     PK and Doc instruct. Doc plays the piano. PK leads the

                 My boxing instruction accelerated
                 as well. It was as if Geel Piet
                 was trying to give me every bit
                 of boxing knowledge he had before
                 we parted. And always from the
                 corners and shadows Bormann
                 watched and waited.
     Bormann watches PK and Geel Piet from the door of his

               more.

     The group disperses. PK beckons the photographer to
     wait. He grabs Geel Piet and forces him to stand,
     much to the little man's protestations, for a photo
     of the two of them. As the picture is taken Geel
     Piet has the widest smile imaginable.


86   INT. PRISON YARD - NIGHT                              86
     The guards, all in crisp uniforms, patrol nervously,
     truncheons at the ready. The towers bristle with guns
     as hundreds of black prisoners file into the yard.

                             PK (V.O.)
               Finally the night of the concert
               arrived. The prison atmosphere,
               normally tense, was keening.
               Each prisoner entering the yard
               is searched. It was prison policy
               to keep tribal rivalries boiling.
               Divide and conquer. The policy
               of control.

                             PK (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               This was to be the first time
               in the history of the South
               African prison system that the
               tribes were allowed to mingle.
               And if trouble came, it would be
               the last.

     All the prisoners are seated on the ground behind Doc,
     who is raised with the piano on a small stage. Guards
     surround the prisoners -- a solid, edgy border encasing
     a black center. The front of the yard is filled with
     seats on which sit the Kommandant, his wife, assorted
     prison brass, politicians, and a smattering of the local
     Afrikaan Hierarchy. PK is overseeing the seating of the
     prisoners when Doc comes up to him.

               Professor?

     He turns the stage over to the professor and takes his
     seat. The professor sits at his stool, poised. PK, in
     front of the singers, watches him for a cue. Doc drops
     his head. PK points to a group of singers. MUSIC and
     VOICE blend spontaneously. "The Concerto for the Great
     Southland" begins.

     Doc plays magnificently with great style. PK focuses on
     leading the singers. Each section, each tribe singing
     its own songs with its own distinct cultural imprints on
     rhythm, pace and tone.

     regains his concentration.

     Instinctively the first four prisoners in each group,
     the leaders, stand and turn to face their people. They
     take up the lead. PK, distracted by his inner vision,
     runs off stage. Doc looks after him, worried, but keeps
     playing.

     one. PK runs through the corridors. He runs through the

     chasing after him.

     room when he hears a THUD, and another.

     light over the ring comes on, illuminating Bormann,
     truncheon raised over the lifeless, broken body of Geel
     Piet.

               No!

     Startled, Bormann jumps out of the ring and runs off. PK
     scrambles into the ring and cradles the lifeless, blood-
     ied head in his lap, and begins to sob.

     PAN DOWN along Geel Piet's arm to his bloodied hand,
     holding the snapshot of him and PK.
     The Concerto grows LOUDER around PK until it enfolds him

               into the little man's body until

      A police car patrols the edge of the vast, dark, ram-
      shackle township, its cruiser light scanning the openings
      to the dark rutted alleys. It passes and disappears down
      the road. A moment later an African steps out of the
      shadows and whistles a signal.

      in the shadows, Nguni hears the whistle. He looks at his
      watch and up the road, tense, as another set of head-
      lights appears. Nguni steps back into the shadows.

      Solly strains to see out his dirty windshield with the
      headlights as his car bumps along the unpaved road.

                               SOLLY
                 The night I escaped from the
                 Tsar's Army it was just like
                 this. Six of us -- four Jews,
                 two Ukranians. Dark as anything.
                 No streets. In the day we hid in
                 bushes. At night we went.
                                 MORRIE
                 You deserted?
                               SOLLY
                 Whey they come take you   at
                 thirteen years old and   tell you
                 it's twenty-five years   in the
                 Army, it's your duty to   desert.

      Nguni steps out right into the path of the headlights.
      Solly hits the brake hard, throwing everyone forward.

                               SOLLY
                 You said the end of the road.

                                 NGUNI
                 Yes, yes.    Sorry. I drive.
      He opens Solly's door with some urgency.       Nguni sees
      Maria.

                               NGUNI
                        (smiling)
                 Welcome, miss, welcome.

                                 MARIA
                 Thank you.

      Nguni turns into the township and is swallowed by the
      dark.

      The car bounces along the rutted darkened streets of the
      township. The glow of smoldering cooking fires through
      open doorways offers minimal illumination to the squalid
      lives within. Maria peers out at a world she has never
      seen. As the car drives, women and children gather along
      the road peering in. Mothers point to PK, instructing
      their children.

                                                                   78.

                The people have come from
                everywhere to see you.

      Maria takes PK's hand, a little nervous.      PK smiles at
      her confidently.

                              MORRIE
                Where are the men?

                              NGUNI
                They are to be witness.

      The muffled sounds of VOICES SINGING reaches them, grow-
      ing louder as they approach. Maria is tense. Nguni
      senses this. He turns to her.

                              NGUNI
                No worry, miss. It is the sound
                of happiness.
      He stops the car at a door in a high wooden wall guarded
      by two big men.

                                 NGUNI
                We are here.

      Everyone gets out of the car and passes through the door
      which shuts behind them.

      Nguni leads everyone down the hallway. PK is dressed to
      fight, hands taped, robe thrown over his shoulders.

                              MORRIE
                I don't see why we have to weigh
                in. They're going to fight
                anyway.

                              NGUNI
                It is very important the people
                see everything is correct.

      They come to    an arch which leads into a big empty room.
      In the center    of the room stands a scale and a dozen
      Africans, all    dressed in worn but neatly pressed suits.
      Mandoma, the    other man who attended PK's fight at school,
      clad only in    boxing gear, waits on PK.

                                                               79.

                                 MANDOMA
                I see you, PK.

                              PK
                I just want you to know you fight
                a man. Onoshobishobi Ingelosi is
                just a name I was given at
                Barberton Prison. It means
                nothing.

                               MANDOMA
                It is not for you or me to say
                what it means.
      An old man, one of the dignitaries says something to
      Nguni.

                                 NGUNI
                Please.

      He motions for PK to step on the scale. PK does. The
      weight is duly noted. Mandoma then does the same. The
      twelve men are satisfied. They head for the exit.
                                 NGUNI
                It is time.

      He motions for the others to follow. PK goes to walk
      with Maria. Nguni pairs him with Mandoma. They exit the
      room.

      The party walks towards a big double door behind which a
      single VOICE PREACHING can be vaguely heard. Nguni
      knocks on the door.

104   EXT. SOCCER FIELD                                      104

      The doors open to an entire soccer field jammed with
      humanity. A boxing ring is raised in the center. The
      only lights in the area directly over it. With the
      twelve witnesses in the lead, the party makes its way
      through a path in the crowd. An OLD WOMAN with a fly
      switch, not unlike Inkosikazi's, speaks from the ring.
      As PK passes the whispers start.

                                 WHISPERS
                Onoshobishobi.

                                                         80.

The Woman in the ring begins to chant.   The crowd picks
it up.

                        CROWD
          Onoshobishopi Ingelosi.
          Shobi shobi Ingelosi.

PK looks back at Maria who is a bit unnerved, as are
Morrie and Solly. He looks across at Mandoma whose face
is a mask looking straight ahead, betraying nothing. The
two men climb into the ring and stand in their corners.
The Old Woman shuffles over and peers into PK's face.
She mutters something inaudible, then turns to the crowd.

                        OLD WOMAN
          Onoshobishobi Ingelosi.

The crowd picks up the chant. She waves and the crowd
goes silent. Somewhere in the darkness a single voice
begins to sing "Nkosi Sikelel I Afrika" -- the African
national anthem.

The crowd picks it up. PK looks down to the front row
where Nguni sits courteously attending to Maria in a seat
of honor among the twelve men in suits.

The African national anthem finishes. The BELL RINGS
three times. The Old Woman is led from the ring. An
Indian Referee in all white enters the ring and waves
the two fighters forward.

                        REFEREE
          You are listening to me please.
          When I am shouting break, you must
          break at once. When a knockdown
          is coming, it is for an eight
          count. No heads, no elbows. You
          fight clean or by golly I am
          giving you penalty points. Good
          luck, boys.
PK and Mandoma touch gloves and go to their respective
corners.

                        PK
          What do you see?

Solly watches Mandoma dancing across the ring.

                        SOLLY
          A very tough fight.

The BELL RINGS.

                       SOLLY
         Watch the left hook.

Mandoma comes charging across the ring and begins to fire
everything in his arsenal at PK, overwhelming him. PK
cannot get away from him and takes a series of devastat-
ing combinations which end in a left hook to PK's jaw.
PK drops like lead. The Referee starts counting. PK
shakes his head clear and rises at eight. The Referee
checks his gloves. There is a cut under his right eye.
                        REFEREE
         Continue.
Again, Mandoma comes charging hard. PK defends himself
as best he can, trying to counter. But Mandoma's offense
won't allow it. He beats on PK until the round ends. PK
sits down in his corner. Morrie works on his eye.
                       PK
         God, he hits like a truck.

                       SOLLY
         He's going for the quick knockout.
         He can't keep it up. Soon the
         truck runs out of gas.

                       PK
         If he catches me again like that
         I'll run out of gas --
         permanently.

The BELL SOUNDS. PK is hardly off his stool when Mandoma
is on him, pummeling him. PK backpedals, bobs and
weaves. Mandoma's punches come fast and furious, each
one looking to end the fight. Mandoma gets PK against
the ropes and bangs away. PK covers up. Mandoma
punishes his arms and kidneys. PK swings back and es-
capes. Mandoma pursues him. He catches PK with a body
chop and then a chopping left. PK goes down again. The
Referee starts to count. The crowd is completely silent.
The BELL RINGS. PK returns to his corner, shaking his
head, trying to clear it. He flops onto his stool.

                       SOLLY
         He's had it. He's got no strength
         in his punch.

                       PK
         Could've fooled me.

                       SOLLY
         I'm telling you.

                        PK

      deeply from his water flask.

      He pokes PK's belly.

                  You put your punches there, you
                  win. You don't, you lose.

      The BELL RINGS. Mandoma comes charging out. PK goes on
      defense. He hits Mandoma hard to the head. Mandoma
      whips around and hits him hard. PK spins and hits the
      canvas. His vision blurs, doubles. The SOUND of a
      WATERFALL fills his head.

      Mandoma rushes in for the kill. PK feints and comes up
      under one of Mandoma's punches, burying a body shot into
      his gut. Mandoma grunts and backs up. PK pursues him.
      Mandoma tries to recover. He throws another big punch.
      PK ducks under it and puts two more hooks into Mandoma's
      stomach. Mandoma starts to back up for the first time
      in the fight. PK boxes, jabbing, feinting, pushing Man-
      doma around the ring, taking control. Mandoma, heading
      for exhaustion, throws another big punch in desperation.
      PK hits him with three punches in return. Mandoma swings
      again with a last desperate effort, and PK buries the
      Solly Goldman thirteen into every part of his body. PK
      steps back and with his last punch, puts Mandoma down.
      The crowd goes silent. The Referee counts Mandoma out.
      He raises PK's hand. Still, the crowd is silent.

      He and Solly look around at       the somber black faces flick-
      ering in the shadows of the       ring light. PK looks  down at
      Mandoma in silence. Mandoma        rises unsteadily. He  stands
      in front of PK, staring into       his eyes, and then he raises
      PK's arm above his head.

      Maria touches his face.   Her eyes soften.

                              MARIA
                I think I love you.

      PK swallows hard.   They kiss and embrace.     PK caresses
      her face.

                              PK
                I would be honored to be your
                escort.

      Maria beams.
                              MARIA
                I didn't doubt it for a minute.

      Solly HONKS the HORN.
      PK kisses Maria once more.

                              PK
                I'll give you a boost.
      PK stirrups his hands. Maria boosts up to the first
      branch of the tree. She crests the wall.

                              MARIA
                Thank you for tonight.    You were
                great.

      She smiles and drops down behind the wall.     PK runs back

                 When you and your manager first
                 came to me with that meshuganah
                 idea to be welterweight champion
                 of the world you did not have a
                 big believer here. But I gotta
                 tell you. Now you do. In London
                 lives Benny Rosen, the greatest
                 trainer in the world today. When
                 you go to your Oxford I give you
                 a letter to Rosen. Whatever I
                 can't do for you, he can.

      As PK and Morrie jog toward their dorm a VOICE stops
      them from behind.

                 Gentlemen.

      PK and Morrie stop cold.      They turn to St. John, up early

                You're up early, sir.

                              ST. JOHN
                Best time for walking.

                              PK
                Best time for running too, sir.
                              MORRIE
                Have to put in the roadwork, sir.
                You know, keep those legs strong.

      St. John eyes the bruise on PK's cheek.

                               ST. JOHN
                Yes.   Quite a fresh bruise there.

                               PK
                I tripped.

                              ST. JOHN
                Maybe you should change your
                footwear.

      He looks down at their shoes. Both boys are wearing pro-
      per shoes; not at all what would be worn for roadwork.

                              ST. JOHN

                Yes, sir.

      St. John fixes them with a look, and then walks off.     The
      boys bolt into the dorm.

      PK and Morrie open the door and stop cold. Gideon
      Mandoma sits in a chair facing the door. He rises.

                a thief by the window.

                        PK
          You speak English?

PK is surprised.   Mandoma nods.
                        PK
          You are a great fighter, Gideon.

          Second greatest in this room.

                        PK
          But you didn't come to talk about
          fighting.

Mandoma shakes his head.   He waits for a moment, then
begins.
                        MANDOMA
          When you say to me, Onoshobishobi
          Ingelosi means nothing, you are
          right. And you are wrong. The
          legend gives the people hope for
          a good tomorrow. But hope alone
          will not make a good tomorrow
          for the people. You cannot
          write our letters, get us clothes,
          food, work. These things we must
          do ourselves, so we can be part
          of this country's good tomorrow.
          If we are not, the hope will
          disappear. The people will grow
          tired. The tired will grow angry
          and there will be no good tomorrow
          for anybody -- black or white.
                        PK
          What are you asking from me?

                        MANDOMA
          To be part of something you must
          know what everyone else knows.
          We have our own knowledge. We
          need yours.

                        MORRIE
          We get our knowledge in schools,
          Gideon. We're not born with it.

                        MANDOMA
          Then it must be the same with us.

                        MORRIE
          You have schools.

PK starts to move horizontally across the cliff face like
a spider on a wall. Doc follows. The rain becomes
torrential.

PK turns to look back at Doc.

                I've found something.
      The rain is so heavy PK can barely make out Doc behind
      him. When he can, he sees the old man pause, breathing
      hard. PK makes his way back to Doc. Halfway there,
      Doc waves him forward and starts to move. PK reaches
      the small opening and slips in.

      PK stoops in the small cave, dripping wet. A moment
      later Doc's foot appears at the entrance. PK helps him
      in. Doc slumps down, exhausted.
                                PK
                You okay?

      Breathing too   hard to reply, Doc shakes his head in the
      affirmative.    PK looks out at the rain forming a sheer
      wall of water   outside. He turns to Doc, who is getting
      up, flashlight   in hand.

      it side to side.

      Doc crouches down and follows the beam of his flashlight
      to the rear of the cave where there is a small opening.
      He shines the light into it.

      Before PK can say anything else, Doc has wriggled through
      the small opening.

      PK, a bit peeved, takes his own flashlight and follows.

      tunnel on his stomach.

                without worrying about waking up
                as something's supper.
      Doc stops crawling.   So does PK.   A DRIPPING can be
      heard.
                              DOC
                You hear that? There is something

      Doc starts moving quicker.

                Let's hope it's not hungry.

      Doc squeezes out of the small space. PK joins him in a
      slightly larger tunnel, the same size as the first one
      -- stoop height.

                What's that?
      Doc recognizes the sound. He pounces on PK, knocking
      him to the floor and covering him with his body. Not
      a moment too soon. For a thousand bats fill the tunnel
      flying through.

      As they come to a tunnel opening: a large cave, perhaps
      200 feet wide by 100 feet high, filled with stalactites
      and stalagmites composed of pure, crystallized calcium
      carbonate.

      Toward one end of    the crystallized room eight stalagmites
      grown up from the    floor cement to form a huge crystal
      slab some ten feet    off the floor. A buttress of stalg-
      mites drip off it    forming a natural, if uneven, stairway.

      the cave among the stalactites. PK follows, soon losing
      sight of Doc behind the large crystal columns.

      PK pokes Morrie.

      quickly unlocks it. He walks away.

      PK and Morrie advance.    PK opens the gate.   As he does,

                                                                 101.
      Gideon Mandoma, followed by 15 men and 5 women, enters.

                              MANDOMA
                I see you, P.K.

                              PK
                I see you, Gideon.

                              MORRIE
                Let's get inside before the whole
                bloody world sees us.

                                MANDOMA
                Morrie.

      He clasps Morrie's hand, first in a traditional hand-
      shake, then in an African handshake. Mandoma smiles.

                              MANDOMA
                You some great friend.

      Morrie is taken by his sincerity.

                                PK
                Let's go.    Stay to the fence.

      The group moves out.

      The Africans are seated around desks, waiting for Morrie
      and PK to tell them what to do.

                              PK
                All right, class.     I know you
                don't understand a    word I'm
                saying, but part of    learning a
                language is hearing    it spoken.
                So -- I am P.K.

      He taps his chest.

                              PK
                P.K.  This...
                       (taps Morrie)
                ... is Morrie. Now you all have
                a chalkboard.

      He holds up the chalkboard.

                              PK
                Chalk and an eraser.      I will say

                the letter. You will say the
                letter. I will write the letter.
                You will write the letter.

                              PK (CONT'D)
                Morrie will check the letter.
                All right? Here we go. 'A'...
                       (in Zulu)
                ... say it. 'A.'

                                ALL
                'A.'

      The door to the library suddenly opens. Everyone
      freezes. Maria enters the room. PK is stunned.

                                PK
                Excuse me.
      PK hurries over to Maria. Not a word needs to be
      spoken. Her presence says everything.

                              MARIA
                I thought you might need some
                help. Or I can just sit and
                watch.

      PK hands her the chalk.
                              PK
                Class. This is Maria. She is
                now the teacher.
                       (to Maria)
                We're doing alphabet, from the
                letter 'A.'

      PK takes up his position with Morrie, ready to check the
      chalkboards. Maria takes the front of the class.

      She battles the butterflies in her stomach as she writes
      an "A" on the blackboard. She clears her throat.

                                MARIA
                'A.'

      No one says anything. Maria looks a little lost.

                                                               103.

                       (to Maria)
                Say it again.

                'A.'

      She writes it on the blackboard again.   PK and Morrie
      trade a look and a smile.

                                 MARIA
                'A.'     Write 'A.'

      She mimes to the chalkboards. All the Africans obey.
      PK looks up from checking the students. Maria's eyes
      are twinkling.

      receiving their heartfelt thanks one by one. Mandoma
      is the last to leave.

                              MANDOMA

                And you are one lucky English.
      He kids PK.   PK blushes.

                              PK
                Good night, Gideon.
      He playfully pushes Gideon out the gate and closes it.
      He turns to Maria and Morrie.

                                MORRIE
                Well, I   think I'll go... um...

                Nice to   see you, Maria.

                Good night, Morrie.

      Morrie runs off.
      PK takes Maria around.

                              PK
                I am one lucky English.
      They embrace and kiss.

                                 MARIA
                P.K.     Can I ask you a favor?

                                 PK
                Anything.
                              MARIA
                We don't have to go in    or anything.
                You can hear the music    from
                outside. I'd love to     have one
                dance with you before    I graduate.

                                 PK
                Done.

                              MARIA
                I feel so good. Race you to the

                You need a headstart?

PK is working on a speed bag. Morrie comes running in
with two open letters in hand.

                         MORRIE
          We made it!   We made it!

He thrusts one of the letters at PK.

          Sorry. I couldn't bear the
          suspense after I read mine.   I
          had to open it.
PK looks at his letter.

          Three months and we're out of

                        MORRIE
          What the hell are you talking

He snatches PK's letter.

          It says nothing about the
          scholarship.

          St. John wants to see you two in

          I'll get showered and changed.

                              PK
                Wanted to see us, sir?

                                  ST. JOHN
                Yes.   Come in.     Close the door.

      As the door closes, BRIGADIER JOHANNES BRETYN, a quiet
      but formidable man, comes into their line of vision.
      Trouble is in the air.
                              ST. JOHN
                This is Brigadier Bretyn from the
                police department.

      Bretyn just nods his head.

                              ST. JOHN
                He has come to deliver, in person,
                an order to close the Saturday
                school.

                                  PK
                Why?

                              BRETYN
                Because it is illegal.

                              MORRIE
                We're only teaching them how to
                read and do sums.

                              BRETYN
                You don't have certification to
                do that.

                              PK
                Prince of Wales is a certified
                school.

                               BRETYN
                Yes.   But not certified for that

                                                      107.
          sort of thing.

                        PK
          Can he do this, sir?

                        BRETYN
          Of course I can do it. Would I
          be here if I couldn't? Come now
          meneer headmaster. Let's end
          this now. I have a full day ahead
          of me still.

St. John meets Bretyn's steely eyes.   He cannot hold the
man's gaze.

                        ST. JOHN
                 (resigned)
          The Saturday school is to be
          disbanded until further notice.

                        BRETYN
          Thank you, meneer headmaster.
          Your cooperation in this matter
          is very appreciated. Good day.

Bretyn goes to exit.

                        PK
          You know it can't go on like this
          forever.

St. John tenses.

                           BRETYN
          What can't?

                        PK
          What you're doing.

                        BRETYN
          I'm just doing my job. And if
          you'll take some advice, you
          should just do yours.

Bretyn exits.

                        MORRIE
          Is that really the end of it, sir?

                        ST. JOHN
          For the moment I'm afraid it is.
                        PK
          If we let them get away with it

          change.   It'll just get worse.

                        ST. JOHN
          History disputes you.

                        PK
          History takes too long.

                        ST. JOHN
          Yes it does. But it is never
          kind to those who try to hurry it.

                        PK
          I feel we should resist, sir.

                         ST. JOHN
          So do I, P.K. But this is not a
          subtle government. They mean to
          have their way and damn the
          consequences. And I cannot
          jeopardize this school, no matter
          how I personally feel. I'm sorry.
                  (beat)
          I heard you were accepted at
          Oxford.

                         MORRIE
          Yes, sir.   Received notification
          today.

                        ST. JOHN
          Well, congratulations.

                        MORRIE
          Thank you, sir.

St. John looks at PK who remains silent.

                        ST. JOHN
          To both of you.

                         PK
                 (tight)
          Thank you, sir.

An uncomfortable silence lingers.
                        ST. JOHN
          We'll talk before you go.

                         PK
          Yes, sir.   Will that be all?

                        ST. JOHN
          That'll be all.

                                                                109.

      PK turns immediately and exits.     Morrie and St. John

                              PK
                I'd like to see Maria Marais
                please.

      The Guard checks his list.

                             GUARD
                Sorry. She's not allowed
                visitors.
                              PK
                Well, if I could just talk to her.

                               GUARD
                Sorry.

      PK backs away and moves off down the street.     He turns

                Morrie.   Morrie.

                               MORRIE

                              MORRIE
                What time is it?

      He looks at his watch and turns over.

                              MORRIE
                Can I see it later?

      He pulls Morrie out of bed.     Morrie groggily starts
      pulling his clothes on.

                              MORRIE
                You know, when we get to Oxford
                -- separate rooms.

                              MORRIE

      The campus is swaddled in early morning fog.

      PK and Morrie stand on the side of the school chapel
      while a black groundsman opens the door to the basement.

                              PK

      PK switches on a light switch to a cavernous space
      cluttered with old desks, blackboards and church pews.

                              PK
                This is a church. Didn't you
                ever hear of the Christian concept
                of sanctuary?

                has to respect it.

                              PK
                Even the Boer has limits, Morrie.

                              MORRIE
                I'm sure he does, but I'd still
                like to see a big bolt on the

      PK leans forward and kisses her, awkward, as if for the

PK writes on the blackboard the word "see."

He says the word in Zulu.

He moves his hands, eliciting response.

          I see.    You see. We see.

PK holds up a book with a picture of a boy.

          P.K., it's me.

Morrie pulls the bolt, opening and shutting the door
quickly.
PK and Maria look at each other.

                We see the girl.

      Maria smiles, surprised.

      The moment is shortlived as a SOUND from behind the
      pews in the rear of the room turns everyone.

      In the shadows, risen from behind the piles of furniture
      against the two opposite walls, stand 20 policemen with
      long menacing riot sticks.
      Bretyn steps into the light.

      Mandoma gives a command and the Africans form a phalanx
      around the women.
                                 BRETYN
                Once warned.     Twice punished.

                You're violating the sanctity
                of the church.

      by the door, slowly slipping the bolt lock, trying
      to remain innocuous while doing so.

      PK sees him and trades a look with Mandoma, who also
      sees what Morrie is doing.

                              PK
                At least let the women go.
                              BRETYN
                You want everything to be equal,
                little Boetie. Why not men and
                women too?
      Just then Morrie throws the bolt.

                                 MORRIE
                Now!
      He goes to charge out the door, but to his chagrin the
      door does not open, locked from the outside.

                 Locks keep people out but they
                 also keep them in.
      He has walked right up to Morrie, not taking his eyes
      off Morrie's for a moment. Morrie meets his gaze evenly.
      The moment is broken as Bretyn's baton slams into Morrie's

                 Get up, you bloody commie Jew!
      He bangs Morrie hard in the jaw, knocking him out cold.

                                  BRETYN
                 Captain.
      The two police lines start to move towards each other,
      sandwiching the Africans, PK and Maria.

      Mandoma gives an order. The blacks pick up anything
      they can to face the inevitable--stools, chairs, a
      flagpole.

                                  PK
                 No.    Wait.   We'll leave.
                              BRETYN
                 Too late. You never should have
                 come. At the ready.

      The two police lines tense to charge forward.

      The blacks brace to defend.
                                  PK
                 No!    Stop!

                                  BRETYN
                 Now.

      The police charge from both ends of the room, yelling,
      clubs held high.

      The Africans respond with their own war cry and engage
      the club-swinging police.

      A policeman swings at PK who ducks and buries a hook
      into the man's ribs followed by another to his jaw.
      The man goes down.


156   PK'S POV                                                  156

                                                              118.

      Morrie has risen to take a policeman out with a stool
      over his head.

      Two other police beat Morrie from behind.   He goes
      down once again under their brutal clubs.


157   BACK TO SCENE                                             157

      PK turns just as another club comes for his head. He
      slips past the blow and punches out his assailant with
      a lightning combination. As the man falls another
      cop charges from behind.

                              MARIA
                PK!

      PK turns off-balance. Maria leaps. The club cuts
      through the air. Maria is caught flush on the forehead
      as she comes between PK and the club. She falls to
      the floor dead. PK swings a stool with all his might,
      breaking the cop's face open.
                              PK
                Maria!

      PK drops to the fallen girl's side. He is frantic at
      the sight of her gaping bloody wound and the sight of
      her open blank eyes. The battle raging around him
      recedes before his pain and rising rage. All at once
      he explodes, screaming like a madman.

      He leaps at Bretyn and bangs one punch after another
      into the startled man. Bretyn's face is broken over and
      over against PK's fists. Still PK keeps pounding blow
      after blow into the fallen man.

      Three cops descend on PK and beat him mercilessly
      until he drops to the floor, unconscious.

      Mandoma is hit hard and goes down.

      The few Africans left fighting go down before the
      withering assault of clubs, fists, and boots.


158   EXT. CEMETERY - DAY                                       158

      Maria's funeral.

      Hundreds of Afrikaaners are gathered.

      Daniel Marais and his wife stand by the open grave,
      grieving, as the minister reads the final prayers.

                                                              119.

      The coffin is lowered.

      Daniel Marais steps forward and shovels the first dirt
      down after it. As Marais looks up he sees PK standing
      behind the mourners, 20 yards off. His anger replaces
      grief.

      Marais advances towards PK, clutching the shovel as a
      weapon. Several MEN restrain him.
                                 MEN
                Daniel.    No.
      Marais glares at PK.

      All of a sudden a thousand African voices cut through
      the air, SINGING songs of mourning.

      Thousands of Africans and a smattering of whites have
      gathered outside the cemetery. The singing rises from
      them.

      Gideon, Morrie, St. John and Solly stand in front of
      the crowd.

      PK stands his ground.

      Marais turns away, back to his daughter's grave.

      PK stands, tears streaming down his cheeks, as the
      SINGING ENGULFS the SCENE.


161   INT. PK'S ROOM - DAY                                      161

      PK sits at his desk filling out application forms.

      Morrie enters.   He picks one up off the desk and looks
      at it.

                                 MORRIE

                                                             120.
                       (surprised)
                You're applying to South African
                universities?

                              PK
                In case the scholarship doesn't
                come through.

                              MORRIE
                Why are you so bloody stubborn?
                You don't belong in a South
                African university any more than
                I belong in the priesthood.
                Will you take my father's loan?

      PK takes the applications back just as a TELEGRAPH
      DELIVERY BOY comes to the door.

                              BOY
                There a Mr. P.K. here?

                              MORRIE
                It's your scholarship.
      Morrie grabs the telegram.

                               BOY
                Sign here.   Odd name -- P.K.
                              MORRIE
                What's your name?

                                 BOY
                Waldo.

                              MORRIE
                You're not one to talk about
                names.

      Morrie scribbles his signature and proceeds to open
      the telegram.
      PK snatches it away from him. He pulls the telegram
      out. His face falls to worry.

                                 MORRIE
                What's it say?

                                 PK
                Doc's missing.

      PK walks through the small house followed by Commandant
      Von Zyl. Nothing is out of place.

                              VON ZYL
                Since his pneumonia last year
                I've had one of the men drop
                by once a week to see if he
                needed anything. Of course
                you know the professor. He
                never did.
      PK looks out at the cactus garden, watered now by drip
      irrigation.
                              VON ZYL
                At the beginning of the week he
                wasn't home so I decided to drop
                by myself. Waited a whole day
                here. When he didn't come back
                I sent search parties. After
                three days I sent the telegram.
                Seven days is a long time for
                him to be gone. Do you have
                any ideas where he went?

      PK looks at the pegs where the rucksacks hang.    There
      is only one hanging.

      PK hikes along, watching the trail. His eyes spot
      something. He kneels over the remains of a small
      campsite. PK touches the ashes. His eyes rise to the
      escarpment soaring above the jungle floor.

      PK stands at the bottom of the crystal slab almost
      dreading what he will find. He resolutely climbs the
      stalagmites to reach the top. PK's eye level shifts
      from below the slab to even with it, then to above it.
      As his sight rises Doc's corpse comes INTO VIEW --

                                                               122.

      PK picks it up and opens it. Inside is a letter.    PK
      unfolds it, and with trembling hands reads:

                              DOC (V.O.)
                So Mr. Schmartypants. It did not
                take you so long to figure out
                what happened. I hope you
                forgive me for not saying goodbye,
                but I did not think it would be
                necessary between us. What could
                I say you don't already know.
                              (MORE)

                               DOC (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                That I love you with all my heart?
                That you have given me more in our
                ten years of friendship than three
                lifetimes could fill? That the
                last thoughts I have before
                becoming something else will be
                of music, cactus, and you? You
                know all this.

      PK turns the sheet to page two which is a whole side of
      music.

                              DOC (V.O.)
                Last night this music came into
                my head. It is my music for
                Africa. My music for you. So
                go. Be welterweight champion of
                the world. Be a writer. A great

          Their reason is that I'm here
          illegal. I didn't enter the
          country with a passport. Like
          the Czar was issuing passports
          to Russian Jews in 1910.
                        PK
          This is because of me, isn't it?

          No, boychick. This is because
          of them. They are the problem,
          not you. Don't ever think
          different. You look tired.

Solly opens his arms.   PK hugs him.

          You got your head screwed on
          right. Don't let these
          meshuganahs screw it on wrong.
          Now go on. You want to find

                You're a very good writer. The

                inflammatory but the style is

                I came to inform you that you
                will not be receiving aid from
                the National Scholarship Fund.
                Neither will you be admitted to
                any of the South African
                universities. Here are your
                applications back.

      He hands PK the applications as he rises.

                              MARAIS
                I told you when you came to my
                house. I am first a member of
                my tribe and I will defend it
                any way I know how.

      He and PK glare at each other, implacable enemies.
      Marais exits.

      PK looks out his window, thinking.

      PK turns.

                                MORRIE
                  Take the hint. Screw the
                  scholarship. Come on. Let's
                  leave.

                                PK
                  If I leave or if I stay in South
                  Africa it's because I choose to,
                  not because they choose for me.

      He takes a small handbag, throws a few books into it
      and Doc's picture. He picks up his notebook and
      packs that too. He goes to exit.
                                MORRIE
                  Where are you going?

      PK exits the room.

      Morrie chases after him.
                                MORRIE
                  P.K., goddammit!

      He grabs PK, stopping him.

      Morrie's grip releases.

      PK walks out.

      Hundreds upon hundreds of black laborers and white
      mine workers descend into the mines. A milling mass of
      disenfranchised humanity come to work the underground
      hell of the copper mines.

      PK exits the management shack and walks through the
      crowd.

                                   PK (V.O.)
                  Dear Morrie.     Here is how it works.

                The copper of the mines in
                Northern Rhodesia is mined below
                ground. All day a behemoth of a
                man, a diamond driller, works a
                stope which is like the top of a
                funnel.

                the stope to get to the haulage
                below is to pass through the spout
                of a funnel and out the steel

                down.

                              PK (V.O.)
                Halfway down the spout area is a
                set of six tungsten steel bars
                called a grizzly which catch all

                              PK (V.O.)
                These are taken care of by a
                grizzly, an explosives expert
                whose job it is to keep the ore
                flowing, and since when the ore
                doesn't flow, neither does the
                money, working the grizzly is a
                very crucial and therefore very
                well-paid position. Three months'

                work the bars for a    year.

181   INT. MINER'S BAR                                            181
      A crude place where the bar runs the back length of the
      room and the bare concrete surroundings offer nothing in
      the way of diversion from the main purpose of being there
      -- to drink hard and long.

      THOMAS, a harsh, ruddy-faced Welshman, the School of
      Mines instructor, downs a drink, pours another and looks
      up at PK.

                                 THOMAS
                Are you crazy?     To sign on for
                a year?
                              PK
                You said I was the best you ever
                taught, sir.

                              THOMAS
                And you are, boyo. The absolute
                best.

                              THOMAS (CONT'D)
                But even the best doesn't survive
                a year on the bars. Down in that
                damn tube the luck runs out sooner
                than later. You may be a genius
                at reading the rock but you ain't
                no fuckin' fortune teller.

      Thomas throws back another drink.
                              PK
                You worked grizzly a year.

                              THOMAS
                And let me show you what I have
                to show for it to this day.

      He holds up his hand.   It shakes noticeably.

                              THOMAS
                And that's thirteen years after
                the fact, boyo.

                                                        129.
A NOISE from the doorway turns Thomas's attention. He
looks over as four huge men enter, drillers, men whose
faces and bodies are as hard and massive as the rock
they work.

One of the men pauses at the door and grabs his head as
an enormous jolt of pain runs through it. He shakes it
off and follows his friends to a table.

Thomas looks concerned.
                        PK
          Something wrong?
                        THOMAS
                 (unconvincing)
          Nothing.

The BARTENDER comes over and puts another shot in front
of Thomas.

                        BARTENDER
          One double brandy. One...
                 (derisive)
          lemon soda.

He puts the lemon soda in front of PK.

                           THOMAS
          Come on, then.

Thomas lifts his glass.

                        THOMAS
          On being the best damned blaster
          ever taught by Ian Thomas.
          Cheers.

Thomas and PK clink glasses.     Thomas knocks his shot back.

                           THOMAS
          Another.

The bartender pours another.

                        THOMAS
          Sure you don't want one?

                        PK
          I don't like the taste.

                           THOMAS
          Taste?     You don't drink for the
          taste.

                                                               130.
      He holds out his hand. It is steady now. He fixes PK
      with a portentous stare. Thomas looks over at the table
      of drillers. The man with the headache is downing one
      shot after another.

                                 THOMAS
                Hell's comin'.

      He draws PK's attention to the drillers.

                              THOMAS
                Drillers. He's got a powder
                pain from breathin' too much of
                that damn gelignite. The pain's
                bad enough. Mixed with a little
                alcohol it's fuckin' lethal.

      He watches the driller down two more shots of liquor.
                               THOMAS
                Come on.   We ain't got much time.

      Thomas directs PK towards the door.
                              THOMAS
                The two most dangerous things
                you'll ever see in your life,
                boyo: a hangup of rock that
                won't blast free on first shot
                and a driller with a powder
                headache drinkin'.

      As they reach the door the behemoth explodes with a
      roar. He grabs his head and staggers backwards; a mad
      look comes into his eyes.

      His three huge frineds rush to grab him.   He throws
      them off as if they were ants.

      He rips a table out of its bolting to the concrete
      floor and flings it across the room.
      The men drinking in the bar, all tough cases, begin to
      flee.

      Thomas grabs PK whose eyes stare in amazement as the
      behemoth struggles against his three massive friends
      and pulls him out of the bar.

                                                     CUT TO:

      game accordingly.   Fights continually break out.

      Off a play a fight breaks out. One of the men is kicked
      unconscious. Two of his teammates carry him off the
      field, dumping his body unceremoniously like a sack of
      potatoes on the sidelines. They run back as play
      resumes.

      PK turns and walks back through the camp.

183   EXT. CAMP - NIGHT                                       183
      A company-built miner's camp. Cement huts with steel
      doors and corrugated roofs. No shrubbery, only dust,
      cement, and the roughest-looking bunch of men assembled
      on earth.
                              PK (V.O.)
                Dear Morrie. To answer your
                question: yes--sports are played
                here, but only in the loosest
                sense of the words "sport" and
                "play". The rules are
                different for everything, in
                games as well as in the rest of
                our lives. The managers, the
                foremen, the company people.
                They live apart from the miners.
                They have families. Proper
                gardens. Sunday dinners. The
                miners--the crud, as we are called
                -- don't. This is a society of
                men, many of whom have pasts
                better left behind. Future does
                not apply. It is a society only
                in the loosest sense of the word.
                The laws of survival are simple--
                you either do or you don't.

      PK comes down a side street. A half a dozen men at
      cards, hard-faced desperadoes, see him pass, eyeing him
      closely. PK averts his eyes. From behind his back
      comes the sound of LIPS PUCKERING loudly, indecently.
      PK swallows hard. The sound of a CHARGE turns him to
      the six men bolting from their card game after him,
      whooping with lascivious intent. PK takes off.

      The chase takes PK and his pursuers flying through the
      streets of the camp, past one identical cement hut after
      another.  People watch, disinterested. No one raises
      a hand to help.

      PK comes racing around the corner to three of the men

                                                             132.
      blocking the street in front of him. He whirls. The
      others catch up behind, yelling and hooting. The two
      lines advance.

      PK gets ready. When the first man is close enough he
      hits him hard, breaking his jaw. He swings at another,
      catching him flush in the face. But then the rest are
      upon him. Even though PK fights like hell, he is
      overwhelmed. The blows come from everywhere, beating
      him to the ground. His arms and legs are firmly grabbed
      by four men. He is banged hard face down onto a concrete
      table. The fifth man pulls down his pants and the sixth
      begins to undo his own fly. All the men scream obsceni-
      ties, anticipating the rape.

      PK struggles like hell to no avail. As he is about to
      be violated, a roaring giant of a man tears into the
      pack like a bear shredding dogs. He scatters the men,
      knocking some unconscious, sending the rest to flight.
      He stands over PK, a looming block of granite with a
      wild black beard and coal-black eyes. His intent only
      becomes clear as to whether he is claiming a prize or
      helping a friend when he offers PK his hand, lifting PK
      effortlessly.

      He examines PK's bruised face with some concern and
      then smiles.

                              PK
                You know, Rasputin, I had them
                right where I wanted them.
                Another minute they were done
                for.
      Rasputin claps PK on the back and addresses him in
      Russian, to which PK responds with a smile. The two men
      walk off together.

                looking for work are driven by a
                different desperation--drought,
                famine, locusts.

      Satisfied with the equipment, PK nods for the box to be
      closed.

      ELIJAH, his head man, closes the boxes.

                               PK (V.O.)
                They come and risk their    lives to
                send money back home to    the
                families sitting on the    barren
                farms, starving, waiting    for
                death or rain.
      When the boxes are closed the other five men in the crew
      lift them and follow PK out.

                Superstition runs deep in them,
                so a good grizzly man attracts a
                good crew. On the bars, the

                are. And by association -- they
                are.

      PK and his crew make their way through a narrow tunnel
      and come to the grizzly. It is dark. The only light
      comes from the lamps attached to their helmets.
      Boulders litter the bars.

      PK and Elijah are onto the bars first.   Their light
      beams move along across the boulders.

                                ELIJAH
                Baas.   Baas.

      PK turns to Elijah. His lamp catches Elijah's face
      which is looking upward. PK looks up.

      His POV in the narrow bands of light: a bunch of rocks
      big and small, packed into the funnel. His face grows
      dim.

      Five feet across a rock wall with stones of all sizes
      blocking up the funnel's mouth.

                              PK (V.O.)
                Hangups are the worst of it.
                When the top of the funnel gets
                blocked up and the ore won't
                flow.

      PK scales the sheer rock wall of the funnel, his shirt
      packed with explosives.

                              PK (V.O.)
                The only way to unblock it is to
                set a charge to blow inward. And
                the only way to do that is to set
                the charge in mud, which means
                climbing up to the mouth of the
                stope and coming face-to-face
                with the devil.

      PK reaches the hangup. He works at taking a prepared
      parcel of gelignite sticks and jamming them carefully
      into a crevice. As he does the hangup creaks deeply,
      shifting, ominous. A few rocks fall. PK freezes,
      holding his breath.

      Elijah remains on the grizzly bars, his light shining on
      PK.

      holding very still, listening.
                              PK (V.O.)
                Sometimes the rock doesn't need
                the provocation of explosives.
                Sometimes the earth shifts...

                turned into something else by
                fifty tons of rock you understand
                why it is called grizzly.

      PK finishes setting the charge. He scales down the wall.
      A large rock is expelled from the hangup and comes
      bouncing down the sides to the funnel, just missing PK,
      crashing through the bars below.

      PK freezes. Elijah holds his breath.   The crew in the
      safty tunnel quakes.

      Nothing happens.

      PK comes down the rest of the way. He takes the cordtex
      rope dangling from the bomb and inserts a fuse. He nods
      to Elijah. Elijah lights a cheesa stick. He hands the
      glowing stick to PK. PK waves towards the tunnel. One
      of the Africans sounds the WARNING WHISTLE. Two blasts
      followed by two blasts. PK nods for Elijah to be off.
      Elijah stands his ground.

                              ELIJAH
                I wait for you, baas.

      PK lights the fuse. Elijah takes off like a scared
      rabbit for the safety of the shaft.
      PK is right on his tail.

      The fuse travels quickly toward the bomb.

                                                              136.

      Elijah trips. PK, coming behind him, grabs him by the
      collar and flings him into the safety tunnel, diving
      after him a second later, just as the BOMB EXPLODES. A
      few rocks come down, but nothing else.
      The Africans look at each other with real apprehension.

      PK rises from Elijah and peeks out.


191   HIS POV - HANGUP                                           191

      is still in place.

      PK studies the hangup, stepping out onto the grizzly,
      listening, looking. The hangup groans. The Africans
      are petrified at the mouth of the tunnel.
      PK stops midway on the bars. He studies the hangup
      intently, then picks up a rock. Choosing a target he
      heaves the rock with all his might toward the hangup
      and runs like hell. The rock hits the hangup. PK
      springs off the grizzly, right into the Africans as the
      hangup thunders down. Dust and small rocks fill the
      safety tunnel.

      When the avalanche has stopped PK raises himself off the
      Africans. They are all covered in dust but smiling and
      babbling, happy to be alive.

      PK peeks out and up. He signals to Elijah who hits the
      LL-CLEAR WHISTLE. Three blasts.
                              PK
                Let's clean her off and call it
                a night, hey?

      Happy, the Africans lift shovels and crowbars to clear
      the bars. As they pass PK they touch him reverentially
      as one would an icon.
                              PK (V.O.)
                The Africans think the longer you
                survive the luckier you are. And
                the luckier you are the longer you
                survive. I know there's something
                inherently wrong with their logic.
                Still, I'm beginning to see their
                point. Especially with less than
                six months to go.

          The shorter your time, the higher
          they go. With you probably ten,
          twelve, thirteen to one when
          you're short a month.

          And  I'll be prayin' every night
          it's  the only bet I ever have to

Jocko rises to exit.

Rasputin says something in Russian as he moves a piece,

checkmates him.

Rasputin laughs, speaks in Russian, and starts to set

                        PK
          One... two... three.
A MUFFLED BLAST comes from the other side of the hangup
deep in the stope. PK freezes, confused, and then a
SECOND BLAST goes off. The hangups starts to give. And
ANOTHER BLAST.

PK lights his own fuse and runs like hell over the bars
toward the tunnel.
The hangup, loosened by the explosions inside, gives
before PK's bomb ignites. The rock is crashing down.
PK races the rock. The tunnel is within sight.

The men yell for him to jump.

PK is about to leap when a rock hits the bar, bounces up,
and catches him in the stomach. He  loses his balance
and goes over the side as the hangup comes crashing down.
PK hits the wall of the lower funnel -- once, twice --
and then lands in the soft stuff -- the shale flake,
cushioning the steel doors below.

                                                            142.

200   HIS POV                                                    200

      against the wall of rock.

      A rock ledge carelessly left when the funnel was
      originally built.

      PK rolls under it. A moment later fifty tons of ore in
      large chunks and small chunks and dust comes crashing
      down, burying PK. He lays there, semiconscious, buried
      but alive.

      The falling rock has stopped. The   funnel is full. The
      bars as well. Elijah and the crew   look out of the
      safety tunnel tremulously. Elijah   looks up the stope.
      His light catches a man at the very  top of the stope
      climbing out.

      Elijah pulls the WARNING WHISTLE.   Five blasts over and
      over.

      Rasputin is timbering with his crew, fitting huge timbers
      into place, making new haulage, when he hears the

      He yells at his crew to grab the tools and he runs off
      down the tunnel.

      A deep hole has been dug through    the rock piled in the
      lower funnel. Rock comes up in     a bucket and is carted
      off. Timber is passed down. A      crowd of miners, black
      and white, watch and help where    they can.

      Rasputin works like a man possessed, piling rocks in the

Botha gets there first and bolts it.

                        PK
          Botha. We've made a lot of money
          working together. Let the past be
          the past.

                        BOTHA
          You ruined the country, all you
          rooineks. You come and ruin the
          country.

He rushes PK again.     Again PK sidesteps.

                        PK
          No, Jaapie Botha. It's hate
          ruining the country.
                           BOTHA
          Jaah.

He swings at PK.     PK ducks.
                           PK
          Boer hate.

                           BOTHA
          Our country.

At that moment the powder headache strikes. Botha
bellows, grabbing his head staggering backward.

PK runs for the door. As he reaches it a table slams
against it, thrown halfway across the room by a
powder-mad Botha.

                                                              150.
      PK jumps out of the way at the last minute.

      Men's faces begin to appear at the iron-meshed windows.
      People start to bang at the door.

      PK, realizing there is no talking to Botha now, does
      his best to stay out of the charging giant's way.

      Botha charges him. PK sidesteps and hits him with a
      left hook. The punch has no effect. Botha swings out
      wildly. PK easily dances away. Botha picks up
      another table and heaves it at PK. PK jumps to avoid
      it, but trips on an overturned stool. He goes down.
      The miners outside, crowding three deep, yell and shout.
      People start to make bets.

      Botha charges PK as PK scrambles up. Botha swings. The
      blow glances off PK's shoulder and sends him flying,
      spinning over a table. Botha leaps at PK, driving him
      into the wall. PK grimaces, sagging. Botha picks him
      up and starts to squeeze him to death in his massive
      arms. PK, his hands free, starts to pound on Botha's
      ears with his palms. Botha screams as the powder head-
      ache accelerates through the top of his skull. He
      drops PK. PK rolls away and swings a stool at Botha's
      midsection. Botha is driven back. PK goes to swing
      the stool again. Botha catches it as if it were made
      of balsa. He rips it out of PK's hand and flings it
      back at him, charging behind it.

      PK goes topping end over end. Botha gets a hand on him
      and lifts him from behind. He flings PK over the bar.
      PK hits the floor, stunned. Botha pulls at the bar
      trying to get at PK.

      He rocks the bar and rocks the bar as PK is trying to
      regain his bearings. Finally, with one tremendous rip,
      the bar comes away from its bolting. Botha pulls it
      aside.

      PK rises just as Botha moves in. PK hits him three
      solid shots to the stomach but Botha hardly feels
      them. He grabs PK and starts to squeeze him again.
      Face to face, Botha's crazed eyes watch the life
      fade from PK's.

      PK's eyes going blank.
                                                    SMASH CUT TO:

                                                              151.

      diving off a waterfall into the turbulent water below.

                                                   SMASH CUT TO:

219   BOTHA                                                        219

      squeezing harder, breaking PK's concentration.

                                                   SMASH CUT TO:
220   PK                                                           220

      swimming, exhausted, climbs on a rock, one more in
      front of him. He dives into the water again.

                                                   SMASH CUT TO:

221   BACK TO SCENE                                                221

      The crowd yells and screams as Botha squeezes harder.
      Odds are called out. Blood starts to trickle from
      PK's mouth.
                               VOICE #1 (V.O.)
                He's dead.   He's dead.

                                                   SMASH CUT TO:
222   PK                                                           222

      as he swims to the last stone. He reaches it and
      struggles on top. He stands on the stone, trimphant.
                                                   SMASH CUT TO:

223   BOTHA                                                        223

      squeezing again, bellowing.

      PK opens his eyes, draws his   head back, and butts
      Botha in the face. Botha's    nose shatters. The grip
      slackens a bit. PK hits him    in the face again. Botha
      drops PK to the floor as he   screams at the unbelievable
      pain. Blood pours from his    nose.


224   PK                                                           224

      catches his breath and is on Botha. He throws three
      hard punches to his face. Enraged, Botha howls and
      swings at PK. PK goes underneath his arm and hooks
      three times into the ribs. Botha grunts, hurt. He
      swings again with the other hand.

                                                              152.
                                                  SMASH CUT TO:

225   INT. PRISON BOXING ROOM - CLOSEUP - GEEL PIET                225

                              GEEL PIET
                First with the head, then with the
                heart. Little defeat big when
                little is smart.

                                                  SMASH CUT TO:
226   PK                                                           226

      pounds into Botha's ribs under another wild swinging
      punch by the giant. Botha shouts and keeps advancing,
      swinging. PK backs up, peppering him, leading him
      forward. Left-right. He punishes Botha for each punch
      the big man throws, but always backing up. Botha, half
      blind, spitting blood follows.

      The crowd screams for him to move side to side.   The
      betting changes fast and furious.

      PK glances over his  shoulder to the cement wall behind
      him. He takes two   more steps and then fires two jabs
      at Botha's face and  then stands stock still. Wild with
      anger, Botha throws  a huge right hand to PK's head.

                                                  SMASH CUT TO:

227   CLUB                                                         227

      coming down on Maria's head.
                                                  SMASH CUT TO:

228   PK                                                           228

      At the last moment PK sidesteps. Botha's hand    smashes
      into the cement wall. His hand shatters into    a hundred
      pieces. The pain is so immense he is rendered    helpless.
      PK doesn't waste a second. He starts banging    away at
      Botha with hard, fast combinations.

                              PK
                Want to see the wages of hate?
      Botha feels the punches.   He steps back, faltering.
      PK pursues him.

                               PK
                Here.   Here is what hate gets you.

      PK hammers away, punching with each word, harder and
      faster.

                                                               153.

                               PK
                 For my chicken. For Geel Piet.
                 For Doc. For Mandoma. For Maria.

      Botha is out on his feet.

                               PK
                 For Africa.

      PK unleashes a final pjnch -- the hardest one he ever
      threw. It catches Botha square in the jaw. Botha
      goes over onto his back like a tree falling.
      The crowd outside screams and yells with delight.     Money
      changes hands.

      PK collects himself and steps over Botha.   He unbolts
      the door and steps outside.

                                                  CUT TO:

229   EXT. BAR                                                      229
      The crowd goes silent as PK emerges. The crowd parts.
      PK, looking neither right nor left, begins to walk away.

                               PK (V.O.)
                 I knew as I walked out of the
                 mines, out of Africa, that I
                 wasn't fleeing. That one day
                 I would return. Inkosi
                 Inkosikasi was right. I was a
                 man for all Africa. Bound to
                 her by my spirit. Bound by my
                 dreams. And Africa had taught
                 me the lesson I would take out
                 into the world and one day bring
                 back. Great changes can come from
                 the power of many. But only when
                 the many join together and create
                 what is invincible. The Power of
                 One.

      ZOOM OUT as PK continues walking out of the camp and
      toward tomorrow.
                                                  FADE OUT.



                                THE END
