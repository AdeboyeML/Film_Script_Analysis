          Sometimes the words present themselves in normal fashion. At
          other times, they're loosely spaced or sharply angled or
          individual words flash up one after another. i.e., titles

          joking with GINNY (28, knocked around but still spirited; two
          kids at home from different guys; she somehow maintains a good
          attitude). Slim views Ginny as her idol: for her attitude, not
          her life. Catch them in mid-conversation, Ginny slightly
          offended, working-class accent:

          Ginny and Slim converge carrying dirty dishes, piling them up
          for the BUSBOY, TEDDY (21, Hispanic). They haven't stopped
          moving for two hours, but now they can take a breath, survey
          the scene. Slim notices Ginny has a wet spot under her arm.

          Finneaan's Wake by James Joyce. A

          he tries to hide his fear:

                         OUR HERO
          Take it easy, M...man. She and
          I were just having some fun -

                         SLIM

                         (VERY CALM)
          I want to know what I'm worth.
          Our Hero gestures to Mitch: would you mind putting me down?
          Mitch reluctantly obliges.
          Our Hero does his best to recollect his dignity. Looks at
          Slim. Drops a ten on the table and smirks:

                         OUR HERO
          The bet was two, but now that I
          know you? Way too high.
          A pained look flashes across Slim's face -
          Our Hero starts toward the door, but Mitch steps in his path.
          Speaks quietly but with authority; there's a physical power in
          his words. Since he's protecting Slim, the power is

          Our Hero nods nervously.
          Mitch steps back 3 inches, just far enough to let our Hero
          leave. Which he does with considerable relief.
          Slim's leaning vs. the counter, shaken, tears in her eyes -
          Mitch tugs his baseball cap, mutters as he heads for the door:

                         MITCH
          Sorry to get in your business.

                         SLIM
          No. Hey. Thank you.
          He nods, keeps going.

          felt bad later.
          Good luck, huh?
          She nods.
          He ambles out the door. A touch of the cowboy in him.
          She shakes her head, looks at Ginny.
          Ginny gestures as if to say, well?
          At first Slim doesn't get it.
          Ginny gestures more urgently: Come on. What're you waiting
          for? She looks toward the door -
          Slim follows her look. PUSH IN ON SLIM'S FACE as she tries to
          work up the courage...
          Just as she starts toward the door, we:

                          FLASHES:
           Wedding photos. Mitch has lots of (surprisingly upper crust)
          family, Slim has a few friends. The more photos FLASH, the
          more pronounced (and sad), the contrast. FLY RIGHT INTO:
          Bacchanalian DANCING. French Champagne has flowed; shoes and
          inhibitions were abandoned hours ago. THE CAMERA weaves
          through the DANCERS to find:
          Slim and Mitch, dancing close, never quite touching, every move
          intense, physical, like subtle public sex. Their eyes are
          locked; she runs her veil down his body, his hand lightly
          touches her ass; they slow down and stand, lips a millimeter
          apart but not quite kissing, the sexual tension building...
          We see how crazy they are about each other, how completely
          physically involved - and how much fun they have.
          Watching them is Phil, with Mitch's parents, MRS. TYLER (58,
          confident, at ease with her power and family money, and
          likeable despite monstrous flaws) and MR. TYLER (someone Mrs.
          Tyler married in a moment of cupidity).

          MRS. TYLER
          Mitch was kind of.. .evasive. Is her
          father dead too?

                         PHIL
          Dead to her. He left when she was
          two.

          MRS. TYLER
          Oh. Well, I'm happy to pay for the

                         WEDDING -

          You don't get along with your son?
          She gives him a look. She's both offended by, and appreciative
          of, his bluntness. Looks out at Mitch:

          MRS. TYLER
          He's like my father. Which means, I
          guess, that he'll do very well.

                         PHIL
          He's done well to get Miss Slim.

          MRS. TYLER
          Yes, he has, hasn't he? He's married
          down, but he's gotten value.
           As Phil reacts, he notices his wife, SALIMA, has joined him.
          With her are two kids (5 and 2).
          Salima's looking out at the floor: not at Slim, but at Ginny
          and her dance partner. We see a thought cross her mind. She
          bends down and whispers conspiratorially to the kids.
          They whoop their response, run out to Ginny (who looks quite
          uncomfortable in her Maid-of-Honor dress).

          FIVE YEAR OLD SON
          Mom! Mom! Mom! Can we spend the
          night at Phil and Salima's house?
          Ginny looks over, winks at Salima, and kisses her kids:

                         GINNY
          Don't eat at their ice cream, huh?
          They squeal with pleasure and run off.
          Ginny turns back, resumes dancing with JOE (24, handsome in a
          casual way, a good guy):

                         GINNY

          She pulls him into a kiss, and...well: he's not a bad kisser...
          We glide from them to Slim and Mitch, hardly moving. Suddenly:
          tender and insecure and almost comic, she looks at him...

                         SLIM
          You sure,you love me?

          He stops dancing. Senses the real issue beneath her questions:

                         MITCH
          You're safe with me, Slim. You're
          safe, and it's okay to be happy.
          We deserve it.
          They kiss. Others stop to watch: how cute. Phil comes over,
          waits. When they break:

                         PHIL
          I'm sorry, I gotta get up five
          o'clock to buy green beans.
          He slips an envelope into Mitch's hand:

                         PHIL
          In my country, it's tradition to
          give money to groom. You don't
          need it, but...
          Slim shakes her head, touched, as:

          She kisses him, and he goes. They look after him.

          He really loves you.
          She nods, not quite picking up how odd his statement is: of
          course he loves her; she nicked him to give her away.
          Mitch turns her toward him and slips his hands inside the top
          of her dress (so the back of his hands touch her breasts; is
          this going too far?). He pulls her to him, whispers:

          He hoists her into his arms and carries her off the floor.
          Applause from the GUESTS. It's a grand romantic gesture. You
          have to wonder if Mitch is just a little too good to be true...

          the furnishings are simple, casual, friendly.
          She's putting a bottle of oil up on a shelf. . .but it never
          quite gets there. Her face changes. Something's happened.

          Oil spreading across the floor...
          She stares at it.
          Claws the air, grabbing the cordless phone as she plops down on

          INT. HOSPITAL. DAY.

          Slim lies in bed. Very pale, a light dust of sweat. We assume
          she's between contractions. Mitch's face inches from hers;
          smothering her with kisses.
          The Nurse brings the baby in, starts to give her to Slim -

                         MITCH
          Can I hold her?
          The Nurse looks at Slim,. who nods, and gives Mitch the baby.

          He kisses her head, dances with her.
          Slim looks adoringly at father and daughter: the sight is
          almost unbelievably sweet.
          His cell phone rings. He keeps dancing, ignoring it.
          After one ring, it stops.
          He's kissing the baby's head over and over, just like he kissed
          Slim, and staring into the infant's eyes -

                         MITCH
          She looks just like my baby
          pictures.
          His cell phone rings again. As if the previous call had been a
          signal.
          Slim looks at him as the phone keeps ringing.
          With some difficulty, juggling the baby, he turns the phone
          off.
          But he doesn't look at Slim.

                         SLIM
          Who was that?

                         MITCH
          I don't know. Who cares? Some
          construction thing, I guess.
          She stares at him.
          He stares at the baby.

                         MITCH
          Isn't she the most beautiful
          thing you ever saw in your life?

          GRACIE, now 4. Says something and Gracie laughs. Slim laughs.

          on, tries to join in, but it's forced-and besides that:
          they're not even looking at him, not inviting his laughter;
          it's all between the mother and child.
          So he stops trying. Just watches them. And before his eyes,
          they become - for an instant - strangers. As this reaction,
          and the subtle hostility it engenders, flicker across his face,
          Slim looks up at him -
          For one long moment they both seem to acknowledge the gulf
          between them...
          Then Gracie says something. Slim turns back toward her, the
          "girls" are laughing again...and Mitch is not.

          She's in the bedroom now. It's underlit, full of shadows. In

          She looks in on Gracie, sleeping peacefully. Consoling image.

          INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT.

          She's washing dishes, bored, humming to herself. The counter's
          covered with take-out food containers: she didn't cook.
          A noise. Pager. Not beeping, just humming slightly: she
          wouldn't even hear it except it's on the tile counter.
          Sounds vaguely like a vibrator. Lying there, just a few feet
          from her. With Mitch's wallet and keys, his cell phone.
          She looks at it. .knows she shouldn't... decides not to...
          Can't resist. Dries her.hands methodically on a dishtowel.
          Picks up the pager. Reads: 33.

          She looks at the cell phone. Wonders whether...
          Looks toward the hall. We HEAR the shower still running...
          She picks up his cell phone. Tentatively - she's not sure this
          will work - she presses: RECALL 33.
          The phone flashes NAME, but instead of a name there's: .
          She stares at this, glances again down the hall-takes a deep
          breath.. .and presses SEND.
          Waits... listens nervously...

          Slim goes into slow motion. How oddly her arm moves downward.
          She looks at the phone. Blinks. Presses OFF.
          Scans the room as if she's never seen it before.
          One of Gracie's toys lies on the floor. Slim stares at it.
          Reaches down to pick it up, but instead of the toy moving up,
          her body moves down. She slumps to the floor. Sits. Stares.

          back in a few hours."
          Her face is completely blank.
          He bends down, gives her a kiss on the head. We feel her skin
          crawl.
          She watches him go.
          Waits.
          Hears the front door close.
          She gets up, walks to the window, watches him walk toward his
          car.
          She turns away, looks at the room. We HEAR his car start.
          She goes to the phone. Thinks.

           FOUR JAGUARs lined up. At a respectful distance sit an old
          Toyota (the maid's car) and a pick-up (the gardener's truck).
          Slim parks near the truck.
          Her hand moves to the door handle, but she can't bring herself
          to open it. She sits... paralyzed, a failure.
          In this prolonged pause, Mrs. Tyler bursts out of the house -

          Well then, you and I will have a

          She's about to hurtle into the gossip when Slim turns her head
          and Mrs. Tyler sees (and we see for the first time) the result
          of Mitch's brutality: a nasty bruise on Slim's cheek.
          Mrs. Tyler's face falls as she realizes what this means.
          Underneath it all, she's a warm person; she hugs Slim:

          Phil nods.
          They wait.
          She does not come out.
          Ginny shakes her head, looks at her watch.

          They wait again.
          Beat.

          INT. HOUSE. NIGHT.

          Slim still frozen in exactly the same spot. Still carrying
          Gracie, still with her hand on the knob. Listening. Turning
          her head this way-that way. She hears the COOING DOVE NOISE
          come again from outside.
          That settles it. She pulls the door -

          MITCH FLYING AT HER -
          Grabs her, catches her, catches Gracie, pulling Slim's hair
          hard, leading her away from the door -

          The three rescuers still wait.
          Frozen.
          Phil shakes his head. We see a baseball bat in his hands.

          We better go in.

          It'd be crazy to wake him. If
          anything's wrong, she'll flick
          the lights. .Right?
          Phil nods skeptically, and Ginny herself doesn't seem so sure.
          They look at the house-and wait. . .and wait... We want to
          scream: "GO IN! GO! SAVE HER!"
          Suddenly something. Subtle. Was that A SOUND from inside???
          They go on alert. . .step forward... listen more closely...
          But hear nothing unusual.

          SCREAM. Slim. Intense horrible spit of sound, replaced by an
          even more horrible silence. Deadly silence. CLOSE ON GINNY as
          they run: as if we've lost Slim and Ginny's.our new
          protagonist. As we near the house, we realize: it's not
          silence. There are sounds from inside: almost inaudible THUDS.
          Sound of a beating. On Ginny's horrified reaction -
          Baseball bat. Phil smashes a window.
          They climb through the hole into the house -

          Mitch emerges from darkness. Light glints off his pistol.
          Thirty feet behind him: Gracie's sleeping on the couch.
          Mitch moves and they stare in horror. Lying at his feet is
          Slim's body..
          Pain springs from Ginny's throat, she rushes to Slim -
          Mitch rams the gun into her head:

          Slim makes a SOUND as Ginny strokes her head...
          Mitch FIRES the gun into the wall over Ginny's head. Muffled
          sound: silencer. But he has everyone's attention now:

          Mitch stares at Phil. Walks to him. Is he going to hit him?
          Shoot him? Mitch leans in, gun to Phil's head, and whispers:

          Nobody cares like I do.
          The others stare at him in astonishment, but continue toward

          from the wedding). Horsing around, having a good time, Gracie
          eating a pastry. They stop and look out at Lake Michigan.

          Sees a LARGE MAN IN A SUIT.

          Joe glances over his shoulder: no sign of them. He opens the
          door, but not far enough to let the man in. Behind the large
          man are TWO OTHER MEN IN SUITS.

          This elicits no response. Joe moves to where he can see the
          other two guys. Looks down the hall toward:

          Third FBI Man searches the room.
          SUDDENLY we go to SLIM'S POV...she and Gracie are in a cabinet,
          looking out through a narrow horizontal slit. Watching the
          Third FBI Man makes his way methodically in their direction.
          First FBI Man stands over Joe, keeping him silent.
          Joe watches the Third FBI Man search the room...
          And then Joe blinks. Moves his eyes, and looks right in Slim's
          direction. He realizes where they must be hiding.
          The Third FBI Man's getting closer and closer to them...
          Joe realizes he has to do something. Abruptly Joe stands:

          okay? "Lug nuts." You don't want to
          worry they're loose every time you

          take this kind of risk, he's either a very good friend (which
          he is) or he's still in love with her (which he is, also).

          They're thrown TOWARD CAMERA -
          Debris flying everywhere -
          They lie on the. ground. Not moving. Are they dead or just

          I do, thanks, I appreciate it.
          Listen: we have to keep it short
          again or he might trace it, so I
          better put her on -

          Hi Grandma! I have a new name!

          Yeah! You wanna hear it?
          "Erin" pushes down the lever, ending the call, mutters:

                         "ERIN"
          Sorry, your Majesty. Remember:
          names're secret.

          That is the most pitiful expression
          I've ever seen.

          She listens, cradling the phone. "Erin" watches her daughter's

          Just tell him you love him and say
          goodbye, okay?
          "Queen E." nods, puts the receiver to her ear. Even "Erin" can
          hear Mitch yelling... "Queen E."'s face changes. Mitch keeps
          shouting angrily.

                         "QUEEN ELIZABETH"
          Goodbye Daddy.
          She did not say "I love you." She hands "Erin" the receiver.
          "Erin" hangs it up.

                         "QUEEN ELIZABETH"
          I am really really sad.
          "Erin" nods, angry at herself:

          slightly in the wind from the window.

          Still staring at the curtain...
          She stands, pulls up her pajamas...

          She keeps coming, past "Queen E's -

          " Erin" starts to scream, looks toward "Queen E." and stifles
          the sound.
          They wrestle. Silently. Grim pantomime. The only sounds are
          GRUNTS, BANGING vs. the walls.

          "Erin" and "Queen E." pulling clothes from the suitcase,
          getting dressed. A FRANTIC BLUR of pajamas and underwear and

          "Erin" coming back onto the road, fighting to keep control, and
          the road narrowing more and more, down to one tight lane. This

          Different country road. Parked ahead is a `78 Oldsmobile.

          They get out of the Taurus. Using her keys, "Erin" unlocks the
          trunk of the Olds. Two large suitcases inside. "Erin" throws
          their small suitcase in on top.
          "Erin" reaches up under the driver's seat and pulls out a
          wallet. Checks the contents: cash, credit cards.

          EXT. DOWNTOWN L.A. STREET. DAY.

          Alex and Slim are across the street from a strip joint.

                         SLIM
          It's closed?

                         ALEX
          Till six, eh?

                         SLIM
          And I'd guess whoever owns it
          isn't a very nice person.

                         ALEX
          That's a safe one.
          Slim starts walking toward the shop. As they go:

                         SLIM
          Why here?

                         ALEX
          You've got soft hands, you've worked
          hard. The tricky part now is nerves.
          They reach the entryway; Slim takes out her tools.

          People on the street?

                         ALEX
          Yeah. And you have to go in when
          his alarm's turned off -

                         SLIM

                         (NODS)
          Meaning he's inside.
          (has tools out)
          I'm ready.
          Alex moves slightly to block the view as Slim bends over and
          slips her tool into the lock...
          Slim working quietly, concentrating...
          Alex looking. around...
          A SHADY CHARACTER noticing them. Hesitating. Coming over..

                         ALEX
          We got company, doll...
          Slim still working...
          The Shady Character has almost reached them...

                         ALEX
          Forget it. You're too slow.
          She opens the door -
          Alex glances down, nods -
          She closes the door again and stands just as:

                         SHADY CHARACTER
          Hey. What're you guys up to?
          Slim stares at him.

                         SLIM
          We were hoping to see some action,
          but it looks like they're closed.
          The Shady Character stares back. He is ve skeptical.
          He watches Slim and Alex walk off down the block. Alex mutters
          under his breath:

          INT. BEAUTY SALON. DAY.

          Slim sits in a chair, cell phone at her ear. Her hair is done;
          now she's getting a manicure.

          MRS. TYLER'S VOICE
          And where is Gracie?

                         SLIM
          She's coming day after tomorrow,
          then we're flying to L.A. I was
          thinking after the hearing, maybe I
          could bring her by.

          MRS. TYLER'S VOICE
          Tell me something. Why is this call
          different? You were always worried
          about how long we talked -

                         SLIM
          I was out in the country, Mrs. T.
          I'm in a big city now, meeting with
          my lawyer, so there're lots of cell
          phones. No one can trace this.

          EXT. BEAUTY PARLOR. DAY.

          Slim exits in a long gray coat.
          Stops outside for one moment, glances around -
          Sees a guy in a GREEN TRENCHCOAT across the street.
          She walks hurriedly away.
          Glances over her shoulder, sees Trenchcoat following her.
          She smiles slightly, to herself.

          EXT. SLIM'S HOTEL. DAY.

          From a discreet distance, across the street, we watch her go
          into her hotel.

          INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAY.

          Slim enters her suite.
          Sitting by the window is TOVA. As Slim walks over, Tova pulls
          on a wig which matches Slim's haircut. There is now a strong
          resemblance.

                         TOVA
          I'm Tova Steinberg.
          Slim stares. Tova's voice is an octave lower than Slim's.

                         SLIM
          Say something else.

                         TOVA
          I was a cop. I got shot, took
          the benefits.
          Slim thinks about Tova's voice. Takes out her cell phone.

                         SLIM
          They have to think I'm still here,
          so use my cell phone, tomorrow, to
          call my dad. Autodial 2.
          Slim presses the autodial number, then SEND, and motions for
          Tova to put on Slim's gray coat. It fits Tova perfectly.

          SLIM (CONT.)
          (lowering his voice)
          Hey, it's me.

          What happened to your voice?; you
          okay?

                         SLIM
          I don't know, I'm getting some
          bronchial thing.

                         JUPITER'S VOICE
          Otherwise everything's okay?

                         SLIM

          Get some rest, huh?
          She presses END, says to Tova, back to normal voice:

                         SLIM
          Tomorrow stay in, order room service.
          Call him twice. Keep it brief.
          "Hello, I don't feel well..."

                         TOVA
          And tonight?

                         SLIM
          Go around the corner, eat at Guido's.

                         TOVA
          I'll be followed?

                         SLIM
          Green trenchcoat.
          Tova nods and Slim takes off her own wig. Short dark hair.

          SLIM (CONT.)
          Wish me luck, huh?

                         TOVA
          Good luck.

                         SLIM
          Luck has nothing to do with it.
          Tova smiles.

          EXT. SAN PEDRO STREET. NIGHT.

          Slim parks, looks across at a warehouse converted into lofts.

          BATTLE OF THE
          She takes a duffle from the back seat. Steps into the shadows,
          stares at the warehouse:
          Brick building, modern door and light fixtures.

                         SEXES
          She looks both ways:
          The street's dark. Deserted.
          She hoists her duffle, takes a deep breath.
          And crosses the street.
          Goes up the stairs to the stoop. Looks at the alarm panel on
          the door: green.
          Crouches, starts to work on the lock.

          INT. WAREHOUSE/LOFT. SLEEPING AREA. NIGHT.

          Mitch in bed, sleeping. Peaceful.
          A SOUND, Off.
          He stirs slightly.

          ANOTHER SOUND.
          He sits up. Frowning... dazed.
          Cocks his head. Listens...
          The SILENCE seems to have texture. He gets up.

          We glimpse: a beautiful brick warehouse converted inside into
          an open, loft-like space filled with bird'seye maple, metal
          beams, etc. Modern, glistening, expensive.
          He walks around the place in the dark.
          In his boxer shorts and t-shirt. He looks vulnerable...
          SLIM'S POV... From one corner. Observing him. She has become
          the stalker.
          HER EYES, watching...
          He decides everything's okay and goes back to the semi
          partitioned sleeping area...
          He gets back into bed - next to a YOUNG BLOND WOMAN, 22.
          She turns over, mutters something, goes back to sleep.
          He lies there, eyes open. Stays very still. Listening.

          JARRING CUT TO:

          INT. SAME WAREHOUSE. MORNING.

          Bright light. Mitch in his bathrobe making coffee. The Young
          Blond Woman comes out, fully dressed...

                         MITCH
          Coffee?

                         YOUNG BLOND
          I gotta get home, change for work.
          He nods, gives her a perfunctory kiss:

                         MITCH
          I'll call you.
          She stares at him a second.

                         YOUNG BLOND
          You want my number?

                         MITCH
          Sure.
          She sees how "eager" he is to talk to her again. Irritated,
          she scribbles the number quickly, hands.it to him -

                         MITCH
          Thanks for everything.

          For the sex, in other words. She gives it right back to him:

                         YOUNG BLOND
          You too. I really appreciate it.
          He's too self-centered to notice her ironic tone.
          She lets herself out.
          The instant she does, we go to a HIGH ANGLE looking down at
          Mitch. Alternate NORMAL and HIGH ANGLE during:
          Mitch pours coffee, goes back into his "dressing area" and
          pulls on some clothes as he talks into his cell phone:

                         MITCH

          No, tonight's no good either. I've
          got a morning flight to San
          Francisco.
          Slim in therafters, listening.

          MITCH (CONT.)
          If it was pleasure, you'd be going
          too. No, I'm going down to get my
          daughter.
          Slim's reaction to this...

          MITCH (CONT.)
          Sure, the custody hearing's here next
          week, but it looks like Gracie's
          being brought to San Francisco and
          my ex-wife ...well, seems like she
          completely vanished.
          ON SLIM. His words echo his threats when he was trying to
          strangle her in her hallway.

          MITCH (CONT.)
          Right off the face of the earth.
          I doubt they'll ever find her
          this time.
          Slim's jaw tightens.
          When we come back to Mitch, he's dressed and packing his
          briefcase.

          HIGH ANGLE SHOT looking down on Mitch as he heads out the door.
          Slim waits in the rafters until the alarm system beeps: it's
          armed.
          She climbs down, walks into the kitchen.
          Notices his Mr. Coffee machine is still on.
          Hesitates, turns it off.
          Opens the fridge to find something to eat -
          The alarm beeps again.
          Slim drops silently to the floor.
          SOUND of the KEY IN THE LOCK -
          Slim scuttles away as we hear:
          FRONT DOOR OPENING. FOOTSTEPS coming toward her.
          She slips around the edge of the counter just as:
          Mitch enters the kitchen. He goes to the Mr. Coffee... Looks
          at it... Frowns. Didn't he leave it on...?
          Slim in the foreground, crouched down, Mitch 15 feet away. He
          looks around. Is something wrong? Is someone here?
          Slim frozen, trying not to breath.
          Mitch listening. Wondering: should he search the place?
          She looks for a place to hide -
          He looks at his watch. He's late.
          He walks right toward Slim, curls around the counter -
          But she's not there any longer.
          He heads for the front door -

          She sighs. Pours herself some coffee, replaces the liquid with

          She hangs up.
          Retrieves her duffle bag from its hiding place and pulls out
          tools, equipment, etc. Picks up a screwdriver and starts
          searching the apartment, checking the phone line, following it
          to the place where it enters the apartment.

          She looks from one piece of furniture to another, back and
          forth, gauging the distance between them.
          She eats a snack from his refrigerator...

          Uses a metal detector to search the apartment:
          in a drawer of the night table beside his bed, she finds a
          pistol. Removes it. There are papers in the same drawer,
          notes or something. She throws these in the trash.
          She takes out three letters. As the CAMERA sweeps over one of
          them, we hear her voice:

          SLIM (V.0.)
          ". .thanks for letting me come talk
          about Gracie. And I'm glad you're
          willing to admit your temper, and -
          let's not mince words - the physical
          abuse you subjected me to."
          And glances at SECOND LETTER:

          SLIM (V.0.)
          "Perhaps with your new attitude,
          we can really work something out.
          Per your last letter, I'll see you
          the evening of..."
          She puts the letters in the drawer where the pistol was.
          They're not in envelopes; they're loose, open.
          She picks up the metal detector, resumes her search.
          The machine beeps insistently around his desk. She can't find
          anything. Finally she discovers a false bottom on one of the
          drawers: a second gun is in there.
          With the gun are papers: reports from private detectives
          looking for her, an assessment of his custody rights...
          She hides the guns in the bottom of the laundry hamper.
          Finds a photo of herself with Mitch and Gracie. Rips it up.
          Puts the metal detector back in the duffle.
          Changes into sweatshirt and sweatpants.
          Takes the distinctive red bag (from the electronics store) out
          of the duffle. There's a machine inside. She plugs it in,
          tucks it behind the couch.
          Puts her cell phone beside it.

          She makes one last check: every wall, surface, every drawer.
          Barefoot, she begins to glide around the space. Backing up.
          Moving with ease and grace, sliding deftly to the side as she
          approaches a couch, desk, chair. She's building on her earlier
          reconnaissance: learning where the furniture is and how to
          navigate around it...

          Light fading toward darkness. She's still moving backward,
          only now her sliding is smooth, graceful; almost a dance.
          As if hearing a distant signal, she slows to a stop.
          For a long moment she stands perfectly still. Poised. Like an
          animal in the forest.
          There's a chair facing the front door. She glances at it. No.
          She walks behind the couch, turns off the machine, picks up her
          cell phone and auto-dials.

          Goes into the bedroom area, takes off his jacket.
          The lights go out.
          Mitch freezes, shadow on shadow, a silhouette in the darkness.
          He looks out the window, sees:
          The neighboring buildings still have light and power.
          He cocks his head, listening.

          He rummages in the drawer. We hear the RUSTLE of the letters
          Slim put there. He fails to find the gun. Gives up trying to
          be quiet, tosses papers onto the floor -

          Looks around... can't see her...
          Goes back to the chair where he hung his sports coat and fishes
          out his cell phone. We see the GLOW of its dial.
          He punches 911 and pressed SEND.
          The dial goes dark for two seconds, then blinks back on.
          He stares at it.
          Tries again. 911, SEND.
          Again it goes dead.

          Walks out of the bedroom area.
          Looks around the vast space.
          Spooky. Slanting light and dense shadow.

          As he realizes her meaning, she moves into the open area
          between two couches.
          She has no weapon.
          She's barefoot, in her sweats, feet spread for balance, arms
          just slightly raised. Compared to him: she's tiny.
          He moves toward her.

          This is what you wanted, right?
          What you were going to San Francisco

          He lunges for her; she slides to the side and he misses.
          He begins to stalk her.
          And as he stalks, she moves backward, slowly and gracefully, in
          the way she was practicing.

          I don't understand, Slim.

          She ignores his words. Watches his eyes and his chest. Wants
          to know where he's going to attack.

          So far you're attacking me.
          He lunges, almost hits her, rushes in -
          She has to leap sideways with great speed and dexterity: jumps
          over the couch to avoid being hit.
          He also jumps over the couch, but his balance isn't as good,
          and she's waiting for him as he stumbles -
          With perfect balance and full force, she slugs him in the nose.
          He goes down. Stays there. For the first time it occurs to
          him: this might not be easy.
          He climbs to his feet, feels his nose: blood.

          Punching as he goes. From the standpoint of pure physics, he
          makes a terrifying force. Until:
          She steps back, grabs his arm, whips him vs. the brick wall -
          He hits it, bounces off.
          Cut on his forehead, blood streaming down his face.
          He stares at her... breathing hard... trying to put it together:

          He goes berserk. Leaps at her, covering ground quickly with
          his long stride, swinging his massive arms. This is the most
          terrifying form of combat: a huge person attacking a tiny one.

          CONTINUE this terrifying choreographed dance with destruction

          She lunges to the left, through a narrow space -
          He punches, grazing her hair; punches again, just missing, and
          a third time. We feel the awesome power behind these blows.
          She's in the clear again. Smiles casually. Clearly part of
          her strategy is to keep him angry:

          He grabs a lamp, yanks out the cord, wields it like a club.

          You see?
          He turns toward her, pain on his face, holding his hand -
          And she truly attacks for the first time. Smashes her fist
          against his head -
          He flies back, bounces vs. the wall.
          As he comes off it, she punches him again -
          He roars with rage, lunges at her, head first, great speed -
          She hurtles him in the same direction, increasing speed -
          Right into the opposite wall.
          The top of his head hits the wall.
          He shudders like someone in a cartoon: a spasm running head to

          Goes to him. Wary.
          Gives him a reflex test -
          No reaction. He's unconscious.
          She tests his neck for a pulse.
          Apparently he's still alive, because she raises her hand
          over her head.
          Her palm vertical, like a knife.
          She's about to deliver a karate chop.
          To his neck.
          it will break his neck.
          It will kill him.
          Her hand stays there, poised. CAMERA PLUNGES IN ON HER FACE.

          - Mitch beating her as she crawls across the floor of
          their house. (Something we didn't see before.) She reaches
          up, flicks the light switch; Mitch jumps on her back -

          - Earlier: "She's My daughter. Don't even think about

          Intentionally.
          Turns away, tears in her eyes.
          She retrieves her cell phone, turns off the cell-phone blocker,
          presses redial.
          Stares out the window. We see the turmoil on her face, hear it
          in her voice:

          I'm not a killer!
          I'm not him!
          Mitch. Crazed and bloody face. In his hand: the wooden lamp.
          She senses something, turns her head slightly to one side -
          - so the lamp does not land quite flush on her skull.
          Still sends her crashing to the floor.
          Now she does not move.
          He stands over her. Looks insane: bloody, dazed, beaten: but
          triumphant.

          lamp clenched tight in his fist.

          SMASH IN CLOSE ON HER FACE.
          CLOSER STILL. We're almost inside her head as we hear:

          Mitch sees the slight smile, can't believe it -
          Rage.
          He pulls his foot back to kick her -
          Her eyes are open, just a slit -
          His foot swinging forward...
          As it reaches her, she grabs it, yanks it -
          He's pulled off his feet, crashing down on top of her -
          But she's already rolling, out from under him... and up -
          Coming to her feet -
          He starts to rise, all fours, then into a crouch and ug...
          SLOW MOTION. She's ready. Her face alert. Center of gravity
          low. Arm low,.fist low... As her motion unfurls:
          Boxers say that an uppercut, perfectly
          executed, is the most difficult,
          powerful, and beautiful of punches.
          Indeed: when an uppercut starts low for maximum center-of-
          gravity and hits the opponent flush on the point of the chin -
          as Slim's does here - it delivers a devastating message to the
          central nervous system, short-circuiting it completely.
          Mitch flies backward...
          There's a table behind him.
          His head cracks on the table.
          His neck snaps.
          He lands on the floor: twisted, broken.
          Slim stares at him.
          There's no way a living man could assume the position now
          occupied by her former husband.

          Though she knows the answer, she feels his carotid artery.
          Her face registers what she feels. Horror, relief.
          She walks slowly to her cell phone, picks it up.
          Listens: no one there.
          She presses redial, waits...

          She makes a slight motion to indicate that Mitch is inside, and
          the OTHER COP runs into the apartment.
          Slim lowers her head.
          First Cop looks at her, sees the blood on her scalp.
