      A sound is building.  Like a living wind.  A
      thousand screams in agony.

      From the blackness, gusts of smoke pull together
      quickly, forming the Main Title against black:

                         "EVIL DEAD"

      Then beneath it, the Roman Numeral "II."

      A SLOW ZOOM brings it toward us.  And as the screams
      reach their sharp crescendo the title zooms through us.

      Whisping smoke against a black background. EERIE
      MUSIC.  In the distance, through the smoke, a
      small object. It fans toward us quickly, filling the
      frame. It is an ancient skin covered volume, with
      the outline of a human face on it's cover. This is
      the Book of the Dead.

                              NARRATOR
               Legend has it, that it was written by
               the dark ones: NECRONOMICON EX MORTES;
               Roughly translated...The Book of the Dead.

      The face on the cover of the book pulls away from its
      skin binding and leans toward the camera. EYES
      on the book blink open and peer at us. It's mouth
      opens and emits a hideous scream. The CAMERA races
      into the blackness of the screaming mouth.

               To trace the origin of the Book, we
               must go back...back...to a day when
               spirits ruled the earth.

      Wispy shapes of animated ghosts move through this
      vortex, coming toward the CAMERA with WAILING and
      MOANING  and then are gone.

      A raging ocean of blood.  Great waves rise and swell
      as if before a storm.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               It was this blood that was used to ink
               the book.

      Through animation, the blank pages of the Book are
      scripted in a strange hieroglyphic by an invisible hand.

      Faster and faster the pages turn on the Book as the
      blood red ink is scrawled across them. The pages flip
      furiously until the Book snaps shut, reveal ing its
      gruesome face on the cover.

      The book flaps violently away from camera.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               The Book of the Dead was last seen
               in 1300 A.D.

      CAMERA panning down to reveal a magnificent newly built
      castle of stone.  Bright banners fly from its turrets.
      An ox grazes nearby.  4 Warriors on horseback in the BG.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               It was then that the dark spirits
               again rose up to battle the living.

      The ground in front of the castle begins to split apart.
      A red glow and smoke pour from the growing crevice.
      Something evil is being unleashed.  A strong wind kicks
      up blowing sand in a furious rage.

      TRACKING SHOT - ASH

      Through the blowing silt, a lone figure appears.  An
      image of power and light.  His clothing is ragged,
      and he holds what appears to be a jagged toothed
      longsword.  Two massive columns of stone stand on
      either side.  CAMERA slowly moves closer, but his face
      is still hidden by the darkness and blowing sands.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               It is said that a hero came from the
               sky.  A man who defeated this evi and
               buried the Book in the Castle of Kandar.
               And there it lay for 700 years...

6     EXT. CASTLE OF KAN DAR - DAY - RUINS                  6

      As the raging dust storm clears to reveal the same
      castle which we saw earlier, but now, in a ruined state.
      It has aged 700 years.  The ox is gone.  Now only its
      petrified skeletal remains stand in a weathered heap.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               ...Waiting.

      A four wheel drive vehicle roars PAST THE CAMERA and
      toward the castle.


7     INT. CASTLE OF KAN DAR - DAY - (STUDIO)               7
      TRACKING SHOT

      The CAMERA slowly tracks in toward the Book of the
      Dead as it sits in the darkness of the stone tomb.
      Next to it rests the KANDARIAN DAGGER, an ancient
      knife, its handle fashioned from the skull of a
      weasel. They rest upon a small pedestal covered
      with cobwebs. Prominently displayed on the stone wall,
      a bas relief of the "Hero from the Sky" holding his
      unusual jagged edged weapon.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               And then...

      The grinding of rock scraping against rock is heard,
      and a large stone is swung open on a secret hinge in
      the wall behind the book. Wind sweeps in through the
      tomb, along with the blinding light from outside. A
      sharply silhouetted figure steps in the newly created
      doorway. The figure lights a torch that he holds,
      illuminating his face.  This is PROFESSOR RAYMOND
      KNOWBY.  An intelligent, grey bearded man in his late
      fifties. He lowers the cloth around his face that had
      been protecting him from the sand.  He stares at the
      Book, awestruck.

      Behind him, two other figures appear in the entrance of
      the tomb. The first is a large school-marmish woman,
      the wife of Raymond Knowby, HENRIETTA. She moves to
      Raymond's side and takes his hand.  Immediately behind
      her is their daughter, ANNIE KNOWBY; twenty-four years
      old, strong stance and beautiful.  Behind her a
      handsome looking man, ED GETLY, enters the tomb.  He
      moves to Annie's side.  They exchange excited glances.
      The CAMERA PANS down to the Book.

      LONG SHOT

      An old log cabin, built in the valley of a dark forest.
      A great wind billows fog about the place.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               Professor Raymond Knowby and his wife,
               HENRIETTA, brought the book to a small
               cabin where they could study it
               undisturbed.


10    INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          10

      Professor Raymond Knowby sits at a writing desk and
      transcribes passages from the Book of the Dead.  A
      small framed photograph of his daughter Annie sits
      upon the table.  Behind him, HENRIETTA sits knitting in
      a rocking chair.


11    CLOSE SHOT - RAYMOND                                  11

      He speaks the phonetic pronunciation of completed
      sentences into the microphone of a tape recorder.

               sobar...Ear-Grets, Gat, ...Nos-feratos
               ...Amantos...Kanda!

      The sound of RAYMOND reciting the passages is faded
      down AS THE CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS away from RAYMOND and
      over to HENRIETTA as she rocks back into the darkness
      and forward into the light.  As she rocks forward into
      the light, she comes into FULL CLOSEUP revealing that her
      eyes have changed to a milky white.  She continues to
      knit.

13    INT. CABIN CELLAR - NIGHT (STUDIO)                    13

      A dank fruit cellar with shelves of half-rotten
      preserves.  Raymond has his back to the stone wall.
      He is dictating into the tape recorder, sweating and
      distraught.

					RAYMOND
               It has only been a few hours since
               I've translated and spoke aloud the first
               of the demon resurrection passages from
               the Book of the Dead.

      The sound of heavy footsteps.  Dust drifts down INTO
      FRAME.  Raymond looks up to the ceiling of the cellar.
      It is also the floor to the main room of the cabin.
      He watches in horror as Henrietta's silhouette paces the
      floor above him.  And then, the footsteps halt.

					RAYMOND
               And now, I fear that my wife has become
               host to a Kandarian demon.  May God forgive
               me for what I have unleashed onto this
               earth.


13Y   REVERSE ACTION                                        13Y

      The milky eyed possessed figure of HENRIETTA jolts quickly
      into the frame, and shrieks in the voice of a demon!
      Raymond Knowby screams.  He drops the microphone.

      ROUNDY-ROUNDY - CAMERA MOUNTED ATOP VAN

      CAMERA MOVING swiftly down a dark tunnel. A light
      at the end growing closer. The SOUND of AIR RUSHING
      BY. The Delta 88 Oldsmobile comes ROARING out of
      the tunnel with a BLAST of AIR, and the sound of
      loud rock and roll music.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               It was one week later that a group
               of college students came to the cabin.


14A   EXT. CABIN - NIGHT - TRACKING SHOT                    14A

      The Delta 88 Oldsmobile parked out front.  Fog roars
      past the place.  We faintly hear waltz music from
      within.  The silhouette of a woman sweeps by the rear
      bedroom window.


14B   INT. CABIN - REAR BEDROOM - NIGHT                     14B
      ASH AND LINDA

      LINDA, an attractive college student, is waltzing in
      the semi darkness of the bedroom.  She wears a "Michigan
      State University" sweatshirt.  She hums melodically to
      the music as she moves.  Around her neck is draped a
      delicate silver necklace.


14C   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH AND LINDA                           14C

      A handsome young man, ASH, is playing the waltz music
      on an old wooden piano.  Linda dances behind him.  Ash
      is not a very good pianist, and can only plunk out the
      melody with two fingers.

                              LINDA
               Ash, what's that you're playing?

                              ASH
               Our song.

      Ash begins to play faster.

      spin.


14E   CLOSE SHOT - LINDA                                    14E

      Out of breath, hair tousled across her eyes, she
      stares deeply into Ash's eyes.  Her lips, parted,
      in a sensual manner.


14F   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      14F

      He returns her stare, lost in her beauty.  He pulls
      her close.

                              LINDA
               Ow!


14G   SHE PULLS AWAY SUDDENLY                               14G

      And looks down to the tiny silver necklace that she
      wears about her neck.

               I really love it.  I'll never take
               it off.

      They kiss and now begin to dance together, to the
      haunting waltz melody that sweeps up upon the soundtrack.

               It was in the cabin's cellar that they
               found the Professor's tape recorder,
               and the Book of the Dead.


14J   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          14J

      CAMERA tracks in toward the trap door.  It opens by
      itself as we move down the steps into the blackness.


15    MEDIUM SHOT - INT. CABIN CELLAR - NIGHT               15

      The CAMERA pans down from the blackness to Ash who
      finds a shotgun, Raymond Knowby's tape recorder,
      tapes, the Kandarian dagger and...

      The group of students sit about the fire as they listen
      to the tape recorder. Coming from the speaker is the voice
      of Raymond Knowby reciting the demon resurrection passage.

      Linda takes Ash's hand.  She's frightened.  Ash smiles
      to comfort her.  She nervously fingers the silver locket
      she wears about her neck.

20    EXT. CABIN - NIGHT                                    20

      The cabin is in the distance.  In the foreground the
      earth begins to swell, then rips apart as a red glow
      emanates from beneath.  Something evil is being
      unleashed.

                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
               One by one, they fell to the possession
               of the dark spirits.

      ASH AND LINDA

      Possessed Linda is coming after Ash.  Ash back peddles,
      stumbles and falls.

      Ash buries Linda's headless body.  He jams a crude

      of lightning strikes.

      and tosses it onto the flames.

      FINAL SHOT OF EVIL DEAD I

      We are racing forward.  We have taken the POV of
      an EVIL ENTITY as it glides with dark purpose through
      a section of woods. It approaches the rear door of the
      cabin.  The door is torn violently open.  The next door
      falls away from us.  We approach the front door. SLAM! It
      jigsaws in two and we are again outside, now in front of
      the cabin.  Ash is seen in the distance.  He is staggering
      away, his back to us as we race at him.  He turns suddenly
      towards CAMERA and screams.

      The final shot of Evil Dead I has a new ending; an
      extension. Ash is caught by an invisible grip.
      "G" force is distorting Ash's face as he is rocketed
      backwards.  He is swept hand over foot through the
      air.  He reaches the edge of the woods and begins
      tearing through the branches and smaller trees,
      clearing a path with his body.  He finally slams into
      a large ungiving tree trunk and he is knocked
      unconscious.

      He lifts his face from the mud, and turns toward us.
      His eyes have gone white. His skin is now a pale color,
      his lips, jet black.  He is Possessed.  A bright edge of
      morning sunlight moves across his face.  He turns his
      beastly face skyward.

      Ash, no longer possessed, collapses into the mud puddle,
      unconscious.


41B   EXT. WOODS - DAY - REVERSE ACTION - FOG - 3 ANGLES    41B

      Streams of morning sunlight pierce the darkness of the
      woods.  We hear the shriek of demons.  The sound of
      SIZZLING.  A great wind blows back fog into the darker
      sections of the woods.  The scene grows brighter and
      the peaceful sounds of morning are faded up.

      vast area of empty woods around Ash.

      A hideous human skull with living eyeballs that stare
      out at us with evil malice.  The eyes stare out from
      the two dark windows.  The dark nose area is the open
      doorway, and the rotted teeth of the skull are the
      whitewashed stones placed at the foot of the cabin.
      Then it fades, leaving only the cabin.

      Ash MOVES INTO A CLOSE UP.  His eyes shift back and forth
      like a trapped animal as he looks about for a means of
      escape.  He spots something.

      A narrow dirt road cutting through the woods. Then,
      the Delta 88 roars down it, and past the CAMERA.  It
      kicks up dust and gravel.

      Ash is driving.  He wipes the mud and blood from his

      A GIANT STEEL HAND LOOMS towards us. It is the twisted
      remains of the steel and wood bridge that crossed
      a great mountain chasm.  A LOUD SCREECH of brakes
      is heard on the soundtrack on this cut.

      A sign hangs from the twisted girders.  It reads:
      "DANGEROUS BRIDGE - 2 TON WEIGHT LIMIT - CROSS AT OWN
      RISK."  Beyond this we see the twisted remnants of the
      former bridge and the rock cliffs far away on the other

      bridge, to the road behind him.  He moves in halting
      steps, not knowing which way to turn.

      Ash opens his mouth, draws in his breath, and just as
      he begins to scream, we CUT TO:

      As it rises up from what appears to be the mountain
      chasm and reveals the opposite side of the twisted
      girders which form the "Giant Hand."  It spots Ash
      immediately beyond.  It moves swiftly towaad him.
      Ash looks up, sensing the evil and darts into the
      Delta 88.  The FORCE moves through the twisted girders,
      pushing them away violently and races towaad the car.

      The Delta starts up and peels off.  The Evil Force
      just misses it.  The car doesn't have the room to
      complete the one hundred and eighty degree turn
      necessary to head back down the road the way it
      originally came, and is forced into a line of break-
      away trees which explode into sawdust as the front of
      the Delta 88 rips through them.  The car swerves
      onto the road, headed back toward the cabin.

      in place in the rear of a camera car that is slowly
      backing away from the cabin.)  The more he runs, the
      farther away from the cabin he gets.

      We race into the cabin, splintering the hall door
      which Ash had swung shut.  Ash retreats into the
      rear hallway, and swings the hallway door shut.  We race
      right up to the door and it shatters into many pieces
      as we glide forward.

      Camera moves through the main room and up to the

      in on Ash as he races down the hallway.  We lose him
      as he swings into the back bedroom of the cabin and
      slams the door behind him.  We rip through this door
      and enter the rear bedroom, only to see Ash scrambling
      for the door to the middle bedroom, which we approach
      and he swings shut in our face.  We rip through to
      reveal Ash scurrying into the Hallway.  We follow him
      through the bathroom, the maze, and back out into the
      Hallway.  We round the corner after him and see that
      Ash has led us into the main room, but there is not a
      trace of him.  We look about for him, but he is gone.
      The hallway is bare except for a few dry leaves.

      The force begins to pull back with an ever-increasing
      speed, out the front door of the cabin, and deep into
      the blackness of the woods.


85    INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          85

      A static shot of the fireplace.  All is quiet.  Smoke
      from the near dead fire wafts up the chimney.  We hold
      on this for a moment.


85A   ANGLE - MIDDLE BEDROOM CLOSET - NIGHT                 85A

      A static shot of a closet with it's door half open.
      The door begins to swing slightly open, revealing
      a rack of clothes inside.  We hold on this for a
      moment.


85B   ANGLE - CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT - TRACKING SHOT       85B

      A writing desk with some papers atop it.  They begin
      to tremble and finally blow away from the light breeze
      that sweeps through the cabin.  The CAMERA PANS down
      from this desk to reveal a trap door in the floor of
      the main room.  The trap door to the cellar.  It is
      raised up on its hinge an inch or so and in that
      slight space between the trap door and the floor we
      see Ash's eyes, looking cautiously about.  He breathes
      a sigh of relief.

      Ed Getly stands in the FG and watches as an older
      style twin engine cargo plane flies over the camera
      and lands.


149L  AIRSTRIP - NIGHT - TRACKING SHOT - PASSENGERS         149L

      The airplane rolls to a halt.  A man wearing a
      jumpsuit ties the airplane off and blocks the wheels
      while a redcap opens the hatch and helps out Annie
      Knowby.  She carries a glass case in her hand as she
      moves toward us.  Behind her five other passengers
      emerge from the Plane.  Ed approaches Annie.

                              ED
               Annie!

                              ANNIE
                         (smiling at sight of him)
               Hi.

      They embrace and kiss.

                              ED
               How'd everything go on the expedition?

                              ANNIE
               Terrific.  I found the additional pages
               from the Book of the Dead.

                              ED
               So you said in the telegram.  What
               condition are they in?

      She holds out the glass case for Ed to look at.

               Haven't aged a day in three thousand years.

                              ANNIE
               Maybe longer.

                              ED
               When do we begin the translations?

                              ANNIE
               Tonight.  Is everything all set with my
               father?

                              ED
               Should be, but I haven't spoken to him
               in a week, what with no phone in that
               cabin.  Take us about an hour to get there.

      They arrive at the parking lot.  Two new, sharp looking
      cheverolets and Ed's old style cheverolet.

                              ED
               We'll take my car.

      Ed opens the car trunk.  Behind him a redcap pulls up
      a large steamer trunk on a hand dolly.  Ed and the redcap
      hoist the steamer up into the car's trunk.

                              ED
               Annie, you hinted in your telegram that
               your father was on to something with the
               first part of his translations.  What's
               the big mystery?  What has he found in
               The Book of the Dead?

                              ANNIE
               Maybe nothing.  But just possibly...
               the doorway to another world?

      Annie slams the car trunk.

      CHEVROLET CAR TRUNK

      CAMERA has taken the POV of the evil force as it glides
      eerily through the woods, around trees and over rotted
      stumps.  It moves over a rise revealing a clear view
      of the boarded cabin in the distance.  It approaches.
      It moves to the window, and peering through the cracks
      in the boards we see Ash asleep in the rocking chair.


152   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          152

      Camera begins on hammer, nails, and planking which
      lay upon the cabin floor.  Camera pans to window #1.
      It is boarded up tight.  Camera pans to door.  It
      is repaired.  Camera pans to Ash who sleeps in the
      rocking chair in front of another boarded window.

      Ash awakens suddenly, sensing something, the
      shotgun clutched in his lap.  He lifts his head and
      turns to a whispering musical sound.  Harp like music.
      It is coming from the back bedroom of the cabin.

      bedroom.


154   ASH'S POV - MIDDLE ROOM AND REAR BEDROOM              154

      As he approaches the rear bedroom, the music grows louder.
      As he enters the room he halts his gaze on the old wooden
      piano.

      MEDIUM SHOT - ASH

      As he moves to the piano.  The sound is coming from
      within.  Suddenly, the piano begins to play by itself;
      Ash draws back from it.  It plays a waltz.  Now the
      piano music mixing with the harp-like strings.  The
      radiator next to the piano begins to release bursts of
      musical steam, adding a wind section to this strange
      orchestra.


156   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      156

      As he listens to this haunting version of a waltz melody.
      He recognizes the music.  It is the same music that Ash
      had played earlier, when Linda was dancing.


157   CLOSE SHOT - PIANO AND RADIATOR                       157

      As steam spouts from the radiator pipes.  As the piano
      keys depress and release themselves.  The melody grows
      louder.


158   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      158

      As he lowers his head.  His horror gives way to sadness.
      From his pocket he removes Linda's delicate silver locket
      that dangles from the end of a chain.  In the locket's
      center is a magnifying glass.  He stares mournfully into
      the glass.  BANG!  He looks up sharply toward the main
      room.

      Wind sweeps in through the place as the curtains flutter
      wildly.  Through the window is a sweeping fog.

      The tiny figure of Ash can be seen looking off toward
      this hill.  In the foreground is a crude burial cross
      and a mound of earth.  The earth begins to crack and
      splinter.  The wooden cross caves in and is swallowed
      as the headless corpse of Linda pulls itself to its
      feet.  The HAUNTING WALTZ MELODY sweeps through the
      night air.

      The WALTZ MELODY fills the sound track, and the rotting
      corpse that was Linda begins to dance, bending and
      swaying as she sweeps gracefully through the evening
      fog.  A waltz of the dead.

      The style of dance begins to change.  It becomes more
      primitive.  The music changes to a more primal beat.
      The dance becomes sexually oriented.  Erotic, with
      sharp pelvic thrusts and gyrating hip motions.

      As it leaps through the air and gracefully situates

      head remains in place, never taking her eyes from Ash.
      With a sensual twirl and leap, she disappears into the
      evening mists.

      clamped to his hand.

      The door to the place is kicked open, revealing Ash

      full of sawdust, chains and power tools.  Old bones
      hang from the walls.

187C  CLOSE SHOT - ASH - HEADLESS LINDA BODY                187C

      Confused.  Wondering what has happened to the

      open and in comes the flailing, headless, body of
      Linda, charging at Ash with the chainsaw buzzing high
      above her head.  Ash is screaming.

      shower of sparks, sending the buzzing saw flipping
      backward.

      The blade of the chainsaw swings upward and arcs
      back into headless Linda, imbedding itself in her
      neck.  She goes nuts as the chainsaw bites its way
      into her chest cavity.  She spins wildly about the
      room knocking into shelves as she tries to pull the
      blade free.  She slams against the wall of the shed,
      and slumps to the floor, the chainsaw still buzzing.

      She is no longer possessed.  She looks as she did
      earlier in the film.  A vision of beAuty.  She is
      again Linda, the woman Ash loved.  Tears roll down from
      her eyes.

                              LINDA
               Please Ash, help me.  I love
               you, please don't hurt me.

      Trying to fight his feelings, he knows what he must
      do.  He pumps the throttle on the saw.

      Pleading with him.

                              LINDA

               NO!


187O  CLOSE SHOT - LINDA'S HEAD                             187O

      Once again fully possessed, and speaking in the voice
      of the demon.  Her eyes again white, her flesh, rotten.

                              LINDA'S HEAD
               YES!  YOU LIED TO HER! YOU LIED TO

               NOW SHE BURNS IN HELL!

187Q  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      187Q

      As he's drenched in the face.  Linda begins to laugh at
      him in a wild, high pitched squeal.

      He gains control of himself and steadies the saw.

                              ASH
               Eat chainsaw.

      He brings down the spinning blade.  And moves past
      the CAMERA and towards the head.  We are left looking
      at the wall of the work shed upon which we see the
      stark shadow of the ghastly deed.  We hear the sound
      of spinning steel meeting bone and the screams of a
      demon.


187R  CLOSE SHOT - LIGHT BULB                               187R

187S  MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     187S

      Ash stumbles back into frame and falls against the
      wall, now lit in crimson.  He looks at the off screen
      carnage in terror.  He begins to shake as though in
      shock.  He trembles as he looks down at his
      hands; they are covered in Linda's blood.

      He wipes his hands on his pants and shirt, trying
      to rid himself of it, but only succeeds in painting
      himself with the stuff.  Ash screams a wild scream of
      fear and despair.  It echoes off into the night.


188   CRANE SHOT - EXT. WORK SHED - NIGHT                   188

      Ash in a confused state as he staggers from the

      the chainsaw.


189   INT. CABIN REAR DOORWAY - NIGHT                       189

      Ash enters through the doorway.  He pushes the door
      shut behind him and halts.  We hear a creaking sound.
      It is coming from the main room of the cabin.  He
      moves in the direction of the sound.


189A  ASH'S POV - REAR HALLWAY - NIGHT                      189A
      TRACKING SLOWLY FORWARD

      Curtains flutter on the partially boarded windows of
      the hall.  Ash moves slowly past them and towards the
      main room ahead.  The gentle creaking sound grows
      louder.  Ash tosses down the saw and picks up the gun.


189B  INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          189B

      Ash enters from the hallway and turns his head to the
      sound.


189C  MAIN ROOM - NIGHT - ASH'S POV - THE ROCKING CHAIR     189C

      It rocks back and forth with a definitive motion,
      halting for a moment at it's pints furthest forward
      and backward, as if some invisible thing was sitting
      there and rocking.


189D  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      189D

      He slowly approaches the chair, scared shitless.


189E  MEDIUM SHOT - FROM BEHIND THE ROCKING CHAIR           189E

      The chair rocks in and out of frame in the foreground
      as Ash takes halting steps towards it.  Ash gathers
      his courage and reaches out his hand to halt the
      rocking motion.  Slowly his hand approaches the chair.
      Just as his hand goes to touch it, the chair abruptly
      halts, on its own accord.


190   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     190

      In a confused state as he backs away from the chair and
      into the wall.  He turns and comes face to face with
      himself in a hanging framed mirror.  He clutches at his
      face, trying to reassure himself of his sanity.

                              ASH
               I'm fine... I'm fine...


191   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM/MIRROR ROOM - NIGHT              191
      MEDIUM SHOT - OVER ASH'S SHOULDER - ASH AND REFLECTION

      Ash's reflection becomes an independent entity.  It
      reaches out of the mirror and grabs ahold of Ash by his
      throat.  The reflection looks like a Mr. Hyde version of
      Ash.  Sweating and nasty looking.


192   SIDE SHOT - SPLIT SCREEN - ASH AND REFLECTION         192
      MITCHELL CAMERA (ASH AS MR. HYDE)

      The reflection pulls Ash close and speaks to him in an
      intimate whisper.

                              REFLECTION
               I don't think we're "fine".  We're
               losing it...  starting to slip.  We
               just cut up our girlfriend with a
               chainsaw.  Does that sound fine?

      The reflection tightens its hold on Ash's throat and
      begins to strangle him.

      Two hands in the bottom of frame, throttling him.
      CAMERA races back to reveal Ash's own hands on his throat.
      There is no sign of Ash's evil reflection.  Ash has
      been strangling himself.  He realizes this the same
      moment we do.  He quickly pulls his hands away, looks at
      them incredulously, then to the mirror.


194   OVER ASH'S SHOULDER - INTO MIRROR                     194

      INTERVOLOMETER

      The bite marks that Linda's teeth have left in the hand
      stand out sharply.  The wound suddenly blackens and
      spiderwebs it's infection across the entire surface of the
      hand.

      CLOSE SHOT - ASH - HAND IN FOREBROUND - MAKE UP BLADDER EFX

      The hand quivers and shakes, now out of Ash's control.
      The hand has taken a whitish cast.  It's veins throb and
      pulsate.  It is possessed by the evil force.  The hand's
      fingernails grow inches.  The wound oozes black fluid.
      Ash is repulsed.


198   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      198

      Ash's demon hand makes a lunge at his face which is
      countered by his good hand.


199   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     199

      He slams the hand to the cabin floor.  He screams to
      the air:

                              ASH
               You bastards.  Give me back my hand.

      SCREAM is heard above the HOWLING GALE.

      Ash rushes into the kitchen and places his hand in
      the sink.  He turns on the faucet.


205   INT. CABIN KITCHEN - NIGHT                            205

      Cool water runs over Ash's burned hand.  Ash rests his
      head on the kitchen counter and mumbles reassurances to
      himself.

                              ASH
               Can't... can't be happening.


206   CLOSE SHOT - THE HAND                                 206

      As the water pours over it.  It grabs a plate sitting
      in the dishwater and reaches up silently out of the sink.


207   MEDIUM SHOT                                           207

      The plate is shattered over Ash's head.  The
      hand grabs Ash's hair and mercilessly slams his
      head down upon the kitchen counter again and again.
      Ash punches himself in the face and is sent reeling
      backwards.  He smashes into a cupboard where dishes
      and plates fall upon him.


208   CLOSE SHOT                                            208

      Ash is knocked unconscious.  The hand continues breaking
      objects over his head.  Ash lies unmoving, but still
      alive.


210   CLOSE SHOT                                            210

      The hand stops as though it senses something.  The
      CAMERA PANS to a large meat cleaver which lies upon the
      wooden floor.


211   MEDIUM SHOT                                           211

      The hand as it independently crawls towards the meat
      cleaver.  The hand is stopped when it runs out of arm,
      now anchored by Ash's unconscious body.

      As it pulls Ash's unconscious body along after it. The
      hand clutches the meat cleaver when a large knife comes
      slicing through the demon hand, pinning it to the
      floorboards.  CAMERA pulls over to reveal a revived Ash.

                              ASH
               Who's laughing now?


214A  ANGLE - ASH - COMEDY KNIFE RIG                        214A

      He reaches over with his good hand and pulls a fire
      engine red chainsaw down from the shelf.

      He holds the body of the machine between his legs and,
      with his good hand, pulls the starter cord.  The
      CHAINSAW ROARS to life.  The CAMERA TRACKS IN to Ash's
      sweating face.

                              ASH
               Who's laughing now!?

      He lowers the spinning blade of the chainsaw down out
      of frame and toward the evil hand.  Blood flies up
      into frame.

      A red tow truck with its orange lights flashing is
      parked there. Painted on it's side is "Jake's Gas
      N' Go." Jake, a toothless, backwoods, greasemonkey is
      setting up flares and wooden roadblocks.  Annie and Ed
      approach.

                              ANNIE

      Bobby Joe takes a pinch of chewing tobacco and stuffs
      it into her mouth.  She doesn't like Annie and her
      fancy clothes.  She stares at Annie like a cat.

               that's right... There is a trail.
               You could follow Bobby Joe and me.

      leads the way with flashlight in hand.  She pockets
      some bills.  She is followed by Annie and Ed who
      carry the glass case containing the missing pages
      and the handbag.  A grunting and sweating Jake brings
      up the rear, the large steamer trunk on his back.
      He is cursing under his breath.

                              JAKE
               Jesus H. Christ!  I thought she
               was talkin' 'bout them two goddamn
               little pieces!

227   EXT. CABIN - NIGHT                                    227

      The wind rushes fog about the place with a fury.
      A large moon hangs in the night sky.


228   INT. CABIN MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                          228
      CLOSE SHOT - EVIL HAND

      No longer attached to Ash's arm, it still writhes about
      beneath Ash's foot which pins it to the floor.


229   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH - HAND'S POV - EYEMO W/ MOUNT       229

      As he grabs the steel wastebasket, dumps out the trash
      lowers it quickly over the CAMERA, trapping the hand
      within.


230   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     230

      With a note of finality, Ash slams down a pile of books
      atop the overturned wastecan, to anchor it.  The top
      book's title reads "Farewell to Arms".


231   FIREPLACE                                             231

      Ash raises a red hot fireplace shovel that had been
      resting upon the coals.  He grits his teeth.


232   ANGLE                                                 232

      Just out of frame, Ash thrusts the glowing shovel against
      the stump to cauterize the wound.  Red steam hisses up
      into frame as Ash screams.


233   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     233

      He tosses aside the shovel and douses his smoldering
      stump into a vase of fresh flowers.


234   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      234

      Unspooling a roll of duct tape.


235   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     235

      He tapes the tablecloth into a makeshift bandage
      about his wrist.  Behind him, the wastebasket
      silently slides across the floor.


236   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     236

      "CLANG"! He turns to see.


237   CLOSE SHOT - THE WASTEBASKET                          237

      Upon its side.  The Evil Hand is gone.


237A  CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      237A

      He turns to a "pitter patter" sound.

      It scampers across the floorboards headed for a hole
      in the wall.

      TRACKING WITH HAND, ASH IN BG

      He raises the shotgun and FIRES.  BLAM!  The floor
      next to the hand explodes.


249   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN THE WALL - SQUIB - EFX. HAND     249

      The hand leaps into the hole as a section of wall next
      to it EXPLODES.  Blam!


250   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      250

      Ash quickly reloads both chambers of the gun.
      He tracks the SOUND of the PITTER PATTER as the hand
      scampers through the sapace behind the wall like a rat.

254   ASH'S POV - WALL - SQUIB                              254

      The blasted hole at the bottom of the wall.  The hand
      appears, still unhurt, waving and taunting at Ash.


255   CLOSE SHOT - ANIMATED HAND - (7 SEC.)                 255

      As it taunts ASH it inadvertently sidesteps into a
      rusting mousetrap.  SNAP!  It springs shut upon the
      hand.  It screams furiously and shakes violently in
      an effort to get free the from trap.


256   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      256

      Throws back his head in a gruff bark of laughter.

                              ASH
               Ha!


257   CLOSE SHOT - ANIMATED HAND - (7 SEC.)                 257

      The hand throws the trap from itself and raises its
      middle finger to ASH, flipping him the bird.


258   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S HAND                               258

      He raises the gun, revealing his face as the
      CAMERA PANS UP with his movement.


259   ASH'S POV - OVER THE GUN BARREL                       259

      Pointed directly at the hand.  But the hand dodges
      away from the hole, disappearing again behind the
      wall.  The gun continues to track the evil hand's
      progress through its pitter patter sound.


260   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S EAR                                260

      The pitter patter ebbs and then peaks in volume.


261   ASH'S POV - OVER THE GUN BARREL - SQUIB               261

      Both triggers are squeezed.  BLAM!  BLAM! A 2nd and
      3rd hole are blown in the wall.  All is silent.


261A  INSERT ASH'S FINGER PULLS THE FIRST, THEN             261A
      SECOND TRIGGER


261B  INSERT FLAME BELCHES FROM THE GUN TWICE               261B


262   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      262

      As he lowers the smoking gun.  Wondering if he has hit
      the hand or not.


263   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS                 263

      All is silent for a moment, and then a slight trickle
      of blood comes dripping from the hole and down the
      side of the wall.


264   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      264

      For the first time feeling victorious.  As Ash continues
      to stare at the hole, his expression changes to one of
      perplexity.


265   CLOSE SHOT - HOLE IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS                 265

      The trickle of blood has increased to a steady flow,
      then, even this volume of blood multiplies.  It is
      forced out of the wall with a greater and greater
      pressure until blood pours from the wall like a fire
      hose.


266   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      266

      Horrified, he spins his glance to the sound of more
      gushing liquid.  He is hit in the face with a geyser
      of deep red blood.


267   CLOSE SHOT - 2ND AND 3RD HOLES IN WALL - 5 CAMERAS    267

      The 2nd and 3rd holes in wall also begin to spew blood
      in a geyser.  The CAMERA PANS over to the 4th of the
      holes.  This, too, is an eruption of blood.  The blood
      changes in color to a black fluid, then yellow, then
      turquoise.


268   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                          268

      Screaming as he looks down at his wrist.  CAMERA PANS
      DOWN to it.  The severed wrist begins dribbling blood.
      Then in a burst, it too, erupts in a hellish fire hose.
      It spouts blood under such great pressure that ASH is
      driven against the walls of the cabin because of it.


269   MED. SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                           269

      We follow him as he slams from one wall into another.


270   CLOSE SHOT - ASH - 5 CAMERAS                          270

      In the midst of his scream, drowning in the blood, it
      all suddenly stops.  The cabin is again deadly quiet.
      ASH, soaked in blood and shivering, waits.  For what,
      he's not sure.


271   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH                                     271

      As he slowly backs away from the walls and sits upon
      the three legged chair.  It shatters beneath him,
      dumping him on his butt.

      CREAK!!!

      ASH turns sharply to the low sound.


272   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                272

      The mounted moose head upon the wall.  It is in a
      different position.  It turns sharply towards ASH and
      emits a hideous cackle.


273   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      273

      He pulls back in fear, then turns to the sound of more
      laughter.


274   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                274

      The desk lamp on its steel swivel rises and falls in
      synchronization with its wheezing laughter.  Ah ha ha
      ha ha.  Ahhhh ha ha ha ha!


275   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      275

      Terrified, he turns to more laughter.


276   ASH'S POV - CLOSE SHOT                                276

      A line of 12 old books upon the shelf flap open and
      closed violently as they emit a chorus of sharp laughs.
      Ash turns.


276A  CLOSE SHOT                                            276A

      Other books upon the floor laugh.


277   MEDIUM SHOT - OVER ASH'S SHOULDER                     277

      He turns sharply toward us and breaks into an
      uproariously frightening bout of laughter.


278   WIDE SHOT - ASH                                       278

      The wooden door behind Ash comes to life.  It
      stretches out as though it were elastic with each of
      its own low and terrible laughs.


279   WIDE SHOT - MAIN ROOM - TRACKING SHOT                 279
      RIGGING FOR TRAP DOOR, CABINETS, CLOCK

      Ash and everything in it are having the time of their
      lives.  Ash leads the bunch laughing harder and
      harder.


279A  MEDIUM SHOT - HAND HELD - FRONT DOOR AND ASH          279A

      KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK!

      The room's laughter suddenly stops.  Ash instantly
      terrified, grabs up the shotgun and fires into the
      door.  Blam!  Blam!

      PAN to the front door.

      Two holes are blown into the door.  We hear a short
      shrill scream and then all is quiet.

      Ash opens the front door.  It slowly swings inward
      with a creak revealing the empty night.


283   MEDIUM SHOT - ASH AND JAKE                            283

      Ash approaches the front porch as Jake enters sharply
      into his frame.  Jake tackles Ash.

      Ed enters and holds Ash down as Jake slugs him twice.
      Ash's fist comes up into frame catching Jake on the
      jaw.  Jake pulls back his fist and rockets a piledriver
      blow to Ash's face, knocking him senseless.

      She holds her shoulder where the shell has grazed her.

                              JAKE
               You gonna be alright, honey?

                              BOBBY JOE

287   MEDIUM SHOT - JAKE, ED, ANNIE, AND BOBBY JOE          287

                              JAKE
               You know this son of a bitch?

                              ED

      Annie steps forward.

                              ANNIE
               Oh my God.  Where are my parents?

      Annie sets down the glass case containing the pages
      of the Book of the Dead.

      shirt and violently shakes him.

                              ANNIE
               What the hell did you do to them?

      to the trap door that leads to the cellar.

               We'll throw him in there.

      the trap door. Half conscious, Ash feebly struggles
      with Jake.

                              JAKE
               Crazy buck's gone blood simple.

               These are my father's things.

      She turns on the tape recorder.  High pitched feedback
      and the professor's screams come from the speaker.

                              PROFESSOR KNOWBY
                         (Voice on Tape)

      Ash's legs in the foreground.  Suddenly from the
      earthen floor of the fruit cellar a half-rotten human
      head juts up!  Just the eyes are above the surface of the
      dirt.  They dart about wildly and halt upon Ash.  Worms

      She turns her twisted body to face Ash.  Moths fly
      about her in a flurry.

                              HENRIETTA
               Someone's in my fruit cellar!

      With a sharp recoil, then spring, Henrietta makes a
      lunge at Ash.  Her face contorting, her teeth
      lengthening, her mouth opening impossibly wide
      as though she were going to swallow his head, and all as
      she lunges forward.  She changes to "Pee Wee" head.

      As he moves to help Jake, Henrietta swats at his jaw,
      knocking him backward into a picture frame. He shatters it
      with his head and slumps to the floor.

      Ash leaps down upon the trapdoor, slamming it to pin

      her back down into the cellar. The trap door shuts.
      Ash leaps atop it. The sound of Henrietta falling down

      ravings.  Ash quickly threads the chains through the
      eyeloops.

      They freeze in their tracks as they hear a gentle voice
      which sings a melancholy tune.  Annie turns her head
      to the sound and the CAMERA PANS TO reveal HENRIETTA whose
      head juts in the space between the floorboards and the
      trap door.  She is no longer possessed.  She looks as
      she did earlier in the film.  She is singing a gentle
      song to Annie.

               in here.

      it.  She shakes her head and looks to the cellar.

                              ANNIE
               No.  No.  I don't know what you
               are but you're not my mother.

                              VOICE OF HENRIETTA
               You were born September 2nd, 1962.  I
               remember it well because it was
               snowing.  So strange that it would
               be snowing in September.


348   CAMERA TRACKING IN ON ANNIE                           348

               That thing in the cellar is not
               my mother!

      Ed stands sharply into her frame.  His eyes bone white,
      his skin, the pale color of the dead.  His mouth has
      grown over large.  His lips are black.  He is possessed.
      He shrieks.  Annie screams and jumps back out of frame.

      stark shadow of possessed Ed which is cast upon the
      wall behind her.  We watch as the shadow of Ash with the

               Start up that saw and hand it here!
               We're gonna cut him up.

      Annie looks to the chainsaw and then to the unmoving body
      of Ed.  She is repulsed at the thought.

                              ANNIE
               No.

                              ASH

      Jake slowly stands into the empty frame. He is in shock
      from what he has just seen.  Annie slowly rises into
      frame - shaking her head in a silent "No." Ash slowly

      Jake sprays a can of air freshener about the room.
      He holds his nose.  Ash tosses a bloodied sheet,
      containing the remains of possessed Ed to the floor.
      It lands with a sickening thud.  Wiping his face with a
      rag, Ash moves off in disgust.  We hold on the bundled
      sheet as the trap door next to it silently opens.
      Henrietta's rotted hand emerges, unnoticed by the others
      in the room.

                              BOBBY JOE
               Jake, I can't take no more of this.

      Henrietta's rotted hand pulls the bundle of body
      parts silently down into the cellar and quietly
      closes the trap.

               well, it just ain't there no more.
               Like the woods jus' swallowed it.

      The room goes quiet.  The sound of the wind outside
      the cabin has died.  Jake and Bobby Joe cock their
      heads to this new silence.

      The wind in the room suddenly stops.  He blows out his
      breath and watches it vaporize.  The screaming face of
      Raymond Knowby emerges from the wall.  A life like
      spirit made of swirling smoke and mist.

                              RAYMOND

               There is a dark spirit here that
               wants to destroy you.  Your
               salvation lies in the pages

               Then who...?

      Bobby Joe raises her hand into frame, to reveal Ash's
      Evil Hand clutched in hers.  Bobby Joe goes nuts,
      screaming and flailing about trying to throw the hand
      from her.  She slams into the lantern, knocking it out.
      We lose them in the darkness.

      She runs deep into the woods, still looking behind her
      as she slams into a twisted oak tree that stops her flat.

      An angry face appears on the surface of the tree.  Its
      gnarled bark folds open to reveal very human like oversized
      eyes.  A large fold in its bark opens to form a gaping
      mouth dripping tree sap saliva.

                              ANNIE
               Recitation of the first passage will
               make this "Dark Spirit" manifest itself
               in the flesh.

                              ASH
               Why the hell would we want to do that?

      Annie thumbs through one or two of the other pages.

                              ANNIE
               Recitation of the second passage creates
               a kind of rift in time and space, and
               the physical manifestation of this spirit
               can be forced back through this rift...
               to an earlier time and place.  At least
               that's the best translation I can ....

               If you want to look for her,
               go ahead.

               She's dead by now.  With these pages
               we can...

      Jake grabs the pages from Annie's hand.

                              JAKE
               Those pages don't mean shit.

      Jake kicks the pages down into the cellar.  Ash and
      Annie look on in horror.

      All is quiet outside, no sign of Possessed Ash or
      Jake, and then Possessed Ash is there, emerging from
      the darkness suddenly.  He raises his finger and
      points to Annie.  He speaks in the low garbled voice
      of a demon:

                              POSSESSED ASH

      Annie enters the room.  She shudders from the

      upon the floor, and over to reveal the bashed out
      window and the curtains fluttering in the wind.


509F  MEDIUM SHOT - ANNIE                                   509F

      The NECKLACE of Linda.


517   CLOSE SHOT - POSSESSED ASH                            517

      The sight of the necklace strikes the human cord
      within him.  He is confused, his evil self, battling
      for control of his spirit and body.  He reaches to
      pick it up.


518   CLOSE SHOT - ASH'S HAND                               518

      As he slowly picks up the delicate silver necklace.
      He raises it to his face;

                              LINDA (V.O.)
               I'll never take it off.

      And then it hits him.  The emotion of love lost. It
      floods the monster that is ASH.  He clutches the
      necklace tightly to his bestial chest.  And as the
      Love/waltz theme sweeps up in volume on the sound
      track, the monster begins to cry.


519   WIDE SHOT - POSSESSED ASH AND ANNIE - TULIP CRANE     519

      crying for the one he has lost.

      pallor.  His blackened, infected cuts disappear.  The

               No.  WAIT!

      Annie swings the axe and again Ash ducks.  The head of
      the axe slams into the plastered wall smashing right
      through.

               Listen to me!  I'm all right
               now.  That thing is gone.

      Ash pushes her away.  Annie falls to the floor.  She
      stands.

      of the axe slices into the wall only a few inches from
      his head.

               GOD DAMN IT!  I said I was all
               right!!

      Annie is nearly choking.

                              ANNIE
               Okay.

      Ash releases her gently.  She again looks to Ash,
      cautiously.

                              ANNIE
               Are you sure?

                              ASH

      Hold down a clamp as ASH'S hand, creates screw sized
      holes in it with a battery powered drill.

      his bicep.


544   ASH'S HAND                                            544

      Slams down the chainsaw upon the table.  It is missing
      its side panel.  ASH'S arm enters frame and we see that
      it is this missing side panel that has been clamped to
      his stump.


545   CLOSER SHOT                                           545

      Ash extends his chainsaw arm, pulling on the starter
      cord.  The CHAINSAW ROARS to life.  With his free arm
      Ash raises the shotgun.  He lowers the blade of the
      chainsaw down upon the barrel.  Sparks fly as the saw
      cuts through it.  The long barrel falls to the floor.
      Ash is left with a sawed off shotgun in one hand and a
      chainsaw strapped to his other arm.

      With a fancy style western flip to the gun Ash saddles
      the shotgun in a makeshift holster, strapped
      to his back.

      The CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS into Ash's face.

                              ASH
               Groovy.

      In the distance, the tiny figures of Ash and Annie
      as they move from the workshed to the cabin.  In
      the foreground is a large oak tree.  A gnarled human-
      like face can be made out on the surface of the tree.
      It is lit from beneath and slolwly brought up on a
      dimmer.  A horrible twisted tree face.  It suddenly
      opens its mouth and breathes in a gust of air with
      a terrible wheezing sound, as though in great pain
      at being brought to life.  It turns sharply towards
      the cabin.

      In the foreground is the base of a large oak tree.  The
      cabin in the distance.  A rumbling is heard.  Then
      suddenly the tree pulls one of its massive roots from
      the earth.  The tree sets its root down a few feet closer
      to the cabin.

               Did you find her?

                              ASH
               ... rid of.

      darkness beyond.  Ash enters.  Again he hears the slight
      sound, a gentle ticking.


578   INT. CELLAR - REAR ROOM - NIGHT - ASH'S POV           578

      The ticking sound is coming from behind a hanging drape.

      He approaches the drape, reaches out his hand and pulls

      and steaming.

                         (In a whisper)
               She got hungry.

      Ash turns from the skeleton and quickly gathers up the
      remaining pages from the Book of the Dead.  Getting
      scared now, he backs into the cellar's front room.

      As they climb. From behind the wooden steps, the
      horrible head of Henrietta appears.  Her two rotting hands
      grab at Ash's ankles.

      As she kneels down at the trapdoor, about to call down

      quickly up into the main room from the cellar.  A
      flurry of moths about her.

      As her head springs down into frame and halts suddenly
      inches from his face.  In the silence we hear the reason:

      Annie's voice singing the same melody that her mother
      had sung to her earlier from the cellar.  For a moment
      Henrietta's face loses its evil malice.  She is confused
      at this sound.

      Henrietta halts.  She spins her head toward Annie.

      and clouds.  And nightmarish sound effects.

      Objects come AT US from the distance and roar past, an
      uprooted tree, the grandfather clock with its hands
      winding backwards at an incredible rate, Ash spinning
      AT US, hand over foot, screaming.  The chainsaw still
      mounted to his wrist.

      ASH

      The vortex is distorting Ash's features as he is
      rocketed back through the dark void of time.

      A wild and rapid pictorial collage of human history
      winding back from the present through the centuries
      lasting seven seconds.

      WIDE SHOT

      A hole opens in the air with a sharp CRACKLING SOUND.
      Ash is spat from this hole and falls downward through
      frame.

      Plunged to the dust.  Debris from the demolished cabin
      rains down around him; his shotgun, the 1973 Delta 88
      Oldsmobile and the old grandfather clock.


676   ASH'S POV. - THE RIFT IN THE SKY - MITCHELL           676

      As it seals shut, leaving only the blue sky and the
      sound of tweeting birds.  Ash's view of the serene sky
      changes abruptly as five steel helmets jut into his
      line of sight.  Five armor-clad medieval WARRIORS
      stand directly over him.

678   CLOSE SHOT - ASH AND WARRIORS                         678

      As he looks to the warriors above him.

      The first warrior raises a bloodstained longsword
      and poises it above Ash's head.

                              WARRIOR #1
               Slay the beast!

                              WARRIOR #2
               'Tis a deadite!

      All raise their swords ready for the kill.


679   MED. SHOT - THE WARRIORS                              679

      Halt as they hear a piercing, high-pitched SCREECH.
      They turn their heads skyward.


680   CLOSE SHOT - ASH                                      680

      Follows the Warriors' gaze.

      MED. SHOT

      A "WINGED DEADITE," a female harpy like creature with
      the tail of a sea horse and man-sized bat wings,
      enabling it to fly.  The screaming beast swoops down
      towards the warriors and horses. High above, the distant
      shapes of other Winged Deadites circle.

      She lets out a screaming banshee laugh, while
      swooping down.

      As he springs to his feet.  With a lightning thrust he
      reaches behind him.

      around front and pulls the trigger.

      The beast continues to flap its wings and fly about a
      moment before falling to a heap in the dust.

      As he looks to Ash.


691   MED. SHOT - WARRIORS                                  691

      They follow his gaze.  The CAMERA PANS TO Ash.  He stands
      alone on a small pile of rubble clutching his smoldering
      shotgun.  He looks about dazedly.  He tries to get his
      bearings.


692   WIDE SHOT - WARRIORS                                  692

      They falter.  Unsure of how to react to this strange
      man, who a moment before was pronounced a Deadite.
      From the crowd, the Warrior #1 calls out:

                              WARRIOR #1
               Hail he, who has come from the sky,
               to deliver us from the terrors of
               the deadites!

                              WARRIOR #4
               Hail!

                              WARRIOR #5
               Hail!

      The cry is taken up by all. A line of medieval warriors
      bow.  Then twenty.  Then fifty.  All remove their
      helmets and kneel silently in the dust.

      Somewhere in the distance a DRUM SOUNDS.  Ash stands
      frozen.  Terrified, unsure of where or when he is.
      Knowing only for the present, he is alive.

      As the wind kicks up blowing dust, Ash strikes a
      familiar pose.  It is the same image of the "Hero
      from the Sky" that we saw earlier in the film.  The
      strange "jagged edged longsword" is Ash's chainsaw.

      The CAMERA PULLS BACK from him as a great medieval castle
      rears up INTO FRAME.  It is seen to be the castle of
      Kandar.  The same castle we saw in the beginning of the
      film.  Now, however, the castle is not a ruin, but brand
      new.  As the CAMERA continues to pull back from Ash, the
      title "EVIL DEAD" appears on the screen acompanied by
      the distant ROAR of some dying animal:  The SCREEN cuts
      to BLACK WITH A THUNDEROUS BOOM.

                             THE END
