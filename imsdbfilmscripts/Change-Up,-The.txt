          Then we hear a baby SCREAM BLOODY MURDER. Then a second baby
          joins in, even more shrill than the first. Finally, we hear
          the worst two words a parent can ever hear:

          Your turn.

          INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE -- NIGHT

          DAVE LOCKWOOD, 30, bleary-eyed father of three, shuffles
          through his well-appointed suburban home, passing a
          grandfather clock reading 3:45. He stumbles over a TOY
          GIRAFFE -- it SQUEAKS, and Dave sleepily mumbles:

                         DAVE
          Sorry Hank.

          INT. NURSERY-- NIGHT

          His eyes half-open, Dave changes the diaper of his very cute,
          very insane nine month old daughter, SARAH, who screams and
          pitches about her changing table.

                         DAVE

                         PLEASE DON'T--
          Honey, that's not--
          Maybe if you--
          She snatches a tin of baby powder and swings it about like a
          mace, knocking over the diaper caddy, the wipes, the lotion --
          and dispersing a cloud of white powder all over the nursery.
          Blinded and SNEEZING, Dave manages to stay on point and
          change the diaper like Van Damme at the end of Bloodsport.

                         DAVE (CONT'D)
          Can't-see ...must...persevere...
          He finishes changing Sarah, places her back in her crib, then
          picks up Sarah's twin brother, PETER, from his crib -- which
          is good because he's been SLAMMING his head against the wall.

                         DAVE (CONT'D)
          Come on, buddy, we've talked about
          the head thing--
          Dave places Peter on the changing table and opens his diaper.
          It's only wet, and Dave, pleasantly relieved, reaches for a
          fresh diaper...

          Only Sarah has knocked the caddy all the way down the
          changing table...
          Holding down Peter with his left hand, Dave fully extends,
          leaning waaay over, reaching for the diaper caddy...
          It's just out of reach.. .he somehow stretches further...
          It's only when Dave glances back that he realizes that his
          head is now perfectly lined up with his son's QUIVERING ANUS.

                         DAVE (CONT'D)
          Oh no.

          THE BABY'S BUTT-HOLE ERUPTS
          with mustardy projectile stool, blasting Dave in the eyes,
          nose and open mouth. Dave remains frozen, excrement dripping
          down his face -- but, like a true dad, he does not let go of
          his squirming child...

          INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

          Dave staggers down the hall, his hair white with baby powder,
          his face covered in poo, and a twin in each arm SCREAMING
          into each of his ears.
          He soldiers on, stoic, an unsung hero in his time...

          INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT

          Juggling the twins in his arms, Dave wipes his face off with
          paper towels and prepares two baby bottles -- nipples,
          filters, defrosted breastmilk -- while the babies take turns
          kicking him in the balls and SCREAMING.

                         DAVE
          Please, sweetheart, not my--
          Honey, Daddy needs those--

          INT. DEN -- NIGHT

          Dave sits on his couch and positions the screaming, squirming
          twins across his lap in an X pattern, plunks the bottles into
          their mouths -- and instantly the twins settle down and slurp
          away like perfect little angels.
          Dave exhales. Whew. Then he reaches for the remote control
          and turns on the TV. An old rerun of Magnum, P.I. is playing.
          Dave watches, exhausted and expressionless.

          short shorts, and Hawaiian shirt, teaches a nubile CO-ED in a
          scandalous bikini how to snorkel in beautiful sun-drenched
          Waikiki. They're laughing and having a blast...
          Dave watches, detached... Then his face starts to change...

          MAGNUM, P.I.
          Is this the life you always dreamed
          of?
          Dave shakes his head, no, despair in his eyes...
          ON TV, the co-ed nods, yes, and hungrily kisses Magnum...
          Dave watches on with genuine existential longing... and soon a
          tear falls from his eye. And then another.

                         DAVE
          Take me with you Magnum P. I...
          Before long Dave is CRYING like a schoolgirl.

          Dave, in a conservative suit and clutching a massive coffee,

          No sir, absolutely not. So sorry.
          Dave quickly undoes his tie as Flemming turns down a hallway.
          SABRINA McARDLE, cute young paralegal, falls into step with
          Dave, stymieing laughter.

          Then he hears TSK-TSK-TSK. He looks over at his mean old
          secretary, GLADYS, 71, sitting at her desk.

          Reddening, he snatches a huge pile of pink message slips and
          hurries towards his office. She follows him, scolding:

          Dave enters his modest office; his phone is RINGING.

          nothing except revenge and honor,
          but other people -- nameless,

          He rolls over to see Jamie, sitting up in bed, pulling her
          breasts out of her tank top, getting ready to nurse the
          twins. Mitch launches out of bed, suddenly very awake.

          WHOA! WHOA! WHAT THE FUCK, JAME?!
          She starts breast-feeding the babies, confused.

          What? What's your problem?
          Mitch shields his eyes with his hands, shocked and disgusted.

          MITCH (O.S.)

          OPEN THE GODDAMN DOOR IMMEDIATELY!
          The body sits up, groggy and confused -- it is, of course,
          Dave in Mitch's body. While he looks like Mitch, he moves,
          talks, and even shuffles to the door exactly like Dave...

          Dave stops, noticing that he's in Mitch's empty apartment.

          Dave backpedals, terrified, as Mitch blows inside, furious.

           Bingo. Got it. We're dreaming.

          room. All the partners will be
          there so do not speak to anyone.

          to say nothing. When a partner asks
          you for the merger documents, you
          will silently hand them over, okay?

          I've spent the last nine months
          banging out the terms of this deal,
          all you have to do is hand over the
          documents. That's it.

          Dude, that's easy as fuck. Okay,
          for me, go home, put on some cool
          clothes, and get to set -- all the
          info is on my phone. Once you're
          there, go to Hair & Makeup and
          memorize your lines and try not to
          be a total douche to everyone,
          okay? This is the film industry.
          Everyone is really cool.
          They look at each other, very doubtful that this will work...

          Mitch blows into Dave's stodgy law firm looking like a lawyer
          -- from a Ralph Lauren ad: he sports a pink buttondown, red
          suspenders, a blue crested blazer, khakis, no socks, black
          and white wingtips, and slicked-back hair.
          He also affects a preposterous patrician accent like John
          Kerry or any white guy on a black sitcom.

          His co-workers look at him like he's fucking nuts. Falling
          into step with him is Gladys, his mean old secretary.

          whole angry prison nurse thing is a
          huge mistake.
          Gladys GASPS and jams some documents into his hands.

          Here are your merger documents!
          Good day to you!
          She storms off. Mitch calls after her:

                         MITCH
          Hey, where's my meeting at?
          She angrily points at a conference room as she stalks off.

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

          The conference room is full of EXECUTIVES from KINKABE
          TECHNOLOGIES and AMALGAMATED INDUSTRIES, as well as several
          well-heeled LAWYERS. They chat amiably until

                         MITCH ENTERS
          in his ridiculous outfit. The room goes silent, but Mitch's
          confidence remains sky-high:

                         MITCH

          Everyone looks a bit confused by this Nobody telling them
          what to do, but nonetheless, they begin taking their seats.
          Mitch goes around, introducing himself.

                         MITCH (CONT'D)
          Dave Lockwood, thanks for coming!
          Dave Lockwood, I did all the work!

          Anyone need anything? Mimosa, spicy
          tuna roll? No? We're good? All
          right, guys, take it away!
          Mitch takes one of the last open seats -- at the head of the
          conference table. It's clearly in his boss's seat. Flemming
          Steel III hovers awkwardly.

          FLEMMING STEEL III
          Yes, well, thank you, Dave...?
          (clearing his throat)
          We are gathered here today to
          codify the marriage of two bold
          industry leaders, Kinkabe
          Technologies and Amalgamated
          Industries.
          Mitch starts APPLAUDING. Others.. .hesitantly. . . join in.

          Finally, even Flemming claps as well, uncomfortable.

          bottom line, are there any

          that we might address? Ask now or
          forever hold your peace...
          Pleasant CHUCKLES in the room. Then the Japanese-American CEO
          of Kinkabe Technologies, KEN KINKABE, 60's, raises his hand.

          Right, my bad--
          Thinking that's his cue, he slides Flemming the documents.

          FLEMMING STEEL III
          No, Dave. Mr. Kinkabe had a
          question about the DPA ratios.

          Mr. Kinkabe angrily jabs his finger at the incredibly short
          CEO of Amalgamated Industries, TED NORTON, 60's.

          The execs furiously race out of the conference room, all of
          them reaching for their cell phones. War has been declared.
          The lawyers hurry after the clients, fruitlessly trying to
          coax them back to the table.
          Mitch frowns, oo, and tiptoes for the exit.. .until Flemming
          Steel III grabs his arm, furious.

          FLEMMING STEEL III
          Right now you need to give me one
          reason not to fire you.
          Mitch stammers, oh shit.

          parked out front, and PA's with headsets loiter about.

          khakis. He self-consciously untucks half his shirt, trying to

          As the crew bustle about, Mona turns to a shell-shocked Dave.

                         MONA
          You wanna bump?
          Mona snorts a fingernail of coke into her nose.

          for, okay? And no, you can't pay me
          to give you a real BJ, I don't do
          that shit anymore.
          Dave's mouth opens, but nothing comes out. A P.A. guides him
          out of the room. He's still in a trance...

                         ANNNND ACTION:
          Dave stands there, frozen. Behind the camera, Valtan
          gestures, go! Dave stumbles into the bedroom, holding the
          huge machine gun like, well, like a corporate lawyer.
          A BLOW-DRIED GOON appears with a gun.

          Dave looks around at the bright lights, the camera, the crew
          watching him -- and he freezes up. The goon tries again:

          Then Dave sees a P.A. waving at him, holding up a huge board
          with his lines written on them. Shielding his eyes from the
          lights, Dave reads his lines, monotone:

                         DAVE
          If you let me don't in...don't let
          me in...If you don't let me in,

          P.A.

          Dave very effeminately "karate chops" the goon in the neck
          once, and the guy dramatically throws himself against the
          wall and drops, unconscious. Then Dave crosses and pretends
          to suddenly see Mona in the bed. His acting is atrocious.

                         DAVE
          Oh my goodness it is Lola my long

          Mona, not much of a better actor than Dave, wakes up -- and
          SCREAMS deafeningly, like some 1950's horror queen.

          Jamie steams upstairs, pissed, with Cara in tow. Dave runs

          Dave enters Mitch's apartment and flips on the bright
          overhead light. The white walls are empty. A futon, TV, and
          four crates of bird seed are all that occupy the living room.

          Sitting on the plush couch with Jamie, eating takeout sushi
          and watching Two and a Half Men on the huge plasma TV.

          another woman who is not your wife,

          INT. TWIN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

          Mitch just looks at the twins, SCREAMING in their respective
          cribs, no idea what to do. He reaches for the phone. Dials.

          INTERCUT WITH DAVE
          in Mitch's apartment, jacking off to some (very small)
          internet porn on Mitch's iPhone. Then the porn disappears,
          and "DAVE LOCKWOOD CALLING" appears on screen.

          I always thought your wife was a
          nice lady but she is neither nice
          nor a lady! She talks like a dock-
          worker and she shits like one too!
          Plus I used to think your kids were
          adorable but actually they're just
          really fucking annoying and crazy
          needy-- Wait, are you jacking off?

          Facebooking them, Twittering them,
          buying them drinks and dinners and
          coffees and listening to endless

          building an elaborate web of lies
          so they don't all find out about

          Mitch puts the phone in his mouth and picks up the SCREAMING
          TWINS. Carrying them like bags of wheat, he jogs down

                         THE HALLWAY
          as they scream their heads off. He's totally rattled:

          INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT

          Mitch jogs into the kitchen and, plop, sets the twins on the
          COUNTER, then speaks into the phone again:

                         MITCH
          All right. In the kitchen.

                         DAVE
          Go to the fridge...
          Mitch turns away from the twins and opens the fridge. He sees
          a bottle of wine and immediately drinks from the bottle.

                         MITCH
          Yeah?

          Defrost two bags of breastmilk in
          the microwave for 3 minutes, then
          prepare two separate bottles...
          Mitch grabs a container of cow's milk, sniffs it, turns to
          give it to the babies -- to discover that Sarah is gone, and
          Peter is licking an ELECTRICAL SOCKET!

                         MITCH

          Mitch hears CLINK CLINK and spins to see that Sarah has
          crawled over to the KNIFE BLOCK and removed a BUTCHER KNIFE
          and a MEAT CLEAVER and is waving them about like rattles!

                         MITCH
          Oh jesus oh jesus...
          Mitch approaches her, wide-eyed, tentative -- when Sarah
          giggles and spastically whips the cleaver at him! He barely
          sidesteps it, and it impacts into a cupboard door -- F-TWANG!

          I know, right? And make sure you
          don't allow any air bubbles in.
          Mitch grabs a pair of tongs and, after a few attempts,
          snatches the butcher knife from Sarah's hands. Then he scoops
          her up and deposits her into the sink with her brother.
          Finally, he slumps over, trying to catch his breath.

                         MITCH
          Dude. Listen to me: you need to go
          downtown first thing tomorrow
          morning and you need to find that
          fucking fountain...
          He starts pouring cow's milk into the babies' mouths. It
          splashes all over them, but they manage to lap up some of it.

                         MITCH (CONT'D)

          himself through school and built a
          better life for himself. I've

          organic snacks and then introduce
          them to my extensive girl-on-horse
          pornography collection. How do you
          think Jamie will react to that?
          Dave just looks at Mitch, horrified.

          Why...Why are you doing this to me?

                         MITCH
          Because I've seen your life and if
          you don't loosen up soon you are
          literally going to die. So go out
          with this chick. Have fun. Bust a
          nut. Remember why life is beautiful
          again, okay? Please?
          This actually gets to Dave a bit. He frowns, fine...

          His work day over, Mitch strides through the parking lot,
          heading for his car, cheerfully waving to various COMMUTERS:

          he'll never build a family or a
          career or anything of substance
          like you have. He's... embarrassing.
          Mitch stands there, mouth agape, just decimated.

          Anyway, I'm sorry to go on and on.

          Mitch starts TEARING UP and fumbling with the car door.

          things about him I hurt too--
          He SLAMS the door shut and jerks out of the parking spot,
          tears pouring down his face. His dad watches on, bewildered.

          And then Survivor's "Eye of the Tiger" comes on the radio.

          Mitch hurries into the pediatrician's office, talking on his
          BlackBerry phone, a twin in each arm, a cigarette dangling

          Mitch jogs into the crowded auditorium and sits next to
          Jamie. The ballet recital is already in progress...
          ONSTAGE, two dozen adorable little BALLERINAS in pink tutu's
          pile and jete about...
          Jamie points out little Cara in pigtails. Mitch smiles.

          battement glisse...
          Jamie tenses up. Mitch does too...
          As Cara starts her spin, Nicolette Peters goes to push her
          over -- and Cara calmly grabs her arm, FLIPS her over her
          shoulder, and drops her flat on her back with a loud WHAM!
          As Nicolette starts CRYING, Cara calmly continues dancing
          like nothing happened. The other girls on stage look pleased.
          Mitch CLAPS and WHISTLES:

                         MITCH
          Shut up and do what I say. We only
          have 3 hours to make you cool...

          This is called gel, or product. Use
          too little and you look like a
          pedophile Cub Scout leader, use too
          much and you look Persian. Neither
          is a winning hand.
          Dave very nervously applies gel to his hair...

          INT. MITCH'S SHOWER STALL

          Dave stands with his pants around his ankles as Mitch very
          delicately shaves his balls with a Bic razor.

                         MITCH
          Okay, normally I would never do
          this for another man, but since
          we're in a rush, and technically
          this is my testicle bag, I'm making
          a rare exception. Always man-scape
          before a first date. It shows a
          lady that you're clean,
          considerate, and American.

                         DAVE

                         MITCH
          Don't speak, it jiggles your sack.

          EXT. EXOTIC MOTORCARS -- EVENING

          Exotic sells the most pimped-out used cars in LA. Mitch
          SQUEALS off the lot in a RED FERRARI and cruises down the
          Sunset Strip, music BLASTING. Dave sits shotgun, stunned.

                         DAVE
          I can't believe you just charged a
          Ferrari to my Discover Card.

          You need to learn to be

          spontaneous.

          Hey ladies! Show us your tits!
          They flip him off. Mitch laughs. Dave is still floored:

          Dave's entire body visibly relaxes a bit.

          Dave gives him his sunglasses; Mitch chucks them out the
          window and hands him his cool Ray Ban's.

          rolling down Sunset strip in a

          Dave looks out the window, getting into it...

                         MITCH (CONT'D)
          Feels good, right?
          After a moment, a TEAR escapes from under Dave's shades.

          It's okay, just let it out.

          They cruise for a bit longer, then Mitch pulls into a CAR
          WASH. Dave looks confused.

                         MITCH
          We're not washing the car, David.
          We're getting you mentally,
          physically, and spiritually ready
          for your date. Come on.

          INT. CAR WASH -- LOBBY -- MOMENTS LATER

          Mitch and a very confused Dave enter the car wash lobby.

                         MITCH
          Now. I don't have time to cover all
          the ways in which women have
          changed since you last dated...
          Mitch stops at the register to pay. Various CAR WASH
          EMPLOYEES keep saying hi to Dave, weirding him out.

          CAR WASH EMPLOYEES
          Hola, Mitch! / Como esta, Mitch?!

                         MITCH
          The bottom line is: the internet
          has revolutionized everything.

                         DAVE
          You mean like J-date?

                         MITCH
          Fuck J-date. No. The internet has
          changed chicks in three major ways:
          first, access and acceptance of
          pornography has commoditized women
          and pressured them into becoming
          sluttier at far younger ages, which
          is awesome.
          Mitch finishes paying and continues through the car wash.

                         MITCH (CONT'D)
          Second: text messaging has de-
          stigmatized the booty call. Call a
          girl at 3 in the morning for sex
          and it's creepy. Text her "SUCK
          WANG MIDNIGHT??" and it's classy. I
          have no idea why, but again, an
          awesome development.

          networking sites have falsely
          convinced people -- women included

          interesting, and unique. Get used

          sweating... it's been a long time ...by the time he finally

          Think of it like this: for the next
          two hours, you're stuck with this
          chick. Doesn't matter if she's cool
          or crazy or if she was born with a
          vagina on her forehead -- you're
          stuck, so make the most of it. I
          dated this chick named Topaz once
          who may or may not have killed her
           father. Long story short, she
          looked like 50 miles of bad road
          and I wasn't interested, but I used
          our time together to learn about
          incest and the failures of the
          American Appellate Court system. I
          found it hugely informative, and
          Topaz got caught up in my
          enthusiasm and gave me a crying
          blowjob on the car-ride home, so
          everybody won. The point is: find
          the fun for yourself and great

          M-My whole life, actually.

          like he did yesterday?

                         DAVE
          What, like a total douchebag?
          She LAUGHS. Dave can't believe it. He loosens up a bit.

          That's not fair. Dave...Dave isn't
          himself right now. I hope he didn't
          say anything to offend you...

                         SABRINA
          No. I mean, he totally did, but
          it's fine. I have brothers.
          Dave pours both of them a glass of wine, finding his rhythm.

                         DAVE
          So. You like working with Dave?

                         SABRINA
          I love it. He's the best.

          Isn't he just?

          You're so funny! Come on!

          EXT. FOXTAIL NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

          A line of HIPSTERS wait outside Foxtail. Holding Dave's hand,
          Sabrina cuts the line, kisses the BOUNCER on the cheek, and
          he lets them inside. Dave nods, awesome...

          INT. FOXTAIL NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

          Dave and Sabrina get down on the sweaty, crowded dance floor.
          The house music is deafening and the lights are hypnotizing
          and everyone is having the time of their lives.
          Dave, his shirt half-open, moves sensually in sync with
          Sabrina, both of them possessed by the music. They're inches
          apart and her dress and hair fly about in all the right ways.

          INT. FOXTAIL NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

          Foxtail is closed, but Dave, with Sabrina on his lap, sits in
          a booth drinking champagne with DJ BASSNECTAR and all of his
          ridiculously cool friends. Dave tells a joke and everyone
          laughs -- including KIEFER SUTHERLAND, who's sitting next to
          him; Kiefer slaps Dave five. Nice!

          Dave, Sabrina, Bassnectar, Kiefer Sutherland, and a group of
          hipsters play poker in Kiefer's unbelievable DOWNTOWN LOFT.
          Music blasts, beer bottles litter the table, and everyone is
          having fun. Sabrina wins a hand and does a victory dance...

          EXT. WEST HOLLYWOOD STREET -- NIGHT

          Dave walks Sabrina home along her quaint, tree-lined street.

                         DAVE
          Now that was a first date...

                         SABRINA
          For a guy with a poker table in his
          living room, Kiefer Sutherland is
          surprisingly bad at poker.

                         DAVE
          I know. I'm not even sure he
          understood the rules...
          She laughs. Then they stop in front of her apartment. Beat.

          night...

                         DAVE
          Yeah. Me too...
          There's a lull for a kiss. Dave hesitates...so Sabrina moves
          in and kisses him. It's sweet but passionate... When it's
          over, Dave can barely speak:

          EXT. TOAST -- DAY

          Dave sits at an outdoor table, reading a novel and taking his
          time with brunch. He sees a BUSINESSMAN wolfing down his food
          and running off to his car, yelling into his cell phone,
          stressed out of his mind. Dave smiles and keeps reading...

          Dave, holding a cross-bow and wearing a loincloth, has fake
          sex with his CO-STAR on a jungle set; their mid-sections are
          conveniently obscured by a giant fern.
          Dave is selling it, and when Valtan calls cut, the whole CREW

          following me to the bathroom and
          calling my house late at night and
          sending me all those filthy emails?
          It's, you know, deeply disturbing.

          (whispering in his ear)
          I fucking own you now.
          The old lady aggressively makes out with Mitch. Her tongue
          roams from his mouth and madly licks his face, neck, and
          forehead. Eventually they separate. Mitch looks stunned.

          Amalgamated execs. No one speaks. It's a corporate staredown.

          INT. SIDE ROOM -- LATER

          The mediation has broken into two separate rooms. The
          Amalgamated team sits in their shirtsleeves, waiting in tense
          silence. PAPERS litter the table. They've been here a while.
          A large tray of sandwiches sits half-eaten on the sideboard.
          Mitch jams the last piece of a ham sandwich into his mouth,
          swallows it, and holds up his hands, victorious!

          Slice's! Pay up, cocksucker!
          An EXEC gives him a 5 dollar bill. Mitch waves it in the air
          and HUMS the Olympic theme song. Flemming just glares at him
          like, you're so fired. Then the mediator enters.

                         ERIN WALSH
          Kinkabe agrees in principle to the
          terms of the sale, and valuates
          your company at 725 million
          dollars. This is their last and
          final offer. I'll be outside.
          She exits. CEO Ted Norton looks at Flemming, intense.

          It's a fair deal. I don't think
          we'll get much more out of them...

          she keeps saying "no, no, I don't
          want to, I'm really drunk and
          you're not circumcised" but then
          she keeps making out with you and
          not getting out of your Fiero so
          you know she really does want it,
          she just needs to be nudged a bit
          more so she can rationalize it to
          herself and to her God, know what I
          mean? This is just like that.
          Everyone in the room is speechless. Mitch opens another soda.

          How is this...at all... like that?

                         MITCH
          If this was really their final
          offer, they'd leave. Instead,
          they're sticking around, which
          means they have more money to
          spend.
          Ted looks at his execs. It's not a terrible point...

          How much more do you think we can

          Do not listen to him, Ted, he is
          beyond reckless! If we make too
          large a counter-offer, we risk

          Seriously, does anyone have a
          Pepto? Because I'm gonna throw.
          Finally, Ted opens the door and says to the mediator:

          CEO TED NORTON
          Tell Kinkabe we want an extra 100
          million and that is our final
          offer, because we're leaving.

          Fuel the jet. Let's go.
          The mediator heads off as the execs start packing up their
          briefcases, bluffing. Mitch points at Ted.

          INT. CUT RESTAURANT -- MEN'S ROOM -- NIGHT

          Mitch stands in the restaurant's upscale men's room, staring
          at himself in the mirror, lost...

                         MITCH
          What am I doing...? This isn't my
          life...

                         VOICE
          Good evening, Mr. Lockwood...
          He spins to see Gladys in the doorway, vamping, sexy...

                         MITCH
          Oh no. Gladys, not now--

                         GLADYS

          I thought we talked about not using

                         THAT WORD--
          WHAM! She throws him against the bathroom wall and starts
          aggressively undressing him.

                         GLADYS
          What's bothering you, Mr. Lockwood?

                         MITCH
          Look, Gladys, I love bathroom sex
          as much as the next guy, but--
          She SPITS in his face, crazy-eyed.

                         GLADYS

          TELL ME WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU!

          (wiping face, a bit scared)
          O-Okay? Well, I guess what's
          bothering me is...I didn't earn any
          of this, you know?
          Gladys rips open his shirt and starts licking his chest
          downward until she disappears OUT OF FRAME.

          And I know what you're thinking:
          Mitch, not earning things never
          used to bother you, why does it
          bother you now? And the answer is:
          maybe I'm growing up.
          We hear the sound of his pants UNZIPPING...

          I mean, sure, I closed the deal
          today, and that felt good, but I
          didn't put in all the years of hard
          work that got Dave to this point,

          freaky deaky old lady secretary. I

          Just then FLEMMING STEEL III BLOWS IN -- and stops cold:

          FLEMMING STEEL III

          GOOD GOD MAN!
          GO WIDE to see that Gladys is in the Reverse Wheelbarrow
          position, her palms on the bathroom floor, her feet against
          the bathroom wall, with Mitch between her legs, his pants
          around his ankles. Mitch sees his boss -- and freezes.

                         MITCH
          Uh oh.

          FLEMMING STEEL III

          THE REVERSE WHEELBARROW?.
          Mitch and Gladys disengage and straighten themselves.

          You're completely exposed--!
          We hear a GASP from the doorway. Everyone turns to see Jamie

          You know what? No. I can't do this

          Fastening his belt, Mitch sprints out of the restaurant,
          desperate -- but Jamie is already SQUEALING away in her car.

          Dave, in dry clothes, sits on his couch, happily drinking a
          beer and watching SportsCenter. He calls into the bedroom.

                         DAVE
          You find anything that fits?
          Then Sabrina appears in the doorway, wearing one of his old

                         COME--
          And then he stops short. On Sabrina's lower back is a cute
          tramp stamp tattoo of a BUTTERFLY.

          Sabrina notices as she slides onto the couch with him.

                         SABRINA
          Is everything okay, baby...?

          Just then the door flies open and

          Thanks, sweetie, but your brain is
          the size of a radish. I am a fuck
          up. I always have been, and I
          always will be. Guys like me, we

          separate, but remain inches apart, breathing hard.

          Dave?
          Dave nods. Jamie squints, trying to understand.

          But...how?
          Dave shakes his head, I don't know...

          So...then ...Mitch was the one...

          Wait, so who was that hot young
          thing back in the apartment?

          Nothing happened, I swear.

                         JAMIE
          Okay. But-we're going to need to
          talk about this.

          I kind of like kissing Mitch.

                         DAVE
          Yeah, I noticed. I'm not sure how I

          Jamie and Dave squeal up to their house to see Mitch, out
          front, sadly trying to pack a Barcalounger into his Ferrari.

          Mitch, terrified, sprints to the car and hops in.

          Jamie races through LA at 80 mph. Dave sits shotgun, and

          Four WORKMEN pack the FOUNTAIN OF METIS into a large wooden

          It's a magic fountain.
          The workmen just look at them, deadpan. Then Dave reaches
          into his wallet and starts pulling out CASH--

          SMASH CUT TO:

          MITCH AND DAVE STANDING SIDE BY SIDE AT THE FOUNTAIN
          with their pants down around their ankles. Dave starts
          PEEING. Mitch doesn't. Dave hisses at him:

          It's creepy that Kiefer Sutherland
          is like way into other people's
          babies, right?

                         DAVE
          Oh yeah.
          Dave flips the burgers.

                         MITCH
          Thanks again for hooking me up with
          the job at Amalgamated, man.

                         DAVE
          Hey, the CEO owed me a favor...

                         MITCH
          I think I'm really going to crush
          it in corporate America.

                         DAVE
          I think so too.
          Just then, MITCH'S DAD approaches.

          MITCH, SR.
          I'm heading out. Thanks for having
          me.
          Mitch, Sr. pulls his son into an emotional hug.

          MITCH, SR. (CONT'D)
          I love you, Mitch.

                         MITCH
          I love you too, Dad.
          They break apart. Mitch, Sr. heads off. Then he stops. Turns.

          MITCH, SR.
          Hey Mitch...
          Mitch turns.

          MITCH, SR. (CONT'D)
          I'm real proud of you.

          Mitch nods, trying not to show how much this means to him.
          Mitch, Sr., heads off.
          Mitch and Dave stand side by side, reflective...

                         DAVE
          Is it weird that I miss your penis?

                         MITCH
          Not really.
