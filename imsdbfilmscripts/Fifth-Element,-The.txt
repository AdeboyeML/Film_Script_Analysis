FADE IN:

1	EXT.  DESERT  NILE RIVER  VALLEY - DAY

	Somewhere in the Nile at the edge of the desert.

	CREDITS  ROLL

	WRITTEN:	EGYPT 1913

	OMAR and his mule zigzag along the bottom of sun scorched dunes.

2	EXT.  TEMPLE  EXCAVATION - DAY

	The mule and the boy finally reach a camp.  A few tents dwarfed by a huge
temple door jutting out of the sand.  The camp is deserted except for
some kids by the temple entrance holding large mirrors, reflecting light
into the temple.
	Omar leaves his mule in the shade, seizes two goatskins and slips inside
the temple.

3	INT.  TEMPLE - DAY

	Omar makes his way uneasily down a pillared corridor that opens into a
vast room where an old scientist stands on a small wooden ladder in front of
the wall across the room.  PROFESSOR MASSIMO PACOLI. A young man is beside
him, BILLY MASTERSON, age 25, an American student. He has a large sketchpad in
his hands.  Behind them AZIZ, age 10, whose job is to hold the last
mirror which shines light into the expansive room.

						PROFESSOR
					(deciphering)
				"..when the three planets are in eclipse.."

	His fingers trace across the wall which is covered with symbols and
strange hieroglyphs as he deciphers.

						PROFESSOR
				"..the black hole like a door is open...
				Evil comes ... sowing terror and chaos..."
				See?  The snake, Billy.  The Ultimate Evil
				... make sure you get the snake!

	The Professor points emphatically to the snake, the symbol of Evil,
coming through the door between the three planets in eclipse.  C.U.
Billy's hand sketches the snake quickly.  He is a natural artist.

						BILLY
				And when is this door opening snake act
				supposed to occur?

	The Professor's fingers touch the signs.

						PROFESSOR
				..if this is the five..and this the thousand..

	He calculates.

						PROFESSOR
				Every five thousand years..

						BILLY
					(kidding)
				So I have some time..

	He reaches for the pad.

	ANGLE ON:  Omar.  Standing at the entrance to the chamber with the water
bag, entranced by the sight.  A skeletal hand falls on his shoulder.  Omar
turns to an ancient PRIEST in a rough milled black cannock.

						PRIEST
				I will take it to them my son.

	Startled but obedient, Omar gives the water bag to the Priest.

						PRIEST
				Go with God.. be safe from Evil..

	The Priest makes the sign of the Cross on the boy's forehead, dismissing
him.
	As soon as he is gone, the Priest turns a worried eye to the Professor.

	ANGLE ON:  The Professor is back to translating, Billy to sketching.

						PROFESSOR
				"..then arrange the elements of life against
				the Terror just so.."

	His fingers run on.

						PROFESSOR
				"..Water..fire..earth..air..four
				elements around the fifth.."

	His fingers fall on the one element that has a human shape, surrounded by
all the others.

	The Priest opens the water skin and begins to pour a vial of powder into
the skin.

	ANGLE ON:  Aziz falling asleep.  The mirror falls, the light fails.

						PROFESSOR
				Aziz!  Light!

	The boy struggles to stay awake.  The mirror comes up.

						PRIEST
				Lord forgive me.. they already know too,
				much..

						PROFESSOR
				"..in which all the history of the Universe resides
				..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from
Evil.."

						PRIEST (V.O.)
				Amen..

	The Professor turns to the Priest who is pouring water into a tin cup
from the skin.

						PROFESSOR
				Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing..
				the greatest find in history..can you imagine
				the implications.

						PRIEST
				Only too well... here you must be
				parched..

	He hands the cup to the Professor.  The Professor takes it, has it almost
to his lips when..

						PROFESSOR
				I mean look.. it is like a battle plan..

	In his excitement he does not drink, much to the Priest's chagrin.

						PROFESSOR
				Here the Good.. Here the Evil..

	As the Priest looks up, Aziz the mirror  boy, tips his mouth under the
water skin, drinking the leakage.

						PROFESSOR
				Here..

	He points to the Five Elements.

						PROFESSOR
				A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am
				going to be famous.

						PRIEST
				Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..

	The Priest hands Billy a cup.

						PRIEST
				Drink!

						PROFESSOR
				To fame.. salud..

	The Professor raises the cup to drink, and then...

						PROFESSOR
				We cannot toast with water.. Billy !
				In my sack.. the Grappa!

	The Priest watches, disconsolate, as the Professor tosses away his water.
Billy finishes his cup before running off into the tunnel.

4	EXT.  COLONNADE - DAY

	A muffled SOUND grows steadily louder. Outside, a monstrous linear shadow
disturbs the kid's game and gradually darkens the temple entrance.

5	INT.  TUNNEL - DAY

	Billy is looking for the grappa in the Professor's bag.  He comes upon a
machine pistol.  When the muffled SOUND suddenly grabs his attention.  He
leans toward the corridor and sees part of a spaceship appear.  Billy is
paralyzed.

6	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY

	The Professor keeps reading over the inscription.

						PROFESSOR
				"..this perfect person.. this perfect
				being.." I do not understand this.. perfect?

						PROFESSOR
				Where is that boy? Billy!

7	INT.  TUNNEL - DAY

	Billy presses himself against the wall, in the shadows, terrified, but
sketching away like mad, as large shadowed figures lumber past him.  He
begins to blink, feeling the effects of the Priest's potion..

8	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY

	The Professor reads the wall.

						PROFESSOR
				And this divine Light they talk
				about.. what is Divine light?

	At that moment, the reflection from Aziz's mirror drops again.  The light
fails.

						PROFESSOR
					(without turning)
				Aziz light!

	The room is flooded with light all of the sudden.

						PROFESSOR
				Better.. this is the most unbelievable thing
				I have ever seen..

	The Professor turns around, and is stunned speechless to find himself
face to face with two MONDOSHAWANS.  A dozen others fill the hall manning
the source of the light, large luminous globes.  Aziz is fast asleep.

						PROFESSOR
					(uncomprehending)
				...Uh, yes?

	The Professor is lifted up and carried off to the side by the aliens.
The KOMMANDER stops in front of the Priest who is still on his knees, face
to the ground.

						PRIEST
				Master... He was about to discover everything,
				but I had the situation under control.

	The two MONDOSHAWAN GUARDS hold the professor three feet off the ground.

						PROFESSOR
					(in a panic)
				Who are you?  Are you Germans?  Sprechen
				Sie Deutsch?

9	INT.  TUNNEL

	Billy staggers forward, a machine pistol in his hand.

10	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM

	The KOMMANDER holds out his hand to the Priest.

						PRIEST
				What did I do wrong?

	The Priest jumps to his feet excitedly.

						KOMMANDER
				Servant, you and the thousand guards
				before you... You have done your work well,
				but we have to recover the elements. War will
				soon engulf your planet. We must keep them safe.

	The Kommander goes over to the wall and seems to be looking for a lock.
He finds it and slides in his metallic finger which is more intricate
than a key to a safe.  He turns his hand, activating a mechanism that opens
the wall.

						PROFESSOR
				Unbelievable!!!

	The Kommander turns around and crooks a finger.  One of the MONDOSHAWANS
	waves his hand, puts the professor to sleep and heads down the hallway
revealed by the opening.  He is followed by his men.  The Priest slips in
behind them.

11	INT.  ROOM 2  TEMPLE - DAY

	The Kommander steps into a vast room.  The ceiling is very high, pyramid-
shaped.  In each corner of the room, four vessels contain four
rectangular twelve-inch stones-, the four elements.  In the middle, an
opaque sarcophagus rests on an altar.  The Kommander stops and
contemplates it a moment.

						PRIEST
					(to himself)
				The Fifth Element...

						KOMMANDER
				Take them and put them in a safe place.

	His men carry out his order.

12	INT.  ROOM 1  TEMPLE - DAY

	Billy staggers across the floor, struggling to stay awake.

13	INT.  ROOM 2  TEMPLE - DAY

	The Kommander opens a case.  His men come and put the four, precious
stones in it, one by one.

						PRIEST
					(moved)
				Will the elements be gone now forever
				from this place?

						KOMMANDER
				When mankind comes to its senses.
				We will return.

						PRIEST
				Knowing mankind as I do, that could take
			centuries!

						KOMMANDER
				Time is of no importance, only life
				is important.

	The Priest nods and lowers his eyes.

	Angle on:  Billy staggering forward, raising his pistol, blinking his
eyes to focus..

	A MONDOSHAWAN puts the fourth element in the case The Kommander shuts the
	case and looks at the Priest.

						KOMMANDER
				When EVIL returns so shall we.

						PRIEST
					(head lowered)
				We will be ready, Lord.

	Billy suddenly staggers into the room, brandishing his gun.

						BILLY
				Stop.

	Billy trips, the gun goes off.  He empties the clip.  The Mondoshawan
carrying the case crumples to the ground.  The wall immediately begins to
close.  Billy fires wildly, unable to control the powerful kicking gun.

						PRIEST
				No!!!  Don't!!!

	The Priest rushes Billy.  The weapon has such a kick to it that Billy
starts shooting into the air, backs up, then stumbles and knocks himself
out.  The Priest is on the ground, seriously wounded.  So is the Kommander.
The WARRIORS are in a panic.

						CLERK
				Hurry, Kommander!  The wall's closing!!!

	The wall continues to close.  Sand pours in from everywhere.  The vast
room fills up like an hourglass.

						KOMMANDER
				A mission is a mission, Savoia.
				You'll learn that.

	The Kommander picks up the case and reaches the wall but can't get
through it.  His
	armor is too bulky, the opening too small.  He manages to get his arm and
the case through.

						KOMMANDER
				My apologies to General Kroi -- and my wife..

	The wall closes, crushing his arm.  The CLERK scoops up the case and runs
	through the huge piles of sand.

14	EXT.  COLONNADE - DAY

	The CLERK boards the ship carrying the case.  Omar hides in a corner,
frightened to death, hugging Billy's bag of drawings.

15	INT.  TEMPLE  ROOM - DAY

	The room fills with sand.  The Priest's body is soon buried.

16	EXT.  DESERT - DAY

	The huge ship's main hatch closes.

17	EXT.  TEMPLE - DAY

	The ship lifts off and speeds away. Omar emerges from the temple gaping
at the ship as it vanishes in the sky.

18	EXT.  PYRAMIDS

	A gigantic shooting star flashes above the pyramids.

19	EXT.  EARTH  ORBIT

	The ship passes in front of us and heads for the stars disappearing at
unbelievable speed.  The background is a star-spattered cosmos.

	WRITTEN:	500 YEARS LATER

	Another, more modern, spaceship, fills the screen.  A warship belonging
to the Federal Army.

20	INT.  SPACESHIP  CONTROL  ROOM

	CU of a digital control screen.  Three planets projecting three straight
lines that crisscross at one point.  Identical to the one observed by the
professor on the temple wall.  GENERAL STAEDERT looks out through the
ship's window at one of the three huge planets in eclipse.

						STAEDERT
				Don't you have anything?  Not even
				a temperature?

						CAPTAIN
				The thermo-analyzers have jammed.
				One of them reads over a million degrees,
				the other's at minus 5000...
				Never seen anything like it.

						TECHNICIAN
				It's taking shape.

21	EXT.  SPACE

	In the middle of the shadows, a door to the nightmare has just opened.
Evil is back.  A round, moving mass, continually changing color.

						CAPTAIN
					(in awe)
				What the hell can it be?

						TECHNICIAN
				Hook-up with the president in one
				minute, General.

	General Staedert remains calm.

						STAEDERT
				...Send out a probe.

22	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE  MANHATTAN

	LINDBERG, 50, the president of the United Federations, his features lined
and worn by various delegations, mainly military, enters his office.
There's a crisis in the air.  The President's AIDE leans down to his ear.

						AIDE
				On air in 30 seconds.

	In the middle of the group is a Priest whose appearance reminds us of
Egypt.  A younger man DAVID, 18, shy, a priest-in-training attends the old
man.

23	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						CAPTAIN
				President on line sir..

	General Staedert leans over his screen and seems surprised to see the
room but not the president.

						PRESIDENT (O.S.)
				Staedert, do you read me?

						STAEDERT
				I can hear you, Mr. President, but I
				can't see you .

	The President grabs the mini-camera on his desk and yanks it around to
face him.
	His face fills the screen.

						PRESIDENT
					(exasperated)
				Is that better?

						STAEDERT
				Perfect, Mr. President.

						PRESIDENT
				I have to address the Supreme Council
				in 10 minutes.
				Just the facts, General.

						STAEDERT
				There are no results from the chemical
				and molecular analysis as of yet, all the
				calibers are overshot..we're hoping a
				thermo nucleatic imaging..

						PRESIDENT
				(exasperated)
				What you are saying is you don't know
				what this..thing..is.

	Consternation reigns in the President's office.

						STAEDERT
				Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is
				it just keeps getting bigger!

						PRESIDENT
				Options.

						STAEDERT
				Wait or act.

						PRESIDENT
				Recommendations.

						STAEDERT
				My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first
				ask questions later.
				I don't like uninvited guests.

						PRESIDENT
				Gentlemen?

						HEAD CHEMISTS
				I think it would be foolish to shoot at an
				organism that seems alive, without first
				taking the time to study it more!
				Besides, it has shown no signs of hostility.

						PRESIDENT
					(worried)
				No... it's just getting bigger.

						HEAD CHEMISTS
				So do people, but that's no reason to shoot
				them.

						PRESIDENT
					(exasperated)
				The security of the Federated Territories is
				and remains number one priority.
					(to the military)
				I suppose General Staedert's "philosophy" is
				acceptable to you?

	All the Generals nod "yes"

						PRESIDENT
				All right, then! Staedert?

						PRIEST (O.S.)
				Mr. President?

	The President scans the room. Staedert remote controls the camera toward
the room.

						PRESIDENT
				...Yes?

	The camera moves up the Priest and we finally discover his face.  He is
in his sixties, a shrewd look in his eyes.
	Around his neck hangs the Kommander's finger, the key to the temple.

						PRIEST
				Cornelius, Vito Cornelius. 50th level parish.
				I have a different theory to offer you,
				Mr. President.

						PRESIDENT
				I'm listening.

						CORNELIUS
				Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not
				anything that can be identified because it prefers
				not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are.
				Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.

						PRESIDENT
					(a little sarcastically)
				One more reason to shoot first eh?

	All the Generals nod in agreement.

						CORNELIUS
				Evil begets evil, Mr. President.
				Shooting would only make it stronger.

24	INT.  SPACESHIP

						TECHNICIAN
				The probe will attain its objective in
				five seconds.

	Staedert moves closer to the ship's window.

25	EXT.  SPACE.

	Evil swallows the probe and immediately bubbles over with activity like a
furious volcano.

26	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						STAEDERT
				Mr. President, we're at crisis point.

	The President looks puzzled.

						PRESIDENT
				Your theory is interesting Father but
				I don't think we have time to go into it
				right now!

						CORNELIUS
				Time is of no importance, Mr. President.
				Only life is important.

						PRESIDENT
					(exasperated)
				That's exactly what we are going to try and do:
				Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our
				fellow citizens! General?
				You may fire when ready.

27	INT.  SPACESHIP

						STAEDERT
					(cold) (to the CAPTAIN)
				..Up front loading of a 120 ZZR missile.
				Marker lights on the objective.

28	EXT.  OUTSIDE  SPACESHIP

	All of a sudden, outside the ship, the strange planet's activity ceases.
A black crust immediately covers it.

29	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

						SCIENTIST
					(consulting new data)
				Its structure has just solidified on the surface,
				 as if the object felt something.  If that's the case,
				we are undoubtedly dealing with an intelligence.

						CORNELIUS
				The most terrible intelligence imaginable,
				Mr. President.

	The President hesitates.

						CAPTAIN
				...The ship is in combat formation.
				The missile is loaded, General.

						PRESIDENT
					(uneasy)
				Staedert?  Give me a minute...
				I have a doubt.

						STAEDERT
					(cold)
				I don't, Mr. President.

30	EXT.  OUTSIDE  SPACESHIP

	The missile explodes from the ship and penetrates its target.  The
explosion is swallowed like a fizzy pill in a small glass of water.
Nothing happens.  And then the mass grows larger.

31	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM / PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	Staedert looks worried.

						STAEDERT
				Load a series of 740 missiles. Maximum
				shield protection.

						CAPTAIN
				Yes, Sir.

	The President is growing ever more worried.

						PRESIDENT
				Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you
				destroy it?

						STAEDERT
				I'm about to, Mr. President.

32	EXT.  SPACESHIP

	A series of three missiles heads for the planet, which absorbs them all.
And literally doubles in size.

						SCIENTIST
				The planet's diameter has greatly
				increased and it's moving toward the ship.

						PRESIDENT
				Staedert?  Get out of there immediately!
				I don't want an incident, do you hear me,
				Staedert?

						STAEDERT
					(worried)
				...What do we have that's bigger than 240?

						CAPTAIN
				Nothing, General.

						PRESIDENT
				Staedert, get out of there!  That's an order!

	A bead of sweat pearls Staedert's forehead. He is about to give an order
when a gigantic flame emerges from the planet and literally swallows
Staedert's spaceship.

						STAEDERT
					(eyes wide)
				... Good God!

	The flame fills the screen with a horrendous NOISE that....

33	INT.  APARTMENT

	... wakes up a man trying to escape from a nightmare. KORBEN DALLAS rubs
his head.  Thirty five years old, short hair, powerfully built,
unquestionable charm, good looking in spite of the scars here and there.
The alarm clock is still ringing, it shows the date as March 18, 2359.  It
in two in the morning. Ha grabs a cigarette, and stops to look for a
light.  He shuts oft the alarm.  He hears a cat mewing in the hall.  But it
	still rings.  Korben takes a moment and then realizes it in the phone
that is ringing.

						KORBEN
					(to the cat)
				I'm coming.

	He grabs the phone and crosses his tiny apartment (27 feet long by 6 feet
wide) heading for the door, patting himself for a light.  Behind him, the
bed makes itself automatically.

						KORBEN
					(on the phone)
				Yeah?

						FINGER (V.O.)
				Hey bud! Finger here.

	He opens the door for the cat and starts to rummage through a drawer for
a match. Out come a handful of war decorations, a hero's collection.

						KORBEN

					(to the cat)
				Hi sweetie!

	...A Medal of Honor Certificate to Major Dallas

						FINGER (V.O.)
				I love you too Major, but you haven't called
				me that since basic training.

						KORBEN
				I was talking to the cat.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer
				your cat to the real thing.

	...A picture of Korben and his ex-wife on their wedding day.

						KORBEN
				At least, the cat comes back.

						FINGER (V.O.)
					(ironical)
				You still pining for that two timing bitch.
				Forget her.
				There are a million women out there.

						KORBEN
				I don't want a million - I just want
				one.  A perfect one.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				Don't exist bud.

	...A picture of Korben and Finger in uniform next to a space fighter.

						KORBEN
				I just found a picture of you.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				How do I look?

						KORBEN
				Like shit.

	Korben finds a box of matches with three matches.  He strikes one. It
does not light.  Korben opens the fridge, bare, except for an empty can of
GEMINI croquettes.
	On the packet is an ad:
	WIN A DREAM TRIP FOR 2 TO FHLOSTON PARADISE.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				 Must be an old picture.. Listen, you gotta bring
				me your hack for the 6 month overhaul.  A.S.A.P.

	Korben heats up some brackish water.

						KORBEN
					(sighs)
				I don't need one.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				You forgetting who sat next to you for
				a thousand missions.
				I know how you drive.

						KORBEN
				Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a
				space fighter!!

						FINGER (V.O.)
				How many points you got left on your
				license?

						KORBEN
					(lying)
				Uh... at least fifty.

						FINGER (V.O.)
				In your dreams! See you tonight!

	Finger has hang up.  Korben sighs and does the same.  He gets the heated
brackish water and sits down.  The cat pounces on the table and meows for
its food.  Korben pours half the coffee in the cat's cup.

	The cat meows.  Korben taps his cup to the cat's saucer.

						KORBEN
				Cheers!

34	INT.  HALL - DAY - OMIT

35	INT.  GARAGE - DAY - OMIT

36	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The office is emptied, only a few army officers remain.  An ancient
manuscript, Billy's drawings, sits in front of the President.  Cornelius
turns page after page, illustrating his
	point.

						CORNELIUS
					(to the President)
				We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs
				to adapt itself to our living conditions.

						PRESIDENT
					(worried)
				And then?

						CORNELIUS
				And then it will be too late. The goal of
				evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life.
				For all eternity...Life upsets it.

	The President appears upset himself by this image.

						PRESIDENT
				Is there anything that can stop it?

						CORNELIUS
					(knowing)
				Yes..thank God..

37	EXT.  SPACE

	The Mondoshawan spaceship bursts through a star cluster and fills the
screen.

38	INT.  COCKPIT - OMIT

39	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The manuscript is open on the President's desk.. CLOSE ON:
	Billy's rendering of the Mondoshawan.

						CORNELIUS
					(to the President)
				The Mondoshawans don't belong to the
				Federated Territories, but they are peaceful...
				in their possession are the four elements of life.
				These elements when they are gathered around a fifth:
				The Supreme Being, ultimate warrior, created to protect
				life......

	The SUPREME BEING is standing, as if frozen in armor.  All we see is the
bottom half of his body.  Big metallic gloves hold the case engraved with
the emblem of the three suns containing the four Sacred Stones.

						CORNELIUS
				..will produce what the ancients called the
				light of creation, the light of total goodness
				which is the only thing that can defeat EVIL.

	The President points to the spot occupied by the 5th element.

						PRESIDENT
				But what happens if instead of
				this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL
				who stands here?

						CORNELIUS
				White turns to black.  Light to Dark.
				Life to Death.  For all eternity.

	The President's nerves quiver.

						CAPTAIN
				Sir, we have a Mondoshawan spaceship at
				the frontier requesting permission to enter
				 our territory.

						PRESIDENT
				I guess I should make a decision..

						CORNELIUS
				They are the only ones who can help..

						GENERAL
				Sir..the Mondoshawan do not belong to the
				federation. We do not know their intention..
				I must recommend a full trinuclear assault..

						PRESIDENT
					(yells)
				Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship
				like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is!
				I ask you for options you give me bullshit.
				Give them permission to enter our territories
				with my warmest regards.

						CORNELIUS
					(relieved)
				Thank you, Mr. President.

42	EXT.  SPACE / INT.  MONDOSHAWAN  SHIP

	The MONDOSHAWAN spaceship zips across the Federated Galaxy.
	But it is not alone: Two black warships seem to be dogging it.

43	INT.  MONDOSHAWAN  COCKPIT

	The MONDOSHAWANS have spotted the spacecraft chasing them.

						FIRST OFFICER
				Two non-identified ships approaching.

						CAPTAIN
				Must be the welcoming committee.

44	INT.  WARSHIP  COCKPIT

	A MANGALORE sits at the controls of the warship. His terrifying features
tell us what sort of welcome they can expect.  The pilot fires without
warning.

45	EXT.  SPACE / INT.	MONDOSHAWAN  SHIP

	The huge ship is badly hit and immediately swerves oft course.
	Panic aboard the MONDOSHAWAN ship.

46	INT.  MONDOSHAWAN  SHIP

						CAPTAIN
				We've been hit! General alert!!!

	Blast after blast hits the defenseless ship.

						CAPTAIN
				We're losing control! We have to land fast!

	The huge ship veers oft course and heads for a small red planet, taking
hit after hit.

						CAPTAIN
				Send out a distress signal!!! Activate
				the emergency landing procedure!

	The huge ship approaches the planet at blinding speed.

						FIRST OFFICER
				Impact in less than ten seconds!

	The red planet looms ever closer.

						CAPTAIN
				Time is of no importance...

	The ship crashes in a gigantic explosion.

46A	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT - DAY

	A thermo nuclear explosion fills a T.V. screen..Which Korben's cat
watches with interest.

	Korben is about to exit the apartment.

						KORBEN
				Don't watch it all day, it'll rot your
				mind. Bye sweetie..

	In response, the cat meows.  Korben opens the door to..A huge
	gun, brandished by a nervous MUGGER, pointing right in his face.

						MUGGER
				The cash man!

						KORBEN
				Been here long?

						MUGGER
				Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow
				you into tomorrow!

	Unperterbed, Korben looks at the mugger's fearsome weapon.

						KORBEN
				Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium.
				Neuro charged assault model?

						MUGGER
					(off balance)
				Uh..

						KORBEN
				You know you could hurt someone with
				this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..

	The mugger is lost.  He looks at his weapon.

						MUGGER
				It's not?

						KORBEN
				You gotta push the little yellow button...

	Korben points to the button on the side of the gun.  The mugger takes his
advice.

						MUGGER
				Thanks..

						KORBEN
				You're welcome..

	And with lightning speed, Korben blasts the mugger with a straight right
hand, sending him down for the count.  Korben retrieves the gun.

						KORBEN
				..you know these things are VERY illegal..
				you could get in a shit load of trouble..
				I better hang onto it for you..

	As the mugger clears his head, Korben opens a drawer next to him which is
full of similar guns! The mugger's eyes pop out of his head.  He scampers
to his feet and runs off.

	Korben shrugs, exits his apartment, and closes the door.  The cat watches
a nuclear holocaust on T.V.,  uninterrupted.

46B	INT.  KORBEN'S  GARAGE - DAY

	Korben enters his taxi.  A robotic voice greets him.

						VOICE
				Please enter your license..

	Korben complies, and starts to push a series of buttons on the dash.

						VOICE
				Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..

						KORBEN
				How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK?
				I didn't.

	Korben hits a button.  The garage door starts to open.

						VOICE
				Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...

						KORBEN
				I had the worst goddamn nightmare.

						VOICE
				You have nine points left on your license..

						KORBEN
				Thanks for reminding me..

	As the garage door lifts, the Megalopolis that is New York City in the
23rd century comes into view.  Startling in it's height, and breath.

						VOICE
				Have a nice day..

	Korben lets the propulsion build.

						KORBEN
				Right..

	He lets the gear slip.  The taxi rockets off into the City.

49	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	Cornelius collapses in a chair.

						CORNELIUS
				We are lost!

						GENERAL MUNRO
				Mr. President, the attack was launched by two
				unregistered warships.

						PRESIDENT
				Close all borders and declare a state of
				general alert.

						GENERAL MUNRO
				Yes, sir.

						PRESIDENT
					(to another OFFICER)
				Try to contact these Mondoshawans.  We
				owe them an explanation.

						CORNELIUS
					(lost, to himself)
				What are we going to do?

						PRESIDENT
				This is government business now.
				You ought to go home and get some
				rest, Father.

	The President motions to his guards to come and get Cornelius.

						PRESIDENT
				I promise to keep you informed.

	A weary Cornelius leaves the room with David's help.

						PRESIDENT
					(to the CAPTAIN)
			...Has the rescue team found any survivors?

50	EXT.  RED  PLANET - OMIT

52	INT.  LABORATORY  1ST DISTRICT  MANHATTAN - DAWN

	An arm, on a surgical cart, moves down the hall of the Nucleological
Center, the most sterile of environments.

	PROFESSOR MACTILBURGH, age 60, hurries alongside GENERAL MUNRO.

						MUNRO
				This is all that survived?

						MACTILBURGH
				Actually only one cell survived..

						MUNRO
				Have you identified it?

						MACTILBURGH
				It's not that easy..we've never encountered
				anything like it before..you see normal human
				beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is
				more than enough for any species to perpetuate
				itself..This one has 200,000.

						MUNRO
				Talk English Doc.

						MACTILBURGH
				This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite
				genetic knowledge stored inside.
				Almost like it was...engineered.

						MUNRO
				Sounds like a freak of nature to me.

						MACTILBURGH
				Yes... I can't wait to meet him.

	They pass into the lab.

53	INT.  LABORATORY

	The two enter a cylindrical laboratory.  There is a huge glass turbine in
the middle with the metal glove inside.  A DNA chain scrolls on the computer
screen.

						MACTILBURGH
					(rather fascinated)
				The compositional elements of his DNA
				chain are the same as ours, there are simply
				more of them tightly packed.
				His knowledge is probably limitless..

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?

						MACTILBURGH
				We put it through the cellular hygiene detector.
				The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.

	Munro hesitates a moment.  Then he sighs and uses his personal key to
open the
	self-destruct box.

						MUNRO
				OK, go ahead! But Mr. Perfect better be polite...
				otherwise I turn him into cat food.

	Mactilburgh starts the operation rolling as Munro puts his hand on the
sell-destruct button, ready to use it.  Thousands of cells form in the
heart of the generator, an assemblage of DNA elements.  Then the cells move
down a tube, like a fluid, and gather in an imprint of a HUMAN body.  Step
by step bones are reconstructed, then the nervous and muscular systems.
Whole veins wrap around the muscles.  An entire body is reconstructing before
our very eyes.

						DOCTOR
				Three seconds to ultra-violet protection.

	A shield comes over the reconstructing body and makes it invisible.

						MACTILBURGH
					(to Munro)
				...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction
				of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly
				greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells
				to react, to protect themselves.
				That means growing skin. Clever, eh?

						MUNRO
					(disgusted)
				Wonderful!

	The meter slows, drops to zero.

						ASSISTANT
				... End of reconstruction, beginning of
				reanimation .

	A whoosh of air in the glass chamber.  Captain Munro has his hand on the
self-destruct button, ready to destroy the being that has barely been
reborn.

						MACTILBURGH
					(pushing a button)
				Activate life support system.

	An electrical discharge fills the glass chamber causing the body inside
to jerk.
	After a few moments of silence, the SOUND of a heartbeat fills the room
over the loudspeaker.

						ASSISTANT
				Life support system activated.

	The Supreme Being is alive once again.

						MACTILBURGH
				Remove the shield.

	The ASSISTANT automatically removes the ultra-violet shield which slowly
reveals... a woman... nude... young... and very beautiful.  Munro stands there
gaping.  Not quite his vision of the Supreme Being.  Mactilburgh glances
at Munro and gently pushes his hand away from the self-destruct button.

						MACTILBURGH
					(with a smile)
				I told you ... perfect!

	Munro is hypnotized by the GIRL's beauty.

						MUNRO
				...I'd, uh , like to get a few pictures for the
archives
				before she wakes up.

	Mactilburgh looks at him with a grin.  A remote-control camera approaches
the girl's face, a flash goes off.  Blinded by the flash, the girl jumps and
screams.  She cowers in a corner, shaking from the cold, darting eyes
everywhere looking for the case she was holding.

						GIRL
					(very angry)
				Ouacra cocha o dayodomo binay ouacra
				mo cocha ferji akba ligounai makta keratapla.
				Tokemata tokemata!  Seno santonoi-aypa!
				Minoi ay Cheba!  Givomana seno!

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				What's she saying?

						MACTILBURGH
					(to his ASSISTANT)
				Activate the phonic detector.

	The girl kicks the window repeatedly.

						MACTILBURGH
				And give her a light sedative...
				and something to wear!

	The ASSISTANT hits a button.  A pile of clothes drops out of a trapdoor
in the ceiling.  She snatches up the clothes angrily and dresses quickly.
Munro draws closer to the glass window.  He watches her dress with
undisguised pleasure.

						MUNRO
					(to Mactilburgh)
				This thing solid?

						MACTILBURGH
					(smiling)
				An elephant couldn't crack it.

	The Girl finishes dressing.

						GIRL
					(angrily)
				Teno akta chataman assin-omekta!

	Munro smiles safely behind his plate glass window.

						MUNRO
					(with a smile)
				You're gonna have to learn to communicate
				better than that angel if you want out.

	Munro dangles the key on a chain that will let her out.  The girl rams
her fist right through the window.  She grabs the key and yanks it.  The
chain snaps tight and Munro slams into the window knocking himself out.  The
girl puts her hand through the window again, unlocks the chamber and steps
out.  She is still bit wobbly on her legs.  Two GUARDS try to grab her.
She sends them flying across the room. Mactilburgh is most impressed.  He
sets off a general alarm.

54	INT.  CORRIDOR  LABORATORY

	The girl runs through a maze of corridors looking for a way out.  A squad
of SECURITY GUARDS appear in front of her and open fire without warning. The
girl takes a leap, grabs an air vent, kicks it out and dives into the air
shaft.  The COPS try and jump up to the vent, but none can reach it.

						CHIEF
				Get me a chair or a stepladder The rest of you
				go through the main ventilation!

55	INT.  VENTILATION DUCT  LABORATORY

	The girl moves along unable to see what's ahead of her. She comes to a
dead-end, a grill that leads outside.  She pushes it out and exits onto
the ledge.

56	EXT.  LEDGE  LABORATORY - DAWN

	She has exited to a ledge on the 450th floor of a building, right in the
middle of Manhattan, which we discover for the first time.  The city has
become monstrous. Buildings rise 600 stories.  Cars fly.  Subways run
vertically...The girl edges along the narrow ledge, unfazed by the height.
The CHIEF leans out the vent, looking out into the void.

						CHIEF
					(to his men)
				Go on follow her!

	The COPS stare into the gaping void.

						COP
				...No way.

	The CHIEF angrily pulls out his gun and shoots at the girl who ducks
around the corner of the building.  Unfortunately the other side in full of
cops as well.  A flying police car zooms up in front of her, sirens
blaring.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				This in the police.  Your status is illegal.
				Please put up your hands and follow our
				instructions!

	The girl feels trapped.  She looks down into the endless 450 below and
all the cars flying underneath her.  Then she raises her arms... and dives
off.

57	INT.  POLICE  CAR - NIGHT

						COP
					(in the car.)
				Christ! She dove off!

	In a panic, the COP makes a wrong turn.  The girl falls for several
seconds.
	She lands on the roof of a flying cab.

58	INT.  CAB - NIGHT

	Korben tries to control his car, reeling from the impact.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				You have just had an accident.
				Seven points have been temporarily
				removed...

	Korben manages to stop his cab, pulls over to the side.

						VOICE / KORBEN
				You have one point left on your license.
				Have a good day.

	Korben sighs and looks in the back seat to see what the damages are.  The
girl, a bit dazed (who wouldn't be), emerges from the debris and sits up.
There's some blood on her face.  Korben is stunned. The girl's still alive
and... so beautiful.  His heart heads for a meltdown.

						GIRL
				Akina delutan, nou-shan.

						KORBEN
					(lost)
				...'Scuse me?

	A police car with wailing sirens halts in front of Korben.

						COP
					(over a loudspeaker)
				You have an unauthorized passenger in your
				vehicle.  We are going to arrest her.
				Please leave your hands on the wheel.
				Thank you for your cooperation.

						KORBEN
					(obeying)
				Sorry, Hon, but I only got one point left
				on my license and I gotta get to the garage!

	The police car presses up against the cab.  Doors slide open.  Huge guns
point at her.  Korben feels lousy.  The girl's helpless, there are tears in
her eyes, she looks exhausted.
	Korben glances at her in the rear view mirror. She's looking all around
to find something to help her communicate with him.

	Her POV: an ad on the back of the seat. An 800 number to help an
orphanage. A teary photo of a kid over the words Please Help.  She shoots
to Korben a look of pure distress.

						GIRL
					(irresistible)
				Please... HELP...

	Korben can't resist her plea.

						KORBEN
				Don't put me in this position...
				I can't... I'm late as it is...

	But he cannot say no to her eyes.

						KORBEN
				Finger's gonna kill me.

	Korben shuts oft the meter and floors it, sideswiping the police car as
he roars away.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				Your license has been revoked.
				Would you please....

	Korben whips out a gun and shatters the loudspeaker.

						KORBEN
				I hate when people cry...
				I got no defense...

	The police car takes out after him, sirens screeching.  An insane chase
ensues.

59	INT.  NEW YORK  STREETS - DAY

	Korben and his flying taxi are absolute masters of the air.  The cops
have trouble following him but then another cop car comes to join in the
fun.  Korben drives like a man possessed, nothing can stop him. Except the
dead-end he's just come up against.

						GIRL
				Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!

						KORBEN
				It there's one thing I don't need advice on,
				it's how to drive.

	Korben turns his cab sideways and scrapes through a narrow passageway,
	ripping his taxi light from the roof.  The police car smashes into the
wall.  The other one brakes just in time.

						COP
				Shit! Attention all-patrol cars!

	The car makes a U-turn, looking for a wider passageway.

60	EXT.  NEW YORK  STREET

	The police car roars up, sirens screaming then slows down and checks out
a dead-end flanked by a large vertical neon billboard. The dead-end is empty .
Korben's cab is hidden vertically behind the billboard.  Seeing nothing, the
	police drive away.

						KORBEN
				We'll wait till things quiet down a bit.
				You mind?

	The girl grabs his shirt collar and pulls him close, whispers in his ear.

						GIRL
					(weak)
				...Priest...

						KORBEN
				You're not that bad... Come on we'll
				get you to a doctor.

	The girl hands him the handle of the case, struck with the three Egyptian
suns.

						GIRL
					(weak)
				Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...

						KORBEN
				Vito Cornelius?

	The girl nods, then faints.  Korben is somewhat lost faced with so much
mystery.

61	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	The door opens. Korben is there with the unconscious girl in his arms.

						KORBEN
					(embarrassed)
				Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.

						CORNELIUS
					(tired)
				Weddings are one floor down.
				Congratulations.

	Cornelius closes the door.  The doorbell RINGS again.

						KORBEN
				She's not my bride, she's my fare.
				She's looking for this Vito Cornelius.
				According to the phone guide he lives here.

						CORNELIUS
					(curious)
				That's me.  But I don't know who she is...
				where did you find her?

						KORBEN
				She dropped in on me... holding this.

	Korben hands him the metal handle with the three Egyptian suns, stamped
on it.

						CORNELIUS
					(staggered)
				The fifth element.

	He faints dead away.  Korben, with the girl still in his arms looks
around helpless.

						KORBEN
					(sighing)
				Finger's gonna kill me...

62	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	In his armchair, Cornelius gets woken by a slap in the face.

						CORNELIUS
					(with a start)
				Who are you?

						KORBEN
				I brought the girl remember?

						CORNELIUS
				The girl?

	Cornalius gets up.  He looks at the handle.

						KORBEN
				Yeah! She dropped in on me. I mean
				on my taxi... talking... this... this bizarre
				language...

	And then it dawns on Cornelius who the girl is.

						CORNELIUS
					(eyes riveted on her)
				He's a she!

						KORBEN
					(bemused)
				You noticed...

						CORNELIUS
					(face shining)
				There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up,
				but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's
				most precious possession! She is... perfect!

						KORBEN
				So you do know her.

						CORNELIUS
				Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..

	Cornelius runs into the next room.  Korben looks at the girl, goes to
slap her, then changes his mind.

	Her beauty troubles him.  He hesitates, then, gently caresses her cheek.
Her skin seems so soft, so fragile.

						KORBEN
				Perfect...

63	INT.  SMALL  ROOM

	David, is mending a cassock when Cornelius bursts into the room out of
breath.

						CORNELIUS
				It's a miracle!!!

						DAVID
					(worried)
				What is?

						CORNELIUS
					(babbling crazily)
				I can't wear these clothes! This calls
				for dignity!
				I have to dress the part!

	He opens a closet filled with identical robes and plunges in,
disappearing as David looks on, uncomprehending.

64	INT  LIVING ROOM.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT

	Korben gently kisses the girl's cheeks, but she doesn't respond.  He
looks around then kisses her on the lips.  The girl's eyes snap open.
When Korben straightens up he discovers his own gun jammed under his
chin.

						GIRL
					(angry)
				Eto Akta Gamat!

						KORBEN
					(embarrassed)
				I'm sorry, it's just that... I was
				told to wake you up gently, so I figured...

	The girl pauses a moment.  She stares at him, looks puzzled.

						KORBEN
				You're right, I was wrong! I shouldn't
				have kissed you... especially since we
				haven't been introduced and...
					(he pulls out a business card)
				Here, it's a bit late, but... my name is
				Korben, Korben Dallas.
				Keep it, you never know, maybe... you'll
				need a cab one day.  I'll be happy to open
				the door this time!.

	The girl hesitates, then snatches the card like a wild animal.

65	INT.  SMALL  ROOM

	Cornelius is lost in the closet.

						DAVID
				Father, will you please explain what's
				going on?

						CORNELIUS
				The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here,
				in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!

66	INT.  LIVING ROOM

						KORBEN
				...What's your name?

						GIRL
					(after a moment)
				Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai
				Ekbat De Sebat.

						KORBEN
					(polite)
				Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname,
				something a little... shorter?

						GIRL
				...Leeloo.

	Korben is falling in love.

						KORBEN
				That's... really cute...

	Cornelius bursts into the room.  She turns the gun on him.
	He bows before her.

						CORNELIUS
				Appipulai Leeloo Minai..

						LEELOO
				Corn-i-Lius?

						CORNELIUS
					(bowing)
				At your service.

	LEELOO lowers her guard starts to laugh.  An irresistible childish laugh.
	Korben smiles.

						DAVID
				Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?

						CORNELIUS
				Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on
				her gloves!

	David bows low, but his eyes glance up at Leeloo.  Cornelius begins to
lead Korben toward the door, hustling him out.

						KORBEN
				They all like this in your family, father?

						CORNELIUS
				She's an exception..

						CORNELIUS
				Thank you so much for your help Mr...?

						KORBEN
				Dallas. Korben Dallas.

	Cornelius takes his arm. Leeloo stops laughing when she sees Korben
leaving.

						CORNELIUS
				Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much.
				A thousand times over!

						KORBEN
				I might call to check up on her,
				you know... to see if she's better?

						CORNELIUS
				She's fine, really..don't you worry..
				just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.

						KORBEN
				I know. I was there when she arrived.

	Cornelius is about to close the door.  Korben's hand blocks it.

						KORBEN
				Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something
				to me a while ago and... I don't really get it...
				Akta Gamat?

						CORNELIUS
				It means, "Never without my permission".

						KORBEN
				That's what I thought.

	Cornelius slams the door in his face.

						KORBEN
				...Thanks.

	Korben beads down the hallway. He passes his NEIGHBOR.

	Korben enters his-apartment.

66B	INT.. KORBEN'S  APARTMENT - DAY

	The door slides back and the cat comes rubbing up against him, tail in
the air.

						KORBEN
				Oh god. I forgot your food ... I'm really sorry!
				How about a nice Thai nosh to apologize?
				How does that sound, huh?

	The cat meows, appeased, just an the phone rings.

						KORBEN
				Hello?

				Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.

						FINGER (V.O.)

				So, just how big was this fare?

						KORBEN

68	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	Leeloo has a towel wrapped around her, it looks like she just took a
shower.  She sits  in front of a computer wolfing down some chicken.  Data
scrolls by on the screen.  David watches from the corner, in awe.

						DAVID
				What's she doing?

						CORNELIUS
				Learning our history!
				The last 5000 years that she missed!
				She's been out of circulation a while,
				you know.

	Leeloo breaks into her childish laughter.

						CORNELIUS
				What're you laughing about?

						LEELOO
					(pronouncing badly)
				Napoleon... small.

	She laughs again and tosses some capsules into the microwave.

						DAVID
					(hesitant)
				Uh father, I know she's been through a lot...
				but the sacred stones..we don't have much
				time..

						CORNELIUS
				Yes. Of course..

	Leeloo takes her plate out of the microwave.  A steaming plate heaped
with chicken and exotic vegetables.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo..I'm sorry to interrupt you but..

	She sits back down in front of the screen and chomps away heavily on her
second chicken.  Cornelius sits opposite her. and holds up the case
handle.

						CORNELIUS
					(serious)
				The case..with the stones...
				Where is it?

						LEELOO
				San Agamat chay bet... envolet!

						CORNELIUS
				The case was stolen?

	Leeloo nods her head, quite unperturbed and continues to devour the food
in front of her.

	CLOSE ON: A pair of feet limping heavily.  A MAN comes alongside them.

						RIGHT ARM
				Excuse me sir, the council is worried about
				the economy heating up.  They wondered if
				it would be possible to fire 500...

	They reach a door at the end of the corridor.  Zorg enters a code.

						ZORG
				Fire 1000.

						RIGHT ARM
				But... 500 is all they need, sir.

	ZORG turns slowly.  A small scar across run across his face, his eye
stutters.
	This is not a man to cross, or contradict.

						RIGHT ARM
				1000! Fine, sir!
				Sorry to have disturbed you.

	The door opens...

70	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	... and David enters carrying a bundle of clothes.

						CORNELIUS
				There was this guy with a limp who
				came a month ago..said he was an art
				dealer ... Asking all these questions about
				the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think
				anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so
				bad with names...

						DAVID
					(to Leeloo, timid)
				I didn't know your size.

	Leeloo is happy. She pulls off the towel and stands there nude. Cornelius
and David turn away.

						DAVID
				They really made her...

						CORNELIUS
				Perfect.

	Leeloo finishes dressing. She is delighted.

						LEELOO
					(to David)
				Domo danko!

	David smiles, dumb with admiration.  Cornelius comes over.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo?  The Stones...
				We must get them back.

	Leeloo settles down, sits at the computer and turns it on.

						LEELOO
				Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!

						CORNELIUS
				You know exactly where they are!

71	INT.  WAREHOUSE - DAY

	A group of handsome WARRIORS approaches.  AKNOT, their leader has the
sacred case in his hands.  The metal handle is missing but the second
metal glove is still grasping the case.

						ZORG
					(pretending to be worried)
				Aknot?  Is that you?

	The LEADER nods. A disgusted look stamps Zorg's features.

						ZORG
				...What an ugly face! Doesn't suit you at all!
				Take it off...

	AKNOT's face burns away revealing the head of a monstrous MANGALORE.

						ZORG
				That's better! Never be ashamed of
				who you are...
				You're warriors... be proud...

	AKNOT says nothing, but if his eyes could talk!

						ZORG
				So what if the Federal Army crushed your
				entire race and scattered your people to the
				wind...
				Your time for revenge is at hand...
				Voila... the ZF1.

	He takes out a weapon from one a crate and goes into a sales pitch.

						ZORG
					(very fast)
				...It's light... the handle's adjustable for
				easy carrying... good for righties and lefties.

	Meanwhile, two MEN set up a mannequin rigged with various defense
mechanisms at the far end of the warehouse.

						ZORG
				... Breaks down into four parts, undetectable by
				X-rays.. It's the ideal weapon for quick, discreet
				interventions.  A word on fire power: Titanium
				recharger. 3000 round clip with bursts of 3 to 300.
				With the replay button, another Zorg innovation,
				it's even easier... one shot.

	He fires at the mannequin.

						ZORG
				... and replay sends every following shot
				to the same location...

	Zorg spins around, the rounds all hit the mannequin.

						ZORG
					(even faster)
				I recharge, but the enemy has launched a
				cowardly sneak attack from behind, the
				automirror takes care of that.  Gives me the
				time to turn around and finish the job.
				300 round bursts, then there are the Zorg oldies...

	He fires off each item he names.

						ZORG
				...Rocket launcher.  The always efficient
				flame thrower... My favorite.
				Our famous net launcher, the arrow launcher,
				with exploding or poisonous gas heads - very
				practical.
				And for the grand finale, the all-new ice-cube
				system!

	The mannequin has been blasted into a pile of ashes covered by a net,.
stuck with arrows, the whole mess frozen solid. He tosses the weapon into
AKNOT's hands.

						ZORG
				...Four full crates, delivered right on time!
				What about you, my dear Aknot, did
				you bring me what I asked you for?

	AKNOT sets the case on a crate.  Zorg gloats while stroking the case.

						ZORG
				...Magnificent.

	Zorg smiles, takes a deep breath, opens the case.  It's empty

72	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	Leeloo breaks into her childish laughter once again.

						CORNELIUS
					(astonished)
				What do you mean empty?

73	INT.  ZORG'S  WAREHOUSE - DAY

	AKNOT looks into the case.  Things grow tense.

						ZORG
				Alright..I've got an open mind here..
				anyone care to explain?

74	INT.  CORNELIUS'  APARTMENT - DAY

	Leeloo explains what happened in her language.

						CORNELIUS
					(translating)
				She says that the Guardians never really had
				much faith in humans. They were afraid of
				being attacked. The stones were given to someone
				they could trust who took another route.
				She's supposed to contact this person in a little less
				than twelve hours from now in a hotel.
				She's looking for the address!

	A map of the stars flashes onto the screen, Leeloo points.

						LEELOO
				Dot!

	The little group comes over to look.

						DAVID

	Cornelius plops down into his armchair.

						CORNELIUS
				...We're saved!

75	INT.  ZORG'S  WAREHOUSE - DAY

						ZORG
				I'm fucked!

	Zorg calmly closes the case and gives Aknot a blood-chilling stare.

						AKNOT
				You asked for a case.
				We brought you a case.

						ZORG
					(shouting)
				A case with four stones in it. Not one!
				Not two or three! But four!!! Four stones!!!
				What the fuck am I supposed to do with an
				EMPTY case?!!

AKNOT's men grow edgy.

						AKNOT
					(tense)
				...We are warriors, not merchants!

						ZORG
					(humored)
				But you can still count.  Look...
				my fingers.

	He holds up four fingers.

						ZORG
				...Four stones, four crates... Zero stones...
					(yelling)
				ZERO CRATES!!!
					(to his men)
				Put everything back, we're outta here.

	AKNOT's warriors turn their weapons on Zorg.

						AKNOT
					(icily)
				We risked our lives. I believe a
				little compensation is in order.

						ZORG
					(smiling)
				So, you are a merchant, after all.
					(to his men)
				Leave them one crate.  For the cause!

	Zorg's men leave a crate and exit with the other three.

76	EXT.  OUTSIDE  ZORG'S  WAREHOUSE - DAY

	Zorg walks along the street to his limo.  RIGHT ARM carries the empty
case.

						ZORG
				I don't like warriors!  They're too
				narrow-minded, no sublety.  Worse,
				they fight for hopeless causes..for honor!
				Honor has killed millions of people but
				hasn't saved a single one.
					(pause)
				You know what -- do I like though, I like killer.
				  A real dyed in the wool killer.  Cold-blooded.
				Clean.  Methodical.  Thorough.  A killer, when
				he picked up the ZF1, would've immediately
				asked about the little red button on the bottom of
				the gun.

77	INT.  HALLWAY  ZORG'S WAREHOUSE - DAY

	The warriors have all taken a weapon. One of them inspects his ZF1.  He
turns it over and notices the little red button. He presses it.

	Korben is finishing a Thai meal, cooked by a Thai on his mini restaurant
anchored at the window. The cat eats next to Korben, contented.

						KORBEN
				So you forgive me?

	The cat meows just as a red light blinks, announcing the arrival of a
message in a glass tube.  Korben ignores it.

						THAI
				Not going to open?

						KORBEN
				I've never gotten a message that wasn't
				bad news.

						THAI
				How someone strong like you scared from
				a message? Is good news I sure!

						KORBEN
				The last two messages I got?  The first one
				was from my wife telling me she was leaving!
				And the second was from my lawyer telling me
				he was leaving too... with my wife.

						THAI
				You right that is bad.. but mathematically
				luck must change!
				Grandfather say: "It never rain every day."
				This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!

	Korben hesitates, then gives the envelope to the Thai, who opens it with
a big smile that fades as reads the contents aloud.

						THAI
				...You're fired. Oh!

	Korben smiles at him.

						KORBEN
				At least I won lunch.

						THAI
				Good philosophy..see good in bad..
				I like..I prepare number one dessert..
				special for you and pussy..

	The cat meows.

	Leeloo is polishing of' an immense pile of dessert as David bangs away at

						DAVID
				I got it!  Everything  here we need to

				and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!

						CORNELIUS
				Good work, my son.  Now all we need is
				a way to get there.

	The doorbell rings.

						CORNELIUS
				I'll get it.  Finish your work my son.

	Cornelius opens to Right Arm with armed escort.

						ZORG
				Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg...
				nice to see you again

						CORNELIUS
				I remember you now..the so called
				art dealer.

						ZORG
				I'm glad you got your memory back, Father...
				Because you're going to need it...
				Where are the stones?

						CORNELIUS
				...Why on earth do the stones interest you?

						ZORG
				Personally, they are of no interest to me,
				I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer...
				so tell me...

						CORNELIUS
				Even it I did know where the stones were
				I would never tell somebody like you.

						ZORG
				Why?  What's wrong with me?

						CORNELIUS
				...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life,
				All you want to do is destroy it.

						ZORG
				Ah, Father... You are so wrong.
				Let me explain...

	Zorg leads Cornelius into his inner office.

						ZORG
				...would you like a drink?

						CORNELIUS
				No thank you.

						ZORG
				Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve,
				comes from destruction. Look at this empty
				glass.

	Zorg pushes the glass with his finger.

						ZORG
				Here it is... peaceful... serene...
				but if it is...

	Zorg pushes the glass off the table.  It shatters on the floor.

						ZORG
				Destroyed...

	Small individual robots, both free-wheeling and integrated, come zipping
out to clean up the mess.

						ZORG
				...Look at all these little things...
				so busy all of a sudden.
				Notice how each one is useful.
				What a lovely ballet, so full of form
				and color.  So full of..life!

						CORNELIUS
				They are robots!

	A SERVANT comes in pours water in another glass.  Zorg tosses a cherry
into it.

						ZORG
				Yes but... by that simple gesture of destruction.
				I gave work to at least fifty people today. The
				engineers, the technicians, the mechanics. Fifty
				people who will be able to feed their children so
				they can grow up big and strong.  Children who
				will have children of their own, adding to the great
				cycle of life!

	Cornelius sits in silence.

						ZORG
				Father, by creating a little destruction,
				I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in
				reality, you and I are in the same business!

						CORNELIUS
				Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people
				with the weapons you produce is quite another.

						ZORG
				Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill
				more people in my entire life than religion has
				killed in the last 2000 years.

	Zorg smiles, holds up the glass and takes a drink.
	Unfortunately, he chokes on the cherry.  Unable to breathe, Zorg starts
to panic.

						CORNELIUS
					(mocking)
				Where's the robot to pat your back?

	Zorg falls, writhing, on his desk, inadvertently hitting buttons which
trigger a slew of little mechanisms.  They pop out all over the desk.
True chaos reigns.  Even a cage appears, holding a Souliman Aktapan, a fat
multicolored beastie, PICASSO, who seems surprised to be out in daylight.  He
licks his half-dead master in thanks.  Cornelius gets up and walks around
the desk.  Zorg motions for help.

						CORNELIUS
				Can I give you a hand?

	Cornelius whacks him on the back.  The cherry comes flying out.  Zorg
regains control of himself. GUARDS come running in.

						ZORG
				You saved my life... So, I'm going
				to spare yours.
					(to the GUARDS)
				Throw him out!

	The GUARDS throw Cornelius out.

						CORNELIUS
				You are a monster, Zorg!

						ZORG
					(complimented)
				I know...

	The GUARDS drag Cornelius out of the office.

						ZORG
				...Torture whoever you want, the
				president if you have to but I want
				those Stones. You have an hour.

	Right Arm salutes and hurries out of the office.

				The Mondoshawan never fully trusted the

	C.U. The most disgusting dessert ever made.  Korben looks at it shimmying
on a plate as the Thai serves it to him proudly.

						THAI
				Stewed jellyfish cake.. my speciality..

	Korben forces a weak, polite smile as the Thai looks on expectantly.  The
phone rings.

						KORBEN
				Saved by the bell.

	Korben rises to get his cigarettes, and answer the phone.

						KORBEN
				...Hello?

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in
				this stinking City!

						KORBEN
					(resigned)
				Hi Ma...

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				I've been playing twice a week for 20 years,
				20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.

	Korben goes to light his cigarette.  There are only two matches left in
the match box.
	Korben strikes one and it fizzles.

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				You wouldn't even eat one to help your
				poor mother, and you win the big prize?
				Know something? The whole thing makes
				me sick!

	The Thai starts to clean up.  Just as Korben goes to strike the second
match..

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				Are you listening to me, you ingrate!

						KORBEN
					(resigned)
				Yes ma..

	Korben sighs and puts the match back in the box.

	Korben enters his code on the keypad the Thai is holding.

						KORBEN
					(to the Thai)
				Go on... This is gonna take a while!

The Thai casts oft.  Korben closes the window.

						KORBEN
				Other than that... You all right?

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				...And now you're making fun of me?
				I'm warning you! If you don't take me
				after all these years of sacrifice, I'll
				never forgive you!!

	The Thai flies off.  In the hall, the cat meows-for more food.

						KORBEN
					(to the cat)
				I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking
				about?

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				I get it! You want to make me beg,
				is that it?

						KORBEN
				All I want is an explanation! I just got
				in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab.
				I got mugged, but other than that
				everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!!
				Now settle down and explain to me calmly..

	A message drops in his tube.  The red light goes on.

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				You just won a trip, you dolt!
				Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!

						KORBEN
				Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it.
				Someone would have notified me.

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				They've been blaring out your name on
				the radio for the last hour, blockhead!

	He eyeballs the message still in the tube.  The doorbell rings.-

						KORBEN
				Ma.. it's the door. I'll call you back.

	Korben hangs up before his mother can say anything and heads for the
door.  Before he gets there it opens, General Munro enters followed by a
Captain and a Major.
	MAJOR ICEBORG is a woman. All she needs to become a man is a mustache.
	Munro opens a file.

						MUNRO
					(clipped)
				Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct
				you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal
				Army on your enlistment which is more than
				you will need for a mission of the utmost
				importance.

						KORBEN
				What mission?

						MUNRO
				To save the world.

						KORBEN
				Where have I heard this song before?

						MUNRO
				You're to leave immediately for Fhloston
				Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the
				Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with
				the utmost discretion as possible.
				Any questions'?

						KORBEN
					(a little bewildered)
				Just one... why me?

						MUNRO
				Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite
				Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army
				you are an expert in the use of all weapons
				and spacecraft needed for this mission.

	Munro pulls out a long list of documents.

						MUNRO
				Two: Of all the members of your unit
				you were the most highly decorated.

						KORBEN
				And the third one?

						MUNRO
				You're the only one left alive...

	Munro removes the message Korben hasn't bothered to look at.

						MUNRO
				Don't you open your messages?

						KORBEN
				I've had enough good news for today

						MUNRO
					(by rote)
				You have won the annual Gemini contest
				and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two.
				Congratulations.
				Here are your tickets.

	He hands Korben the tickets.  Korben gets it.

						KORBEN
				You rigged the contest?

	Munro nods.

						MUNRO
				Major Iceborg will accompany you...
				as your wife...

	The idea of taking a trip with Iceborg makes him sick.

						KORBEN
					(sarcastic)
				You couldn't come up with something
				a little more discreet?

						MUNRO
				Old tricks are the best tricks eh?

						KORBEN
				I'm not going.

						MUNRO
				Why not?

						KORBEN
				One reason... I want to stay the only
				one left alive.

110A	INT.  KORBEN'S  HALL

	Leeloo and Cornelius search for Korben's apartment. Leeloo carries the
card Korben gave her.  Cornelius finds the apartment, and yanks the.
number off the door.  He waves Leeloo over as his hand goes to the bell.

110B	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT

	The doorbell rings.

						KORBEN
				...Scuse me.

	Korben goes to the door and looks out the peephole: the beautiful Leeloo.
	Korben panics, overcome with happiness.

						KORBEN
				...Shit!

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				What is it?

	Korben has two seconds to make up something to get rid of Munro.

						KORBEN
				It's my wife.

						MUNRO
				I thought you were divorced.

						KORBEN
				I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex..
				if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates
				you guys. It's what killed us in the first place.
				Please...

	He puts them in the fridge, shoving the jellyfish cake in Iceborg's
hands.

						KORBEN
				...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice!
				It'll only take a minute! Let me set up
				another meeting and I'll be back.

						MUNRO
				Three of us will never fit in there!

						KORBEN
					(pushing him)
				Oh, yes you will...

	Korben slams the fridge door.  The doorbell RINGS again.

						KORBEN
				...Coming!

	He whips through his place in ten seconds, gathers up things laying
about,
	shuts drawers, rolls up his laundry in the folding bed. He brushes his
hair back
	and opens the door with a big smile only to discover a gun stuck between
his
	eyes held by Cornelius.

						LEELOO
				Apipoulai!

						KORBEN
				I suppose that means "Hi" ?

						CORNELIUS
				I'm sorry to have to resort to such
				methods, but we heard about your
				good luck on he radio and we need
				the tickets to Fhloston.

						KORBEN
				Is that the usual way priests go on
				vacation?

						CORNELIUS
				We're not going on vacation..we're
				on a mission..

						KORBEN
				What kind of mission?

						CORNELIUS
					(sincere)
				We have to save the world.

						KORBEN
					(skeptical)
				Good luck..

						CORNELIUS
				Of course.

						KORBEN
				Father, I was in the Army for awhile
				and every time they told us we were
				on a mission to save the world the
				only thing that changed was I lost a
				lot of friends. So thanks for the offer..
				but no thanks.

	Cornelius is disappointed.  Leeloo looks crestfallen.

						KORBEN
				I'm sorry..

						VOICE
				This is a police control action..

	Everyone freezes as the whole building resounds with the electronic
voice.

111	INT.  LANDING  KORBEN'S  BUILDING

	A group of POLICEMEN bursts into the hallway.  One of the cops enters a
code on the police wall box.  A device descends from the ceiling, a
flashing light-siren,
	a VOICE fills the air.

						VOICE
				This is not an exercise.
				This is a police control.

	Cornelius starts to panic.  Korben takes charge.

						CORNELIUS
				Oh my god oh my god..

	Korben pushes a button sending the fridge to the next floor.  A shower
takes it's place.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo, hide in here and don't move!

	Leeloo hops in.  Korben tosses Cornelius on the bed.

						CORNELIUS
				What are you doing?

						KORBEN
				Trying to save your ass so you can
				save the world.

	..and hits a button on the wall.  The bed disappears into the wall.

	Korben grabs his tickets and slides them in his belt.

112	INT.  LANDING  KORBEN'S  BUILDING - DAY

	Meanwhile, the automatic police voice continues.

						VOICE
				...Spread your legs and place your
				hands in the yellow circles, please.

	A COP slaps a viewer device on Korben's door which makes part of it
transparent.

						COP 1
				Put your hands in the yellow circles,
				please.

	Korben takes his time hiding his face. The Cop looks at his sheet. He's
looking for
	a... KORBEN DALLAS. He has his picture, but it is Korben with long hair
and beard.

						COP 1
					(to COP 2)
				Sir? Are you a human?

						KORBEN
				No, I'm a meat popsicle.

						COP 3
					(at the other end of the hall)
				I found him!

	C.U. Korben's calling card is clumsily stuck to the door of the
neighbor's apartment.  COP 3 slaps the viewer on the nasty neighbor's door.
The neighbor is at his sink shaving instead of against the wall, COP 1
arrives with Korben's picture.

						COP 1
				Sir, this is a control.  Please put your
				hands in the yellow circles.

	The neighbor steps right up to the viewer, shaving cream on his face.  He
could pass for Korben.

						NEIGHBOR
				Fuck you!!

113	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT

	Korben still has his hands to the wall.

						KORBEN
				Wrong answer.

	SHOT O.S. EXPLOSION.  Scuffle.

114	INT.  HALL

	The riot police hustle down the hall dragging the neighbor behind them in
a canvas bag.  A cop is on the wall phone.

						COP
				OK, we got the guy under wraps.

115	INT.  ZORG'S  OFFICE

	Right Arm is on the phone, facing Zorg.

						COP (O.S.)
				It was not easy, but we bagged him!.
				Thanks for the tip!

						RIGHT ARM
					(smiling)
				Glad to help.

	He hangs up.

						RIGHT ARM
				They just arrested the guy for Uranium
				smuggling. Everything's going as planned.

	He shows him a plane ticket, and a passport with his picture and Korben's
name.

						RIGHT ARM
				All I have to do now is to go to the
				airport and take his place.  I should be
				in Fhloston in less than four hours.

	Zorg sits there quietly for a moment.

						ZORG
				Don't come back without the Stones.

116	INT.  KORBEN'S  APARTMENT

	Korben opens the shower door.  Leeloo is soaking wet, her teeth
chattering from the cold.

						KORBEN
				I'm really sorry.. there wasn't time.

His eyes fall on an old blanket.

						KORBEN
				Here let me wrap you up.

	Korben wraps her in an blanket and vigoroualy rubs her back.  Leeloo
warms gradually and snuggles closer to that warm comfortable shoulder.
Korben's rubbing slows, looking more like caresses.

						KORBEN
			..It's funny.  I've met you twice today  and
			you've ended up in my arms both times.

	Leeloo suddenly realizes that she has maybe gone a bit too far.
	She recovers, looking embarrassed too.

						LEELOO
					(nicely)
				Valo massa... Chacha hamas.

						KORBEN
				Uh..you're welcome.

	The intimacy makes him nervous.  He looks for a diversion.

						KORBEN
				Coffee!  That's what you need!
				A nice, hot cup of coffee!

	He pushes a button on the coffee machine.

						KORBEN
				With some honey!  You'll see, honey's
				great!...

	Korben rummages through the drawer.  Leeloo, innocent, doesn't seem to
quite understand everything that is going on.

						KORBEN
				A hot cup of coffee... with honey...

	He rummages through the cupboard, exceedingly nervous.  Leeloo smiles and
begins to look around.  She opens a drawer and comes upon..

						KORBEN
					(nervously)
				I've got this great honey somewhere.
				You know about honey?  There used to be
				these little animals who made it with antenna...

	..pictures of Major Korben Dallas War Hero.

						KORBEN
				..and these other animals who ate it..
				one were bees the other were bears..

	She looks back to the man fumbling for honey.

						KORBEN
				I forget which ate it and which made it
				but..

	And she smiles.

						KORBEN
				Here it is!

	Korben holds up the jar of honey.

						KORBEN
				Taste this...

	Leeloo innocently sticks his finger in the jar then puts it in her mouth.

						KORBEN
				It... melts in your mouth, doesn't it?

	She savors the honey, slowly; sensually.  Her lips shine with honey.  Her
eyes narrow with pleasure.  Korben is hypnotized by her lips, like a moth
attracted to a flame.  He begins to lose control, which makes him nervous.

	An indistinct sound comes from the wall.  But Korben is so entranced with
the sight of Leeloo licking her honied fingers, he doesn't hear it until
it becomes quite a racket.

						KORBEN
				You hear that?

						LEELOO
					(licking)
				Cornelius..

						KORBEN
				Oh god!

	Korben pushes the button on the wall.  The bed pops out, fully made, with
Cornelius tucked in it, struggling to get out.

						KORBEN
				I'm really sorry.. let me help you..

Korben begins to pull at the covers when..

						LEELOO
				Achta ge lumitai de matala..

	Korben turns..

						KORBEN
				What?

	He turns to Leeloo struggling out of her wet clothes. His breath is taken
away by the sight of her perfect body.

	Cornelius whacks him heavily on the head with a lamp.  Korben drops to
the floor.

						LEELOO
					(displeased)
				Vano da, mechteba?!
				Soun domo kala chon hammas!

						CORNELIUS
				No, I'm not proud of myself...
				But we don't have the luxury of choice.

117	INT.  ENTRANCE  KORBEN'S  BUILDING - DAY

	The POLICE exit the elevator and head for the front door.  A cop suddenly
takes a hit from a silencer, then a second. Others are bashed on the head
by MANGALORE warriors.  One of them picks up the prisoner bag, takes it
into a small shed.

118	INT.  SHED

	Aknot, the Mangalore leader, is seriously wounded and can't walk.

						AKANIT
				Korben Dallas!  We got him.

						AKNOT
				Perfect... Take command, Akanit.
				Go to Fhloston and get the Stones...
				If Zorg really wants them... He'll have
				to negotiate.  Revenge is at hand.

119	INT.  KORBEN'S APARTMENT  KORBEN'S  BUILDING - DAY

	Korben gets unsteadily to his feet, some blood drips down his face. He
daubs at it.

						KORBEN
				Jesus!... Some priest!

	The phone rings, he manages to answer.

						KORBEN
				Yeah?

						MOTHER (V.O)
				Have you pulled yourself together?

						KORBEN
				...Not yet.

	He hangs up.

	Korben opens the fridge door.  The three officers are frozen solid.
Korben grabs some ice, presses it to his forehead.

						KORBEN
				I'll take the mission.

	He closes the door.

120	INT. AIRPORT  HALL - DAY

	Cornelius and Leeloo (still damp) arrive at the Manhattan Intergalactic
Airport.
	A huge hall three quarters filled with trash piled up to the ceiling.

	There are groups of extra-terrestrials on strike standing in trash
holding picket signs.  A SECURITY GUARD picks up a phone off the wall.

						SECURITY GUARD
				Illegal gathering in Zone 4.

	A hand taps Leeloo from behind.  She whips around catching David in the
face.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo, be careful.

	He turns to David who in holding his bloody nose.

						CORNELIUS
				Did you get them?

	David hands Cornelius two passports.

						CORNELIUS
				Excellent... Leeloo Dallas.

	He hands it to her.  The name makes her smile.

						CORNELIUS
				And Korben David Dallas.

	She frowns.

						LEELOO
				Akta dedero ansila do mektet.

						CORNELIUS
				I can't pretend to be your husband...
				David's in great shape.

	She looks at David holding his bloody nose.

						CORNELIUS
				He'll protect you. Go on... See the Diva...
				get the Stones... See you at the temple...
				God be with you.

	ANGLE ON: Korben comes rushing into the airport. Walking quickly, he
scopes the hall looking for Leeloo. A POLICE PATROL bearing down on the
STRIKERS jostles him. The cops open fire.  The strikers dive into the garbage
and disappear.

121	INT.  BOARDING  GATE

	David nervously puts tickets and IDs on the check-in counter.
	Leeloo tosses her suitcase on the conveyor belt.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
				Congratulations on winning the contest.

	David gives her a bleak smile.  Leeloo rolls her eyes.

	Back a ways, Korben has spotted Leeloo and... David.  He heads right for
them.  Leeloo's seen him. She is both delighted and panicked.  David's
seen nothing.  Korben presses one of his fingers like a gun to David's back.

						KORBEN
					(friendly)
				Hey! I really thought I was going to
				miss my flight!
					(to David)
				Thanks, kid! You put the luggage on
				the conveyor belt?

						DAVID
					(freaking)
				Uh... yeah.

						KORBEN
					(smiling)
				Great! Now beat it!

	Paralyzed, David leaves.  Korben turns to the attendant.

						KORBEN
				Excuse me.  I was so afraid I'd miss the
				flight that I sent the kid here to pick up
				my boarding card.

	He looks at David's fake ID.

						KORBEN
				...My cousin David...

	Leeloo is unable to hold back a smile.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(looking at Leeloo's ID)
				Your wife?

	Korben grabs the ID and reads it.

						KORBEN
				Uh, yes... Newlyweds.
					(aside)
				You know how it is... Love at first sight.
				You meet, something goes tilt,. you get
				married, you hardly know each other.
				Right, darling?

	Leeloo rips her boarding card out of the attendant's hand.

						LEELOO
					(sharply)
				Dinoine chagantakat!

						KORBEN
				Took the words right out of my mouth.
				Go on... I'll be right with you.
					(to Check-in Attendant)
				It's our honeymoon. We're going to use
				the trip to get to know each other better.

	He winks at the stewardess.

	ANGLE ON:

	The neighbor and a tawdry young girl cross the airport.  The couple in
almost knocked over by a police patrol holding a 500 pound PIG on a
stainless steel leash. The couple panics a moment, the realize the patrol
isn't for them. The pig heads for the pile where the strikers disappeared.

						COP
					(to pig)

				Come on, snyffer, go root!

	The pig piles into the garbage.  The Cop cuts it some slack.
	Cornelius sits at a bar.

						CORNELIUS
					(to the bartender)
				I feel so guilty sending her to do the dirty
				work. I know she was made to be strong
				but she's also so fragile... So human.
				You know what I mean?

	The bartender, a robot, nods his head as he pours Cornelius a drink.

	ANGLE ON:

	The nasty neighbor and his wife hand their tickets to the check-in
attendant.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(surprised)
				Dallas... Korben...

						NEIGHBOR
					(in a different voice)
				Yes, that's me.

	The check-in attendant triggers a transparent blue light that shines on
their faces, revealing two other faces:

	Mangalores.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(smiling)
				Just a minute, please.

	She hits a silent alarm, but the Mangalores feel something is wrong.

						NEIGHBOR
				We'll be right back ... we're gonna
				check out the duty free...

	They spin around and hurry away.

	ANGLE ON:

	Cornelius at the bar, half in the bag.

						ROBOT
				The same?

						CORNELIUS
				Yeah...

						DAVID (V.O.)
				Make that two...

	Cornelius turns to David.

						CORNELIUS
				Where's Leeloo?

						DAVID
				On the plane... with Mr. Dallas...
				the real one.

						CORNELIUS
				It's all my fault.  I'm the servant...
				It's my mission! Here!

	He hands David the Temple Key from around his neck.

						CORNELIUS
				Here's the key to the Temple..
				Prepare for our arrival!

	Cornelius tosses David's drink into his own, downs it all in one shot,
and takes off, passing the Mangalore couple headed for the exit.  They are
very nervous.
	A police patrol is coming.  This time, it seems to be for them.

						NEIGHBOR
					(to the tawdry girl)
				Tell Aknot plan A flopped.
				Tell him to go to plan B.

	The tawdry girl nods and peels off. The neighbor takes out a gun and
blasts away at the cops.  The cops fire back. A firefight rages in the
hall. The tawdry girl dives into a pile of garbage and disappears.

						COP
					(into walkie-talkie)
				...Send in a back-up unit, Zone 7!

	ANGLE ON:

	On one side of the hall, a trap door opens. Three pigs come running out,
grabbed by their police handler.

	Cornelius waits until everyone has left, gets down on all fours and
crawls through the trapdoor reserved for the pigs.

122	INT.  FIRST  CLASS  LOUNGE

	Leeloo stands at the buffet in the first class lounge eating everything
in sight.

123	INT.  HALL

	Korben is led down the hall by a STEWARDESS.

						STEWARDESS
				You are so lucky... Loc Rhod is the
				coolest DJ in the universe.

						KORBEN
				Listen... I don't want to be interviewed.
				I'd prefer to remain anonymous.

	The stewardess stops in the corridor.

						STEWARDESS
				Forget anonymous.  You'll be doing Loc
				Rhod's live show every day from 5 to 7!

						KORBEN
					(expression changes)
				You gotta be kidding!

	The stewardess smiles and shakes her head.  The door next to him suddenly
swings open and smashes him in the face.

	In walks LOC RHOD amidst a tornado of music and security guards.  He is
young, good-looking, eccentric, charming as an elf or sly as a fox.  A
bundle of energy.  He is the 24th century's most popular DJ.

						LOC RHOD
					(speedy, in rhythm)
				Korben Dallas! Here he is The most hated
				man in the universe. The one and only winner
				of the Gemini Croquette contest! Ladies, start
				melting 'cause the boy's hot! Hot! Hot! The boy
				is perfect..
					(he feels his muscles)
				...The right size, right build, right hair.  Right on!
				Say something-to those 50 billion pair of ears out
				there D-man!

	An ASSISTANT hands a totally lost Korben a mike.

						KORBEN
					(hesitant)
				...Hi.

						LOC RHOD
				Does it get any better or what!

	Loc Rhod grabs Korben's arm and leads him down the hallway, as fast as
the music.

						LOC RHOD
				...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on
				fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know
				everything there is to know about the D-man.
				His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of
				intimates.  And from what I'm looking at
				intimate is the stud muffin's middle name.
				So tell me my main man... you nervous in the
				service?

						KORBEN
				Uh... not really.

	Loc Rhod lets go of Korben's arm and grabs the Stewardess.

						LOC RHOD
				Freeze those knees, my chickadees, 'cause
				Korben is on the case with a major face...

	Loc Rhod rubs up against the stewardess.

						LOC RHOD
				...Start drooling, ladies! My man here is a
				sharp-tongued Sire who's gonna stroke your
				every desire.

	They come to an intersection.  The airline company has prepared drinks
for them.  Loc Rhod pushes on, grabs a glass of champagne, scribbles his
autograph.

						LOC RHOD
				Yesterday's unknown will be tomorrow's Prince
				of Fhloston Paradise, the hotel of a thousand and
				one follies, home of luxury and beauty.  A magic
				fountain flowing with non-stop wine, women and
				Bootchie Koochie Koo...

	He tosses away his champagne glass.

						LOC RHOD
				Beware out there puppy dogs my man is on
				the prowl. Owwww!

	Howling, Loc Rhod grabs another stewardess by the arm.

						LOC RHOD
				...And start licking your stamps little girls,
				this guy's gonna have you writing home to
				Momma! Tomorrow from 5 to 7, I'll be your
				voice, your tongue and I'll be hot on the tail
				of the sexiest man of the year... D-man...
				Your man... My man.

	The stewardess shivers.  A BEEP is heard.

						VOCODER (O.S.)
				End of transmission.

	The MUSIC suddenly stops.  Several assistants come and compliment Loc
Rhod who sighs, lights up a cigarette, and drops his pretense.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben sweetheart do me a favor I know this
				is probably the biggest thing that ever happened
				to you in your inconsequential life. But I've got
				a show to do here and it's got to pop. So tomorrow,
				when we're on air, give me a hand... Try to make
				believe you have more than a one word vocabulary.
				OK pal?

	That does it.  Korben grabs him by the collar and drags him into a
corner.
	Loc Rhod's feet don't touch the ground.

						KORBEN
					(pissed)
				I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio.
				So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a
				hand, that clear pal?

						LOC RHOD
					(petrified)
				Crystal.

124	INT.  AIRPORT

	The Check-in attendant has two more tickets in her hand.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(alter a moment, reading)
				...Mr. Dallas... Korben Dallas?

	Zorg's Right Arm gives her a big smile.

						RIGHT ARM
				That's right.

	The attendant scans the ID with a yellow beam, it checks out, and the
blue light reveals no other face but his.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
				The problem is I only have one Korben Dallas on
				my list... and he's already checked in.

	Right Arm's smile shatters.

						RIGHT ARM
				That's impossible!  He's in j... I mean, there
				must be some mistake. I have my ticket!
				I'm the real Korben Dallas!

	A shrill BELL rings out.

						CHECK-IN ATTENDANT
					(smiling)
				I'm sorry, sir, boarding is finished.

	The attendant hits a button.  A thick window slowly slides up between
them.
	Right Arm totally loses it.

						RIGHT ARM
				I want to see your boss!  Get rid of this
				fucking window! Somebody's made a
				mistake, goddamnit!

	He pounds on the counter with both fists. A steel curtain comes down.
Red sighting beams target spots on his body, ten gun barrels protrude from
the wall, all aimed at him.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				This is not an exercise.  This is a police
				control.
				Put your hands in the nearest yellow circles...

						RIGHT ARM
					(slowing down)
				Sorry, my fault... Just a little overexcited...
				that's all... I'm calm now.

125	INT.  SHUTTLE - DAY

	Korben makes his way in the plane  looking for his seat. No more seats in
modern planes, just individual travel boxes lined up like microwaves.  He
passes STEWARD holding his bloodied nose. He has found what he is looking
for. He enters to.... Leeloo quietly stretched out in front of a computer
screen.  Korben slips in beside her.  Leeloo in concentrating on the words
that scroll rapidly  past her on the screen.  He doesn't understand what she
is doing.

						LEELOO
				Apipoulai!

						KORBEN
				Not hard to find you...just follow the
				Chaos...

	Leeloo smiles, as if complimented.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo, listen to me... these tickets...
				they're not mine... I mean they are, but
				not for vacation like everyone thinks...
				I'm on an operation... and if I didn't come
				get you, you'd be in a shitload of trouble...
				I'd love to be on vacation with you...
				but now.... now I've got to work...
				And Leeloo... I would love to work in peace.

	Leeloo types in "LOVE" on the keyboard.

						LEELOO
				Love...

						KORBEN
				Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word
				here, PEACE is!

	Leeloo types in this new word.

						LEELOO
					(rather pleased)
				Peace... and love...

	She brings up a picture of a 60's style Hippie flashing a peace sign.
Korben sighs and switches off the screen.

						KORBEN
				Sometimes you can't learn everything
				from a screen..sometimes it's better to
				ask someone who has experience..

						LEELOO
					(quite happy)
				What is... Make Love?

	Korben just stares at her for a few minutes.

						KORBEN
				Know what? On that subject maybe you'd
				be better off asking the screen.

	He turns the computer back on.

	ANGLE ON:

	A STEWARDESS walks up the aisle of the shuttle pushing the red buttons on
top of each individual box.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				...to make your flight as short and agreeable
				as possible, our flight attendants are switching
				on the timing sleeper which will regulate your
				sleep during the trip...

	ANGLE ON:

						LEELOO
					(switching off the screen)
				OK! Finished!

						KORBEN
				Finished what?

						LEELOO
				Learning language.

						KORBEN
				Which one?

						LEELOO
				All 900.

	Korben doesn't know if he should laugh or not.

						KORBEN
				You learned 900 languages in five
				minutes?!

						LEELOO
					(pleased)
				Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your
				language, you have to learn mine!

						KORBEN
				I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how
				to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.

						LEELOO
				Apipoussan!

						KORBEN
				Apipoussan?

						LEELOO
				Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?

						KORBEN
					(fumbling)
				Uh...

						LEELOO
				...Hoppi-hoppa.

	Korben literally melts.

						KORBEN
					(to himself)
				Help...

	Luckily, a stewardess smiles at him through the box window.

						STEWARDESS
				Sweet dreams, Mr. Dallas!

	The stewardess sets the timing sleeper.  Korben and Leeloo immediately
fall asleep.

	A STEWARDESS at the other end of the shuttle has a problem.

						STEWARDESS 2
				Mr. Loc Rhod you have to assume
				your individual position.

						LOC RHOD
					(hugging her)
				I don't want an individual position,
				I want all positions!

						STEWARDESS 2
					(resisting somewhat)
				We're going to take off soon, Mr. Rhod!

						LOC RHOD
				Now you're talking!

126	INT.  COCKPIT  FHLOSTON  SPACE  SHUTTLE

	Three CREW MEMBERS prepare for liftoff.

						COPILOT
					(on the radio)
				Molecular axis authorization. Vector 130.
				Destination Fhloston.

	Stewardess 1 enters the cockpit.

						STEWARDESS 1
				Zone 1. 217 locked. The sleep regulator is OK.

						PILOT
					(checking her out)
				Thanks, Miss.

	The Stewardess leaves with a smile.  A red light flashes on the vast
control panel.

						MECHANIC
				Tell the ground crew we've got parasites
				in the landing gear.

127	INT.  AIRPORT  LANDING  STRIP - DAY

	A GROUND CREW MEMBER goes over to the truck parked under one of the
plane's wings and bangs on the side of it with a shout.

						GROUND CREW MEMBER
				Disinfecting!

	Two DISINFECTORS in hermetically sealed suits exit the truck.  They go
over to the front landing gear and send up a whooshing beam.  The flame
burns everything it touches.  A pack of repugnant creatures falls squealing
from the landing gear.  A small trapdoor is opened under the shuttle and a
huge slightly phosphorescent tube falls out.

128	INT.  AIRPORT  HALL / ZORG'S  OFFICE

	Zorg's Right Arm is in a phone booth in the middle of the hall.

						RIGHT ARM
				Yeah, it's me... Put Zorg on.

	He is already sweating.

						ZORG
					(cold)
				I'm listening.

						RIGHT ARM
				The real Korben Dallas is on the plane!
				He took my place.

						ZORG
				This is a joke, right?

129	INT.  SHUTTLE

	Loc Rhod is wrapped around a stewardess like a snake.

						LOC RHOD
				No!! I swear to God! I've never been this
				sincere with a human before!

130 EXT.  LANDING  STRIP

	TWO GROUND CREW MEMBERS stick an enormous, highly phosphorescant tube
	into the opening.

						GROUND CREW MEMBER
				You're fueled and ready to go.
				Have a nice flight.

131	INT.  SHUTTLE

						PILOT
					(to copilot)
				Everything ready for liftoff?

132	INT.  CABIN

						STEWARDESS

				No, no... I'm not ready! I'd like to talk first...

133	INT.  ZORG'S  OFFICE / AIRPORT  HALL

						ZORG
				I cannot hear you. We have a bad
				connection here.  What's your number?

	Right Arm reads off the phone number.

						RIGHT ARM
				278-500-645-321

						ZORG
				I'll call you back.

134  EXT.  LANDING  STRIP

	The runway is now empty. A man slips out of the shadows. It's Cornelius.
He scurries over to the front landing gear. He pauses for an instant, the
climbs up the wheel well and disappears inside the shuttle.

135	INT.  SHUTTLE

	The pilots are going through the pre-flight check list.

						COPILOT
				Anti static pressure?

						MECHANIC
				Primed.

	The mechanic presses a series of buttons.

136	INT.  CABIN

	Loc Rhod undoes a series of buttons on the stewardess' blouse, behind a
curtain. He whispers a poem.  Impossible to resist him. Outside the
curtain the stewardess' legs rise slowly.

137	EXT.  LANDING  STRIP

	On the ground, protective fire curtains rise slowly to contain the engine
exhaust on liftoff.

138	INT.  ZORG'S  OFFICE

	A keyboard slowly appears in front of Zorg.

						ZORG
					(typing the number)
				278... 500...

139	SERIES OF QUICK CUTS:

	The pilot gradually turns the engines up.

						COPILOT
				10 seconds...

						PILOT
				Power increase.

	- The stewardess undergoes a power surge from Loc Rhod that's about to
lift her of.

	- Zorg finishes gleefully typing in the number.

						ZORG
				3... 2... 1...

	- The engines at full blast.

	- The stewardess in close to screaming.

						PILOT
				Liftoff.

	- The copilot pushes a button.

	- So does Zorg.

	- The engines release their full power.

	- The stewardess screams in ecstasy.

	- In the hall, Right Arm literally explodes along with the phone and
everything else   within 60 feet.

140	INT.  FHLOSTON  SPACE  SHUTTLE

	The stewardess' legs slowly descend and disappear behind the curtain.

141	INT.  COCKPIT

	In the cockpit, the atmosphere loosens up.

						COPILOT
					(relaxing)
				Landing gear secure.  Let's light one up.

142	INT.  CABIN

	Korben and Leeloo sleep soundly in their box.  Leeloo has a smile on her
face and her hand in Korben's.

143	EXT.  OUTERSPACE - NIGHT

	The spaceship rockets past us, then suddenly vanishes with amazing speed.
Space is now empty and calm.  Billions of stars glow in perfect silence.


144	EXT.  SPACE

	The nefarious planet in still there, immobile, even larger now, writhing
like a serpent.  Then, suddenly, for no apparent reason, all activity stops
and it becomes gray and cold.

145	INT.  SPACESHIP

	In the Admiral's starship, scientists watch the measuring device.  One of
the devices suddenly starts working.

						TECHNICIAN
				All right! We're finally getting something!

146	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The Head Scientist stands facing the President, who is looking more tired
than ever.

						HEAD SCIENTIST
				The thing is sending out radio wavelengths!

						PRESIDENT
				What the hell does it want with radio waves?

						HEAD SCIENTIST
				...Probably wants to make a call!

	The President and his Generals look at him in astonishment.

147	INT.  ZORG'S OFFICE

	Picasso purrs contentedly on Zorg's lap.  The phone rings.

						SECRETARY (O.S.)
				Mr. Shadow on the line.

	Zorg shoots to his feet.  Picasso tumbles to the floor.  Zorg picks up
the phone, both excited and uneasy. He stands there, almost coming to
attention.

						ZORG
				Yes... Zorg here.

	The voice is feeble.  It comes from the far reaches of time, from the
bowels of the universe.

						SHADOW
				Am I disturbing you?

						ZORG
				No... not at all.  Where are you?

	SHADOW'S breathing is awesome.

						SHADOW
				...Not far, now.

						ZORG
				Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen
				and see you at last!

	Zorg brings up a huge screen and pushes a few buttons.

	In the middle of an electronic snowstorm, a blackish, vaguely human,
quiverinq form appears. Two eyes, like lava, give an idea where the head is.
Zorg feels sick.

						SHADOW
				Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?

						ZORG
				Got it.

						SHADOW
				How's our deal coming along?

						ZORG
					(ill at ease)
				Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you
				asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy.
				My costs have tripled.

	Shadow pauses an instant.  A black slimy liquid starts to ooze from the
top of the screen.  Zorg is feeling worse all the time.

						SHADOW
				Money is of no importance...
				I want the Stones!

	The black liquid oozes all over the screen which starts to melt.  Zorg
sweats profusely,  his legs tremble.

						ZORG
				The Stones will be here. I'll see to it
				personally!

						SHADOW
				...I can't wait to be among you.

	Zorg sighs and sits down totally freaked.

148	EXT. ORBIT  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	The space shuttle fills the screen.  It banks left and begins its descent
toward Fhloston, the turquoise planet.  Crystal blue water, perfect white sand
beaches.  A true paradise.

149	INT.  SPACE SHUTTLE

	The stewardess picks up a microphone to make an announcement.

						STEWARDESS
				Ladies and gentlemen, we have begun our
				descent toward Fhloston Paradise...

	Stewardesses walk down the aisles waking the passengers one by one. They
press a button on the door of each box.

	In the corner, Loc Rhod and the stewardess awake with a start and
straighten their clothes quickly.  The stewardess is embarrassed.

						STEWARDESS
					(timidly)
				I wanted to tell you that...

	Loc Rhod puts on his sunglasses and presses a finger to her lips.  He
disappears behind the curtain leaving the sighing stewardess on her own.

150	EXT.  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	The spaceship descends through some clouds and glides over a vast
turquoise sea.  Fhloston Paradise looms into view.  An enormous oceanliner
floating a dozen yards above the water.  On closer inspection it is more
modern than a traditional oceanliner.  The shuttle draws near, looking
ridiculously small next to the monster.  Like a sardine next to a whale.

151	INT.  COCKPIT

	A blinking light goes on.

						PILOT
				Shit! Parasites in Zone 1. Take a look.

	The 1st Mate heads off.

152	INT.  CABIN

	A stewardess opens Korben's box door.  He is still heavy with sleep. He
looks over at Leeloo.  She's not there.

153	EXT.  FHLOSTON

	The tiny space shuttle clings to the huge oceanliner.

154	INT.  COCKPIT

	The Pilot maneuvers the ship into it's docking area.

						PILOT
				Docking activated.
				You can let the passengers out.

155	INT.  REAR  OF  COCKPIT

	The 1st mate pries open the door to an overhead panel.  Cornelius falls
out, hanging in a jumble of wires.

156.	INT.  ENTRANCE  HALL  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY

	The enormous door opens and the passengers exit.  Leeloo is among them.
She appears quite impressed by the beauty and luxury of the 19th century
decoration.

157	INT.  CABIN

	Korben attempts to make his way up the shuttle's aisle.

						KORBEN
					(jostling everybody)
				Pardon me.  Excuse me. I'm trying to
				reach my wife.. Sorry!

158	INT.  ENTRANCE  HALL

	A dozen policemen wait patiently at the end of the hall.  Leeloo stops
and presses against the wall.  She spots Korben leaving the shuttle.  A
gorgeous HOSTESS comes up to him, drapes a lei around his neck and plants a
kiss on his lips in welcome.

						HOSTESS
					(smiling)
				Welcome to Paradise.

	Korben's face is covered in lipstick.  Leeloo sees he did nothing to stop
the girl and she doesn't like it.

	A HEFTY MAN wearing a sarong drapes some flowers around her neck.  Then,
	obviously relishing it, he leans down to kiss her.  Leeloo bashes him on
the forehead.  The hefty man straightens up.  He's still smiling, but his
nose is bleeding. He falls slowly to the floor.

	Korben pushes forward trying to spot Leeloo.  He also tries to wipe the
lipstick off.  Leeloo tries to escape through a door marked PERSONNEL ONLY,
but it's locked.  A HOST looks at her with a grin.

						HOST
					(playful)
				If you don't have the code you can't
				open it!

	Leeloo smiles and punches in an old code and twists the doorknob.  The
door opens with the sound of a braking lock.  Leeloo smiles sweetly and enters
as if nothing were amiss.

	A shriek of joy fills the room.  Korben turns around.  The HOSTESSES
cluster around Loc Rhod as he comes out of the plane.  Loc Rhod spots Korben
and latches onto his arm.  It's not going to be easy to remain discrete.

						LOC RHOD
					(relieved)
				My main man! Please don't leave me here
				alone. My head's killing me and my adoring
				fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta
				here!

						KORBEN
				I'll take you to the bar, after that,
				you're on your own.

						LOC RHOD
					(hanging on to Korben)
				Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right,
				man. Tell me all about yourself, your
				roots, your personal life, your childhood
				dreams...

						KORBEN
				I don't think this is a good time...

						LOC RHOD
				...You got brothers and sisters? What
				about your dad? Tell me about your
				dad! What was he like? Physically?
				Big, I suppose?

						KORBEN
					(evasive)
				Yeah, very big, a giant.

						LOC RHOD
				I didn't have a dad... never saw him...
				never even heard him. 50 billion people
				listen to me every day... and he doesn't
				hear me...

159	INT.  SMALL  ROOM  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY

	Leeloo is in a small room, ear at the door, listening. Everything seems
normal. She turns and discovers the room for what it is:	a rest room
for... three cops who look up from their books and stare blankly at her.
Leeloo doesn't know what to do. So she smiles.

	The door opens.  The HOSTESS turns on the light and enters.  Korben
follows her, gaping at all the luxury.

	The BAGGAGE BOY enters bringing Leeloo's two suitcases.

	Korben grabs the notice announcing Diva Plavalaguna's concert at 5:30 in
that evening.  Dress: Formal attire.

						KORBEN
				For the concert it says formal attire...
				I didn't bring...

	The hostess pulls back the closet door.  Twenty tuxedos in a row.

						HOSTESS
					(looking him over)
				Here's some champagne. I'll drop by after
				the concert to open it.

	She gives him a blinding smile and closes the door.

	Korben pushes a button.  The curtains open to reveal a most spectacular
view of the turquoise planet.  Stars shoot out into infinity.
Breathtaking.  Korben stands gaping.  The phone rings, snapping him out of
his reverie.

						KORBEN
				Hello?

						MOTHER (O.S.)
				You little sleaze bag!

						KORBEN
				...Ma???

						MOTHER (O.S.)
				Don't you ever ask me for another thing
				in my life again, you've killed your

	Korben drops into an armchair and sighs. His eyes go to the ceiling.

	The Chief of Police has Cornelius in front of him, handcuffed.

				The Diva's ship is coming in.

						CHIEF OF POLICE
				I want maximum security.

						FOG
				Yes. Sir!

						CHIEF OF POLICE
					(to Cornelius)
				OK, let's hear it.

						CORNELIUS
				Where was I?

						CHIEF OF POLICE
					(bored)
				...You open the door. There's a cabby with
				a girl in his arms.

	FOG opens the door.  Two COPS come hobbling in all bloody and bandaged.
They hold up a THIRD COP.

						CHIEF OF POLICE
				What happened?
				A bomb go off in your face?

						BEAT-UP COP
				Yeah... A 5 foot 7 inch bomb...
				with green eyes.

	Cornelius perks up.

						CORNELIUS
				And the smile of an angel?

	They all turn to look at him.

						CORNELIUS
					(to Chief)
				May I speak to you alone.

167	INT.  CORRIDOR  FHLOSTON PARADISE - DAY

	Leeloo watches the Diva's arrival.  A door opens and two POLICEMAN clear
the way for DIVA PLAVALAGUNA, her MANAGER, her BODYGUARDS and a gaggle of
	PORTERS carrying trunks.

	Not wanting to draw attention to herself, Leeloo feigns interest in a
painting that is obviously upside down. A white chiffon veil covers the face
of the Diva, she stops in front of Leeloo.  The Diva reaches out and
strokes Leeloo's face, without touching her. The Diva removes her hand
making a sound of crackling electricity, then passes on.  Leeloo is groggy.
The Diva's ASSISTANT comes up to her.

						DIVA'S ASSISTANT
				Please forgive this little incident. She wants
				you to know that she senses great powers in
				you... in the service of a noble cause... She
				will give you what you have come to get, but
				she wants to sing first...
				One last time...

	The Diva's assistant turns the painting right side up.

						DIVA'S ASSISTANT
					(nodding)
				Miss.

	Leeloo looks at the painting, seems to understand it better.

168	EXT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	Policemen stand at attention in front of the Diva's suite.

						FOG
				Hello, I'm head of security.
				Everything is in order. You can...

	The Diva enters her suite without letting him finish.

						FOG
				...make yourselves at home safely.
				If you need anything...give it a knock!

169	INT.  POLICE  OFFICE  HALLWAY - NIGHT

	A door opens near the police officer's main entrance. Cornelius looks
both ways. Then crosses the hall, dragging the Chief of Police by the feet.

170	INT.  KORBEN'S  STATEROOM

	Korben finishes putting on his tux, still on the phone.

						KORBEN
				Listen, Ma! I've only got a few days
				vacation and I'll be damned if I'm
				gonna spend them on the phone.

	The door RINGS.

						KORBEN
				...Hang on, it's the door. No!
				I told you I didn't bring anybody!
				I'm all alone... as usual!

	Korben opens the door.  It's not the champagne.  Even better. It's
Leeloo.

						KORBEN
					(to his mother)
				...I'll call you back.

	Leeloo heads right for her suitcase and starts to undress.  Korben has to
turn away once more.

						KORBEN
				Here we go again...

						LEELOO
					(by rote)
				You know women normally change five
				times more than men.

						KORBEN
				You get that off the screen?

						LEELOO
				Yes... you know there's a lot of
				differences between men women.

						KORBEN
				You noticed..

						LEELOO
				OK, you can turn around!

	Korben turns around.  Leeloo has put on a very simple dress which is sexy
to the max.  He is smitten.  So much so that Leeloo wonders if something
isn't quite right.

						KORBEN
				Where you going?

						LEELOO
				I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's
				the matter?... Do I look bad?

						KORBEN
				No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite,
				you're... you're beautiful!

	Leeloo smiles at him, his compliment pleases her.  She turns, revealing
her unzippered back.  Korben cannot help but stare at her bare flesh.  Her
perfect bottom.

						LEELOO
				Do you know how this works?

	Korben's blood boils.  She wriggles, pressing her hands together close to
the zipper.

						KORBEN
				I have an idea.

	But instead of pulling on the zipper he slips a bracelet on her wrist.  A
flourescent beam bursts out of the bracelet and forms a vertical bar going
from the floor to the ceiling.
	Stunned, Leeloo is held captive.

						KORBEN
				I told you I need to work in peace.
				Remember? I need to concentrate.

						LEELOO
				And you can't concentrate with me
				around?.

						KORBEN
				It's difficult.

	She tries to breakout.

						KORBEN
				Army issue. I'm sorry.

	Leeloo tries desperately to get out of the handcuffs. Impossible.

	Korben sets the radio down in front of her and turns it on.
	Leeloo looks like she'd like to break his head.

						LEELOO
					(seething)
				You're nothing but a... a...

						KORBEN
				The words you're looking for weren't
				in the dictionary you studied. I won't
				be long.

	The door flies open.  Loc Rhod barges in.

						LOC RHOD
				Hey Stud we gotta...

	Then he sees the scene, Leeloo cuffed, in a low cut dress.  His mind goes
to the obvious.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben my man what's happening here?
				Who's the chick? What's the gig?
				We free forming here? Getting funky
				with the monkey? Can I get in on this?

	Korben grabs him by the collar..

						KORBEN
				No..to all of the above.

	And yanks Loc Rhod out of the room.  Leaving Leeloo looking extremely
unhappy.

	Loc Rhod and Korben enter what turns out to be a replica of the Garnier
Opera in Paris.  A hostess escorts them to their seats.

						LOC RHOD
					(broadcasting)
				We have just walked into what is probably
				the most beautiful concert hall in the universe.
				Totally awesome! Magnificent paintings on the
				ceiling. I don't know who painted them, but he
				must have busted his balls! I see a row of former
				ministers, more sinister than minister! A few generals
				practicing how to sleep. And there's Baby Ray, star
				of stage and screen, drowning in a sea of nymphets.
				He's not gonna get much out of this concert, he's
				stone-deaf!

	ANGLE ON:

	Baby Ray bending his ear to a girl asking for an autograph.

						BABY RAY
				...to who?

						LOC RHOD
					(moving down the aisle)
				...And over there is Roy Von Bacon, the king
				of laserball and the best paid player in the League.
					(shakes hands as he goes by)
				...And over there is the Emperor Kodar Japhet
				whose daughter Aachen is still at the bar.
				"I love to sing, too, but in the shower", she
				recently confessed to me. She will no doubt
				prove to be as generous tonight as she always is.

	A waiter gives them two glasses of champagne.  Track with the WAITER an
he leaves the hall with his empty tray.  He enters a small room reserved for
staff.

177	INT.  STAFF  ROOM  FHLOSTON  PARADISE - NIGHT

	The waiter joins some other WAITERS.  They are well armed.  He opens a
cupboard and pulls out a humongous weapon. Suddenly their faces burn off
revealing AKANIT, the young leader of the Mangalores, and his troops.

						AKANIT
				It's showtime!

178	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	The lights dim slowly in the concert hall.

179	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	President Lindbergh and his staff, including Munro, sit at the desk.
Speakers appear.

180	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	Leeloo, still a prisoner, listens to the concert.

181	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Korben is tense.  The curtain rises.  The Diva, in a stunning gown,
stands in the center of the stage, head bowed.  Behind her, a star filled
window.  The MUSIC begins.  The Diva looks up, a rare beauty, but an alien.
And then she begins to sing.  Her voice is divine, unmatched.  Korben is
swept up in the TEARS.

182	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	Leeloo has tears in her eyes

183	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	The manager couldn't care less about the concert.  His main problem is
the bottle of scotch he can't seem to open.  The doorbell RINGS.

						MANAGER
					(ugly mood)
				Yeah!?

						VOICE (O.S.)
				Flowers for the Diva.

						MANAGER
				She's allergic to flowers!!!

						VOICE (O.S.)
				There's champagne as well...

	The manager takes one look at the stubborn bottle and opens the door. And
finds himself staring down the barrel of a gun. A dozen Mangalores rush
in. One of them, with a human face, closes the door and waits out in the hall.

	ANGLE ON:

	Cornelius watching from around the corner.

						CORNELIUS
				...My God!

184	INT.  CONTROL  ROOM  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

						CAPTAIN
				Commander, I have a ship with a main
				malfunction. He requests permission to

						COMMANDER
				Did you check out his registration number?

				Everything's in order.

						COMMANDER
				Put him in the docking garage and inform
				the police.

185	INT.  COCKPIT  ZFX200 - NIGHT

						CAPTAIN (V.O.)
				Permission granted. Dock 575.  You have
				an hour. Will that be enough time'?

	Zorg sits at the controls.

						ZORG
					(cold)
				More than enough.

186	EXT.  FHLOSTON  PARADISE - NIGHT

	The ZFX approaches Fhloston.

187	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	The ship comes close enough for Leeloo to see it out the window.

	FLASHBACK:

	The same ships with Mangalores at the controls attack the Mondoshawans at
the beginning of our story.

188	INT.  KORBEN'S  SUITE

	Leeloo is alarmed.  She has to act.  She seizes the flourescent bar beam
with great effort and rams it into the ceiling, marking a hole large enough
for her to escape.

189	INT.  CLOSET  FHLOSTON  PARADISE

	Cornelius bursts into the closet he left the Chief of Police tied and
gagged in.  He quickly unties him.

						CORNELIUS
					(in a panic)
				Mangalores! The Diva's suite! They want
				the Sacred Stones! They must be stopped.
				We must stop them!. I'm going to free you
				but you must promise to help me!

	The Chief of Police nods his agreement.

190	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	The Mangalores have trashed the suite.  One of the Mangalores finally
finds a case engraved with the four elements.

						MANGALORE
				I have it.

	The Mangalore is about to open the case when... Leeloo descends quietly
and gracefully from the ceiling.  Time stands still.

						LEELOO
				(smiling)
			Apipoulai!

191	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	The Diva switches from classical music to funk, picking up the tempo.

	INTERCUT':

192	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE / CONCERT  HALL.

	A WARRIOR whips out the biggest knife ever made and rushes Leeloo.  She
disarms him gracefully.  A violent fight breaks out.  The Diva sings and
Leeloo dances.  The Mangalores pay a heavy price for the show.

193	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Hearing noise from inside the suite, the Mangalore by the door gets
nervous.  He runs for reinforcements.

194	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Cornelius enters the police station wearing handcuffs.  The Chief of
Police is behind him holding a gun.

195	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE / CONCERT  HALL

	Leeloo knocks out the last Mangalore just as the Diva finishes her song
to a burst of applause.  The Diva takes a bow.   So does Leeloo.

196	INT.  ROOM

	Akanit and his men listen to the concert. The Mangalore guard runs in.

						MANGALORE
				They were waiting for us! It was an
				ambush!

						AKANIT
				If it's war they want it's war they'll get!
				Enact the Final Plan!

	All the Mangalores cock their weapons.

197	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	Leeloo is about to open the case when the door EXPLODES.  Zorg is there
holding a ZF1.

						ZORG
				My compliments, little lady!
				...And thanks for doing all the dirty work!
				I couldn't have done it any better myself!
					(sharply)
				...Now hand over the Stones!

	Leeloo smiles and hands him the case.  Zorg arms the ZF1 and gets ready
to kill her.

						ZORG
				Nice knowing you.

	Leeloo catches on quickly.  She kicks the scotch bottle on the floor into
the gun which throws Zorg's shot off.  She jumps to the ceiling and
disappears in an air vent.  Furious, Zorg fires at the ceiling.

198	INT.	AIRSHAFT

	Leeloo dodges the bullets as best as she can.

199	INT.  SUITE

	Zorg fires his 3000 round clip.  The ceiling looks like a piece of swiss
cheese.  Zorg sticks a small cylinder in the wall and flicks it on.  The
numbers flashing by tell us it's a bomb.  The timer reads: 19 minutes and 59
seconds.

						ZORG
					(with a crafty smile)
				You can run but you can't hide...

200	INT.  POLICE  OFFICE  FHLOSTON  PARADISE - NIGHT

	Cornelius is seated opposite the Chief of Police.  A MEDIC is bandaging
the chief's head.  The door explodes.  The cop outside in riddled with
bullets.  A dozen Mangalores attack the police office.  Akanit is at
their head.  The policemen are caught unaware.

						AKANIT
				Nobody move! We're taking over this
				ship!

	The Chief of Police is goggle-eyed.  Cornelius leans toward him.

						CORNELIUS
					(pleased with himself)
				I told you...

201	INT.  CORRIDOR

	Zorg has the case and exits the suite just as the general alarm goes off.
	He sighs in exasperation.

202	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Three Mangalores suddenly rush into the opera hall shooting.

						MANGALORE 1
				Everyone down!

	There is panic all around.

						LOC RHOD
					(broadcasting, panic stricken)
				Ladies and gentlemen, I think we're being...
				attacked.  The place is crawling with warriors.

203	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	President Lindberg and his generals look very worried.

204	INT.  CONCERT HALL

	Some security guards open fire one of the Mangalores is hit.  The others
turn their guns on the cops.  People scream, diving for cover.  Korben bides
his time.

	More Mangalores rush in from all around shooting.  Two cops are killed.
	The Diva... takes a bullet.

	She falls from the stage into Korben's arms. He lowers her to the floor.
Korben ignores the panic all around and wraps her in his dinner jacket,
trying to stop the blue blood spurting from her wounds.

205	EXT./ INT.  SPACE  AROUND  FHLOSTON

	Zorg's ZFX200 speeds away from the boat.  Zorg is at the controls, a
devilish smile on his lips.

						ZORG
				You want something done, do it yourself!

206	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Fighting rages all around in the concert hall, but Korben is oblivious to
it.  He sets the Diva's head delicately on the floor.  Loc Rhod is hidden
nearby, still on the air.

						LOC RHOD
					(voice low, panicked)
				They're hideous. They've got a crest on
				the head, the eyes of a toad and fingers
				all over their hands. Totally hideous!

207	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE.

						MUNRO
					(worried)
				...Mangalores!

						PRESIDENT
				Send a battalion out immediately!

208	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

						KORBEN
					(to the Diva)
				I was sent by the government to help you.

						DIVA
				Don't worry.  This is my fate...
				How was the concert?

	Korben is a little surprised, but... the Diva is an artist.

						KORBEN
				I've never heard anything so beautiful
				in my life.

	A Mangalore jumps on them from the stage.  Korben makes short work of him
and grabs his gun.

						DIVA
					(weak)
				You're a good man...
				She was right to have chosen you...

						KORBEN
				Who?

						DIVA
				The Fifth Element...
				The Supreme Being... Your wife...

	Korben is floored.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo... is... she's...

						DIVA
				Yes, and more than that... You must
				give her the Stones, she's the only one
				who knows how to use them.

						KORBEN
					(to himself, suddenly
					realizing)
				...So Cornelius was telling the truth!

209	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	The Mangalores tie up Cornelius and the Chief of Police together.

						CORNELIUS
					(to the Chief of Police)
				Of course I was telling you the truth!...
				If you had listened to me in the first place,
				we wouldn't be in this predicament now!

210	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Korben wastes two more Mangalores.

						DIVA
				She needs you. She needs your help and
				your love. She's more fragile than she seems...

	Korben looks around, ready for another attack.

						KORBEN
				...Yeah, so am I.

	The Diva takes his hand.

						DIVA
				She was taught to love the life of others...
				but not her own. You have to teach her
				to love if you want her to truly live!

						KORBEN
					(uncomfortable)
				I'll help her, I promise, but I think you
				should tell me where the Stones are!

						DIVA
				Do you love her?

						KORBEN
				I... I don't know! We hardly know
				each other... it takes time!

						DIVA
				I don't have time... I need to know.

						KORBEN
				Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman
				I loved her ... I never saw her again.

						DIVA
				I would like to have died in peace...

	The Diva's eyes close.

211	INT.  DIVA'S  SUITE

	The timer on Zorg's bomb clicks over to "15 minutes".

212	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

						KORBEN
				You tell me to save the world then
				you go off and leave me in the shit!

	He shakes her, gently slapping her cheeks.

						KORBEN
				Come on! You're not gonna die in peace!
				You're not going to die at all! You hear me?
				Where are the Stones?

213	INT.  SPACESHIP

	Zorg sets the Sacred Case on a table in the cockpit.  He opens it with a
complacent smile:		It's empty!

	He cannot believe his eyes.  He goes berserk, destroying everything in
sight.

214	INT.  CONCERT  HALL

	Korben slaps the Diva soundly.  She comes around somewhat.

						KORBEN
				I'm sorry, but... the Stones...

						DIVA
					(very weak)
				They are... with me...

	The Diva dies.  Blue blood streams from her mouth.  Korben frisks the
Diva but doesn't find anything.  The shooting slowly stops in the theatre.
The Mangalores are now in total control.

						MANGALORE 2
				Stay calm and nobody will get hurt!
				Hands on your head and into the hall!

	The guests comply

						KORBEN
					(to himself)
				...The Stones are with me?

	and then it occurs to him.

						KORBEN
				...In me?

	He touches the Diva's stomach and senses something hard.  Girding
himself, he sticks his hand in the wound and pulls out a Sacred Stone.
Then another.  And another.  Korben pulls out all four Stones, covered in blue
blood.  Everyone has left the theater.  The Mangalores check the aisles one
by one.

	Loc Rhod peeks out from under a seat.

						LOC RHOD
				Don't you think we'd better be going?

	A Mangalore spots Korben kneeling alongside the Diva.  He grabs Korben by
the shoulder and pokes him with his gun.

						MANGALORE
				Hey, you! With the others!

	Korben spins and, in one swift motion, breaks his arm.  Just for
starters.  Another WARRIOR rushes over.  Korben punches him into oblivion
and snatches the gun.

						KORBEN
				That's it... I've had... all day people
				have been sticking guns in my face...

	Korben wraps up the four Stones in his shirt.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben man... These dudes are going
				to waste us if we don't do what they say.

	Korben gives him the package and grabs his mike.

						KORBEN
				You don't do what I say... I'll waste
				you myself. Got it?

						LOC RHOD
				Got it...

215	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	President Lindberg dabs his sweaty face with a towel.

216	INT.  POLICE  STATION

	Akanit is still in the police station facing control screens.  He barks
into a
	walkie-talkie.

						AKANIT
				What's the situation in the hall?

217	INT.  HALL

	Hostages are being gathered in the middle of the hall.  They are
surrounded by Mangalores who guard them.

						MUGGER
					(into walkie-talkie)
				There's no more resistance.
				Everything's under control.

	Three Mangalores are suddenly blasted through the glass door leading to
the theater.  Korben bursts into the hall, two huge guns in his hands.

						KORBEN
				Everybody down!

	Korben takes out two more WARRIORS coming towards him, rolls behind a
column.
	Laser bullets stinging all around his head.

						LOC RHOD
				This is amazing! Korben, Korben Dallas,
				the winner of the Gemini Croquette
				contest just killed three warriors like he was
				swatting flies...

	Panic everywhere!  Heavy firing fills the hall.

	ANGLE ON:

	Roy von Bacon, the laserball player, rises from the floor behind a
Mangalore, grabs him and smashes his head into a column, seizing the gun.

	ANGLE ON:

	Two Mangalores firing a huge machine gun at the column Korben is using
for cover.
	He dives for cover behind the bar.

	ANGLE ON:

	Two Mangalores watch awestruck.  Roy whistles behind them.  The two
Mangalores turn around.  Roy bonks their heads together.

						LOC RHOD
				It's Roy von Bacon, the Lions center
				forward joining in the battle...

	Someone taps Loc Rhod on the shoulder.  He jumps with fright.

						PRINCESS AACHEN
					(hot to trot)
				All this is terribly exciting, hmmm?

	Loc Rhod covers his mike.

						LOC RHOD
				GET OFF MY BACK!

	A Mangalore shoots in their direction.  Loc Rhod flattens himself on the
floor.  A vase falls on the Princess knocking her out.  A Mangalore loads
some missiles in his gun and destroys the bar piece by piece forcing Korben to
move forward.  Korben motions to Baby Ray hiding under the pool table.

						KORBEN
				Toss me the balls!

						BABY RAY
					(terrified, still deaf)
				What?

	Another piece of the bar explodes.

						KORBEN
				The balls for Christ's sake!

	Korben apes playing pool, but Baby Ray really is stone-deaf.

						EMPEROR JAPHET
				He wants the balls! You deaf or something?

	The EMPEROR rolls the balls over to Korben.  The Mangalore loads more
missiles and shatters another part of the bar.  Korben hides behind the last
bit left.

						KORBEN
				How far is he from here?

	The EMPEROR glances at the Mangalore, who in reloading.

						EMPEROR
				I'd say about thirty yards to the left.

	Korben hefts the ball, jumps up and hurls it with blinding  speed.  The
Mangalore catches it right in the head.  He drops, firing in the air.  The
missile strikes the ceiling which collapses on him.  The emperor gives Korben
a thumb's up.

						LOC RHOD
				...And our man Korben has literally
				knocked out the opposition with an

	The COPS on the floor rise, scoop up weapons from dead Mangalores and lay
down a line of fire at the last of the fleeing rebels . Roy whirls his arm
in victory.

						FOG
				Thanks for your help.

	Korben leans around the corner and fires rapidly.

						KORBEN
				Six to the left. One to the right.

	The police round up the remaining Mangalores.  Korben is at the control
center screens trying to find Leeloo.  Cornelius comes over to him,
embarrassed.

						CORNELIUS
				You're probably very angry with me and
				I quite understand. But I want you to
				know I'm fighting for a noble cause.

						KORBEN
				Yeah, I know... to save the world... but
				right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.

						CORNELIUS
				Leeloo's in trouble?

						KORBEN
				When is she not in trouble?

						CORNELIUS
				Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?

	Korben realizes that Cornelius in probably right.

with the bomb stuck on the wall.

	Korben in busy looking for Leeloo.

						KORBEN
					(loudly)
				Leeloo?

	Up in the airshaft, Leeloo has heard him.

						LEELOO
				Korben...

	Her voice is too weak, Korben can't hear her.

						LOC RHOD
				Korben man... what the hell is this?

	Korben gives the bomb a prefunctory glance.

						KORBEN
				A molecular bomb.

	Three minutes left on the timer.

						LOC RHOD
					(increasingly worried)
				And, uh, what're these numbers clicking
				by?

						CORNELIUS
				Probably the time remaining before it

	Cornelius smiles and continues his search.

						LOC RHOD
					(weak smile)
				You're just saying that to scare me! Right?
				If it was a bomb, an alarm would've gone off.
				There's bomb detectors in all these hotels!

	A general alarm goes off.  Loc Rhod is crushed.

						VOICE (O.S.)
				This is a Type A alert. For security reasons

						KORBEN
				Not without Leeloo.

	Loc Rhod cannot take his eyes off the bomb.

						LOC RHOD
				Like D-Man, I hate to bother you but uh,
				like, we're down to 2 minutes here...

	Korben breathes out, bothered.  He turns his attention to the bomb.

						KORBEN
				It's the latest model.. I've never seen one
				before... it works off a magnetic coded
				card... Let's see if I can rig it up.

235	INT.  AIRSHAFT

	Leeloo sticks her fingers out one of the bullet holes and lets some of
her blood drip down.

	The blood splats on Korben's hand.  He snaps his head up and knows
immediately who is up there.  He forgets about the bomb.

						LOC RHOD
				Hey! What are you doing? The bomb!

	Korben drags the desk over, jumps on it and pokes his head in the torn up
airshaft He spots Leeloo who gives him a weak smile.

						KORBEN
				Don't worry, I'm here now!

	He pulls her toward him, helps her out of the shaft and stretches her out
on the desk.

						KORBEN
				Just relax. I've got the Stones.
				Everything's going to be fine.

	30 seconds left on the timer.

						LOC RHOD
					(falling to pieces)
				Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of
				your time here?

						KORBEN
					(to Leeloo)
				I'll be right back.

	Korben dashes over to the bomb.  He is stopped by the barrel of the ZF1.
Zorg, in person, holding a magnetic card.

						ZORG
					(smiling)
				Allow me...

	Zorg slips a small magnetic card in the bomb, it starts to count down
from 5 minutes.

						ZORG
				Just for the fun of it.

	Loc Rhod faints.

						ZORG
				Well, what do we have here? Is this
				Korben Dallas? The famous winner of
				the Gemini Croquette contest?
				Or is this Korben Dallas from Special
				Section sent by old Lindberg himself.

	Korben doesn't reply.

						ZORG
				...In any event, whoever you are,
				I was glad to meet you.

	Zorg fires at Korben who figures he is dead.  Nothing.  Zorg tries again.
Nada.  The clip is empty.  Zorg starts to panic.

						ZORG
				...A 3000 round clip! I didn't fire off
				3000 rounds... did I?

						KORBEN
				Don't you know how to count.
				It's not all that hard. Watch!

	Korben punches him square in the face, shows him his index.

						KORBEN
				One! That's for trying to kill me!

	Second Punch.

						KORBEN
				Two! That's for firing me! Three!
				That's for pushing around a priest!
				And the rest is for what you did to
				my wife!

	Korben pummels him mercilessly.

	Zorg falls to the floor, beaten to a pulp.  The timer clicks over to 3
minutes.

						KORBEN

the lines to shreds.

	Loc Rhod is thrown to the rear of the ship.

little.

				I'm so very sad.

				Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't

						LEELOO
				Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs...
				Money...
				Everything you create is used to destroy...

						KORBEN
				I told you not to read all that crap!

						LEELOO
				Protect life... Until death.

	Her eyes close and she falls back asleep.  Korben is worried.  She seems
so depressed.  Cornelius enters.

				His name's Mambo, I think.

				So now what's the problem?

	The President drops into his armchair and sighs.

						PRESIDENT
				There's a ball of fire 1,200 miles in diameter

				no idea how to stop it! ...That's the problem.

	Korben thinks fast.  The Priest is with him.  The Five Elements are on
board.

						KORBEN
				How much time before the collision?

	The President queries the scientist with a nod of the head.

						SCIENTIST
				If its speed remains constant... in an

	The ZFX200 is parked in the middle of the desert.

	Korben walks ahead carrying Leeloo.  Cornelius has the four Stones with
him.
	Barely awake, Loc Rhod stumbles along.  David appears at the door of the
chapel.

						DAVID
				You're all safe. Thanks be to God!

						CORNELIUS
				Later, David! Later!
				There's not a minute to lose!

	The small group enters the chapel.

261	INT.  CHAPEL

	Cornelius pushes the group onto the altar which is surrounded by a wooden
barrier.  Cornelius stands in front of the cross.

						KORBEN
				Excuse me, Father, but... could we pray

	Cornelius bends the cross and pushes it down.  A mechanism is set off
lowering the altar like a service elevator.

	The altar descends amid rocky walls.

				About nine minutes.

	President Lindberg has trouble breathing.

265	INT.  TEMPLE

	Lit by torches, Korben sets Leeloo delicately on the altar in the exact
center of the four elements.  Cornelius looks over the four Stones every
which way.

						CORNELIUS
					(panic-stricken)
				Uh, this one... must be water!

	It's obvious he doesn't know where to put it.

						KORBEN
				Don't tell me you don't know how all
				this works?

						CORNELIUS
				Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form
				the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed
				to stand in the middle there, but...
				I don't have the reference book.
				I've never seen the Stones work!

	Korben can't believe his ears.  He tears the Stone out of Cornelius' hand
and studies the inscriptions.  He goes over to one of the four bases the
stones rest on and tries to figure it out.  The symbol of air is on the Stone,
the same as on the base.

						KORBEN
				Match the symbols!

	Korben places the first Stone and picks up another one.  Cornelius has
found the symbol for water.  Loc Rhod sits down.  He is very tired.

						LOC RHOD
				What is this some kinda game? Like
				chess?

	Korben pulls him to his feet and sticks a Stone in his hands.

						KORBEN
				No. It's much simpler. If we don't figure
				out where these Stones go in five minutes,
				we're all dead! Think you got it?

	Loc Rhod's got it and runs over to put in his Stone.  The four Stones are
all in place but nothing happens.

						KORBEN
				There's no light! You told me there were
				supposed to be four beams of light.

						CORNELIUS
					(lost)
				Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut!
				They have to be open for it to work.

						KORBEN
				And you don't know how they open,
				is that what you are saying?

						CORNELIUS
				That's what I'm saying.

				The wind blows... the fire burns...

						KORBEN
				I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking
				about the Stones.

						LEELOO
				...The rain falls...

	Korben is desperate.  Leeloo's too weak, he won't get anything more out
of her.
	He darts over to a Stone and turns it over and over.

						KORBEN
				The rain falls... the wind blows?

	Loc Rhod stands in front of his Stone looking at Korben.

						KORBEN
				Try and figure out how this fucking thing
				opens, instead of staring at me like that!

	Loc Rhod starts feeling the Stone all around.

						LOC RHOD

	Korben and Cornelius turn the Stones every which way.  All to no avai1.
Loc Rhod is discouraged.

						LOC RHOD
				...we'll never make it.

	He sighs.  Three hooks pop off the Stone.  Loc Rhod can't believe his
eyes.

						LOC RHOD
				It... it moved! Korben! Korben!

	Korben rushes over, looks at the Stone.  Hooks are undone.

						KORBEN
				What did you say? What did you do?

						LOC RHOD
				Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do
				nothing!

						KORBEN
				Look, you did something that set it off.
				Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me
				exactly what you did!!

	Loc Rhod tries to duplicate the same movement.

						LOC RHOD
				I was like this... With my hands here and...
				I said, "We'll never make it!" That's all!

	Nothing happens.

						KORBEN
				Is that all?

						LOC RHOD
				Yeah... then I sighed... like this.

	Loc Rhod sighs, really depressed this time.  The Stone opens even more.
	Korben's got it.

						KORBEN
				The wind! The wind blows...

	Korben blows on the Stone which immediately opens revealing a patch of
blue sky with some miniature clouds floating around inside.  A yellow beam
pops up like a ray of sunlight, like Korben's smile.

						KORBEN
				Quickly, everyone on a Stone!
				Water for water!  Fire for fire!
				Earth for earth!

	The two men move fast.  Korben on the 4th Stone: Earth.  He grabs a
fistful of earth  and throws it on the Stone.  A miniature patch of green
appears and immediately forms a green beam.  Cornelius wipes his forehead
with a scarf and wrings it out over the Stone.  It opens revealing a patch of
miniature raging sea.  A blue beam appears.

	Loc Rhod has a problem.

						LOC RHOD
					(shaking)
				I don't have a light.  I stopped smoking
				last week! If we'd come a bit sooner...

	Korben pats his pockets, he comes up with a box of matches.  There's only
one left.

						KORBEN
				Don't breathe.

	Loc Rhod and Cornelius hold their breath.  Korben strikes the match.  A
small flame appears on the tip.  A breeze goes through the room.  Korben
feels like he's got TNT in his hands.  He approaches the flame to the Stone.
The flame twists, dims, flickers ...but holds on.  The Stone opens.  A patch
of miniature fire appears. Korben sighs, snuffs out the match.  The fourth
beam, a red one, immediately forms.

				Come on! You can do it!

	Korben slowly releases Leeloo and steps back from the altar.
	Leeloo can barely stand in the center of the four beams.
	An indistinct white beam begins to form around her, starts to rise.

						CORNELIUS
				Come on Leeloo! Come on!

	The beam loses its intensity.  Leeloo crumples to the floor.

the temple floor and begins to smoke, eating away at it like acid.  Loc
Rhod has to dodge another drop of the stuff.  Korben quickly straightens
Leeloo up and puts her back in the center of the beams.

						KORBEN
				Leeloo! If you don't get on with the

	Leeloo wraps her arms around Korben's neck.

				You're right but there are lots of good

	Leeloo has tears in her eyes.  The heat is overpowering.  Black acid is
everywhere.

						LEELOO
				Tell me...

						KORBEN
				I love you...

	Despite her fatigue, Leeloo smiles broadly.

	CUT TO:

278b	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE

	The stopwatch goes from 3 to 2.

279 INT.  CHAPEL

						LEELOO
				Now you're allowed to kiss me.

	- Korben wraps his arms around her and kisses her like he's never kissed
anybody before.  - The white beam, the Divine Light, immediately forms
around Leeloo and Korben. - The stopwatch hits zero.  - The Absolute Beam
explodes from the top of the pyramid and heads straight into the sky zapping
the fireball smack in the middle, slowing it down.  - Korben and Leeloo kiss
like there was no tomorrow.

	- The beam hardens and slowly solidifies the Evil Planet.  Inaudible
screeches escape from the dying planet.  Screeches of terrifying pain as if a
million souls were dying.

	- Streams of black acid spurt from the pyramid and solidify like
brilliant stalactites.

280	EXT.  SPACE

	The pure beam, the Light of Life, has finished its work.  The Dark Planet
nothing more than a dead planet.
	Strangely enough, it looks like the moon.  Everything is calm around it.

281	INT.  PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

	President Lindberg opens his eyes and realizes he's not dead-

						SCIENTIST
				The planet seems to have stopped at...
				62 miles from impact.

282	INT.  CHAPEL

	In the temple, the beam loses its intensity.  But Leeloo and Korben
remain stuck together, lost in their kiss.  Cornelius has dropped to his
knees, clutching his hands.

	Loc Rhod slips along the wall with a sigh.  He gives Cornelius a knowing
smile.

						LOC RHOD
				This guy is a killer with the babes.
				I knew it from the moment I laid eyes
				on him.

	Cornelius and Loc Rhod burst out laughing.  Korben and Leeloo keep on
kissing.

283	INT.  LABORATORY

	We are in the Nucleological Laboratory that gave birth to Leeloo in the
beginning of our story.  The President enters the lab followed by a group
of officials in ceremonial dress.

						MUNRO
				Mr. President, let me introduce you to
				Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.

						MACTILBURGH
				It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.

						PRESIDENT
					(beaming)
				Yes.. Well? Where are our two heroes?

						MACTILBURGH
				They were so tired from their ordeal that
				we put them in the reactor this morning..

						PRESIDENT
				I have 19 more meetings after this one
				Professor..

						PROFESSOR
				Of course.. Let me see if they're revived.

						AIDE
				We go live in one minute, Mr. President.

	Mactilburgh goes to the reactor and opens a small slot which allows him
to see what is going on under the blue shield.

	Leeloo and Korben are naked, arms wrapped around each other, kissing and
probably engaged in hoppi hoppa.
	Mactilburgh looks troubled.

						MACTILBURGH
				I.. uh.. they need five more minutes,
				Mr. President.

	The President, pressed for time, looks over to his aide who in struggling
with a phone call.

						AIDE
				No ma'am... I tried... No ma'am...

						PRESIDENT
				Who is it?

						AIDE
				Some woman... claims she's Korben's
				mother...

						PRESIDENT
				Give it here...

	The President takes the phone and goes to the window.

						PRESIDENT
				Mrs. Dallas, this in the President.
				On behalf of the entire Federation,
				I would like to thank...

						MOTHER (V.O.)
				Don't pull that crap with me, Finger...
				I'd recognize that trash can voice of
				yours in a dark alley during a rain storm.
				You tell that worthless no account son
				of mine he should plotz for the way he's
				ignored his mother... when I think of all I
				sacrificed for him...

284	EXT.  NEW YORK

	Outside the lab we see the President through the window, holding the
phone away from his ear.

	PAN slowly across Manhattan.
	Credits Roll as TWO full rising silver moons ascend in the dark blue sky.

THE END
