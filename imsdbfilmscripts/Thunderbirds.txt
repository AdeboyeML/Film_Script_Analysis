               From a secret island in the South Pacific, 
               the courageous Tracy family run an organization               
               called International Rescue. When disaster strikes, anywhere 
               in the world, they are always first on the
               scene. They go by the name they gave their incredible machines, 
               the Thunderbirds.

               (Counts down numbers and shows corresponding
               Thunderbirds) Five, four, three, two, one. Thunderbirds are go!
 
               
               Cuts to live action, Alan Tracy is looking out a school window.
 
               
               
               But in this family of heroes, there is one son left behind.
 
               
               
               
                             TEACHER
               So, gentlemen, we all know that A2 plus 
               B2 equals... C2, that's right. But what 
               happens when we bring in Leonardo Da Vinci's E,
               F and... (Teacher notices Alan looking out window
               and not paying attention to the lesson) Mr. Tracy!

               Alan. Alan!

               
               Alan's head jerks back from the window and to the teacher who 
               is now standing in front of him.
 
               
                             TEACHER
               How kind of you to come back from outer 
               space, Alan. I trust re-entry wasn't 
               too rough?
 
               (Chuckles sarcastically and continues sounding even more annoyed) 
               Here on Earth we've been discussing the Pythagorean
               theorem. Did any of that happen to sink in?
 
               
                             ALAN TRACY
               I was just...

               
                             TEACHER
               Apparently not (she picks up his notebook 
               which he has been doodling in) "Thunderbirds 
               are go."

               Well, I hope you aren't going anywhere special over spring 
               break, Alan. Because I expect a 10,000 word paper on my desk
               the day you get back. That should keep you busy.
 
               
               Bells rings dismissing the students and Alan and Fermat walk 
               out to their lockers.
 
               
                             ALAN
               (mocking the teacher) "That should keep 
               you busy. Yeah, well you can take your 
               10,000 words

               Both boys turn around to see the headmaster approaching them 
               while walking by with the teacher from before

                             FERMAT
               Because technically you're not a Thunderbirds 
               yet. And if your identity was discovered, 
               it would a d-d-di- it could be very bad.

               
                             ALAN

               be on TV. Let's go! They're gonna be

               And there is real concern for the lives of six 
               men who remain trapped on board.

               An emergency call went out to the Thunderbirds just a few minutes 
               ago. They should be here any moment now.

               A blast of fire hits Thunderbird 1 and sends it a little farther

               a Thunderbird without activating the anti-detection shield. You 
               put everyone in danger when you act
 
               selfishly. You want to be part of the team, you have to play

               Tintin uses a limb to hit the bee hive at Mullion and the other 
               two guards. Mullion falls off the car
 
               and into a puddle while being stung by bees. The scene cuts back 
               to Alan and Fermat in the junkyard
 
               attaching something to the back of the hoversled so that all 
               three of them can fit on it.

               Actually, I agree with Tintin. I don't 
               think this is s-s-safe.

               You don't think anything is s s-safe.
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               Just because I s-s-stutter doesn't mean 
               that I'm wrong. If we're a team, we 
               should make
 
               decisions as a team.
