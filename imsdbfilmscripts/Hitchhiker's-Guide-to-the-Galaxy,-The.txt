    OVER DARKNESS...                                                  1

    ...we hear what we will come to know as the VOICE OF THE
    GUIDE.
                 GUIDE VOICE
         It is an important and popular fact that
         things are not always what they seem.

    A small square image appears on screen.    Home video.      The
    dolphin stadium at Sea World.

                 GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
         For instance, on the planet Earth, man had
         always assumed that he was the most
         intelligent species occupying the planet,
         instead of the third most intelligent
         which was, in fact, entirely accurate.

    The dolphins perform; leaping through hoops, etc.

                 GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
         The second most intelligent creatures
         were, of course, dolphins who curiously
         enough had long known of the impending
         destruction of the planet Earth. They had
         made many attempts to alert mankind to the
         danger, but most of their communications
         were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to
         punch footballs or whistle for tidbits, so
         they eventually decided they would leave
         Earth by their own means.

    They leap madly, desperately. Higher and higher...

                 GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
         The last ever dolphin message was
         misinterpreted as a surprisingly
         sophisticated attempt to do a double-
         backward somersault through a hoop while
         whistling the "Star-Spangled Banner" but
         in fact the message was this...
         "So long and thanks for all the fish."

    TITLES ROLL - (FULL SCREEN 35mm IMAGES)

    Dolphins leap over and interact with the opening titles.
    Breathtaking somersaults, back flips, choreographed to a
    Buzby Berkley-style song called, "SO LONG AND THANKS FOR
    ALL THE FISH." We end with a wide shot of all the
    dolphins jumping out of the top of frame, but they never
    come back down. TILT UP to a starry night sky - the
    dolphins have vanished.

    END TITLES

    As night turns to morning, we hear CLICK, then...

                         VOICE ON RADIO
                 ...as well as Sea World Orlando and San
                 Diego reporting their dolphins have
                 mysteriously disappeared overnight.

    INT. ARTHUR DENT'S BEDROOM - MORNING                        2

    CLOSE ON the clock radio from which the voice emanates.
    A hand shuts it off. ARTHUR DENT is awake. 30's. Kind
    faced. His feet land perfectly in slippers as he stands
    and shuffles out of his very neat but very boring room.

3   IN THE BATHROOM - Arthur gargles in front of the mirror.    3
    He bends over to spit revealing a YELLOW BULLDOZER
    through the window, crawling toward his house. A TEA
    KETTLE WHISTLES O.S.

4   INT. ARTHUR DENT'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                     4

    Arthur sets the newspaper (with the headline "DOLPHINS
    VANISH") on the table, removes the kettle. Doesn't notice
    through the window 3 MORE LARGE YELLOW BULLDOZERS.

    He pours a cup of tea, sets the pot down next o his
    mobile phone. He picks it up, stares at a DIGITAL PHOTO
    ON THE SCREEN of himself and a very pretty woman (Tricia)
    at a costume party.

    He presses the phone to his head as if it were a cold
    compress. Suddenly, there's a LOUD RUMBLING o.s. The
    tea cup RATTLES. Arthur looks out the window. Now he
    sees the bulldozers.

    The tea cup shatters on the floor.
                                                     CUT TO:
5   EXT. ARTHUR DENT'S HOUSE - MORNING                          5

    Arthur, dressed in pajamas and robe, lies in the dirt in
    front of a bulldozer, blocking it from destroying his
    house. He yells into his mobile phone.

                       ARTHUR
                  (into phone)
              What do you mean he's gone out to lunch?
              You just said he was still at breakfast!

    MR. PROSSER, a bureaucrat, leans over him.

                      PROSSER
              Come off it, Mr. Dent. You can't lie in
              front of the bulldozers forever.

                      ARTHUR
              I'm game. We'll see who rusts first.

                      PROSSER
              This bypass has got to be built and it's
              going to be built. You should have made
              your protest months ago.

                      ARTHUR
              The first I heard of it was when a workman
              came yesterday. I asked if he'd come to
              clean the windows, and he said he'd come
              to demolish the house. He didn't tell me
              right away of course. First he wiped a
              couple of windows and charged me twenty
              quid. Then he told me.

    The bulldozer driver, looking guilty, ducks behind the
    steering wheel. Prosser removes plans from his briefcase.

                         PROSSER
                 Look. These plans have been on display at
                 the planning office now for a year.

                         ARTHUR
                 On display? I had to go down to a cellar!

                         PROSSER
                 That's the display department.

                         ARTHUR
                 I eventually found them in the bottom of a
                 locked filing cabinet in a disused
                 lavatory with a sign on the door saying
                 'beware of the leopard'.

                         PROSSER
                 Mr. Dent, have you any idea how much
                 damage that bulldozer would suffer if I
                 just let it roll straight over you?

                         ARTHUR
                 How much?

                         PROSSER
                 None at all.

                         FORD (O.S.)
                   (American accent)
                 Arthur!

    Arthur and Prosser turn to see a man cresting a hill,
    pushing a shopping cart which is filled with beer and
    bags of peanuts. This is FORD PREFECT. Wiry, intense.
    As he heads downhill, he leaps up and rides the cart down
    towards Arthur's house -- like a kid in a supermarket.
    He rolls right past Arthur and the bulldozers.

                         ARTHUR
                 Ford?

    He leaps off, drags the cart to a full stop.

                         FORD
                 Arthur! There you are. Here drink and
                 eat with me. We need to talk.

                         ARTHUR
                 Er, um...now's not the best time, Ford
                 They're going to demolish my home,

                          FORD
                 Whoa.   You already know? How?

    Arthur simply motions to the bulldozer.

                       FORD (CONT'D)
               Oh. When you say "they" you mean they.
               Got it. Listen, I gotta tell you
               something important, and I gotta tell you
               now.

                       ARTHUR
               But what about my house?

    Ford looks to Prosser who is conferring with the
    bulldozer driver. He pushes the cart over to him.

    ARTHUR - watches as Ford gestures to Prosser who waves
    his hand and the all the 'dozer engines die.
    The bulldozer drivers step down, start drinking the beer
    and eating the peanuts. Ford returns to Arthur.

                      FORD
              C'mon. Let's go to the pub. He said they
              won't destroy your house until they've
              finished the beers.

                      ARTHUR
              Can we trust him?

                       FORD
               I'd trust him to the end of the Earth.

                      ARTHUR
              And how far's that?

                      FORD
              About twelve minutes away.

                                                                CUT TO:

6   INT. VILLAGE PUB - MIDDAY                                             6

    Ford and Arthur enter the half-full pub. Ford hurries to
    the bar. Arthur follows, cell phone to his ear.

                      FORD
              Six pints of bitter. And quickly.      The
              world's about to end.

                       BARMAN
               Oh yes, sir? Nice weather for it.

    He starts to pull pints. Ford shoves bar peanuts into
    his pockets while Arthur shouts into his phone...

                      ARTHUR
              Well, when does he get back from lunch?
              Or is he going straight out for tea?!

    He shuts the phone, sits, looking forlorn.

                      ARTHUR (CONT'D)
              This is shaping up to be a crap day.

                         FORD
                 It's about to get a lot crappier.

                         BARMAN
                 There you are, six pints.

    Ford slaps down a £50 note. The barman's impressed.

                         FORD
                 Keep the change. You've got ten minutes to
                 spend it.

    Ford pushes three pints in front of Arthur.

                         ARTHUR
                 Three? At lunchtime?

                         FORD
                 Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.

                         ARTHUR
                 Very deep. You should send that in to the
                 Reader's Digest. They've got a page for
                 people like you.

                         FORD
                 Drink up.

                         ARTHUR
                 Why three pints?

                         FORD
                 Muscle relaxant.
                    (grabbing more peanuts)
                 And eat these. You'll need the salt.

                         ARTHUR

                         FORD
                 What would you say if I told you I wasn't
                 really from Guilford but from a small
                 planet somewhere in the vicinity of
                 Eetelgeuse?

                         ARTHUR
                 Why, is it the sort of thing you're likely
                 to say?

                         FORD
                 Remember when we met? That car was racing
                 toward me, I was trying to greet it, you
                 pushed me out of the way?

         QUICK CUT TO A STREET - MID-DAY                                  7

         Ford stands in the middle of the road, extending a hand
         to a fast approaching car.
         Arthur drops his shopping, dives at him and tackles him
         out of the way as the car zooms past.

(6 cont) BACK TO FORD IN THE PUB:                                      (6 cont)

                           FORD
                   Didn't you find it a little strange that I
                   was trying to shake hands with a car?

                           ARTHUR
                   I assumed you were drunk.

                           FORD
                      (shaking his head)
                   I thought cars were the dominant life
                   form. I was trying to introduce myself.

                           ARTHUR
                   And that's why you're named after a
                   discontinued car from the seventies?

                           FORD
                      (nodding)
                   You saved my life that day.      Now I'm
                   saving yours.

         Arthur just stares at him, then turns to his beer.

                           ARTHUR
                   This must be Thursday. I never could get
                   the hang of Thursdays.

                           FORD
                   Look, if it's about your house...

                   No, it's not that.    It's....

         He shows Ford the photo of he and Tricia on his phone.

                           ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                   I found her. Ford. The perfect girl. I
                   found her, and then I let her get away.
                   You remember that fancy dress party I told
                   you about?

                           FORD
                   This isn't a long story, is it? We've
                   only got six minutes.

         Arthur shakes his head.    Ford checks his watch.

               want to go, would have much rather stayed
               home and, I don't know, brush the dog.
               Anything. But there I was -- and then,
               there she was...

    Arthur, dressed in safari attire complete with pith helmet,
    sits off to the side, observing, looking miserable.

                       TRICIA (O.S.)
               Who are you?

    Arthur looks up. TRICIA MCMILLAN is dressed in a mid
    19th century mens suit with mutton chop sideburns and is
    holding a taxidermy beagle -- and she still looks
    beautiful.   Arthur, ever the gentleman, stands.

                       ARTHUR
               I'm Arthur. Arthur Dent.

                       TRICIA
               No, I mean who are you?

                       ARTHUR
               Oh, the costume. Right. Er, um...
                  (sheepishly tipping his hat)
               Livingston, I presume.
                   (pointing to her attire)
               Granted. Not as clever as Darwin, but the
               best I could do on short notice.

                       TRICIA
               You're the first person who's got it
               right. Everyone keeps calling me
               Sherlock.

                      ARTHUR
              Really? I thought the beagle made it
              rather obvious.

    He pets the dog.    She smiles.    He smiles back.

    THE BALCONY -- Arthur has just taken a digital photo of
    he and Tricia on his cell phone. They look at the screen
    image and laugh.

                         ARTHUR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                 She was amazing, Ford. Witty, and
                 beautiful, and brilliant. Four or five
                 degrees. One in math, one in astrophysics,
                 another in biology...

                         TRICIA
                 I've got so many degrees I am officially
                 unemployable. Let's drink to that!

    They clink their wine glasses, take sips, continue to chat.

                         ARTHUR (V.O.)
                 And just as I was asking myself, "Why is
                 this stunning and intelligent woman even
                 giving me the time of day, out of nowhere
                 she says...

                         TRICIA
                 Let's go somewhere.

                         ARTHUR
                 Yeah. It is a bit noisy. There's a
                 lovely little cafe around the corner...

                         TRICIA
                 I was thinking Madagascar.

                         ARTHUR
                 Is that a new club on Dean Street?

                         TRICIA
                 No. It's a country.    Off the coast of
                 Africa.

                         ARTHUR
                 Oh, that Madagascar. Right, off we go
                 then.
                    (then realizing...)
                 Good God, you're serious.

     She nods.    Arthur isn't sure how to react.

                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                  Well...that's...an extraordinary
                  proposition. But...I can't just up and
                  go. What about my job?

                           TRICIA
                  Quit.   Get a new one when we return.

                          ARTHUR
                  I can't just...what about my house?     Who
                  would feed my dog?

                          TRICIA
                  Bring him with.

                          ARTHUR
                  He's a Welsh Collie.   He'd feel all out of
                  place in Madagascar.

     Trillian forces a smile, clearly disappointed.

                          ZAPHOD (O.S.)
                  You don't want to go to Madagascar.

     They both turn to face ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX - very charming,
     extremely handsome - whose attire seems very "other
     worldly." Knee high boots, a yellow sash...

                          ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                  Hi. I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of
                  the Galaxy -- of course, you probably
                  already know that. I'm headed for a lost
                  and distant planet. Would you like to see
                  my spaceship?

                          ARTHUR (V.O.)
                  I went to refresh our drinks.     When I came
                  back, she was gone.

                  "Would you like to see my spaceship?"
                  Really, what sort of chat up line is that?

                          FORD
                  More popular than you'd think.

                          ARTHUR
                  I've left messages, sent letters... It's
                  like she's vanished off the face of the

      There's a ROAR OF ENGINES and a LOUD CRASH outside.
      Arthur and everyone else in the pub look up.

                           ARTHUR
                   My house!

      He runs out. Ford rises, grabs two handfuls of peanuts from
      the bowl, tosses the barman all the money in his pocket.

                           FORD
                   A round for everyone, on me.

                   Shouldn't we lie down or put a bag over

                   Not really.

      He gives everyone in the bar a friendly salute, exits.

      Arthur runs up the road towards his house which is being

                            ARTHUR
                   STOP!   STOP, YOU BASTARDS!!

      Arthur suddenly stops running and covers his ears as we
      hear THE LOUDEST RUMBLE IN MOTION PICTURE HISTORY.

11a   A GIGANTIC YELLOW SPACESHIP (picture a concrete tower         11a
      block)) sweeps overhead. Ford hits the deck. Arthur is
      blown sideways. Trees are uprooted.

      Ford rises and hurries to the rubble that was Arthur's
      house. He digs around near the exposed toilet and comes
      up with -- A TOWEL. He hurries to Arthur's side.

                     In many of the more relaxed civilizations
                     on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy,
                     the Hitchhiker's Guide has already
                     supplanted the great Encyclopedia
                     Galactica as the standard repository of
                     all knowledge and wisdom. For though it
                     has many omissions, and contains much
                     which is apocryphal, or at least wildly
                     inaccurate, it scores over the older, more
                     pedestrian work in two important respects.
                     First, it is slightly cheaper. And second,
                     it has the words "DON'T PANIC" printed in
                     large friendly letters on its cover.

        The book closes. The words "DON'T PANIC" appear just
        below the title, blinking like a tacky diner marquee.

        PULL BACK FROM THE GUIDE to find Arthur holding it, the
        blinking light illuminating his very disoriented face.

    2   INT. HOLD OF VOGON CONSTRUCTOR SHIP - NIGHT                        22

        Arthur, in total shock, holds up the guide.

                             ARTHUR
                     So you're not from Guilford, which would
                     explain the accent -- which I've always
                     wondered about...and you're not an out of
                     work actor -- but rather a writer for
                     this...this...book thing.

        Ford nods.    Arthur rubs his weary brow.

                             ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     I don't feel well. I need a cup of tea.

        Ford hands him a fistful of peanuts.

                             FORD
                     Here. Eat these. If you've never been
                     through a transmat beam before you've
                     probably lost some salt and protein.

        Arthur eats some peanuts, sits up, squints. Ford feels
        his way around the room, looking for something.

                             ARTHUR
                     If I asked where we were would I regret

                             FORD
                     We're safe. For now.

                             ARTHUR
                     Good.

                             FORD
                     We're in a storage hold in one of               the
                     ships of the Vogon constructor fleet ...

                             ARTHUR
                     Obviously some strange usage of the word
                     safe I wasn't previously aware of.

                             FORD
                        (not getting the sarcasm)
                     Is it?

                             ARTHUR
                     Tell me you're joking.

                             FORD
                     Okay. I'm joking.

                             ARTHUR
                     And do a reassuring little laugh.

        Ford does a reassuring little laugh.

                             ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     Now tell me where we really are.

                  ship.

        Ford continues his search.   Arthur's breathing quickens.

        full of alien junk and old mattresses.

                     Yes, but ants aren't exactly people!

                             FORD
                     And now you're thinking like a Vogon.
                        (before Arthur can respond)
                     I saved your life, okay? Which makes us
                     even. Next thing.

        Ford throws Arthur a towel. Arthur looks confused.

                              FORD (CONT'D)
                      It's a tough galaxy. You want to survive
                      out here, you really gotta know where your
                      towel is. Now gimme a hand over here.

        Arthur joins Ford near a rusty ventilation pipe.

                              FORD (CONT'D)
                      Careful, it's hot.

        He slides the towel behind the pipe, holding each end of
        it, Arthur does the same.

                              FORD (CONT'D)
                      We've got to get off this ship before the
                      Vogons find us. Vogons hate hitchhikers.
                      Which is why they make ships with walls
                      that won't allow the Sub-Etna signal to
                      pass through. So we've got to send the
                      signal up and out if we wanna catch a
                      ride. Pull.

        They both pull. A section of pipe snaps off. Steam
        shoots out. Ford holds the black Thumb under the pipe.

                             ARTHUR
                     What's a Vogon?

                             FORD
                     Ask the guide.    Say "Vogons."

                  degenerate freeloaders.

        The door BURSTS open. A VOGON GUARD enters. Grabs Ford
        and Arthur. They struggle.

                          VOGON GUARD
                  Resistance is useless!

        The struggle continues. As they're dragged out the door,
        Arthur continues to try to yank the fish out of his ear.
        Ford wrestles with him, trying to keep it in.

                  The Babelfish is small, yellow, leechlike,
                  and probably the oddest thing in the

26      INT. VOGON SHIP CORRIDOR.                                     26

        A bleak corridor. The Vogon guard pushes a still
        struggling Arthur and Ford down it.

                          GUIDE VOICE
                  It feeds on brainwave energy, absorbing
                  unconscious frequencies and excreting
                  a matrix of conscious frequencies to the
                  speech centres of the brain, the practical
                  upshot of which is that if you stick one in
                  your ear, you instantly understand anything
                  said to you in any language.

        Arthur continues to struggle, until he passes a portal
        window. He backs up to look out.

                          GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
                  Now, it is such a bizarrely improbable
                  thing that anything so mind-bogglingly
                  useful could have evolved in the Universe
                  purely by chance that many thinkers have
                  chosen to see this as a final clinching
                  proof of the NON-existence of God.

26a     ARTHUR'S POV -- of space through the window, beautiful        26a

                  The argument goes something like this...
                  "I refuse to prove that I exist," says

                  faith I am nothing."

                      "But," says Man, "the Babelfish is a dead

                      therefore you don't. QED." "Oh dear," says
                      God, "I hadn't thought of that," and
                      promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.

         The guard yanks Arthur away, pushes him forward with Ford.

                              GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
                      Most leading theologians claim that this

                      that didn't stop Oolon Colluphid from making
                      a small fortune when he used it as the

                      'WELL THAT ABOUT WRAPS IT UP FOR GOD.'

         Arthur looks lost and confused. They approach a set of
         double doors. He stops. The Guard shoves him forward.

                      throw us out into space.

                              ARTHUR
                      And if we're unlucky?

         Off Ford's apprehensive look we CUT TO...

27       INT. VOGON CONSTRUCTOR BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                        27

         Arthur and Ford are strapped against two concrete pillars
         with hundreds of elastic bands.

         A STRANGE AND LETHAL LOOKING DEVICE DESCENDS FROM THE
         CEILING. Looks like an instrument of torture. As the
         device descends, Jeltz fishes a JEWELED CRAB out of a
         gunky trough and smashes it with a hammer -- BLAM!

         Jeltz takes the device in his hand -- then blows in it.
         We hear FEEDBACK. It's a microphone (like ones used to
         introduce boxers). He taps it. This thing on? It is.
         He faces them, holds up a book entitled... "       " --
         smirks, then begins to read Vogon poetry.

                              JELTZ

                     Vogon poetry is widely accepted as the
                     third worst in the universe.

        Ford VIBRATES like he's having an epileptic seizure.
        Arthur just looks like he has a migraine.

                             GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
                     The second worst is that of the Azgoths of
                     Kria. During a recitation by their Poet
                     Master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem
                     "Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found
                     in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning," four
                     of his audience died of internal

                     Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by
                     gnawing one of his own legs off.

        Spasms wrack Ford's body.    He SCREAMS.     Arthur squints.

        Ford's entire body tenses, arches, then goes limp.
        Arthur lets out an audible sigh as the poem ends.

                             GUIDE VOICE
                     The absolute worst poetry was written by
                     Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Sussix.
                     It involved decaying swans. Luckily, it
                     was destroyed when the Earth was.

                                         JELTZ
                     So, Earthlings, I present you with a
                     simple choice. Either die in the vacuum
                     of space, or -- tell what you thought of
                     my poem.

        Ford is spent, can't say a word. Arthur looks up.

                             ARTHUR
                     Actually...I rather liked it.

        Jeltz looks surprised. Ford notices, whispers to Arthur.

                             FORD
                     Good tact. Run with it.

                             ARTHUR
                     Um...some of the words I didn't understand,
                     but I found the imagery quite effective.

                     (turning to the Guard)
                  Throw them off the ship.

        The guard grabs them, drags them out of the bridge.

                     from Betelgeuse and about to die of

        Ford and Arthur spin away from the ship, holding their

        A pair of arms and legs pop out of each sofa.

    2   INT. HEART OF GOLD. BRIDGE - NIGHT                             32

32a     CLOSE ON A MONITOR -- on which plays a news report.            32a

                          REPORTER (ON TV)
                  ...and of course, the top story is still
                  the sensational theft of the new
                  Improbability Drive prototype ship Heart of
                  Gold last week, stolen at the launch
                  ceremony by none other than Galactic
                  President Zaphod Beeblebrox.

                          ZAPHOD (ON TV)
                  So, in the name of the people and freedom
                  and, I dunno, democracy and stuff like
                  that, I hereby declare this ship
                  officially stolen!

        PULL BACK to reveal ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX, leaning toward the
        TV, watching with a very satisfied grin...

                          FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                  Three to one...two to one...

        Annoyed, he turns. There's a woman with red hair
        (TRILLIAN), her back to him, reading numbers off a
        console display and speaking into a microphone.

                          TRILLIAN
                     (into microphone)
                  Probability factor of one to one...we have
                  normality, I repeat we have normality.
                  Anything you still can't cope with is
                  therefore your own problem. Please relax.
                  You will be sent for soon.

                            ZAPHOD
                   Hey.   Do you mind?   I can't hear.

        TRILLIAN turns -- and we now recognize her as Tricia from
        the fancy dress party. Her hair is shorter and bright
        red. She looks amazing.

                           TRILLIAN
                   Can we put your ego aside for one moment?
                   Something important has happened.

                           ZAPHOD
                   If there's anything more important than my
                   ego on this ship, I want it caught and
                   shot now.

        He turns back to the TV and turns it up.

                           REPORTER (OK TV)
                   ...the question everyone seems to be
                   asking is, has the Big Z finally flipped?
                   We asked his private brain care
                   Specialist, Gag Halfrunt...

        The TV suddenly clicks off.    Zaphod spins.    Trillian's
        holding a remote.

                            ZAPHOD
                  Hey...

                          TRILLIAN
                  We have a couple of hitchhikers in our
                  receiving bay.

        His head jerks upwards. He quickly grabs it with his
        hands and shoves it back down.

                          TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                  I didn't pick them up. The ship did.

                            ZAPHOD
                  Huh?

                          TRILLIAN
                  When you engaged the Improbability Drive.

                          ZAPHOD
                  I didn't engage the drive.

                          TRILLIAN
                  We picked them up in sector ZZ9 Plural Z
                  Alpha -- where you picked me up.

                          ZAPHOD
                  That's impossible.

                            TRILLIAN
                  No.    Just very, very improbable.

                           ZAPHOD
                  I don't have time for this! We've got the
                  police of half the Galaxy after us and we
                  stop to pick up hitchhikers?! Okay, so
                  ten out of ten for style, but minus
                  several million for good thinking, eh?

        He reaches for a hi-tech gun on the wall.      She stops him.

                          TRILLIAN
                  Don't. I'll send Marvin. (calling)
                  Marvin!

        Zaphod rolls his eyes as a humanoid robot rises from its
        seat behind them. This is MARVIN. He trudges slump-
        shouldered toward Zaphod.

                          MARVIN
                  I think you ought to know I'm feeling very
                  depressed.

                          TRILLIAN
                  We have something to take your mind off
                  things.

                  It won't work, I have an exceptionally
                  large mind.

                          TRILLIAN
                  I know. Go down to the number two entry
                  bay and bring the two aliens up here.

                          MARVIN
                  Just that?

                          TRILLIAN
                  Yes.

                          MARVIN
                  I won't enjoy it.

                          ZAPHOD
                  She's not asking you to enjoy it. Just do
                  it will you?

                          MARVIN
                  All right. I'll do it.

        Marvin turns and trudges away. Then he turns again.

                          MARVIN (CONT'D)
                  I'm not getting you down at all am I?

                          TRILLIAN
                  No, no, Marvin, it's fine really. It's just
                  part of life.

                           MARVIN
                  Life.   Don't talk to me about life.

        Marvin trudges away. A door slides open for him and
        makes an audible, satisfied SIGH as it does.

34      INT. BRIDGE OF VOGON DESTROYER SHIP - NIGHT                 34

        A light blinks on a console. A VOGON CAPTAIN turns a
        dial, listens through his head set. He punches a few
        buttons. COMMANDER KWALTZ (green and walrusy like Jeltz)
        appears on the large monitor, sitting in his chair at
        Command Headquarters.

                             KWALTZ
                     Get me the vice-president.

        Approximately 15 Vogons sit around the table murmuring
        sporadically. A VOGON MESSENGER runs up, holding papers.
        Kwaltz takes them, signs, signs the next page -- and the
        next. He hands them back to the messengers (who has been
        jogging in place the whole time). He runs off. The
        VOGON CAPTAIN appears on the large screen before him.

        Arthur looks around and notices the room is gleaming
        white, hi-tech, brand new, plastic still on some stuff.

                              ARTHUR
                     Now this is more like my idea of a

        sigh -- "Hhhmmyaaaahhh". As they walk through...

                            MARVIN
                    I've brought the aliens.    Don't thank me
                    or anything.

         Zaphod spins around in his chair, holding a gun but
         sporting that same politically correct smile.

                              ZAPHOD
                    Freeze!

         Arthur and Ford throw their hands up.      Marvin doesn't.

                            MARVIN
                    Do you mean sit in a corner and rust or
                    just fall apart where I'm standing?

                           ZAPHOD
                   I wasn't talking to you.

                              FORD
                    Zaphod?

                              ZAPHOD
                    Ixxie?    It is you!   IXXIE!

         Zaphod gives Ford a big bear hug. He pulls away, then
         playfully punches Ford in the arm.

                            ZAPHOD (CONT'D)

                     Okay "Ford" -- you zarking frood.

        They embrace, tussle, punch arms. They bump into Arthur.

                              FORD
                     Oh, this is Arthur. Arthur, this is
                     Zaphod Beeblebrox. My cousin? Semi-half

                             ZAPHOD
                     He shares three of the same mothers as me.

        Before Arthur can explain, Trillian enters.

        Arthur is stunned silent. He goes to her, making sure she's
        really there. He's speechless. She smiles and gives him a
        friendly embrace.

                           ARTHUR
                      (completely bewildered)
                   I can't believe this...I've been
                   looking...and you're here? I went to get
                   wine and...

                           TRILLIAN
                   I know. And it was rude to just leave,
                   but I told you I wanted to get away, and
                   he had a spaceship parked outside, well,
                   honestly -- I assumed you were a sort of
                   stay-at-home-and-read-a book type.
                      (hopeful)
                   But you're here...

        Arthur smiles, then realizes with some regret...

                           ARTHUR
                   Actually -- I am that type. But...well
                   you do know what happened, don't you?

        Zaphod stops in between them, puts his arm around Arthur.

                           ZAPHOD
                   --Ford picked him up, they hitched a ride,
                   and here we all are. Now, enough small
                   talk, Trill. We're on the run, remember?
                   I stole a ship?

                           ARTHUR
                   We're having a bit of a chat if you don't
                   mind.

        Arthur SHOVES Zaphod's hand off his shoulder. Oddly,
        Zaphod reacts with a smile. And then -- his head shoots
        all the up way revealing a second head that lives
        somewhere under his chin.

                            ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                    You blew it with her, Earthman, so shut up
                    or I'll kick you in the gones!

                            FORD
                    There's the Zaphod I remember.

        Arthur recoils in horror, instinctively raises his fists.

        Zaphod wrestles with Head 2 while A THIRD ARM springs out
        of Zaphod's chest and PUNCHES ARTHUR in the jaw. Arthur
        buckles and hits the floor.

                            ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                    You should teach your pal a lesson, Ford.
                    He's a guest on my ship.

                    I thought you said you stole it.

         A KLAXON sounds. Red lights FLASH. Zaphod (Head 2)

         Trillian hurries to Arthur who nurses his jaw.

                     Do you have any idea how ridiculous this
                     is?

                            KWALTZ
                     I don't have ideas Mr. Vice President.     I
                     just do what I do.

        A VOGON MESSENGER runs up holding papers. Kwaltz takes
        them, signs one in two places, initials others, lifts the
        top sheet, removes the pink copy. Folds it.

        The Heart of Gold comes out of hyperspace and slows to
        cruising speed...alone. No Vogons in sight.

        Zaphod's Head 2 is still up, beaming.

                             ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                     Damn, I'm good.

        Hands slam Head 2 down.         Zaphod (Head 1) turns to Ford.

                             ZAPHOD
                     So -- you along for the ride or am I
                     dropping you somewhere?

                        (still wary of the two heads)
                     Depends. Where you going?

                             ZAPHOD
                     Into the pages of history, cousin.
                     And when you see what I'm about to show
                     you, you'll beg me to take you with us.

        WITH TRILLIAN -- who notices Arthur looking ill.

                             TRILLIAN
                     You okay?

                              ARTHUR

                     This way.

        She exits.    Arthur follows.       Zaphod steps back, blocking
        his way.

                              ZAPHOD
                     Hey, apeman. Earthman.      I'm sorry, what
                     was your name again?

                     Right.   No hard feelings, okay? And
                     sorry to hear about your planet, but don't
                     mention it to the girl because if you do

        He smiles broader.    Then Head 2 pops up and finishes...

                     I'll pull your spleen out through your

        Zaphod slams Head 2 back into place..then smiles again.
        Arthur furrows his brow and Zaphod and follows Trillian.

                     Two heads. Interesting choice.

                              ZAPHOD
                     Apparently you can't be President with a
                     whole brain.

                             FORD
                     So you carved it up?

                              ZAPHOD
                     Yes -- I think. And I think I did it in
                     such a way that it wouldn't be detected by
                     the Government screening tests -- or by
                     me. So, what's so secret that I can't let
                     anybody know I know it, not the Galactic
                     Government, not even myself? And the
                     answer is--
                        (thinking)
                     --I don't know. Obviously. But I put a
                     few things together and that's when I
                     realized I had this.

        CLOSE ON - the NUTRI-MATIC MACHINE. Brownish liquid
        flows into it a Martini glass, topped with dry-ice fog.

        Arthur removes the glass.    Sips.     Grimaces

                     I might have an aspirin.

        She unzips it. TWO MICE scurry out and scamper off, a

        The aisles are lined with Priest-Technicians. Ahead is
        DEEP THOUGHT - a huge Buddha-esque computer.

                  a sense of adventure, but mostly I think
                  it's for the fame and the money.

        He continues preparing the ship. Trillian consults the

                  sticks. Plus everyone thinks you're deep.

                     The Infinite Improbability Drive is a new
                     method of crossing vast interstellar
                     distances without all that tedious mucking
                     about in hyperspace. As soon as the drive
                     reaches Infinite Improbability, it passes
                     through every conceivable point in every
                     conceivable Universe almost simultaneously,
                     then selects the appropriate re-entry
                     point. The principle of generating small
                     amounts of finite improbability by hooking
                     the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub-
                     Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter

        A knitted version of Arthur, Trillian, Ford and Zaphod
        sit in chairs before the ships console.

                          KNITTED ZAPHOD
                     (clutching stomach)
                  Is this going to happen every time we hit
                  that button?

                          KNITTED TRILLIAN
                  Very probably, yes.

53      The air ripples. The 'knitted' crew flip back to their       53
        former selves. Arthur pukes into a trash bin and with a
        sick expression, looks up to the screen.

                          ARTHUR
                  Did it work? Are we there?

        Now Zaphod looks -- and he's elated.

                          ZAPHOD
                  Yes!...I think.     Computer?

                          EDDIE
                  Hi, fella!

        Head 2 suddenly springs up.

                          ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                  Can you please change that zarking
                  annoying voice!!?

                          TRILLIAN
                  Computer? What planet is that, please?

                          EDDIE
                  CHECKING!!

        On-hold Muzak plays. They all sit and listen for a few
        beats, then Arthur yelps...

                          ARTHUR
                  OW!!
                     (spinning around to Zaphod)
                  Did you just pluck a hair from my head?

                          ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                  Yeah, as if, apeman.

        Arthur suddenly feels something on his back, leaps out of
        the chair and brushes it off.

        The two mice land on the floor across the ship, then
        scurry away down a hallway. Before Arthur can react...

                             EDDIE
                     Thanks for waiting, everyone. I'm just
                     tickled pink to tell you we are currently
                     in orbit around the planet Viltvodle 6.

        PUSH IN ON ZAPHOD -- who's 2nd Head suddenly shoots up.

                             ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                     Humma Kavula!

54      INT. VOGON DESTROYER SHIP. BRIDGE - NIGHT                          54

        Vogon crew quickly enter data. A FLIGHT ENGINEER gets
        something on his screen, shows it to the Captain.

                             VOGON CAPTAIN
                     Sir, the Heart of Gold has just requested
                     permission to land on Viltvodle 6. Should
                     I pursue?

                             KWALTZ (ON MONITOR)
                     That is not a request to which I can
                     respond, captain. Should I pursue what?
                     Are you requesting hyperspace clearance so
                     that you may pursue the fugitive?

                             VOGON CAPTAIN
                     Yes, commander.

                             KWALTZ (ON MONITOR)
                     Then you must say that, captain -- in
                     request form.

                             VOGON CAPTAIN
                     Requesting hyperspace clearance to pursue
                     the fugitive, sir.

                             KWALTZ (ON MONITOR)
                     Thank you. Request acknowledged.   Await
                     response.

55      INT. VOGON HEADQUARTERS - CONTINUOUS                               55

                        (into microphone)
                     Bring me the request to pursue fugitive
                     forms.

        The war room is silent. We hear the sound of running
        above. The footsteps hurry all the way around, we hear a
        door open, running up more steps, along the corridor
        until and finally an exhausted Vogon Messenger bursts
        through the door holding a blue form. Questular shakes
        his head in disbelief as Kwaltz signs the request form.

                     This is ridiculous! What do you need, an
                     executive order? Fine. I order you. Stop
                     doing this! Go and get him!

                             KWALTZ
                     According to Subsection 94b, paragraph 2,
                     you're not authorized to make such an
                     order.

                             QUESTULAR
                     But I'm acting president!

                             KWALTZ
                     Then act like a president, and do nothing.

        Kwaltz continues to fill out the forms. Questular grabs
        a clump of his hair -- and pulls it out.

                                                            CUT TO:

56      EXT. VILTVODLE 6. SPACEPORT. - NIGHT                          56

        All we can see are the lights of the Heart of Gold's
        entry ramp cutting through a dense fog. Or is it fog?

        Zaphod's 2nd head is up as he comes down the ramp ahead
        of the other three.

                             ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                     Humma Kavula!

        BACK A FEW STEPS WITH ARTHUR, TRILLIAN AND FORD...

                             ARTHUR
                     Why does he keep saying that?

                             TRILLIAN
                     I don't know. I'm not used to seeing him
                     this way.

                             ARTHUR
                     You mean fully clothed?

        She stops, fires him a look.

                             ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     Sorry, but I can't for the life of me
                     figure out why you, the most brilliant
                     woman I have ever met, have ended up with
                     that half-witted, self-obsessed, vapid
                     politician! I mean, look at him!

        They squint through the fog at Zaphod, Head 2 out. His
        hands keep trying to get it down but the 3rd arm keeps
        whacking them away. He disappears into the fog.

                     Clearly unlike any guy I've ever met.
                        (back to Arthur)
                     Look, if you're going to pout your way
                     around space, then maybe you should just
                     go home.

                              ARTHUR
                     I can't. That's the whole point -- and
                     I've been trying to tell you...

                              FORD
                        (interrupting)
                     Hey, look what I found in the guide.

        He hands the guide to Trillian. She keeps walking.

                             FORD (CONT'D)
                     I wouldn't tell her if I were you.

                             ARTHUR
                     She deserves to know.

                              FORD
                     But if you tell her and she ends up with
                     you because you're literally the last guy
                     on Earth -- you'll always doubt her
                     intentions.

        Arthur considers this.      Nods.

                             FORD (CONT'D)
                     Got your towel?

                             ARTHUR
                     Do I need it?

                             FORD
                     Only always.

        Ford puts his towel to his mouth as they follow Trillian
        down the mist covered street. She's reading the guide.

                             GUIDE VOICE
                     In the beginning, the universe was created.
                     This made a lot of people very angry and
                     has been widely regarded as a bad move.

        Zaphod continues several steps ahead of them.

                     Many races believe that it was created by

                   of the time they call "The Coming of Great

        SLAM.   Zaphod's two arms shove his chin back down.

                   I'll handle this.

56a     EXT. SEEDY STREET-VILTVODLE                                   56a

        The others approach, watching Zaphod as he stops a
        passing an eight-armed alien creature, asks him
        something, oozing charm. The creature points down the
        street with 3 arms, then with 2 others hands him a pen
        and paper. Zaphod signs an autograph and moves on.

        The alien beams, then squirts three cans of aerosol under
        several arms. More mist rises. FOLLOW IT UP revealing:

57      A LARGE BUILDING -- a temple with two giant arches.           57

        The others follow. CAMERA TILTS UP and we see this
        building looks like a nose lying horizontally, the "giant
        arches" are the nostrils.

58      INT. ARKLESEIZURE TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS                         58

        Zaphod opens the huge doors inside the large
        nostril/arches. A rush of air blows the mist past Ford,
        Trillian and Arthur a few steps behind. They stop.

        A congregation of worshipers faces front where HUMMA KAVULA
        stands behind a podium. He's a humanoid wearing a white
        robe and night-vision sun glasses.

                           HUMMA KAVULA
                   The handkerchief is coming, beloveds. Are

        Instead of bowing, they all point their noses heavenward.
        Zaphod marches down the center aisle while Humma prays.

                        (shaking his head)
                     Humma Kavula was his opponent in the
                     election. Something happened during the
                     campaign. Zaphod never forgave him.

                             ARTHUR
                     What was it?

        Ford shrugs.    HUMMA looks up, sees Zaphod, smiles.

                             HUMMA KAVULA

        Humma's quarters are opulent. He sits behind his desk
        flanked by several ARMED BODY GUARDS. Ford, Arthur and
        Trillian keep a safe distance as Zaphod faces off with
        Humma who has the air of a cool news anchor man.

                 I don't think I do.

                         ZAPHOD
                 Oh, I think you think you don't, but we
                 both know -- you do.

                         HUMMA KAVULA
                 Elequent as always, Zaphod. Your ability
                 to communicate a clear thought never
                 ceases to amaze.

        Head 2 suddenly springs up -- to the surprise of all.

                         ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                 You called me stupid!

                         HUMKA KAVULA
                    (re: the heads)
                 Interesting. And I don't know what you're
                 talking about.

                         ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                 During the campaign, Humma -- you said I
                 was stupid.

                         HUMMA KAVULA
                 This Humma you speak of no longer exists.
                 He came here in his consolation position
                 as Ambassador to Gamma Z10 to squelch an
                 ideological threat to the system and
                 repented from his wicked ways. He now
                 goes by the holy name Tazelo the
                 Unceasingly Righteous, given to him by his
                 devoted followers.

                            ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                     I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CALL YOURSELF, YOU
                     RIGHTEOUS FREAK!! YOU STARTED THE RUMOR
                     THAT I'M STUPID AND YOU'RE GONNA PAY!!!

        The 3rd arm reaches for a gun in Zaphod's vest. The BODY
        GUARDS aim their weapons. One runs up and smacks Zaphod
        in the back of the head -- slamming Head 2 back in place.

                            ZAPHOD
                     Thank you.

        The 3rd arm disappears.      The gun falls.   A BODY GUARD
        picks it up.

        WITH ARTHUR, FORD AND TRILLIAN

                            ARTHUR
                     Why do I get the feeling he's going to get
                     us all killed?

                            FORD
                     Probably because it's very possible.    Just
                     don't save me, okay? We're even.

        Humma lays his palms on the table and lifts himself as if
        to stand - but there is nothing of him below the table
        line except for thirty, one inch metal legs, attached to
        the base of his torso. He glides towards Zaphod, the
        little legs extending to reach the floor as he reaches
        the end of the table.

                          HUMMA KAVULA
                  The election is ancient history, Zaphod,
                  but if memory serves -- you won, proving
                  that good looks and charm win over
                  brilliance and ability to govern.

        A guard drapes a white robes over Humma's shoulders - which
        he ties with a belt - hiding his peculiar undercarriage.

                          HUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D)
                  And incidently -- you are stupid.

        His head jerks up.   Zaphod stops it, paints on a smile.

                          ZAPHOD
                  That's really not the point.

                          HUMMA KAVULA
                  You haven't come halfway across the galaxy
                  to settle a campaign grudge. Why are you
                  here, Zaphod?

        Zaphod doesn't answer. Humma motions to a guard who
        grabs his arm, twists it -- hard.

                          ZAPHOD
                     (wincing)
                  I don't know. I was headed for Magrathea,
                  I ended up here.

        PUSH IN ON HUMMA -- who raises his hi-tech sun glasses.

                          HUMMA KAVULA
                  How very, very...
                     (knowingly)
                  ...improbable.

        He pulls the nose off his body guard, turns a key.    A
        secret safe door slides open from the mans' chest.

                          HUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D)
                  I kept a few souvenirs from my former
                  life. Ah, the heady days of space
                  piracy... so young, so foolish..,

        Another, smaller box rises from the chest cabinet. Inside
        we see glowing jewels, a skeleton hand, etc. Humma
        removes a PINK CUBE (like Zaphod's blue cube.)

                          HUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D)
                  I'll gladly give you the coordinates to
                  Magrathea...

        He holds up the pink cube revealing A SERIES OF
        COORDINATE NUMBERS on each side. Zaphod reaches for it.
        Humma takes it back...

                          HUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D)
                  ...provided you bring me something in

                             ZAPHOD
                   A gun?

                           HUMMA KAVULA
                   A very special gun. Designed by the
                   greatest computer ever invented, now
                   buried in the bowels of Magrathea.

                           ZAPHOD
                   Fine. I'll get your gun.    Just give me
                   the coordinates.

        Zaphod reaches out.    Humma pulls it back.

                           HUMMA KAVULA
                   And what will you give me to insure your
                   return?

                   My word as President.

                   Ha! I'd be better off with the dung of a

                           ZAPHOD
                   Okay, then I'll get you that.

                           HUMMA KAVULA
                   I need a hostage, something you hold dear.
                   Only what does Zaphod Beeblebrox treasure?

        ON ZAPHOD'S SECOND HEAD -- peeping out of the collar
        looking terrified.

        Humma smiles. Bingo. He signals the guards. They grab
        Zaphod who looks back to Trillian, offers a weak smile.

                                                      SMASH CUT TO:

        Zaphod's head hangs on the wall. Wires feed out of the
        neck into a huge machine.
        Beneath the head is a crude drawing of a body and the
        words "I'm with Stupid." An arrow points to Zaphod's
        Head 2 -- which is shouting...

                           ZAPHOD HEAD 2

                   You should quit while you're "a head"
                   Zaphod. No one has ever got passed the
                   Magrathean defence system alive.

        Humma laughs maniacally.

62      EXT. VILTVODLE 6. MAIN STREET - NIGHT                       62

        Zaphod, held aloft on Ford and Arthur's shoulders,
        staggers down the street toward the spaceport where the
        Heart of Gold is parked. His neck is wrapped with a
        blood-soaked bandage which looks like a scarlet ascot.

                           ARTHUR
                   Are we sure this is the right way?

                            FORD
                   Yes!   I think.   I don't know.   Maybe not.

                           ARTHUR
                   Yes, thank you for clearing that up.

        Ford looks puzzled at Arthur. Did I clear it up? A crowd
        has gathered. When they see Zaphod, they scream...

                           CROWD
                   Mr. President!...Zaphod, over here!...I
                   want to have your baby!, etc...

        Zaphod, still feeling the effects of whatever drugs he
        was given, dons a presidential smile and waves.

                           FORD
                   Back to the ship. Quickly.

        They quicken their pace when suddenly...

        FIFTY VOGON POLICE -- emerge from the mist.

                   Mr. President! We are here for your

        Zaphod, Ford, Trillian and Arthur freeze in their tracks.

         Zaphod sports a goofy smile. Arthur is scared to death.

                    Oh God, I really hate Thursdays.

                    Zaphod, what do we do?

                    He holds up two peace signs, a la Nixon.

                               ARTHUR
                    What?

                            FORD
                    I think that was his campaign slogan.

         Trillian finds a deodorant can, grabs it, gets an idea.

                            TRILLIAN
                    Alright, follow me.
               She aims the can at Zaphod's ear- Arthur's face registers
               the madness of the moment.

(62 cont) The police step backwards -- but the crowd takes a step       (62 cont)
          forward. A huddle of female ADMIRERS rush them, waving
          pens and paper as if the Beatles have arrived.

            Zaphod paints on a smile, breaks away from the others to
            go sign a few autographs.

            Shots are fired. The crowd SCREAMS and SCATTERS. Arthur

                      Tricia!

            Ford, with Zaphod in tow, shoves Arthur forward, using
            his towel to clear a path through the mist. They see the
            Heart of Gold ramp descending from the belly of the ship.

                               FORD
                       This way!

            Questular and Kwaltz watch the monitor as Vogon Police
            usher Trillian, in futuristic hand-cuffs, past the Vogon
            Captain who stands in the foreground on his ship.

                          Bring her to Vogsphere for processing,

            The captain nods.      The screen goes black.

                          They're coming here!? But they've only

            Ford and Arthur drag Zaphod into the bridge. On the
            front screen, they can see the Vogon ships flying away.

                                  ARTHUR

        Arthur lunges for a control. Zaphod woozily tries to
        stop him. There's a struggle, then Zaphod realizes...

                             ZAPHOD
                     Hey -- my third arm.   I had one, didn't I?

                     We have to go after her!

        The computer fires to life, BLEEPS and BLIPS. Only now
        it has an effete, effeminate, almost matriarchal voice.

                             EDDIE
                     Boys, please! Not so rough. You're
                     damaging my joystick.

        They all look at the source of the voice, confused.

                             FORD
                     Who is that?

                     Ghastly, isn't it? I was asked to change

                     emergency back-up.

                             EDDIE
                     How, if you want me to take you somewhere,
                     we're going to have to start using our
                     magic words, "please" and "thank you."

                             ARTHUR
                     Can you change it back?

                             MARVIN
                     I can -- but I won't enjoy it.

                             EDDIE
                     I'm wait-ing...

        Arthur sees the Vogon ships getting away. Desperate, he
        shoves_Zaphod out of_the_driver's seat. Zaphod hits the
        floor, considers protesting, lies down on the floor to
        sleep instead -- with a contented smile.

        Arthur sits. He looks very out of place in a seat
        normally reserved for the likes of Han Solo. He scans
        the console. Ford sits in the seat beside him.

                               ARTHUR

64a     DING. A chime sounds. A switch on the console                 64a
        ILLUMINATES. "MANUAL OVERRIDE." Arthur flips the switch.
        The cockpit is sealed in a glass ball and shoots upwards.

        little glass pod. It floats through space, then rear
        thrusters ignite and blast the ship forward.

        An aircraft steering wheel rises up between Arthur's
        legs. He grabs it, spinning out of control.

                             FORD
                     I think I should push this button.

        Ford pushes a big button.    AN ALARM SOUNDS!

         The ground is barren. A scintillatingly jeweled crab
         crawls out of a swamp and looks up at the sky. We hear
         the sound of the pod approaching (but hold on the crab)
         as EEEOOOO-KA-KFFFZZZ! The crab runs back into the
         swamp. PAN LEFT to see the pod rammed into the ground,
         steam rising. The door opens. The three emerge.

                              FORD

                    No.   It's Magrathea!   I know it!

         Ford reaches in his satchel, pulls out a sort of
         ELECTRONIC BERET, pulls it snugly onto Zaphod's head.

                    Little something I learned about on an

        A TELESCOPIC ROD WITH A PADDLE AT THE TOP shoots out of

                     Nothing.

        Arthur leaps back. Looks down. Nothing. Nothing at all.

                  ideas or theories -- nothing.

        A beat. They all strain to think of nothing.     Several
        paddles shoot up. Smacking them.

                         ARTHUR
                  I can't, help it!    Trillian is in there
                  somewhere and we need an idea to save her.

                          ZAPHOD
                  I have an idea. (SMACK!) Run!

                          FORD
                  Ever the politician.

        They take off running. A forest of paddle stalks erupts
        out of the ground around them, smacking violently.

        They come to rest at the side of a Vogon building.

                          ARTHUR
                  Okay, so...

         The front doors BURST open. Arthur storms through them,
         holding Marvin's arm which has the fingers pointed like a
         gun. He trips, falls, drops the arm, picks it up again,
         trying hard to look tough. Ford and Zaphod follow, Zaphod
         wearing the Thinking Cap and sunglasses for disguise.
         Ford wearing his towel over his face like a bandit.

         The Vogons look up, nonplussed.

         Arthur looks at the arm -- then slowly lowers it.

                              ARTHUR
                      Actually, we're looking for...

        He raises Marvin's arm, pointing the fingers.

            Trillian sits at the Officer's desk, arms folded, defiant.

                               TRILLIAN
                       I don't believe you. This is some sort of
                       trick. Zaphod wouldn't blow up a planet,
                       especially mine.

            Kwaltz now steps forward and extends a piece of paper.

                               KWALTZ
                       These are the orders.

            Trillian takes the paper, runs her finger down to the
            signature line where it reads "Love and kisses, Zaphod!"

                               TRILLIAN
                       Love and kisses...?

            She hands the paper back, swallowing emotion.

                               KWALTZ
                       Now -- according to Section 8, sub-section
                       34 dash A, the punishment for kidnapping
                       is a recitation of the classic poem, "Ode
                       to the Removal of Your Left Kidney."
                       Unless -- said kidnapping is of the

                       We thank you for your cooperation.

            A door is opened revealing a room with a large steel box.
            A huge, angry eye stares out of a tiny barred window.

            The box shakes like crazy. Trillian gulps.

            Zaphod is in line with Arthur and Ford.     He looks up to:

            A PRESIDENTIAL PHOTOGRAPH -- of himself, in suit and tie,
            smiling broadly. He lowers his thinking cap.

            Arthur steps up, followed by Ford and Zaphod who keeps
            his head low and bowed.

                               ARTHUR
                       Yes. Hi. We're here about getting a

            She holds out her hand. Arthur doesn't have a form.
            Annoyed, she points across the room to a wall that is
            nothing but shelves holding forms.

                  Right. Once I've filled it out can I
                  return to the front of the line, seeing as
                  I've already waited...

                              FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR
                  No.     Next!

        Arthur sighs, frustrated. All three of them walk to the
        shelves holding the forms. Arthur turns to Zaphod.

                           ARTHUR
                  Can't you do something?!     You're
                  President, aren't you?

                           ZAPHOD
                  You want me to make a speech, shake a
                  hand? That's what I do -- I think. It's
                  all a little fuzzy.

        Arthur angrily fills out the form.

        MOMENTS LATER--

        Arthur is back in line, having waited a long time. He
        finally gets to the window, hands the green form to the
        Vogon Processor. She types into her computer, then checks
        the screen.

                          FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR
                  This Prisoner is being detained for...
                     (reading)
                  Kidnapping the president. Not eligible for

                  appointment for a later date or take a
                  number and wait.

        Arthur's breathing quickens.     He can't take this.

                          ARTHUR
                  Alright, look.

                       sunglasses off Zaphod)
                  This is the President.

        She looks at Zaphod, then back to the large portrait of
        Zaphod, then back to Zaphod. She nods. Okay...

                              ARTHUR   (CONT'D)
                      He says the whole kidnapping thing was a
                      terrible misunderstanding, she didn't mean
                      anything by it and he's ordering you to
                      let her go.

            As she braces herself to be eaten by the monster.
            Suddenly, a couple of VOGON GUARDS enter and hand Kwaltz
            a blue piece of paper. He reviews it, then signs it.

                               KWALTZ
                       You're free to go.    Release her.

            The Vogon Guard pulls Trillian up and out of the box on a
            cable. The Bugblatter beast goes berserk.

                               QUESTULAR

                       He's here?! Zaphod is here!? Let's go
                       get him!

            But the Guard is already escorting Trillian out of the
            room. Kwaltz is completing paperwork.

            Kwaltz holds up a walrusy hand, one finger raised,
            silencing Questular while he continues. Questular sighs.

            We hear the Bugblatter beast weeping as the doors are
            closed on him.

                     "Love and kisses, Zaphod?"  I saw the

                     Honey, I'm President of the Galaxy. I
                     don't get a lot of time for reading.

                             TRILLIAN
                     An entire planet, Zaphod. My home. Gone.
                     All because you thought someone wanted
                     your autograph!

        She SLAPS him again, storms away, bursting out the door.

                             ZAPHOD
                     They framed me! It's routine for

        Trillian storms away from the building, enraged. She
        sees a one-armed Marvin standing by the glass pod. She
        heads for him. Arthur catches up to her.

         She storms ahead of him.     He stops.

                      What about coming here to rescue you?!
                      That was my brilliant idea!

          A paddle shoots up and slaps him in the face.

         Kwaltz and Questular, flanked by the Vogon police force,
         step out of the building just in time to see...

78       ...THE GLASS HEART OF GOLD POD soaring overhead.                   78

         They all watch as it disappears from sight.

                              KWALTZ
                      The President tests my patience. This

         Kwaltz sits in a desk, filling out a form.

         Questular holds two clumps of hair in each fist.

                              QUESTULAR

                      it's against the law.

         Questular fists tremble.     PLOP.   Out comes two large
         tufts of hair.

        The ship suddenly BLASTS forward. Their heads are
        slammed back into the seats as they VIBRATE VIOLENTLY.

                             FORD
                     WHAT'S HAPPENING, ZAPHOD?!   WHERE DID YOU

                             ZAPHOD
                     I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING!

        Arthur looks to the console and sees the two mice sliding
        across it, getting thrown across the ship. They continue
        to vibrate -- even more violently.

                             FORD
                     ARE YOU SURE WE REATTACHED THIS THING THE
                     RIGHT WAY?!

        Zaphod is all smiles, hanging on as if he were on a
        rollercoaster ride.

        Stars appear on the screen as they slow from hyperspace.

        Arthur steadies himself, turns to Trillian who's still
        staring forward, angry. She unbuckles her seat-belt and
        moves away from the console.

        A planet appears on screen.     Zaphod and Ford lean
        forward.

        TRILLIAN -- who stares out a portal window into the
        emptiness of space. A tear rolls down her cheek.

        Arthur steps up, isn't sure what to say.

                     Look, you're right. You deserved to know

        She turns and stares, wipes the tears away.     Can't speak.

                              ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     Right.   Anyway...I'm sorry.

                     we are currently in orbit at an altitude
                     of three hundred miles around the

        They all stare in awe as they move toward a planet which
        gets closer and closer. Suddenly, their faces are awash
        with light.

        Two suns rise behind the planet.     It's breathtaking.

                             ZAPHOD
                     The twin suns of Soulianis and Rahm...

        Marvin (both arms in tact) rises in the back, peers out.

                     It's rubbish.

                          No.   They're right behind us.

            He looks down, sees the IMPROBABILITY DRIVE BUTTON.

                                  ARTHUR
                          Look, why don't I just hit this thing?

                                   ZAPHOD
                          NO! We're here! No telling where it will
                          send us!

             The missiles turn and accelerate high into the sky. A
             second set of boosters kick in on the missiles as they
             soar back toward the H.O.G. --- much, much faster.

(85 cont) ON THE BRIDGE--                                                  (85 cont)

            They all stare at the approaching missiles. Arthur looks
            at the drive button. Screw it. He flips open the glass
            lid.
                               ZAPHOD
                       NO!

            Too late. ARTHUR HITS THE BUTTON.

            WOOMF! Light blasts through the bridge. Morphing
            madness!

            Empty for a moment. Then, the HEART OF GOLD reforms. A
            few beats later, a SPERM WHALE floats into frame followed
            by a BOWL OF PETUNIAS.

        It coalesces back into shape out of chaos. The safety
        dome rises revealing our heroes standing in the exact
        same place they were - dazed.

                           ZAPHOD
                   Um...where are we?

                           TRILLIAN
                   Exactly where we were, I think.

                           ZAPHOD
                   And the missiles?

                           FORD
                   Have apparently turned into a bowl of
                   petunias and a very surprised looking
                   whale.

        He points to the screen. The whale and petunias float by.

                           EDDIE

                   thousand, one hundred and twenty-eight to
                   one against.

        They all look to Arthur who shrugs. Zaphod nods his
        approval. Ford counts on his fingers -- are they even?

        He waves it off, gives Arthur a little salute and moves
        on. Trillian looks to Arthur and musters a smile.

                          ARTHUR
                  I could really use a cup of tea.

88      EXT. SPACE - NIGHT                                          88

        The H.O.G. arches away. The whale in mid-air, stops
        rising, starts falling.

                          GUIDE VOICE
                  It is important to note that suddenly, and
                  against all probability, a sperm whale had
                  been called into existence several miles
                  above the surface of an alien planet. And
                  since this is not a naturally tenable
                  position for a whale, this innocent
                  creature had very little time to come to
                  terms with its identity as a whale before
                  it then had to come to terms with suddenly
                  not being a whale any more. This is what
                  it thought as it fell.

        The camera moves around the whale as it falls.

                     ooh! This is an interesting sensation...

        ANGLE: From below. The whale is wriggling a bit.

                             WHALE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     Oh! This is an interesting sensation,

                     tingling sensation in ... well I suppose I'd
                     better start finding names for things if I
                     want to make any headway in what for the
                     sake of what I shall call an argument I
                     shall call the world, so let's call it my
                     stomach! Good. Ooooh! It's getting quite
                     strong now. And hey,what's this whistling
                     roaring sound going past what I'm suddenly
                     going to call my head? Perhaps I can call
                     that ... wind! Is that a good name? It'll
                     do. Perhaps I can give it a better name
                     later when I've found out what it's for!
                     It must be very important because there
                     certainly seems to be an awful lot of it.
                     Hey! What's this thing ... this ... let's call
                     it a tail - yeah! Tail!

        The whale thrashes its tail. Between the camera and the
        whale drops the bowl of petunias. It falls from sight.

                             WHALE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     Hey! I can really thrash it about pretty
                     good, can't I? Wow! Wow! Doesn't seem to
                     achieve much but I'll probably find out
                     what it's for later on. How. Have I built
                     up a coherent picture of things yet?
                     No. Never mind. Hey, this is really
                     exciting, so much to find out about, ao
                     much to look forward to, I'm quite dizzy
                     with anticipation ... Or is it the wind?
                     There really is an awful lot of that now,
                     isn't there?

        It's eye tries to look down. Camera pulls back from the
        whale, abandoning it ...

                             WHALE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     And hey! What's this thing coming

                     wide-sounding name like ... ow ... ound...round
                     ... ground! That's it, ground! I wonder if

                     Curiously, the only thing that went
                     through the mind of the bowl of petunias
                     as it fell was "Oh no, not again."

        We hear the petunia vase SHATTERING.

                             GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
                     Many have speculated that if we knew why
                     the bowl of petunias had thought that we
                     would know a lot more about the nature of
                     the Universe than we do now.

89      EXT. HEART OF GOLD. MAGRATHEA SURFACE - DAY                   89

        The gang stand by A HUGE CRATER (the H.O.G. parked in the
        b.g.) -- a large whale carcass sits in the middle of it --
        along with a few petunias. They all grimace.

        BEYOND THE CRATER -- they see a formation of large rocks,
        aligned in a circle. It's the only structure in sight.

        They walk toward it.

90      EXT. ROCK FORMATION - DAY                                     90

        Arthur walks behind the others, his head down.

                             FORD (O.S.)
                     Hey...this looks familiar.

        Arthur looks up, registers surprise.

        THE ROCK FORMATION -- looks like Stonehenge - only newer.
        The rocks letters carved into them that read "DESIGN
        DEPARTMENT" "SHOWROOM" "EXECUTIVE OFFICES" "TOILETS"

                             FORD (CONT'D}
                     Must be portal doors.

                             ARTHUR
                     You mean -- the hippies were right?

        In the middle of the circle sits a stone receptionist
        desk with a sign on it that says "OUT TO LUNCH."

        Zaphod heads for the "To Design Department" stone.
        Trillian and Ford follow.

        Zaphod feels around it, looking for a switch, a knob,
        anything. He must've hit something because the front of
        the stone suddenly slides open revealing a SWIRLING
        VORTEX THAT LOOKS LIKE A JET ENGINE.

                              ZAPHOD
                     Okay.   In we go.

                     We gotta pick one, right? If it's not the
                     right one, we come back and pick another.
                     No biggie.

                             ARTHUR
                     Yes -- big biggie. What if that's the
                     last door we ever step through? What if
                     it rips us into tiny little atomic
                     particle...thingies.

        Trillian, who hasn't said a word since leaving Vogsphere,
        covers her ears - trying to block them out

                             ZAPHOD
                     It's the right one.   I have a hunch.

                     Go with the hunch of a narcissist with
                     half a brain who's wearing a ridiculous
                     thinking cap!? Are you insane?!

                             ZAPHOD
                     Hey, I think I resent that.

                             ARTHUR
                     I don't care what you think you think...

        They all start arguing over each other. We focus on
        Trillian -- Anger and frustration building, she covers
        her ears -- then screams....

                     AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!

        And she takes off running for the door. Suicide? Bravery?

        They turn just in time to see her jump into the vortex.
        She YELPS as her body is bent in half, twisted like a
        rung mop, then sucked inside.

        Arthur is horrified, literally gasping for air.      Ford is
        semi-impressed. Zaphod, unfazed.

                             ZAPHOD
                     That's supposed to happen...I think.

        Ford shrugs, throws his towel around his neck like a
        scarf and dives through. Same thing. Bent, twisted...

        He runs after Ford, stops at the door, turns like he's
        about to board Air Force one, gives a salute, jumps in.

        Arthur finally gets his legs to move, steps up -- but
        hesitates at the threshold, paralyzed with fear, unable
        to take a step. Then -- FFSSSSH - the door seals shut.

                  No.    No!     NOOO!!!

        He bangs on the stone, slides his hand around like Zaphod
        did, desperately looking for a way to open it. He
        collapses and buries his head in his hands.

                          MARVIN
                  I told you this would all end in tears.

91      EXT. TEMPLE OF DEEP THOUGHT - MOMENTS LATER                   91

        Ford stands outside a stone doorway at the end of a
        cobblestone street. Zaphod's body falls to the ground
        next to him, untwists, unbends and snaps bolt upright
        beside them.

        Trillian is already heading down the street toward the
        Temple. Ford and Zaphod hurry to catch up to her.

92      EXT. ROCK FORMATION - DAY                                     92

        Arthur sits with his back against the stone, staring
        across the field at the beautiful double sunset. He looks
        over and sees THE TWO MICE FROM THE SHIP -- scurrying
        toward one of the giant stone doors. They slip through a
        crack beneath the stone. A FLASH OF LIGHT bursts through
        the crack. Arthur barely reacts, so drained of emotion.

                          ARTHUR
                  Life is full of paradoxes, isn't it?

                     I know. You keep going on about it.      It
                     sounds awful.

                             ARTHUR
                     Oh no, it's beautiful.    Or at least, it
                     was...

                             MARVIN
                     Did it have oceans?

                              ARTHUR
                     Yes.   Great wide rolling blue oceans.

                             MARVIN
                     Can't bear oceans.

        Arthur looks up at Marvin.

                             ARTHUR
                     So this is how it will all end, then? Me,
                     on a dead planet -- with a manically
                     depressed robot.

                             MARVIN
                     You think you've got problems? What are
                     you supposed to do if you are a manically
                     depressed robot? No, don't bother to
                     answer that, I'm fifty thousand times more
                     intelligent than you and even I don't know
                     the answer. It gives me a headache just
                     trying to think down to your level.

                             SLARTIBARTFAST    (0.S.)
                     Excuse me.

        Arthur spins to see AN OLD, BEARDED MAN IN LONG ROBES.

                             ARTHUR
                     Aah!

        He jumps, crab walks backwards away from the man.

                             ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     Who are you?

                             SLARTIBARTFAST
                     My name is not important.

        Arthur continues to scramble away from the man.

                             SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
                     You must come with me. Terrible events are
                     afoot. You must come or you'll be late.

                             ARTHUR
                     Late? What for?

                             SLARTIBARTFAST
                     What is your name, Earthman?

                            ARTHUR
                    Dent. Arthur Dent.

                              SLARTIBARTFAST
                    Late   as in "the late Dentarthurdent."
                    It's   a sort of threat you see. Never been
                    much   good at them myself, but I'm told
                    they   can be terribly effective.

        He motions to the stone that is marked "To Showroom."

                            SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
                    Your friends are safe. You can trust me.

                            ARTHUR
                    Trust a man who won't tell me his name?

                            SLARTIBARTFAST
                    My name? Very well...
                       (heaves a sigh, reluctant)
                    My name is...Slartibartfast.

        Arthur reacts with a furrowed brow.

                            SLARTIBARTFAST(CONT'D)
                    I said it wasn't important.

        Slartibartfast motions to the door.     He looks to Marvin.

                             MARVIN
                    I could calculate your chances of survival
                    -- but you won't like it.

        Arthur rises, cautiously moves over to Slarti's side.

                            SLARTIBARTFAST
                    I must warn you. We are about to pass
                    through, well, a sort of gateway thing. It
                    may disturb you. It scares the willies out
                    of me.

        He puts his hand on a certain spot in the stone and
        presses. The stone dissolves revealing once again the
        jet engine swirling vortex. Slarti motions -- after you.

        Arthur takes a deep breath -- and steps in.

                              ARTHUR
                    Whaa!

        He is bent, twisted and sucked away.     Slarti follows.

        Marvin stands for a moment, then looks up to...

92a     THE SKY--                                                       92a

        where the fleet of Vogon ships has now arrived.

                            MARVIN
                    Funny how just when you think life can't
                    possibly get any worse, it suddenly does.

        Kwaltz sits in his chair as they press forward. The
        GHOSTLY IMAGE of the recorded message appears.

                           GHOSTLY IMAGE
                   This is a recorded announcement as we're
                   all out at the moment. The Commercial
                   council of Magrathea thanks you for...

94      INT. MAGRATHEA/PLANET SHOWROOM - DAY                          94

        Arthur is hunched over a litter bin, barfing.

                           SLARTIBARTFAST
                   I told you you might find it a bit
                   disturbing.

                           ARTHUR
                   I have found this whole day a bit
                   disturbing.

        Arthur realizes he has his towel with him. He wipes his
        mouth with it, dabs his brow. Then he notices...

        ...THE ROOM -- which is like a car dealer's showroom only
        instead of cars there are models of various planets.

                           SLARTIBARTFAST
                   Did you know we built planets?

        No.   Arthur didn't know that.   He looks perplexed.

                           SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
                   Fascinating trade. Doing the coastlines
                   was always my favorite. Used to have
                   endless fun doing all the little fiddly
                   bits round fjords. But the Galactic
                   economy collapsed, and seeing that custom-
                   built planets are something of a luxury
                   commodity...
                        (getting back on subject)
                   At any rate, there's been a terrible mix
                   up with your planet. You must come with me
                   or it's all going to blow up in our faces.
                   The best laid plans of mice, you know...

                           ARTHUR
                   ...and men.

                           SLARTIBARTFAST
                   Mmmm? What?

                     it.

        Arthur looks confused.     Slarti motions him to a door.

95      Arthur readies his towel at his mouth as Slarti hits a        95
        button. The door slides open and nothing happens. It's
        just a door that leads to a room where several TRANSPORT
        CARTS move past -- like a kids ride at Disneyland. They
        step into one. Slarti closes the little door. The cart
        MOVES through a curtain, out into DEEP SPACE.

        PULL BACK - till the cart is no more than a speck being
        pushed forward by the longest telescoping arm in history.

        The space is millions of miles across. Floating in it are
        half-finished planets, construction gantries around them.

        Ford, Zaphod and Trillian enter the dimly lit temple.
        They hear a faint, tinny sound. They follow it.

        FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR...

        The sound gets louder. Tinny music. And laughter...
        Flickering light illuminates the end of the corridor.

                             ZAPHOD
                     This is it!

        He quickens his pace. Trillian and Ford follow.      They
        round the corner to find...

        DEEP THOUGHT -- sitting there majestically.     The TINNY
        MUSIC emanates from somewhere near him.

        Zaphod takes another step in and now sees the source of
        the TINNY MUSIC.

        Deep Thought is watching TV.     A violent, stupid cartoon.

                             ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                     Deep Thought...!

                     Shhh.   This is a good bit.

        The cartoon continues. Zaphod enters, removes his
        thinking cap and reverently approaches. He kneels...

        Zaphod holds a smile but his world is slowly crumbling.

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     I designed another computer to perform
                     that great task.

                             ZAPHOD

                     Not here. Another world.

                             ZAPHOD
                     It's on another world?

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     It is another world. Or was.

                              ZAPHOD
                     Where?

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     Ask your companion.

        Zaphod turns to Ford.     Ford looks confused.

                             DEEP THOUGHT (CONT'D)
                     Not him.

        Zaphod looks to Trillian. She looks equally confused.
        Zaphod puts the thinking cap back on. Strains hard.

                             ZAPHOD

        A robotic arm reaches out and turns up the volume.

        Zaphod stands, turns to Ford and Trillian, smiles that
        smile -- but it's starting to look a bit crazed.

                  Great. This is just great. Let's go find
                  something else for my entire life to be
                  about.

        He starts to march off.    Ford grabs his arm.

                          FORD
                  Zaphod. The gun? The one Humma sent us
                  for? We have to get it. You gave the guy
                  your head.

                            ZAPHOD
                  I know.    Why did I do that?

        He pulls his thinking cap down -- all the way over his

        Before he finishes the sentence, a PANEL in the wall
        slides open revealing a LARGE, SCARY LOOKING GUN. A
        robotic arm pushes it forward.

        Ford goes over, takes it, carries it like it's
        nitroglycerin to Zaphod who's already walking away,

        Ford hands Zaphod the gun.

                             FORD (CONT'D)
                  Here.     Take it. I don't do guns.

        Zaphod takes it with a smile...

                          ZAPHOD
                  Thank you.

        ...and instantly points it at his head. Ford lunges for
        it. There's a struggle. Ford's trying to get Zaphod's
        finger off the trigger when CLICK! The trigger is
        pulled. Ford winces. But apparently, nothing has
        happened.

                            ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                  Great!    This is a bust, too!

                  Hey, man, you must be really frustrated.
                  To go through all you did only to come
                  here and get no answer, which means no
                  fame and money, and you deserve that, man.
                  Because you're great -- you're just
                  really, really great.

        Zaphod isn't sure what just happened. But he smiles
        anyway. Trillian, however, is onto something.

                         TRILLIAN
                  Give me that thing.

        The transport cart moves past two half-finished planets
        and on toward a 3rd planet. Construction gantries and
        clouds obscure our view.

                  The galaxy was a bit of a shambles, you
                  see. Everyone enjoying themselves being
                  singers and comedians and really creative
                  and interesting things like that. No one
                  doing the boring jobs.

                          ARTHUR

                  In spades. So a species was genetically
                  engineered to do the boring jobs. Tax
                  inspectors, traffic wardens, government
                  officials. We were commissioned to build
                  a special planet for them.
                  Problem was, some cleverdick made it so
                  any time one of the creatures had an
                  interesting idea it would get a hefty
                  smack around the face.

                  What? You did that? I've been there!

        The cart lowers down toward the surface of the planet.

         THE VOGON SHIPS -- descending from space. The missiles

                   ...and you're right, I shouldn't be so

                   just go on with it, right?

         PULL BACK TO REVEAL -- Ford is hesitantly aiming the gun
         at Zaphod.

                           TRILLIAN
                   Shoot him again.

         Ford reluctantly pulls the trigger.    CLICK.

                  Hitchhiking is good.    Towels are good,

                            FORD
                  Yeah.    I kinda like this.

         She take the gun from him.

                          TRILLIAN
                  A gun that makes people suddenly see
                  things from your point of view. Useful

                  convert the masses, eh?

         She starts walking.

                          TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                  We should get back. Arthur's waiting.

                   Why so edgy?

         She can't believe he's asking this.     She aims the gun,

                           ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                   Of course you're edgy, your planet's been

                   the Galaxy with the guy who signed the
                   order

         CLICK.   She shoots him again.

                           ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                   You actually wanted to know the Question
                   because you always thought there was more
                   to life, and now you're crushed because
                   you find out there really isn't.

         She's getting angrier and more hurt.     CLICK.

                              ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                      You've got no home, no family, no one to
                      be with -- and you're stuck with me,
                      another in a long line of men who doesn't
                      appreciate you because he's too busy
                      appreciating himself.

         Hearing this puts a lump in her throat, causes her eyes
         to well with tears. She lowers the gun.

         Zaphod shakes his head -- the effect wearing off.       But he
         realizes what he said and doesn't like it.

                              ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                      Give me that thing.

         He grabs the gun, points it at her.

                              TRILLIAN
                      Won't affect me.   I'm already a woman.

         Before he can react, A BRIGHT LIGHT SHINES BEHIND THEM.
         They turn, shielding their eyes.

                              ZAPHOD

                    So -- it wasn't destroyed?

                            SLARTIBARTFAST
                    Actually, it was. This is a back-up.
                    Earth Mark II.

                            ARTHUR
                    So you're saying you ... made the Earth?

                            SLARTIBARTFAST
                    Well, not me alone. It was a group
                    effort. I did my part, though. Ever heard
                    of a place, I think it's called Norway?

          Ayers Rock. A GUY ON A LADDER is painting it it's
          familiar red color. Some of it is still primer grey.

                            SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
                    That was one of mine. Won an award you
                    know. Lovely crinkly edges. I was sorry
                    to hear about it being blown up. Shocking

                    Mice?    Who cares about bloody mice?

                            SLARTIBARTFAST
                    Are you a fan of plate tectonics?

101d      JUMP CUT. They move through a forest where a man presses    101d
          a lever making several MUSHROOMS pop up on the ground.

                            SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
                    Earthman, you must realize that the planet
                    you lived on was commissioned, paid for,
                    and run by mice. It was destroyed shortly
                    before the completion of the purpose for
                    which it was built. Ten minutes later, we
                    would have been free and clear. But we
                    gave them our standard ten million year
                    warranty and they have come here to
                    retrieve this back-up copy. And they've
                    brought you with them.

                       been a front. They were experimenting on

                       experiments so they could prod your

                       Thought designed the Earth...which was a

                       Vogons destroyed it ten minutes before the

                       That's bureaucracy for you.

                               ARTHUR
                       Actually, this explains a lot. All my
                       life I've had this strange feeling that

                               SLARTIBARTFAST
                       That's just perfectly normal paranoia.

                              SLARTIBARTFAST
                      I don't know, perhaps I'm old and tired,
                      but I always think that the chances of
                      finding out what's really going on are so
                      absurdly remote that the only thing to do
                      is say hang the sense of it and keep
                      yourself busy. I'd much rather be happy
                      than right any day.

                              ARTHUR
                      And are you?

                              SLARTIBARTFAST
                      No. That's where it all falls down of
                      course.
                         (slowing the platform)
                      Here we are, then.

l03      The platform slows to a stop.      Arthur steps out and is     103
         stunned to see...

         HIS HOUSE. It's partially constructed. The chimney lies
         intact on the ground, waiting to be hoisted up. A row of
         hedges lies on it's side beside a trench. But it's his
         house alright.

                              ARTHUR
                      Is this...?

         Slartibartfast nods.      Arthur, in a daze, stumbles toward
         the house.

103a     INT. ARTHUR DENT'S HOUSE/MARK 2 - CONTINUOUS                   103a

         Arthur enters his house. There is no furniture, no
         photographs or books or any evidence of his existence
         there. He feels the walls, the countertops. He's home?

                                TRILLIAN (O.S.)
                      Arthur!

         Arthur pokes his head around a wall to find...

104      FORD, ZAPHOD AND TRILLIAN -- sitting at an elegantly set       104
         table -- stuffing their faces with a meal fit for a king.

103a     INT. ARTHUR DENT'S HOUSE/MARK 2 -                              103a

                              ARTHUR
                      What -- what are you doing? What happened
                      to you?

         They talk while continuing to stuff food in their mouths.

                              FORD
                      Funniest thing. (chew, chew) Our hosts
                      attacked us with Dismodulating Anti Phase
                      Stun Mist (chew, chew) then brought us to
                      this amazing meal as a way to make it up
                      to us (chew, chew). Try the mutton. It's
                      fantastic.

                         (mouth full)
                       Zarking incredible.

          They can't seem to stop eating, like they've been
          drugged.

                               ARTHUR
                       Hosts attack you --? And then you sit
                       down for -- is that tea?

          Arthur has spotted a TEA POT on the table. He hurries to
          it, feels it. Warm. He pours a cup, takes a sip,
          Closes his eyes, enjoying it.

                               ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                       Now that's a cup of tea.

                               FRANKY MOUSE (O.S.)
                       We're glad you like it, Earth creature.

          He looks down and sees THE TWO WHITE MICE sitting on a
          silver platter.

                               BENJY MOUSE
                       After ten million years on Earth, and a
                       rather large chunk of that time in
                       England, it would be utterly humiliating
                       if we didn't know how to make a decent pot
                       of tea.

          Arthur stares in shock...can't speak.

                               TRILLIAN
                       Arthur, these are our hosts. Benjy mouse
                       and Franky mouse (chew, chew).
                       They control a large sector of the
                       Universe in our dimension (chew, chew).
                       I'm sorry, I thought you were told about
                       the mice...

                                ARTHUR
                       Yes. Yes, I was. I just wasn't quite
                       prepared for the full reality of it.

          He steadies himself on the table.

                               BENJY MOUSE
                       Sit, Earthman. Eat.

          Benjy pushes his hand through the air, the chair at the
          end slides backward.

                               ARTHUR
                       In a moment, perhaps.   I can't seem to let
                       go of this table.

          Slartibartfast steps forward.

                    Pardon the interruption, but I'll just be
                    getting back to work now.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    That won't be necessary, Slartibartfast.

                            ZAPHOD
                       (cracking up, like he's stoned)
                    Smarty fart blast?

                             BENJY/FRANKY
                    Eat!

                             ZAPHOD
                    Right.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    It looks like we won't be needing the new
                    Earth after all, now that we've found the
                    only living native of the planet.

                            SLARTIBARTFAST
                    But...they've nearly finished the oceans.

                            FRAHKY MOUSE
                    That will be all, Slartibartfast.

          Slarti, slightly hurt, backs away out of sight.

                            ARTHUR
                    I'm sorry, when you say "the only living
                    native" -- do you mean me? What about
                    her?

          Benjy holds up a strand of hairs, same color as Trillian's.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    We performed some rudimentary DNA tests on
                    the ship. She's half-native. Her real
                    father was a Blahardid, the hyper-
                    intelligent yet carelessly nomadic race
                    native to the planet Olbed, who apparently
                    popped in to Earth for a one-nighter with
                    a one Ms. Francis McMillan.

                            TRILLIAN
                       (looking up, mouth full)
                    Which explains a lot.

          She goes back to eating.    Arthur is taking this all in.

                            ARTHUR
                    So -- mostly harmless and me.    That's it.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    We're sorry to have stage managed you so
                    shamelessly, but once we learned you were
                    the only full-blooded Earthling in the

                    We've spent a considerable amount of time
                    on your planet trying to find this
                    wretched Ultimate Question, and the
                    thought of doing it all over again on
                    account of those idiotic Vogons sickens me
                    to no end. Which is why you're here.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    Sit, Earthling. Sit.

          Arthur goes to pull out the chair beside him.

                            BENJY/FRANKY
                    NOT THERE!

          Arthur jumps. The others look up.      Benjy and Franky
          cover their outburst with a smile.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    This chair is much more -- comfortable.

          Benjy makes a motion. The chair he pushed out before
          slides over behind Arthur's knees, making him sit.

                              BENJY MOUSE (CONT'D)
                    Drink.

          He slides the cup of tea over.     Arthur takes a sip.

                              ARTHUR
                    Mmmm.    This really is delicious.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    Good. Glad you like it.      Now -- to
                    business.

          Ford and Zaphod raise their glasses like drunken sailors.

                            FORD/ZAPHOD
                    To business!

          Benjy and Franky fire them a look.

                              ZAPHOD
                    Sorry.    Thought you were proposing a
                    toast.

                              BENJY/FRANKY
                    EAT!

          Ford and Zaphod eat. Benjy turns to Arthur. Smiles. No
          one notices, through the window, a row of Vogons cresting
          the hill.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    About this Ultimate Question. You see,
                    we've been offered a quite enormously fat
                    contract to do the 5D TV chat show and

                            FRANKY MOUSE
                    But - and here's the point - we have to
                    have product. Which means we still need
                    an ultimate question.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    Or at least, one that sounds ultimate.

                               FRANKY HOUSE
                    Yes.     Got to sound good.

                            ARTHUR
                    An Ultimate Question that sounds good...
                    From a couple of mice...for a chat show.

                            FRANKY MOUSE
                    And as it turns out, the chances are
                    astronomically high that the structure of
                    the question is encoded in your brain.
                    Which is why we need it. More tea?

          Franky tries to pour more tea. Arthur stops drinking, a
          little woozy. Did he hear them right?

                            ARTHUR
                    I'm sorry -- did you just say you need my

                               BENJY MOUSE
                    Yes.     To extract the question.

                            ARTHUR
                    You can't have my brain. I'm using it.

                               FRANKY MOUSE
                    Barely.

                             BENJY MOUSE
                     We can replace it if you think it's
                     important. An electronic brain maybe.

                             FRANKY MOUSE
                     A simple one should suffice. Who would
                     know the difference?

                             ARTHUR
                     I would!

                             FRANKY MOUSE
                     No, you wouldn't. We could program you not
                     to.

          Arthur tries to get up. Clamps spring up from the chair
          and wrap around his arms. A dome flips over from the
          back and slams down on his head. Arthur struggles.

          The platter the mice are standing on rises up, moves toward
          Arthur, ominous surgical instruments spring from it.

                    Don't worry. You won't feel a thing.

          The mice on the platter move ominously toward Arthur.
          Arthur, still attached to the chair, backs away.

          Scythes and rotating arms with circular saw blades shoot
          out -- ominous surgical equipment to remove his brain.

                             ARTHUR
                    Wait a minute, JUST WAIT A SODDING
                    MINUTE!!

          The scythes and arms stop spinning. Arthur stumbles
          backwards and sits down in the chair. The others stop
          eating and listen.

                            ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                    You want the question that goes with the
                    answer "42" How about "What's six times
                    seven?" Or "How many Vogons does it take
                    to screw in a lightbulb?" Or here's one,
                    "How many roads must a man walk down?"

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    Hey, that's not bad.

          Through the opposite window (in much the same way
          bulldozers arrived in the opening) we see more Vogons
          arriving.

                            ARTHUR
                    Fine. Take it. There's plenty more where
                    that came from because my head is filled,
                    with questions, and I can assure you mate,
                    no answer to any of them has ever brought
                    me one iota of happiness. Confusion? Yes.
                    Indecision? Loads. But happiness...?

          He shakes his head.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    We don't want to be happy.   We want to be
                    rich.

                            FRANKY MOUSE
                    Take his brain.

          Benjy steers the platter toward Arthur. He jerks his
          arms up. They break free of the shackles and hit the
          platter. The mice fly through the air and land on the
          table -- right beside the POV gun. They scramble to
          their feet.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    Shoot him!!

          They try to lift the POV gun but it's way too heavy.

          Arthur, his butt still strapped in the chair, leaps over
          to the table and grabs the first thing he sees -- a leg
          of mutton. He raises it high. Benjy and Franky look up.

                            FRANKY MOUSE
                    Oh, shit.

          Arthur brings the mutton down, squashing them flat.

          The others instantly snap out of their food induced haze,
          Zaphod suddenly clutches his gut.

                            ZAPHOD
                    Ohhhh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

          Arthur looks up and now he sees the Vogons marching down
          the hill toward the house. He leans over the table,
          bumping his teacup. IT SHATTERS TO THE GROUND.

105       ON THE HILL JUST BEYOND --                                   105

          An ARMY OF VOGON POLICE march over it.    Amongst them...

          MARVIN -- marches as well, a gun held to his head.

                            MARVIN
                       (to the Vogon)
                    I must warn you, I'm feeling very
                    depressed.

                            KWALTZ
                    Mr. President!     We are here for your
                    protection!

          Zaphod appears at the front door and waves Presidentially.

                            ZAPHOD
                    Thank you!

106       The Police open fire. Zaphod and the others flee as the      106
          barrage of fire continues. Trillian drops the POV gun,
          goes back for it. Arthur stops her and pulls her behind
          the truck. Marvin catches a bullet in the back of his
          head - sparks fly and he is thrown forwards! Is he dead?

          BEHIND THE TRUCK --

          FORD looks at MARVIN lying face down in the dirt - his
          head emitting smoke.

                               FORD
                      Okay -- that thing I said about not saving
                      my life because we're even? Scratch that.
                      Save at will.

                               TRILLIAN
                      We need that gun.

                               ZAPHOD
                         (campaign sound-byte)
                      We need tighter gun control!

                               FORD
                      We need his other head.
                         (an idea)
                      Okay -- I'll create a distraction.

         He holds up his towel.

                               ARTHUR
                          (sarcastic)
                      Brilliant plan. I'm certain it will work.

                               FORD
                          (squinting at Arthur)
                      You know -- I think sometimes you say
                      things that mean something other than what
                      you're actually saying.

         More gunfire erupts. Ford spins his towel until it's
         twisted and taught. He leaps up and runs towards...

107      ...THE VOGON POLICE FORCE -- who see him coming, his            107
         towel held like he's going to whip someone on the ass.

                              FORD (CONT'D)
                      AHHHHHHHH!!!!

         The Vogons are so caught off guard, they back away.

                              TRILLIAN
                      Now!

108      She and Arthur both run out toward the gun.                     108

                    ARTHUR                        TRILLIAN
         I thought I was...what are       I thought I was...I'll get
         you... get back... okay          it... you already... fine,
         fine...                          fine

         They each grab the gun just as Questular realizes...

                              QUESTULAR
                      It's a towel! It's only a TOWEL!!     GET
                      HIM!!

         The Police stop their retreat, raise their guns, move
         forward. Ford skids to a stop and runs back toward
         Arthur and Trillian, both clinging to the gun, running
         back toward the truck. GUNFIRE ERUPTS. A and T TRIP.
         The POV gun goes flying and lands in... MARVIN'S ARMS.

         The Vogon Police run in formation toward the gang.       Ford
         looks back, sees the Vogons approaching. He looks
         forward, sees Marvin raising the gun.

                                FORD
                      Duck!

                                ZAPHOD
                      Where?

         He looks to the skies just as Ford fans out his towel and
         uses it to bring Z, A & T to the ground just as...

         MARVIN FIRES THE POV GUN,

         Questular ducks. CLICK. The entire Vogon Police force is
         hit. They instantly stop. Their shoulders slump.

                           VOGON POLICE FORCE
                      (in unison)
                      Oh what's the point?

         They turn their weapons on themselves and...

         ANGLE ON FORD, ZAPHOD, ARTHUR AND TRILLIAN -- turning
         their heads as we hear the weapons fire. They look up.

108a     All the Vogon Police lie motionless on the ground                108a
         including Kwaltz. Questular is the last man standing.

         He marches toward them, patches of clump baldness on his
         head. He drops to his knees.

                              QUESTULAR
                      Shoot me. Please Zaphod. Shoot me.

         Zaphod takes the gun, fires it at Questular.       He rises --
         and paints on a big smile.

                              QUESTULAR (CONT'D}
                      What am I so pissed off about? I'm great?
                      I'm zarking incredible! Everyone loves
                      me! WHOOO HOOO!!! Look at me...etc.

         Questular runs towards a lake/blow hole, takes off his
         clothes and jumps in.

                                ZAPHOD
                      Marvin.    You saved our lives.

                                MARVIN
                      I know.    Wretched, isn't it?

                              QUESTULAR
                      (distant) Oh man! I love being me!!

         They share a laugh.      Arthur approaches Slartibartfast.

                              ARTHUR
                      Thank you.

                       I've just been informed by some of the
                       lads that since we're so near completion,
                       we're going to go ahead and finish Earth.
                       We can put it back exactly the way it was
                       when you left, you know -- unless there's
                       anything you'd like to change. Something
                       you think your planet could do without?

          Arthur thinks about it...looks around...slowly nods...

                                ARTHUR
                       Yes.   Me.

          He looks to Trillian who raises an eyebrow.    Really?
          She smiles.

                               TRILLIAN
                       Let's go somewhere.

                               ARTHUR
                       Yes, You name it. I'll go.

                               ZAPHOD
                       I'm going to Humma's. He has my head...I
                       think. Doesn't he? I'm so confused.

                               FORD
                       And I'm hungry. After we get your head
                       let's grab a bite. I know this great
                       restaurant at the end of the universe.

          As they walk away, we CUT TO...

109       SLARTI'S FACTORY ELEVATOR -- where they all board.           109

                               SLARTIBARTFAST
                       Okay. Hold tight.

          Everyone grabs the rail, except for Trillian who holds on
          to Arthur. SSSSSSHHHHHHHHHVUMP! Up into the sky they go.
