          hush falls, and the JUDGE comes out: ORTON POWELL, 60...

          indispensable witness. A Mr. Green.
          With emphasis. A look goes between the Judge and Mick.

          How much time do you need? Would a
          week be enough?

                         MICK
          And so does Judge Powell. He spent
          a lot of years as a defense lawyer,
          so he knows all about having to
          chase "Mr. Green," and he doesn't
          look kindly on defendants who don't
          pay their attorneys. Now do you get

          It's a supermax prison where they
          send violent sex offenders. You'll
          fit in real good in your loafers.

          What's the matter?

          You lied to me, Louis. I'm about to
          go and see the new prosecutor,
          who's doing everything he can to
          put you away, and now I find out
          you've been lying.
          (before Louis can deny)
          Tell me about Reggie Campo.

                         LOUIS
          What about her? I've told you--

                         MICK
          You didn't tell me. That you were
          going to pay her for sex.
          (off Louis's surprise)
          You think it's hard to find out
          somebody's not Snow White?

          Alright yes, I was going to pay.
          She wrote down a price on the
          napkin, four hundred dollars...

          Cecil's office?

                         LOUIS
          I didn't want my mother to know.
          Cecil tells her everything. And can
          we keep it down? Her office is on
          the other side of that door...

          Alright I will. You know that guy
          on the Venice boardwalk? The one
          who has all those plates spinning
          on sticks?

          What does this have to do with--

                         MICK
          Just listen. A bunch of spinning
          plates: that's the state's case. In
          the middle is a big one. It's a
          fucking platter. And if that falls
          it takes the others down with it.
          (He gets closer to Louis)
          The big plate is the victim. The
          only witness against you. I knock
          her down, the act is over and the
          crowd goes home. No trial.
          Mick has Louis' attention now.

                         LOUIS
          You can make this trial go away?

                         MICK
          We've lost time. You concealed from
          me the fact that could do it. It
          comes down to why.

                         LOUIS
          Why what?

                         MICK
          Why would a guy with a Porsche and
          a Rolex need a knife to get sex
          from a woman who sells it anyway?
          The answer is, he wouldn't. And
          when you see that you see the set-
          up, the trap. And suddenly it's the
          defendant who looks like the
          victim.

          Yes. Young hot-shot named Ted
          Minton. He wants to give me the
          discovery file. Poor guy doesn't
          know that Raul already got it. He's
          new to felonies but he's no dope.
          When he hears his vic's a hooker
          he'll know we've knocked all his
          plates down.

          No promises, Louis.
          Louis closes his eyes, savors the prospect. Then sees Mick to
          the door. When he opens it: MARY WINDSOR's there. Surprised
          to see Haller.

          You know what that is? It's a
          picture of your knife. The one you
          had on you when you went to Reggie
          Campos. The one the cops have.
          Look at the blood on the blade.
          Look at the initials.
          Louis is stuck for an answer--

          That's why Ted Minton didn't care
          when I told him Reggie's a
          prostitute. What's it matter, when
          he's got a knife with her blood and
          your initials on it?

          (scowls, sore)
          That's right. The file Raul got us
          was a loaded deck. The cops must
          have been on to him, because they
          used it to set us up. So we'd think
          they had nothing, when in fact they
          had enough to put your Hugo Boss,
          golf-playing ass away for twenty
          years!

          He sees HAYLEY in the backseat looking out. So does Louis.
          Mick sees him looking her way...
          Feeling the man's look, Hayley sits back. Out of sight. A
          moment... then Mick resumes. Cold and firm.

          the knife.

          picture wasn't mine.

          I just hope you catch the bastard
          who did it to her.
          And goes. Mick tucks the picture under some papers, to hide
          it-- but finds that he's only hid it halfway. Leaving half
          her face exposed. The good half. Something about this... He
          picks it up again, folds it...

          Leaning over the sink, Mick holds the folded photo against

          be the victim of a violent crime.

          The case is clear. Straightforward.
          A man attacked a woman in her home

          Lankford sneers, starts for the next room. To Sobel--

          He leaves. As she bags it-- He wonders why.

                         MICK
          You can't do ballistics on a box.
          She glances, seeing Lankford's gone-- explains.

                         SOBEL
          That old Mickey Cohen shooting?
          It's kind of famous. It turns out
          the county still has the evidence
          in storage. The bullet.

                         MICK
          You can match casings to a slug
          that's fifty years old?

          It'd be easier with the gun, but
          yeah.
          She goes to join her partner. Mick stops her with--

                         MICK
          Detective? How long will ballistics
          take?

                         SOBEL
          Careful. You'll make me think
          you're worried what we'll find.

                         MICK
          I'm in the middle of a trial.

                         SOBEL
          A day. Maybe forty-eight hours.
          She leaves. Mick's gaze, in the mirror: Fear.

          Mick and Ted, at the same time. As they move to the front...

                         TED

          dying the death of a thousand
          razors up there and you don't even
          know it.
          They peel off-- Mick to the defense table, where Louis waits
          for him. Before Louis can speak: Low--

                         MICK (CONT'D)
          Listen, you little shit: This gun-
          scheme of yours is about to blow
          up, and I'm not going down for it.
          If I have to drive people to the
          airport the rest of my life.
          Mick is seething. Louis smiles. Unruffled.

                         TED
          One last witness, your honor. The
          prosecution calls Regina Campo.

          INT. COURTROOM, LATER - REGGIE ON THE STAND...

          Diminutive, conservative dress, dark curls around her pretty
          face-- none of the aggressive sexiness. Hesitant but frank.

                         REGGIE
          It's true that I lied. I knew him
          when he came to the door.

                         TED
          In fact, you'd arranged his coming
          Miss Campo: why did you lie?

                         REGGIE
          I was scared. I wasn't sure the
          police would believe me and I
          wanted to make sure they arrested
          him... because he's an animal...
          She looks tentatively at Louis, as if still scared-- then she
          looks away. Louis is blank. Mick takes it in. Ted follows up--

                         TED

                         LOUIS
          I want to remind you of your words.
          You were going to tear her apart
          and throw her entrails into the
          sea.

          Mr. Haller.
          Emphatic. Mick frees his hand, straightens himself. watched
          by Louis. Then all at once, to surprise her--

                         MICK
          Ms. Campo have you engaged an
          attorney to sue Mr. Roulet for the
          events of March Sixth?

          No I haven't.

                         MICK

                         MICK
          I asked if you talked to one. About
          a possible lawsuit.
          Mick's crisp like he knows for sure. She wilts a little.

                         REGGIE
          It was nothing more than talk...

                         MICK
          Did you ask if you could sue Mr.
          Roulet for damages?

                         REGGIE
          I thought what you say to lawyers
          is private.

                         MICK
          If you wish, you can tell the
          jurors.
          Faces her. Ted squirms, seeing the box she's in.

                         REGGIE
          I think I want to keep it private.
          Ted squirms again. Wrong answer.

                         MICK
          Okay, let's go back to the night at
          Morgan's. Had you ever seen Louis
          Roulet before that night?

                         REGGIE
          Yes. There and other places.

                         MICK
          Ever noticed he wore a Rolex watch?

                         REGGIE

                         NO--

                         MICK
          Or that he drove one of two cars, a
          Porsche or a Range Rover?

                         REGGIE
          I never saw him driving.

          And what made you approach him?

                         REGGIE
          I knew he was in the life. You
          know. A player. I had seen him
          leave with girls who do what I do.

                         MICK
          With prostitutes. To go to a hotel,
          or their apartments...?

                         REGGIE
          I don't know where.

                         MICK
          So how do you know they left? Maybe
          they just went out for a smoke...

                         REGGIE
          Because they got in his car and
          drove away.

                         MICK
          But you just testified that you
          never saw Mr. Roulet drive! Now you
          saw him leave with a prostitute
          like yourself. Which is it?
          The contradiction rings round the room. Reggie, tries...

                         REGGIE
          I saw him get in a car but I didn't
          know what kind it was.

                         MICK
          Do you know the difference between
          a Porsche and a Range Rover?

                         REGGIE
          one's big and one's small, I guess.
          Reactions... Reggie shakes her head, knows she's not making
          it... But Mick, like he's just getting started...

                         MICK
          The women he left with, when you
          saw them again, had they been
          beaten or injured?

                         REGGIE

          But girls in your profession talk
          about customers, don't you? Warn
          each other if someone's a freak...

                         REGGIE
          Yeah, usually...

                         MICK
          And how many had warned you about
          Louis Roulet?

                         REGGIE
          None. No one.

                         MICK
          So you believed you'd be safe?

                         REGGIE
          I, thought he was a known quantity
          and I needed the money, so...

                         MICK
          So you thought he could solve your
          need for money?

                         REGGIE

                         NO--

                         MICK
          No? Isn't that why we're sitting
          here? Because you zeroed in on him?

                         REGGIE
          No! I mean yes, but not like that--

          Maggie closes the bedroom door so she can speak...

                         MAGGIE
          Haller, is this serious?

          INTERCUT: MICK ON THE PORCH, RAIN/ MAGGIE IN HER KITCHEN

                         MICK
          I'd say so. I'm being set up for
          his murder. Couple of detectives
          from Glendale are following me
          around, just waiting for the go-
          ahead to hit me with an arrest
          warrant... Could be any minute...

                         MAGGIE
          How is this possible?

                         MICK
          Bad timing, bad client, me being
          dumb...

                         MAGGIE
          Is it Roulet? Is that the client?

                         MICK
          I can't talk to you about my
          clients. How is Hayley?

                         MAGGIE
          Fine. But Haller, if she ever hears
          anything about this--

                         MICK
          She won't. Not if I play it right.

                         MAGGIE
          What are you going to do?
          A long beat. Then he says, just as he told Raul--

                         MICK
          I'm working on it. I have a plan.

          CLOSE ON MICK, in the back seat. Looking out at the rain. His
          look a little different: close shave, neat suit. Fade up
          sound of Earl, meanwhile, rattling on...

                         EARL
          .when Not Guilty Two gets to four

          are on it?

          LORNA, she's paying for a take-out coffee, when Mick scoops
          her up by the arm, urgent, he's been looking for her--

                         MICK
          Minton's putting on Corliss. He's
          got him in lock-up already...

                         LORNA
          But Gloria still hasn't let us know

          Moving her OUT OF THE CAFE, DOWN THE HALL-- hushed & fast--

          Yes you did.

                         LORNA
          Yes I did.
          Just then, approaching, he sees SOBEL & LANKFORD: Are they
          coming for him? No, they turn into the courtroom along with
          others showing up for the trial's last day. Relieved--

                         MICK

          What shit is this, Haller? I got

          You'll just have to wait and see.

          Cursing, Kurlen takes himself off to a corner. Leaving Mick

          Hate contorting his features, he's checking out the street

          The ROAD SAINTS, MOTORCYCLES SPANNING THE STREET, ARE HEADING

          POLICE! PUT DOWN YOUR WEAPONS!

          (forces out the words)
          They're down! I'm shot!
          Suddenly LANKFORD & SOBEL are through the door-- Lankford
          sees Mary on the floor, while--

                         SOBEL
          Don't move, Haller--
          She rushes to him. Lankford's already on his phone--

                         LANKFORD
          This is Lankford, we've got a
          shooting, twelve-twelve Creek off
          Laurel, we need paramedics,
          ambulance transport for two--
          During which he's checking Mary Windsor's body, revises--

                         LANKFORD (CONT'D)
          Transport for one.
          Rings off. Sobel takes Mick's hand, presses it to his wound--

                         SOBEL
          Press hard and keep pressing.
          Mick's hand is on a blood-soaked hole, hurting like hell...
          while Lankford makes another call...

                         LANKFORD
          Yeah, it's Lankford again. Tell
          them it's over, they can grab
          Roulet and bring him in... He what?

                         (LISTENS-- SURPRISED)
          So, bring him to the Emergency Room
          first, then bring him in!
          (rings off; to Sobel)
          Dig this. The uniforms had some
          help picking up Roulet. Some
          motorcycle gang was already beating
          the shit out of him.

          (She levels.)
          We thought he'd come after you. We
          couldn't tell you. The truth is we
          had plenty on him for killing
          Renteria. Jesus Martinez will be
          released. But we wanted Roulet for
          Levin, too. I told you: We had to
          find out how he beat the trace. Now
          we know.

          Just like last time.
          They share a look at the cleverness of it. When--
