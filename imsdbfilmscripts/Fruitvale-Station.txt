      small bag of fruit snacks. She looks up at Oscar with a
      bright eyed expression. But Oscar quickly places his finger
      over his lips.

       She quickly sits up. Oscar leans over to give her a kiss on
       the cheek, makes a farting sound on her neck instead.

       Oscar, now in the car by himself rides in the car listening
       to HIP HOP MUSIC. He comes to a red light.

       He looks at the car radio clock: 8:58 AM.

       He thinks to himself for a beat, he looks dissatisfied. He
       turns his music up for a beat and listens to it. He looks
       around, still not at ease. He turns off his music and pulls
       out his cellphone. He takes a quick look around to see what
       cars are around, before dialing numbers. CALLING MOM flashes
       on the screen. He holds the phone to his ear.

       The store is small and brightly lit. Oscar is reading a card
       from off the BIRTHDAY FOR MOTHER rack.

       We see that on the card is a picture of a black woman walking
       on the beach holding her son's hand. Inscribed over it are
       the words to the religious poem "Footsteps" by Anonymous.

       Oscar's eyes quickly scan the poem: he's read it before.

       several large wooden tables with plastic chairs placed around
       them. There are a few VISITORS already sitting at tables with
       inmates. Several Corrections Officers stand by.

       We see Oscar, shirtless, arms behind his head, is looking
       through the glass window of the search room. A Corrections
       Officer is conducting a search. Oscar's face is bruised under
       his left eye, and there is a small white bandage strip on the
       left side of his face. He turns around, bends over and
       coughs. He turns back around, and the officer hands him his
       Blue shirt and pants. Oscar puts them on and-

       BUZZ. The door opens, and Oscar walks through the large room
       to Wanda's table. As he approaches she stands up.

       Oscar pumps his gas. He looks at a poster of Obama that reads
       CHANGE, posted on the gas pump. He looks across the lot and
       notices a Zales engagement ring poster.

       He pulls out his phone. Starts to text.

       it.

       We see it is a gnarly- looking male PIT BULL sniffing around
       a few feet from Oscar's tires. It looks to be maybe 3 or 4
       years old. Oscar whistles at the dog and calls him over.

       Oscar pets him on the head, we see its ears are a bit
       scarred, but it has beautiful brown eyes. He feels around the
       dog's neck- no collar. Oscar looks around for an owner for a
       beat while the dog licks his hand.

       CLICK- Oscar's gas tank is full. He turns away from the dog,
       places the pump back on the base, and screws his fuel cap
       back in. He looks back to where the dog was and doesn't see
       him. He scans the block and panic strikes his face. He takes
       off running towards the street.

       street chasing a car going too fast for us to see.

       heard coming from the kitchen. The front door opens, and in
       walks Sophina, Oscar, and Tatiana.

       Oscar gives her a kiss on the cheek. Sophina gives her a hug.

       As Oscar enters, we see Sophina is in her bra and panties,
       talking into her cellphone. She lays several different
       outfits out on the bed. Oscar closes the bedroom door, leans
       on it.

       A large pot is placed atop the gas stove. The burner blazes
       under it, as Wanda drops the now clean crabs into the bucket.

       She drops in the vegetables and begins to stir. Bowls are
       grabbed by everyone and they are filled up by Wanda, with
       white rice first, and then the brown gumbo is poured over it,
       along with large pieces of un- cracked crab.

       Everyone eats their gumbo in the kitchen. Laughing talking.

                 But I think it's a sign of the
                 times. The country is in bad enough
                 shape for them to hand it over to a
                 black guy. Look, if Bush hadn't
                 have messed the country up so bad.

       Brandon takes his arm down and offers her the bottle of            
       Hennessy- she declines. He turns to Karen and Donald, and
       offers it. Donald opens his jacket and pulls out a flask. He
       lifts it at Brandon, smiling. Brandon lifts his bottle in

                  stabilized him, but he's in
                  critical condition. The bullet
                  caused massive internal bleeding

                   Well does he have his cellphone?
                   Maybe if I call him and talk to
                   him, he will come back.

                   No. Daddy doesn't have his
                   cellphone baby. You can't call him
                   where he is.
