          FADE IN:

          EXT. KIGALI AIRPORT. DAY
          
          A burning white sun high in a clear blue sky,
          
                                                                     PAN DOWN TO:
          
          A rundown (sixties) airport, peeling in the heat.
          
          A mad traffic jam of cars, vans, motorbikes all stopped at a checkpoint
          where a RWANDAN POLICEMAN blows his whistle, waves some and stops
          others as bored Rwandan soldiers look on.
          
          CLOSE ON: A white van pulls out of traffic, a balls-out case of line
          jumping. HORNS, OBSCENITIES.
          
          A HAND: Extends from the passenger side of the van, Rwandan francs
          pressed neatly between thumb and palm.
          
          The van stops next to the policeman.
          
                                     POLICEMAN
          Mr. Rusesabagina, good morning.
          
          In the passenger seat PAUL RUSESABAGINA, late 30's, flashes a smile. He
          is dressed in a sharp blue suit (always dressed in a neat suit and tie,
          it is a matter of pride).
          
          A quick shake of hands. Money passes from one to the other.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI AIRPORT TARMAC. DAY
          
          The van parked by the runway tarmac. African music plays on the radio.
          Paul drums his fingers, checks his watch.
          
          ZOZO, porter/driver, early thirties, sits nervously.
          
          An airport baggage handler approaches the van.
          
                                     HANDLER
                         Sir, the flight is delayed one more hour.
          
                                     PAUL
                         Thank you.
                              (to Zozo)                                              
                         He can get the beer.
          
          
          
          
          
                                                                            2.
          
                                  ZOZO
                           (suddenly worried)
                      Rutaganda's place?
          
                                  PAUL
                      What's wrong?
          
                                  ZOZO                                               
                      Beg your pardon sir, you are Hutu. You
                      are safe there.
          
                                  PAUL
                      You are with me, Zozo, don't worry.                            
          Zozo throws the van into gear and speeds off.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI STREETS. DAY
          
          The white van, marked "THE HOTEL MILLE COLLINES," whips its way through
          Kigali's packed streets and open-air markets.
          
          
          ZXT. KIGALI STREETS. DAY
          
          Zozo works THE HORN, weaves in and out of traffic.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      What is it like to fly on a plane, sir?
          
                                  PAUL
                      It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach
                      it is like the bus to Giterama.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      That is why they call it coach?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Maybe. But in business class there are
                      fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
          
                                  ZOZO
                           (impressed)
                      You have taken business class?
          
                                    PAUL
                      Many times.
          
          Suddenly, Zozo slows.
          
          Paul looks up, SEES: a gathering on the side of the road -- a large
          crowd of men dressed in exotically, yet identically colored shirts.
          They're members of the INTERAHAMWE - the Hutu Militia.
          
          
          
                                                                             3.
          (Interahamwe - the Hutu Militia will de distinguished by these wildly
          colored shirts) They chant, drink beer, dance onto the road,
          obstructing cars, threatening the occupants. Several of them perform a
          rhythmic dance - the INTERAHAMWE war dance to thumping drumbeat music
          from a boombox.
          
                                   PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Turn off.
          
          Zozo, scared, looks for a side road, studies the traffic behind.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      There is nowhere to turn, sir.                                
          As the van approaches,
          
                                   PAUL
                      Slow down.
          
          The van pulls up beside the Militia.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Boys, do you know the way to Mr.                              
                      Rutagunda's warehouse?
          
          Some Militia approach. They are suddenly friendly, helpful.
          
                                  MILITIA MAN #1
                      It is one more mile on this road.
          
          Paul reaches into his pocket, takes out some Rwandan dollars.
          
                                  PAUL
                      This is thirsty work, let me treat you to
                      some beers.
          
          As the van pulls away Zozo looks to Paul, relieved.
          
          
          INT. RUTAGANDA'S WAREHOUSE. DAY
          
          At his desk in front of a fan. GEORGE RUTAGUNDA, late 30's, huge, gold
          chains, Rolex watch, (like an African Mafia boss) but the same
          Interahamwe shirt. He squeezes an orange rind into a cup of espresso.
          
          Behind him, through his office window, the white van is being loaded
          with cases of beer.
          
          George holds out his massive shirt.
          
                                  GEORGE
                      You will join us at the rally today?
          
          Paul sits opposite, sipping coffee.
          
                                                                            4.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I will try my best George but these days
                      I have no time for rallies or politics.
          
                                  GEORGE
                      Politics is power, Paul. And money.
          
          Paul studies his watch.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Time is money, George. We need extra beer
                      today.
          
                                  GEORGE
                      Business is good at the hotel?
          
                                    PAUL
                      Very good.
          
                                  GEORGE
                      I am always glad to see you Paul.
          
          George leads Paul out into the warehouse.                                 
          As a forklift lifts A WOODEN CRATE, George angers.
          
                                  GEORGE (CONT'D)
                      Hell man, that is not beer, put it back!
          
                                  DRIVER
                      But, sir, the Carlsberg is behind...                          
                                  GEORGE
                      Forget the Carlsberg, give him Grolsch.
                           (to Paul)                                                
                      I won't charge extra.                                         
                                    PAUL
                      Thank you.
          
          The driver of the forklift, anxiously, spins the machine to return the
          crate but it slides off and CRASHES onto the floor: MACHETES, hundreds
          of them, spill out.
          
          An awkward moment then George picks one of the crude blades.
          
                                  GEORGE
                      A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents
                      each, I'll get a dollar.
          
                                    PAUL
                      At least.
          
          Off Zozo terrified.
          
                                                                              5.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI AIRPORT TARMAC. DAY
          
          A Sabena airliner lands. Passengers disembark via a roll-up staircase.
          
          Paul's van pulls up by the luggage belt.
          
          A large polystyrene box comes down the conveyor belt. It has Brussels -
          Kigali destination stickers all over it.
          
          As Zozo picks it up, water sloshes from the lid.
          
                                  PAUL
                      The ice has melted!
          
          Zozo goes to open it.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Don't. Let's go.
          
          Paul slips money to two customs officials.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI STREETS. DAY
          
          The van speeds through traffic. More traffic jams, Zozo edges up on the
          sidewalk. Then at an intersection they see.
          
          THE INTERAHAMWE PARADE - a mass of young men and women, most in the
          same colorful uniform. Line after line, waves all performing the
          INTERAHAMWE war dance, in wild hypnotic sync, many wave sticks, spears,
          wooden imitation guns. A large banner reads, "Hutu Power."
          
          A flatbed truck, speakers blare drumbeat music. On it GEORGE RUTAGUNDA
          dances the DANCE and waves a machete to the crowd.
          
          Zozo sinks down behind the wheel.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Sit up, smile, Zozo, don't attract
                      attention to yourself.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Boss, some of those men are my neighbors,
                      they know I'm Tutsi.
          
          The parade passes. As they wait Paul takes out the wad of notes George
          gave him, peels off a few dollars.
                                  P
          
                                  PAUL
                      Here, Zozo, for your trouble.
          
          Zozo takes it.
          
                                                                               6.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL ENTRANCE. DAY
          
          The van turns off the street into The Milles Collines Hotel driveway
          and HONKS twice as it pulls down a short drive lined with tall shrubs.
          An ARMED GUARD rushes from his booth and lifts the gate. Perfectly
          timed. The van doesn't even have to slow as it passes. A sign on the
          guard house reads "WELCOME TO THE HOTEL MILLE COLLINES".
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Lush tropical gardens, peacocks wander the well-manicured lawns,an
          exotic African paradise. The van heads to a magnificent colonial
          building.
          
                                  PAUL (V.O.)
                      Pull up at the front door.
          
          A valet opens the front door of the hotel and looks shocked. It's
          unheard of for a service van to stop out front.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (urgent, to the valet)
                      Help Zozo.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul leads Zozo and the valet into a magnificent lobby, a tasteful
          blend of Africa and Europe. Guests stare as water sloshes and spills
          from the crate.
          
          GREGOIRE, early thirties the receptionist behind the desk throws a look
          of disapproval. Paul, imperial, snaps his finger toward him.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (re: spilled water)                                       
                      Gregoire. Take care of this.
          
          Gregoire engages a guest in chit-chat, ignores Paul.

                      Gregoire!   See to this right away.
          
          The elevator door opens and reveals BIK the Belgian hotel manager, mid-
          40's, reading some reports. He looks up, sees Paul and Zozo carrying
          the box as they step in. Bik looks puzzled.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      It's an emergency, sir.                                        
          Now Bik sees the wet floor.
          
          
          
                                                                              7.

                      Paul!
          
                                  PAUL
                      Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
          
          The elevator doors shut. Bik's left standing in disbelief.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL KITCHEN. DAY
          
          The crate is hefted onto a counter. The top pried off. A crowd of
          cooks gathers around Paul and Zozo as they peer in.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Any of them make it?

                      Into the sink!
          
          They hoist up one end of the crate and LOBSTERS spill out. Many make
          it into the sink, but some miss and slide across the counter and fall
          onto the floor.
          
          The cooks sort the living from the dead.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Twelve are dead.
          
                                    PAUL
                      How dead?
          
          The cooks smells a dead lobster, shakes his head no.

          Paul emerges, as a troupe of African male dancers in ceremonial costume
          - Leopard skin dress, ostrich feather head dress, spears and shields
          perform a greeting dance for a the American Ambassador and a crowd of
          European dignitaries.
          
          The male dancers are joined by a troupe of young female dancers in
          similar ceremonial dress. The ceremony comes to a foot stomping finale.
          The guests break into LOUD APPLAUSE. Paul flings open double doors to a
          reception room and the crowd moves in.

          grand piano in the corner. Rwandan Hutu army officers, (distinguished
          by their crisp khaki uniforms, in the style of the French army), arms
          dealers, government dignitaries, businessmen and reporters mingle
          freely. The few tourists stand out.
          
          PAUL heads to a table. The center of attention and conversation is
          General BIZIMUNGU, 40's, dressed in a crisp, heavily decorated
          uniform, a strong figure, relaxed, in control. 
                                      
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU

                      It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I
                      thought you'd like it. Anything you need,

                      Oh, Paul, talk to the coat check, please.
          
          Paul heads for the lobby. He's intercepted by an zealous young Tutsi
          reporter BENEDICT who covers the political scene for the local
          independent newspaper.

                      reception?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'm sorry, it's a private function.
          
          Benedict takes out his reporters notebook.
          
                                  BENEDICT
                      At least tell me who is attending. The
                      newspaper will be grateful.

                         Now, General, don't ask for the
                         impossible.
          
          Paul smiles.
          
                                     PAUL
                         I have heard, Mr. Ambassador, that they
                         have discovered oil here, under Lake                        
                         Kivu.
          
          Oliver bursts out laughing. 
                                                         
                                     COLONEL OLIVER                                  
                         You're right, Mr. Ambassador, Paul knows
                         how to get anything, even U.S. troops. 
                               
          The ambassador takes Paul's hand, shakes it warmly.
          
                                     US AMBASSADOR
                         Thank you for a wonderful meal, Paul.
          
          Paul moves away graciously, and in one smooth move checks out, then
          pockets, the hundred dollar bill the ambassador palmed him.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          General Bizimungu gazes through glass into the reception room, SEES
          Paul shake hands and joke with the Ambassador. (He's impressed.)
          
          Paul notices the General.
          
          The General raises his briefcase and waves.
          
          Paul waves back. Another favor rendered.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL GROUNDS. NIGHT
          
          It is night now. Floodlights bathe the hotel in a warm glow. Tiki oil
          lamps illuminate the walkways and spread scented citronella smoke among
          the trees. Wild birds CALL OUT.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL REAR CAR PARK. NIGHT
          
          Paul walks to the employee car park at the rear.
          
          He sees Gregoire and another male reception clerk tossing Zozo's
          pillbox porter's hat between them with Zozo trapped in the middle
          trying to jump and catch it. Gregoire thinks this tease is great fun.
          
                         
          
          
                                                                              13.
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      Come on, Zozo, cockroaches can jump, some                      
                      of them can fly.
          
           he clerk sees Paul just as he's about to throw, miscalculates, the hat
          sails over Gregoire's head and lands at Paul's feet. Zozo scampers to
          pick it up.
          
                                    PAUL
                      No.
                            (points to Gregoire)                                      
                      You pick it up.
          
          Gregoire doesn't move.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      How are your dish-washing skills,                              
                      Gregoire?
          
          Gregoire bends, picks up the hat, hands it to Zozo, who walks away
          quickly. Gregoire and his friend turn to head back into the hotel.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in
                      this hotel, do you understand?
          
                                   BIK (O.S.)
                      Cockroaches?
          
          Bik has walked out of the rear door and overheard.
          
                                  BIK (CONT'D)
                      Don't tell me we have cockroaches, Paul?                       
          A sly smile breaks on Gregoire's face as he uses Bik's arrival to
          disappear inside.
          
                                  PAUL
                      No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.   
                                 
                                  BIK
                      That's what I came to talk to you about.
          
                                   PAUL
                      Excuse me?
          
                                  BIK
                      The Hutu-Tutsi thing. The BBC faxed to                         
                      say they would be here on the sixth for
                      the peace accords. And the U.N. wants the
                      banquet room for that day, a reception to
                      broadcast the signing ceremony. Can you
                      organize monitors and check the satellite
                      dish?
          
                                                                               14.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Leave it to me.
          
          Bik leans slightly closer.
          
                                  BIK
                      Also, could you remember to use the
                      service entrance at all times?
          
                                    PAUL
                      Of course.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. NIGHT
          
          Paul hops in his car and tosses a box of Belgium chocolates on the seat
          next to him.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI STREETS. NIGHT
          
          Paul speeds through the streets of Kigali HUMMING along to music on the
          radio and eating chocolates from the box. He passes bicycles laden
          with produce. The song on the radio ends and local news comes on.
          
                                  RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                      Good Hutus of Rwanda, beware. The
                      dictatorship of the Tutsi cockroach is
                      near. Watch your neighbor. Identify these
                      cockroaches. Then rise up and stamp out
                      this murderous infestation...
          
          Paul turns the station.    Finds another with music.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI NEIGHBORHOOD. NIGHT
          
          Lights burn in windows. Kids play soccer in dusty lots. Paul's van
          turns onto a residential street and slows. He HONKS twice. The metal
          gate to a walled compound swings open. A GUARD(old, peaked hat, bare
          feet, pathetic) stands just inside. Paul waves to him and pullsinto
          the courtyard, two cars are already parked there.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE. NIGHT
          
          A neat bungalow and gardens behind the high wall. Paul parks and gets
          out. A DOG runs and greets him, BARKING.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Down, Pealiss.
          
                                 
          
          
                                                                           15.
          
          His wife, TATIANA, a woman of great natural beauty, emerges from the
          house, beside her an even taller, very elegant woman, she has a
          doctor's bag and a stethoscope in her hand. This is ODETTE, their
          family doctor and close friend.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Good evening, Odette, who is sick this                      
                      time?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      I asked Odette to take a look at little
                      Anais. She has a rash.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Your brother's here?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Yes, with Fedens and the children.
                       e wants some advice.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      Good to see you, Paul.     
                                           
          Paul embraces Odette warmly, kisses Tatiana.
          
                                  ODETTE (CONT'D)
                      I must go, Paul.            
                                          
                                  TATIANA
                      You will not stay for dinner.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      No thank you, Tatiana.   
                                             
                                  PAUL
                      My best to Jean Baptiste.
          
          
          EXT: PAUL'S HOUSE. NIGHT
          
          The old guard opens the gate, Odette drives off.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S GARDEN. NIGHT
          
                                  PAUL
                           (a sigh)
                      Thomas wants advice?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      He wants your wisdom.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Let's have dinner first.
          
                                   
          
          
                                                                              16.
          
                                      TATIANA
                        Of course.
          
          His brother-in-law THOMAS and sister-in-law FEDENS come out to greet
          Paul the Patriarch. They hug. Kids run everywhere. Paul spots his twin
          nieces Anais (in blue) and Carine (in yellow), four years old. He
          scoops them up, one in each arm.
          
                                      PAUL
                        Hello, Anais.                                                 
          She laughs.
          
                                      CARINE
                        I am Carine.
          
                                    PAUL
                        You are not Anais?  
                                                    
                                      ANAIS
                        I am Anais.
          
                                    PAUL
                        Oh, Carine, that is a shame. I have a                         
                        present for Anais.
          
          Anais reaches out her hand. Paul sets them on the ground, takes a
          chocolate from his chocolate box, deliberately hands it to Carine.
          Anais jumps up and down.
          
                                    ANAIS
                        It is for me.
          
                                    PAUL
                        Goodness, I cannot tell. I guess I must
                        find another present.
          
          He takes a chocolate gives it to Carine, then hands out the   chocolates
          to his children who are gathered around.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S KITCHEN. DAY
          
          A crowded family table. Tatiana, Paul's four children, Thomas and
          Fedens, and the twins Anais and Carine.

                        Roger, your turn.
          
          Paul's eldest, ROGER, 12, bows his head.
          
                                    ROGER
                        For food and clothes, and all that grows,
                        etc, etc. Dear Lord, thank you.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           17.
          
                                     PAUL
                         Thank you, Roger.
          
          Food is passed around. Roger gobbles his down.
          
                                     PAUL (CONT'D)
                         Why the hurry, Roger?
          
                                     ROGER
                         Simon has a new pet. Can I go see it?
          
                                     PAUL
                         No, I don't want you going on the street.
          
                                      OGER
                         Please, papa, I have a secret path.

                         Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
          
                                      PAUL
                         Homework?
          
                                      ROGER
                         It's done.
          
                                     TATIANA
                         And he did extra chores.
          
                                     PAUL
                         Wash your things, and be back soon. 
                                  
          Roger takes off at a run.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S GARDEN. NIGHT
          
          Roger runs to a wooden fence, gets down, moves two boards and squeezes
          through into a path, almost a tunnel in dense reeds.
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S (SIMON'S) YARD. NIGHT
          
          Roger crawls along his path. There's a gap a little way down, and Roger
          shoots through it into the wide open of the neighbors yard. He runs to
          a back window of the house and taps on it. Soon SIMON, 12, appears. He
          slides it open.
          
                                     ROGER
                         Let's feed it.
          
          
          
                                                                           18.
          
          Simon lets Roger in.
          
          
          INT. NEIGHBOR'S (SIMON'S) HOUSE. NIGHT
          
          Roger holds a WILDLY COLORED SNAKE in a jar. Simon has a bag of bugs.
          Waves the bag in front of the snake. It's forked tongue goes wild.
          
                                  ROGER
                      Let me.
          
          Simon hands him the bugs. Roger lifts the lid, drops one bug in, and
          the snake strikes. The boys jump back, laugh.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S KITCHEN. NIGHT
          
          After dinner coffee for the adults. Tatiana, Thomas and Fedens at the
          table. Paul, in his usual position, at the head, listening, like
          Solomon.
          
                                  THOMAS
                      I've heard bad things, Paul. My assistant
                      says we should get out of Rwanda.
          
                                  FEDENS
                      Why should we leave? I have a new job,
                      things have never been better for us.
          
                                  THOMAS
                      What good is it if we are murdered in our
                      bed?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Your assistant, he is Hutu?
          
                                  THOMAS
                      Yes, and he is in the Hutu Power Militia.
          
                                  CARINE
                      He wants your job.
          
                                  THOMAS
                      No, he is a friend, but he tells me to
                      listen to the radio. All day they talk
                      about the great slaughter.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      That station is filth.
          
          PAUL has listened, now he decides to speak.
          
          
          
                                                                             19.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Today I talked to my friend the American
                      Ambassador and Colonel Oliver of the                           
                      United Nations. They are preparing a
                      banquet for the peace signing. The BBC
                      are flying in their best reporters. The
                      world is watching. There will be peace.
                      Don't listen to this man.
          
          Solomon has spoken. Fedens smiles, Tatiana rubs Paul's arm.
          
          
          EXT. NEIGHBOR'S (SIMON'S) YARD. NIGHT
          
          Roger crawls along his grass tunnel. Then he hears something. He looks
          through the reeds toward the street.
          
          HE SEES: Military boots, a cluster of Hutu soldiers in their crisp
          Khaki uniforms.
          
          He hears whispering.
          
                                     OLDIER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                      That house.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE. NIGHT
          
          Paul, Tatiana, are by Thomas's car. They say good night to their
          guests. Anais and Carine sleep in the car.
          
          Paul nods to the old guard to go open the gate. Just then Roger emerges
          from the thicket, wide-eyed, afraid.
          
                                  ROGER
                      There are soldiers.
          
                                    PAUL
                      Where?
          
                                  ROGER
                      On the street.
          
          Paul nods to Tatiana to take Roger inside. Thomas and Fedens grab the
          sleeping twins from their car.
          
          Paul goes to his big metal gates and peers through the two inch gap
          E
          between the gate hinge and the gate post.
          
          
          EXT. VICTOR'S HOUSE. NIGHT.
          
          HE SEES: (two houses down) the group of Hutu soldiers, clustered around
          jeeps, they whisper and point. It's a raid.
          
                                   
          
          
                                                                           20.
          
          Now they move rushing out of view.
          
          The sounds of SPLINTERING WOOD, GLASS BREAKING, CHILDREN'S CRIES, WOMEN
          SCREAMING.
          
          Suddenly there's a face, beside Paul's. It's Tatiana.
          
                                    TATIANA
                      What is it?
          
          She looks, sees the soldiers, as they drag a middle-aged man onto the
          street.
          
          He is crying, pleading, like a whipped dog.
          
                                  TATIANA (CONT'D)
                      Oh, my God, it's Victor. Why do they want                      
                      Victor?
          
          They watch as Victor is beaten to the jeep. At this point Victor looses
          it completely, stops pleading, grabs on to a soldier, clinging,
          screaming like a terrified child - like a man who knows he is going to
          die. It's a horror.
          
                                  TATIANA (CONT'D)
                      Do something.
          
                                    PAUL
                      What?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Call your friends in the army. Call
                      someone. Victor is harmless. This is a
                      mistake.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Please, be quiet.
          
          Tatiana, moves toward the gate handle.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      I'm going to talk to them.
          
          Paul grabs her.
          
                                    PAUL
                      No.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      We must do something.
          
          Paul takes her by the arm, leads her to the house.
          
                                                                         21.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What would you have us do? Argue with                     
                      these madmen? We cannot interfere.                        
          
          INT. PAUL'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Thomas and Fedens wait, anxious, as Paul appears.
          
                                  PAUL
                      You better stay the night, it is too
                      dangerous to be on the streets.
          
          Tatiana hides her anger.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      I'll fix a bed.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
          
          Paul lies in bed unable to sleep.   The clock reads 3:00 am.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Why didn't you call your contacts in the
                      army?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I couldn't help.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      You could have asked for a favor.
          
                                  PAUL
                      No, I could not. What do you know about
                      favors Tatiana, about barter and deals?
                      All day long I work to please this
                      officer, that diplomat, this tourist. To
                      store up favors so that if there is a
                      time when my family need help I have
                      powerful people I can call upon. Now you
                      would have me waste a precious favor on a
                      stranger.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Victor was not a stranger, he was our
                      neighbor.
          
                                  PAUL
                      He was not family. Family is all that
                      matters. Do you think if you or I were
                      being dragged from here, any one of them
                      would lift a finger to help us?
          
          
          
                                                                            22.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      They do not have your connections.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Connections? I have no connections, only
                      favors. If I call to help Victor, a
                      General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is
                      a fool. He thinks my favors are so
                      numerous and so insignificant as to waste
                      them on everybody." Then my hard work is
                      doubly squandered. I insult the General
                      and I do not get to use my favor at all.
                      Please leave these things to my good
                      judgment.
          
          His turn away indicates the discussion is over.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FRONT GATE. MORNING
          
          Paul's car rolls up to the hotel's guard house.
          
          SUPER THE TITLE: APRIL 6th, 1994.
          
          An army jeep is parked just inside. General Bizimungu is in the
          passenger seat, talking into a walkie-talkie.
          
          The General gives an I'll see you soon wave.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          The hotel entrance is a mini-jam of airport buses, white UN jeeps,
          foreign news crew Land Rovers, and a TV repair van unloading monitors.
          Paul marches in, past Zozo the bell hop, who helps the TV men unload.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Welcome, gentlemen.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          The lobby buzzes with activity. At the reception, Gregoire is
          surrounded by a BBC news crew: GLORIA, young, chic female
          reporter/producer, and JOCK, tough, experienced Scottish cameraman, and
          his local sound guy Peter. Gloria is upset.

                                  PAUL

                      We're having a little trouble, Paul. We
                      booked five rooms, but...
          
          Paul moves behind the desk.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Let me check.
          
          He punches into the computer.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Ah, I see the mistake. You were reading
                      CBC - the Canadian broadcasting people
                      instead of BBC Gregoire.
          
          Close on the computer: It clearly states BBC - two rooms.   Gregoire
          looks to Paul with a mix of puzzlement and anger.
          
          
                      Of course, the BBC, five rooms.
                            (lies)                                                  
                      They are being prepared as we speak. I
                      have ordered fresh flowers and
                      complimentary champagne.

                      Just give me a moment to get your keys.
          
          Paul better come up with three rooms fast. Then he spots the reporter
          Benedict hovering at the door.
          
          
          
                                                                           24.

                      Excuse me for one second.
          
          Paul hurries over to Benedict.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Benedict, you should meet the BBC people.                     
                      They could use your expertise.                                
          
          Benedict is delighted. They head back across the lobby.

                      Benedict, General Bizimungu will be here
                      any moment. The BBC should talk to him.
          
          They join the BBC team.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)

          Paul turns, walks past porters ferrying the BBC luggage. He puts his
          hand out. Gregoire hands him keys.
          
          Paul does his rounds. He double checks the banquet room where
          technicians install several TV monitors and test the signal.
          
          He looks in the kitchen, frenzied activity.
          
          He wanders behind the bar. Everything is 'under control'.

          It's General Bizimungu, he is sitting with George Rutagunda now in a
          shiny blue suit. A bottle of whiskey on the table is almost gone.

          stumble and shoulder bumps the big man.
          
          George falls into his chair.

          Rutagunda bursts out laughing, toasts:
          
                                  GEORGE
                      To our president. May he find peace.
          
          As Paul is forced to join in the toast, Rutagunda laughs, Bizimungu        
          smiles at some insider joke.                                               
          
          INT. HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM. EVENING
          
          Reporters and crews pack up their equipment. Paul shakes hands, orders
          porters to pick up cases. Then a porter whispers a message to Paul.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Excuse me, gentlemen.
          
          
          
                                                                           29.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. NIGHT
          
          Paul emerges, discovers Fedens and Thomas - they look embarrassed to be
          in such exulted surroundings.
          
                                  THOMAS
                      Forgive us, Paul. We must talk.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What's wrong?
          
                                  THOMAS
                      We are leaving Rwanda, Paul.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Go to the terrace, I will join you.
          
                                                                       CUT TO
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL POOL TERRACE. NIGHT
          
          Drinks are served at a table as Paul listens to Thomas.
          
                                  THOMAS
                      My assistant, the Hutu Power man, says we                      
                      should get out now, that soon it will be
                      very bad.
          
          Paul stifles his anger.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Give me this man's name.
          
                                  THOMAS
                      His name is Naramaranga, but please,                           
                      Paul, even though he is Hutu Power, he is                      
                      a friend, he likes me. He told me there
                      is a signal. It is "Cut the tall trees."                       
                      When they hear the signal, the militia                         
                      are to go to war.
          
                                  FEDENS
                      Please, let us take Tatiana with us. You
                      are Hutu, you will be safe.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Thomas, Fedens, I am a man who looks
                      after his family. If there were danger I
                      would be the first to leave?
          
          BANG - a distant explosion, a flash of light on the far side of the
          city. Fedens jumps.
          
          
          
          
          
                                                                          30.
          
                                   FEDENS
                       What was that?
          
                                   PAUL
                       Calm yourself, it is fireworks to
                       celebrate the peace.
          
                                   THOMAS
                       Please, Paul, tomorrow I will bring you
                       my car. You will sell it for me and get a
                       fair price. We will go to Tanzania until
                       there is real peace.
          
                                   ZOZO
                       Excuse me, Paul, you have a call. 
                                    
          Zozo hands Paul a cordless phone.
          
                                   PAUL
                        ello. Tatsi. Yes, they are here. Yes. I
                       know but I want them to calm down.
          
          THOMAS and Fedens listen.
          
                                   PAUL (CONT'D)
                       Already the press are packing their bags.
                       The BBC man told me there's no story
                       here. We are boring now. I'll be home
                       soon.
          
          He hangs up.
          
                                   PAUL (CONT'D)
                       Let us all go home and sleep.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. EVENING
          
          Paul escorts Fedens and Thomas to their car.
          
                                   PAUL
                       Call when you get home.   And don't worry,
                       Thomas. Good night.
          
          
          INT.   PAUL'S CAR. NIGHT
          
          Paul's at the wheel, driving. A thick mist. Barely a car on the road.
          Shadows dart past faint house lights. The windscreen clouds. Paul
          switches on his wipers. A Toyota truck, loaded with Militia, appears
          from the mist, speeds past. Paul switches the preset buttons on the
          radio as he drives. He can only find fevered drum-based MUSIC.
          
          
          
                                                                             31.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S STREET. NIGHT
          
          Paul turns onto his street. The houses are dark: windows shuttered;
          gates closed; not a soul about. Paul stops before his gate. HONKS
          twice. The gate doesn't open. He hops out and opens it with a key.
          Gives it a push and pauses as he heads back to the car. He hears the
          far off sound of gunfire. Distant explosions light the night sky.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE. NIGHT
          
          Paul drives in. His compound is curiously dark.     His headlights sweep
          across his pitch-black house.
          
                                                                         UT TO:
          
          The gates swing shut. We PULL BACK as Paul turns and faces his house.
          Paul whistles for the dog, nothing. He goes back to the car, gets a
          flashlight, heads for the front door.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
          
          The door slowly opens. Paul steps in quietly, tries the light switch,
          nothing. He listens. The only sounds are distant explosions and
          gunfire. The beam of his flashlight cuts the blackness, illuminating:
          magazines arranged on a coffee table; an empty chair; children's toys
          in a basket.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S KITCHEN. NIGHT
          
          Paul continues his search. Scans the counter. There's food on the
          stove. The table is set. He hears a GROWL, quickly cut short, from one
          of the bedrooms.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S HALL. NIGHT
          
          Paul shines the light into a room. Looks for a second, then closes the
          door, and walks to the next. He stops and listens with his ear to the
          door. Nothing. He pushes it in.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
          
          Paul's light sweeps across the room and illuminates:
          
          Eyes - terrified eyes, a room full of faces, staring back.
          
          THEIR POV: A dark figure behind a blinding light.
          
          The dog breaks free, runs to Paul.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           32.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Pealiss!
          
          From among the faces, Tatiana's voice heavy with relief.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Paul!
          
          Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded
          into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband
          Jean Baptiste.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Jean Baptiste!
          
                                  JEAN BAPTISTE
                      Our house has been burned.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What is going on?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      The president has been murdered.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Murdered! By whom?
          
                                  ODETTE
                      The radio says Tutsi rebels.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Nonsense. Why would the rebels kill the
                      president when he agreed to peace?
          
          Tatiana pulls Paul aside.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Where are Thomas and Fedens?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I sent them home. Go and call them.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      I tried already. The phones do not work.
          
          Jean Baptiste turns on his tiny radio.
          
                                  RADIO ANNOUNCER
                      Our great president is murdered, by the
                      Tutsi cockroaches. They tricked him, then
                      they killed him. We must cleanse this
                      country, Good Hutus of Rwanda. We must
                      clear the brush. Clear the brush of all
                      cockroaches. Clear the brush!!!
          
          
          
          
                                                                           33.
          
          The words are cut short as a grenade blast rattles the window. Everyone
          jumps, children whimper. Paul is shocked but tries to pull things
          together.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Come on, everyone out of this room, find
                      a seat in the living room.
          
          He holds the door open, they file out, frightened. Tatiana is last, he
          stops her, steps back in, closes the door.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (in hushed anger)                                         
                      Is every Tutsi in the neighborhood here?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      They came through the bushes, over the
                      wall. What could I do?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Send them home. We are not the police.
                      What do we have to protect them?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The
                      militia will not come here, they know you                      
                      are a Hutu with influence.
          
                                  PAUL
                      They know you are Tutsi!
          
          The door knocks.   Paul gets up, angry.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Please, Paul, 'til first light.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Dawn. Then they go.
          
          Paul opens the door, it's Odette, holding the hand of Paul's eldest
          daughter.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      Forgive me, Paul. Danielle says that
                      Roger has gone.
          
          Tatiana comes over instantly, worried.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Gone where? Tell me, Danielle.                                 
          Their daughter Danielle answers.
          
                                                                                    
          
          
          
          
                                                                           34.
          
                                     DANIELLE
                         Next door, mama. He was afraid for his                     
                         friend Simon. He went to fetch him.
          
          
          EXT. UNDERGROWTH. NIGHT
          
          Roger crawls between the shrubs.      He hears ANGRY VOICES.
          
          He peers through the long grass.
          
          Sees: Hutu soldiers boots, feet in sneakers, bare women's feet. And
          among them the glint of machetes, hoes, a club spiked with nails, a
          length of chain CLANGING on the ground.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S GARDEN. NIGHT
          
          Tatiana rushes out the front door, Paul after her.
          
          Paul catches her and puts his hand over her mouth.
          
                                     PAUL
                         Shhhhh.
          
          SHOUTS next door. Paul pulls Tatiana behind the car. A beat. More
          SHOUTS. Paul takes his hand from her mouth. She's sobbing.

             EXT. NEIGHBOR'S YARD. NIGHT
          
          Roger crawls to the gap in the shrubs. Feet, a crowd, leaving, through
          a gate. Engines rev.
          
          Roger crawls from the bushes.
          
          Crawls across, the driveway, crawls through a puddle.
          
          Then stops, SEES SOMETHING, AN (UNSEEN) HORROR!
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S GARDEN. NIGHT
          
          Paul and Tatiana exit the back of the house with flashlight in hand
          headed towards the rear gate.
          
          Paul searches along the chain link fence, finds a section loose, he
          pulls it back, clambers underneath it.                                    
          Tatiana clasps her mouth, afraid to utter a cry.                          
          
          EXT. UNDERGROWTH. NIGHT                                                   
          Paul crawls through this scrub tunnel.                                    
          
                                 
          
          
          
                                                                            35.
          
          Then he hears BRANCHES SNAPPING.                                           
          He moves toward the sound.                                                 
          Discovers Roger, terrified, thrashing in a tangle of bushes.               
          He grabs Rogers shirt, pulls him as the little boy startles.               
                                    PAUL                                             
                      Ssshh!                                                         
          Paul drags his son through the chainlink fence, whisks him up in his       
          arms and rushes him to the house.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S KITCHEN. NIGHT
          
          Paul bursts through the back door and sets Roger down.   Tatiana is
          beside them.
          
                                    TATIANA
                      Roger!
          
          Paul turns the flashlight on Roger. Tatiana pulls back in horror:
          Roger is covered in blood. Her SCREAMS, stifled by fear.
          
                                    TATIANA (CONT'D)
                      Oh, my God!                                                    
                                  PAUL
                      Where are you hurt, son?
          
           oger stares blankly. Odette is beside them now.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      Get his clothes off.
          
          Hands pull and tear his clothes off. Towels wipe him down. Odette
          looks all over his body with the flashlight. Despite the blood Roger
          has no injuries.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What happened, son? Where did you get
                      this blood?
          
          But Roger, trembling, just stares, totally traumatized. Children cry.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      He's not injured.
          
          His paralysis freaks the women in the room. Paul turns angrily to them.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Leave us, give us some space.
          
                                                                           36.
          
          He ushers the neighbors out of the room, closes the door.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (to Tatiana)                                              
                      The neighbors must go at dawn.
          
          Tatiana hugs her son.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI. DAWN
          
          The faintest grey of dawn over the city. Then a flock of birds rises as
          one in the distance. A millisecond later, the cause of their flight, a
          grenade explosion, echoes.
          
          The birds dart, in another direction as the STACCATO of a machine gun
          rips the air.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM. DAWN
          
          PAUL sits on the edge of the bed, staring out the window.
          
          Behind him Tatiana has Roger cradled in her arms, he still trembles
          wide eyed as she tries to get him to talk.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Will you take a little milk?
          
          Nothing.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Let him sleep.
          
          The door knocks. The old guard calls in frightened.
          
                                    OLD GUARD (O.S.)
                      Mr. Paul.                                                      
                                  PAUL
                           (to Tatiana)
                      It is time for the neighbors to leave.
          
          He heads for the door.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S LIVING ROOM. DAWN
          
          Paul steps out, closes the door behind him. A small delegation of the
          men wait nervously.
          
                                    JEAN BAPTISTE
                      It is true.
          
          
          
                                                                              37.
          
          He holds up the tiny radio, tuned to the BBC World service, a crackly
          Brit voice. (It's Gloria the reporter.)
          
                                  GLORIA THE REPORTER (O.S.)
                      The Hutu president's plane was struck by
                      a ground-to-air missile as he returned
                      from signing the peace accord with the
                      Tutsi rebels. There were no survivors.
                      The Hutu government has already blamed                         
                      the Tutsi rebels. The rebels have denied                       
                      the accusation. Already there are reports                      
                      of reprisal killings on the streets.  
                                   
          As they listen, a young woman lets out a SQUEAL, and flees the window
          where she's been sitting.
          
                                  WOMEN (O.S.)
                      They are here.
          
          Hysteria in the room, women and children push toward the bedroom. Paul
          manages to make it to the window, nervously steals a glance and sees:
          
          A HUTU ARMY SOLDIER sits on the high wall by the gate. He pulls another
          up beside him.
          
           anic in the room now. Paul turns.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Shut up!
          
          PAUL'S POV: The soldiers drop into his garden. They draw pistols.
          
                                  TATIANA (O.S.)
                      What is it, Paul.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Stay with the children.
          
          PAUL'S POV: The soldiers go to the gate, slide the bolt, swing it open.
          
          Two jeeps, jammed with heavily armed SOLDIERS, sit in the drive like
          many-limbed beasts of war. Paul watches as the jeeps rumble into his
          garden. The soldiers jump out.
          
          INSIDE THE ROOM:
          
          Nothing can stop the women and children from fleeing into the bedrooms.
          Paul is frozen at the CRASH of rifles on the door.
          
          The door gives, SOLDIERS flood in.
          
          They are startled by the crowd in the living room, rifles raised,
          SHOUTS.
          
                                                                           38.
          
                                  SOLDIERS
                      Out, get out now!
          
          Paul pulls himself together, marches over to the soldier.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Who is in charge?
          
          A Captain is at the door.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                      Who are you?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I am Paul Rusesabagina, a good friend of
                      General Bizimungu.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      We are looking for you.
          
          He takes Paul by the arm, leads him outside.
          
          
          EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE. DAWN
          
          The Captain stops by his jeep, studies his clipboard.
          
          Tatiana with Roger in her arms, her kids and all the neighbors herded
          together.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What is this about?
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      Let me see your identity card.
          
          Paul pulls it from his pocket, hands it to the Captain.
          
          CLOSE ON: Paul's ID - it reads Ethnicity: HUTU.
          
          The Captain studies him, waves for the soldiers to back off.
          
                                  CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                      You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered
                      our president.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
          
                                  PAUL
                      No. I work at the Mille Collines.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           39.
          
          The Captain looks confused. Paul quickly:
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      I used to work at the Diplomat.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      Do you know how to open the safe there?
                           (Paul nods)
                      Our government needs to use the hotel and
                      the room keys are in the safe. You must
                      open it.
          
                                   PAUL
                      Of course.
          
          Paul sees out into the street behind the jeeps: a group of Militia in
          their colored shirts armed with machetes, have gathered, trying to see
          what is going on.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Captain, I must take my family.
                      It is not safe here.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      Where is your family?
          
          Tatiana is beside him now.
          
                                  TATIANA
                           (interrupts)                                              
                      This is them.
          
          Tatiana points to the huddled neighbors. Paul is stunned.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      All of them! I cannot take them.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      No, no, good Captain, you do not have to.
                      We have the car and our van.
          
          She points to the Mille Collines van.
          
           he Captain looks doubtful, then his two-way radio barks - an urgent
          message. He listens.
          
          Tatiana drags the kids and ushers everyone toward the van. In a second,
          they are all clambering in.
          
                                   CAPTAIN
                      Let's go.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           40.
          
          Paul jumps behind the wheel of the van. Neighbors are jammed in like
          sardines, 15, more, inside. Tatiana and their kids are squashed
          together on the front bench.
          
          The convoy (jeep - van, car - jeep) starts up and turns out into the
          street.
          
          The Militia men wave sticks, machetes.
          
          
          INT. VAN TRAVELING - DAY
          
          Paul looks back as they speed off down the street.
          
          Sees: The Militia looters pour into his gateway.
          
          As they pass the Caringa home, Militia looters carry off a TV and push
          a stove on a child's skateboard.
          
          TATIANA has Roger on her lap, she cradles his head.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI STREET. DAY
          
          The convoy speeds through the deserted streets. Slowing only to
          maneuver through makeshift roadblocks where Militia wave machetes,
          nailed clubs and spears as they dance.
          
          FURTHER ALONG THE ROAD: a group of Militia swarm over a car, smashing
          the windshield, the windows. Inside a family huddles together in
          terror, waiting for the windows to give way.
          
          In the gutter by the side of the road, three dead bodies.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (to Tatiana)                                             
                      Don't look.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL DIPLOMAT. DAY
          
          The convoy pulls up at this older, shabbier hotel. There are other
          jeeps, and several staff in a panic. The janitor, ROBERT, sees Paul,
          bursts into waves of joy.
          
                                  ROBERT
                      Mr. Paul, sir. Oh, Mr. Paul. We must open                     
                      every door right now for the government.
          
          Paul jumps out of the van, hurries to the lead jeep.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (to the Captain)                                         
                      The safe is in the manager's office.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           41.
          
          The Captain nods to two soldiers.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      Go with him, get the keys.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL DIPLOMAT LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul runs through the lobby. The staff look petrified.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL DIPLOMAT MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul bursts into the room. The two soldiers follow.
          
          He goes to the hotel's big old combination safe, spins the combination
          a few times, tries the handle, clunk! It doesn't open. He's forgotten
          the number.
          
          The soldiers look at him impatiently. Paul improvises.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Gentlemen, you'll find some chocolate,
                      and maybe a few beers in the fridge.
                      Don't let them go to waste.
          
          The soldiers fall over each other to get to the fridge.
          
          Paul tries the safe numbers again, clunk! It opens.
          
          He sees: a big bunch of keys, a wad of dollars, Rwandan francs, a check
          book, and several bottles of the best cognac, whiskey, some Cristal.
          
          He looks round nervously but the two soldiers are busy fighting over
          the beer and chocolates in the fridge.
          
           s they do, Paul, hands trembling, stuffs the wads of notes, into his
          belt, pulls his shirt over and shuts the safe door.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      I've got them.
          
          He is about to leave.
          
                                  SOLDIER 1
                      Wait!
          
          Paul looks back at the soldier.
          
                                  SOLDIER 1 (CONT'D)
                      Sit down.
          
          Paul sits, as the two soldiers guzzle beers and stuff chocolate into
          their pockets.
          
                                                                           42.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL DIPLOMAT LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul hurries through the lobby toward the entrance.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL DIPLOMAT ENTRANCE. DAY
          
          Paul emerges to see:
          
          All of the occupants of the van, Tatiana, his kids, Odette on their
          knees, with their hands on their heads.
          
          The Captain hovers over them, pistol in hand, turns, sees Paul. He
          marches toward him and SLAPS HIM HARD on the face.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                      Traitor!
          
          Paul reels from the blow, but manages to stay on his feet.
          
          The Captain snatches a bunch of ID cards from a soldier, hurls the
          cards in Paul's face.
          
                                  CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                      They are all Tutsi cockroaches.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Let me explain.
          
          He grabs Paul by the scruff of the neck, pushes him toward the kneeling
          captives. The Captain snatches a pistol from one of his soldiers,
          shoves it into Paul's hand.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                      SHOOT THEM!
          
          Paul looks at him.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Please, I don't use guns.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      There is nothing to it.
          
          The Captain raises his own pistol and FIRES it. Everyone jumps with
          fright.
          
                                  CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                      Shoot them now or you die first.
          
          The Captain aims his pistol at Paul's head. Cocks the hammer.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           43.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Captain, what could I pay you not to do
                      this?
          
          The Captain laughs.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      You want to pay me?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Why not? These are not rebels, look at
                      them. Soon they will be worthless to you.
                      Why not take some money, for your work?
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                      How much?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Name a price.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      Ten thousand francs for each one.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I don't have that much.
          
          The Captain laughs, snatches the gun from Paul, marches toward them.
          
                                    PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Wait! Wait!
          
          Paul reaches into his pocket, pulls out the bunch of dollars.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Here, here, a thousand US dollars - fifty
                      thousand francs for my family. To let us
                      drive off to the Mille Collines.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      How many in your family?
          
                                    PAUL
                      Six.
          
          The Captain looks at his soldiers, at the wad of notes.
          
                                   APTAIN
                      Pull your family out.
          
          Paul runs over, grabs Tatiana, Roger, the three girls. Odette kneels
          beside Tatiana. Paul whispers.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Have you any money?
          
                                                                            44.
          
                                    ODETTE
                      Nothing.
          
          Paul pushes his family toward the van, looks back, sees the Captain
          pocket the dollars, move toward the line.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Paul, don't let them die.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (urgent)
                      Get in.
          
          Paul pushes them into the van, shuts the door, digs into his soul for
          all the courage he can muster, then turns back.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Captain, let these people give you some
                      money, whatever they have.
          
          The Captain hesitates. Paul sees this, runs over to the line of
          neighbors.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Give me everything, everything you have.
          
          A pathetic rain of Rwandan francs, useless coins, watches, jewelry
          falls onto the ground. Paul scoops it all up.
          T
          
          he Captain looks at it, takes it, then:
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      There is only enough for one cockroach.
          
          The Captain raises his pistol.
          
                                  CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
                      Pick one to take with you.
          
          Now each terrified neighbor looks to Paul, begging.
          
                                    PAUL
                      Wait, wait.
          
          Paul counts the kneeling figures: ten adults, four kids.
          
                                    PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Ten.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      And four children?
          
          
          
          
                                                                              45.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'll give you a hundred thousand francs
                      for all of them.
          
          The Captain points the gun.
          
                                    CAPTAIN
                      Give me it.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I don't have it here. At the Mille
                      Collines. I can get it for you.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      You will run into the hotel and hide
                      behind the U.N.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand
                      francs, enough for a house. I will get
                      the money, you keep them outside.
          
          The Captain smiles.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      I will keep your family outside. Let's
                      go.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FRONT GATE. DAY
          
          The convoy pulls up at the outer gates of the Mille Collines. It's
          manned by ARMED UN PEACEKEEPERS.
          
           he Captain walks to Paul in the van.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      Go with my soldiers. And hurry back if
                      you want to keep these cockroaches.
          
          The Captain nods to Paul's children.
          
          Paul jumps into the Rwandan army jeep.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (to UN Peacekeepers)                                      
                      I am the manager. Open the gate.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Chaos - UN jeeps, hotel vans, dismayed tourists, frightened Tutsi
          refugees.
          
          
          
                                                                              46.
          
          CLOSE ON: Bik, the Dutch manager, bag packed, anxious, sees Paul.
          YELLS.
          
                                  BIK
                      Paul, I have to talk to you ...
          
          But Paul ignores Bik, barrels his way through the din and crush of the
          parking lot.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul rushes in:   The lobby is filled with Tutsi refugees, and scared
          white tourists.
          
            solitary receptionist, besieged by anxious guests, is relieved to see
          Paul.
          
                                  RECEPTIONIST
                      Oh, sir, please can you...
          
          Paul rushes to the accounting room behind the reception desk, closes
          the door.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul pulls bundles of dollars from the hotel safe.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL. DAY
          
          Paul pushes through the mob at the door. Bik comes up.
          
                                  BIK
                      Paul...                                                        
                            grabs Paul)                                              
                      ...I have to talk to you.                                      
                                   PAUL
                      I'll be back.
          
          Paul breaks free and hurries over to the Army jeep.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (hops in)                                                 
                      Let's go.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FRONT GATE. DAY
          
          Paul jumps from the jeep. Waves to Tatiana in the van, then gives the
          money to the Captain.
          
          
          
                                                                           47.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Now let them go.
          
          No response. Money in hand, the Captain eyes Paul with malice.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Don't be foolish. There's more money to
                      be made here.
          
                                  CAPTAIN
                      You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask
                      for Captain Naramunju.
          
          The Captain smiles, then jumps in his jeep and speeds off. Paul runs to
          the van and jumps in.
          
          INSIDE THE VAN
          
          Jubilation, in the rear of the van. Odette is in tears.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      Thank you, thank you, Paul.
          
          Paul doesn't reply. Tatiana hugs him. He gives her a look - a mix of       
          relief and anger - the crowd in the back almost cost him his family.       
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Paul's van arrives. Bik hangs from a minibus.
          
                                  BIK
                           (shouts)                                                  
                      Paul, I have to go. The staff have fled
                      Kivu Lodge. I have to close it.                                
          
          He flings office keys to Paul.
          
                                  BIK (CONT'D)
                      While I'm away, you're in charge.                              
          
          Bik's van takes off. A group of tourists hears Bik's words.
          
                                  TOURISTS
                      Hey, hey, we need our passports, we want
                      to get a flight.
          
          Paul looks at them.
          
                                  TOURIST
                      They're in your safety boxes. We need
                      them right away.
          
                  
                                                                              48.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Come inside.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          At the desk, the same receptionist is overwhelmed.
          
                                  TOURIST (O.C.)
                      He's in charge, that's him.
          
          Paul goes behind the desk. Rumors fly among the crowd of tourists.
          
                                  TOURISTS
                      (staccato) to the airport...my embassy
                      ...tried to call... the airport is closed
                      ... refund... this is outrageous ...
          
          Behind the tourists, Tatiana and the neighbors look lost.
          
          Paul addresses the frightened Western tourists.  
                                    
                                  PAUL                                               
                      Please, I am the house manager. Return in                      
                      thirty minutes and we will deal with all                       
                      your requests, thank you.     
                                           
          Paul turns to the room key boxes, nearly all are empty.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)                                      
                      What happened to all the rooms?
          
          Finally he finds a key, pushes through to Tatiana, hands a key to
          Odette and Jean Baptiste.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Take this room. Tatiana, bring the
                      children.
          
          Paul starts to lead his family away.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      (re: neighbors) What about them?
          
          Paul looses it.                                                            
                                  PAUL                                               
                      Them. They almost got us all killed. I                         
                      have done enough for them! We cannot look                      
                      after them anymore.
          
                                                                           49.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What are you going to do? You cannot
                      drive them out onto the road. They can                      
                      stay with me.    
                                                     
                                  PAUL                                            
                      What!          
                                                       
                                  TATIANA
                      I will not have them on my conscience.                      
                      They will stay in my room.  
                                          
                                  PAUL
                           (to Zozo)
                      Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms.
                      Put these people in them.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Yes, sir.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY
          
          Paul hurries his family along the corridor. Rwandan refugees wander
          aimlessly pulling their meagre possessions.
          
                                  REFUGEE
                           (calls out)                                            
                      Moses, Moses Seradungu.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Can I help you?
          
                                  REFUGEE
                      I'm looking for Moses Seradungu's room.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What is his room number?
          
                                  REFUGEE
                      I don't know.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Go downstairs, I will help you.
          
          Paul finds his room and opens the door.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAY
          
          PAUL leads his family into a one-bedroom suite. The kids drop to the
          beds exhausted. Tatiana picks up the phone and dials.
          
                                                                           50.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What are you doing?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Trying Thomas and Fedens. We've got to
                      get them here.
          
          Paul paces the room. The maids clearly haven't cleaned it since it's
          last occupants: the beds are unmade; towels are on the floor; and a
          newspaper is scattered across the desk.
          
                                  PAUL
                      (re: room) This won't do.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      It will do just fine.
          
          So Paul tidies the place. As he does,
          
                                  PAUL
                      Any luck?
          
                                  TATIANA
                      No answer. Please send someone to get
                      them, please.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'll try.
          
          Paul leaves.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Paul waits, then a car pulls up, an Indian businessman, Mr. Garindi,
          gets out, shakes hands, he's shaken.
          
                                  MR. GARINDI
                      Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies                      
                      everywhere. I cannot stay here.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I need a great favor.
          
          He hands Mr. Garindi an address.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      I need you to go to this address and
                      bring my brother-in-law and his family.
          
                                  MR. GARINDI
                      No, no. This is a very dangerous part of
                      town. I cannot do this.
          
                                                                            51.
          
                                  PAUL
                      This would be an enormous favor to me. I                     
                      am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this                    
                      nonsense is over I will be most grateful.    
                          
                                  MR. GARINDI
                      I will see what I can do.
          
          Mr. Garindi climbs back into his car.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul stops just shy of the lobby. Around the corner is a mob of angry
          guests. Paul takes a moment to gather himself: straightens his tie;
          button his jacket; flick a piece of lint from his shoulder. Then he
          takes a breath and steps around the corner.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Thank you for your patience, ladies and                      
                      gentlemen. Now, how can I help you.    
                                
          The mob rushes him.
          
                                                                      CUT TO:
          
          Paul works the front desk as angry guests surge all around him. Zozo
          emerges from the office with two tourists.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Where are the receptionists? Where's
                      Gregoire?
          
                                  ZOZO
                      He has taken the presidential suite.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What!

                      a smell of cockroaches? If I were to                           
                      leave this room, I'm sure I could find                         
                      this smell. I know people who could                            
                      cleanse it.(stares) But maybe it doesn't                       
                      bother you? Why is that? Are used to this                      
                      smell? Not me, I need a clean room to                          
                      escape it.         
                                                      
          Gregoire closes the door. Paul's eyes burn with anger, but this battle     
          will have to wait.

          Paul comes into the lobby and discovers Colonel Oliver, he is escorting    
          a tall, well-dressed man, the Tutsi Minister of Finance XAVIER and his
          family.

                      Paul will look after you.
          
                                  XAVIER
                      I will need a suite.

          He moves over to Zozo.

                      people there right away.
          
          There's a commotion by the door. Paul goes over.
          
          A valet stops a group of Tutsi refugees from entering.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      What's going on?
          
                                  VALET
                      Sir, they have no reservations.
          
          Paul studies the group, - a ragged bunch, no way are they Mille

                      I said everyone go over there.
          
          Paul sees: UN Colonel Oliver giving an interview to the BBC in front of

                      No. But I fear it's intention may have

                         Can I have your name again?
          
                                     PAUL (O.S.)
                         Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The
                         house manager. I met you on your last
                         visit.
          
                                     SABENA PRESIDENT
                         Yes, Paul, I remember. The Mille Collines
                         is a very important property for Sabena.
                         Our directors believe we should close
                         down, shutter the place until this unrest
                         is over?
          
          This is really bad news. Paul can't allow them to close.
          
                                     PAUL
                         Sir, that would be very bad for our                       
                         reputation. We are an oasis of calm for                   
                         all our loyal customers. What would they                  
                         think if Sabena deserted them now? (lies)                 
                         I assure you the United Nations has                       
                         everything under control.
          
          IN THE SABENA PRESIDENT
          
          He looks at the others.
          
                                     SABENA PRESIDENT
                         Very well. But if this thing gets worse,
                         we must close. If there's anything you
                         need, call anytime.
          
                                     PAUL

          INT. HOTEL BANQUET ROOM. NIGHT

                        This is my letter of appointment, signed
                        by Mr. Godefroid, the president of
                        Sabena. The Mille Collines is a five star
                        establishment, we will run it that way.
                        If you don't want to work for me, then
                        leave now.
          
          No one moves.
          
                                    PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I want the hallways cleaned now, a menu
                        prepared for the dining room. Where's the
                        pianist?
          
          A hand goes up.
          
                                    PAUL (CONT'D)
                        I want you on the piano in the Kigali
                        Room tonight. Back to work.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. MORNING
          
          Paul emerges to find more refugees, some settled on the lawn, others
          gathered in clumps by the doorway.
          
          Paul calls over to the valet.
          
                                    PAUL
                        Take these people to the rear car park,
                        they can't stay here.
          
          Suddenly women and children on the lawn scream and run in fear. Behind
          them bushes shake, then suddenly a bloody figure wearing only boxer
          shorts bursts out from among the trees and flees to the middle of the
          driveway. It's the journalist, BENEDICT, covered in blood. His ear has
          been chopped off.
          
          PANDEMONIUM. As Paul runs to him, calls to Zozo.
          
                                      PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Get Odette!
          
                                                                                    
          
          
                                                                           58.
          
          Paul grabs Benedict, tries to calm him.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      What happened?
          
                                  BENEDICT
                      They're killing everyone. The Lady
                      Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the
                      gate.
          
          He points down the driveway. This sparks many of the women refugees,
          and white guests, to flee inside the hotel.
          
          Odette arrives with her bag, leads Benedict inside.
          
          Jock has been filming all of this.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL DRIVEWAY. DAY
          
          Now Jock runs, camera still on his shoulder, toward the gate.
          
          Paul takes off after him.
          
          More Tutsi refugees running up the driveway in fear.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FRONT GATE. DAY
          
          As Jock films, Paul arrives by the gate house. UN soldiers watch the
          outside road. Engines roar, then.
          
          A convoy of Toyota trucks circle on the road outside the gate. Drunken
          Militia men on the back wave spears, machetes, one, in a woman's disco
          wig, waves a cordless power drill. The drill bit is red with blood.
          
          In the next truck, TWO Militia MEN triumphantly taunt the UN soldiers
          as they hold blue UN helmets high on sticks. The helmets are shot
          through with holes.
          
                                  MILITIAMAN #1
                      We kill UN. We kill you next.
          
          ENRAGED UN SOLDIERS cock their weapons, aim.
          
          A UN armored car races past the Militia and turns into the driveway.
          The back door opens, UN Colonel Oliver jumps out.  
                                 
                                  COLONEL OLIVER
                      Hold the line here. Do not shoot!
          
          The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive     
          by. Paul approaches Oliver                                                
          
                         
          
          
                                                                           59.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What's happening?
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                      They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians
                      who I sent to get the lady minister.
          
                                      PAUL
                      Where is she?         
                                                  
          Oliver shakes his head. He helps Paul clamber into the armored car.
                                                                         
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul follows Oliver as he marches through the lobby. Several reporters    
          surround them.
          
                                  REPORTERS

                      Are all ten dead?
          
          Paul watches the UN command disappear into an elevator.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY
          
          Paul is in the corridor, talking to Tatiana.    
                                    
                                  PAUL

                      No, Odette says he's in shock.   
                                       
                                  PAUL                                              
                      How can we help him.        
                                            
                                  TATIANA                                           
                      He needs to be in a safe place.                               
                           (a beat)
                      Have you heard from Mr. Garindi? 
                                       
                                  PAUL

          There's a clank of metal. Paul looks and sees:                            
          A waiter struggling with a trolley of food by a door.                     
          He hurries to help the waiter as Jock opens, indicates quiet, waves
          Paul and the waiter in.

                      gruesome ambush of a ten man Belgian
                      patrol has left the UN peacekeeping force

          seated on the ground. Two Militia emerge from the crowd, waving
          machetes. They SLASH their way along the line, savage, powerful blows,
          butchering people like cattle.          (Author note: we will use real
          news footage of this)

          Gloria snaps out of her shock, snatches the phone, dials.
          
                                                                           62.

          She puts the phone down, turns to the others, triumphant.
          
          An embarrassed silence in the room. Jock is disgusted by her glee. He
          picks up a plate from the trolley.
          
                                  JOCK

          She storms out. Paul fills the embarrassed silence.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'm glad you filmed this. Now the West
                      will have to stop it. Excuse me,

          EXT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. EVENING
          
          The businessman Mr. Garindi knocks on room 211. Paul opens the door,
          sees him, then turns back to Tatiana.
          
                                     PAUL
                      Tatsi, come.
          
          Tatsi appears at the door with several of the kids.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      (to the kids) Go back inside.
          
          The kids do as they're told. Paul and Tatsi shut the door and join the
          businessman in the hall.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Did you find the twins?
          
          Tatiana clings to Paul, fearful of the news.
          
                                  MR. GARINDI
                      I made it to the house but it was empty.
                      It had been robbed.
          
                                     TATIANA
                      Oh God.
          
                            
          
                                                                              63.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Was there blood?
          
                                  MR. GARINDI
                      No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old
                      woman, waved to me. I went to her house.
                      She has the little girls. They are safe.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      My brother, his wife. Did this woman know
                      of them? Did they leave the children with
                      her?
          
          The businessman shakes his head no. Tears run down Tatiana's face. She
          holds Paul's arm to stop from falling to the floor.
          
                                  PAUL
                      This is not bad news, Tatsi. Perhaps they
                      fled or could not make it home. There is
                      hope.
          
                                  TATIANA
                           (to the businessman)
                      Please go back, bring the children to us.
          
                                  MR. GARINDI
                      (frightened)No ma'am, I cannot do that.
                      The roadblocks are everywhere. They are
                      looking for children. They shout, "Kill
                      the babies to clear the infestation."
                      Leave them be, they are safe. I have to
                      go now.
          
          Paul takes a small wad of notes from his pocket, presses it into the
          businessman's hand.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Thank you for your help.
          
          He leaves. Tatiana pulls Paul to her.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      My sister is dead, Paul. They would not
                      leave the children.
          
                                  PAUL
                      No. They are not dead. Stop this.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul and Tatiana push through the French tourists and AID workers
          running across the lobby.
          
                                                                            64.
          
                                   FRENCH TOURISTS
                       Mon Dieu, Merci.
          
          Cheers break out. Paul and Tatsi peer from the crowd and through the
          lobby window see:
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL DRIVEWAY. DAY
          
          French and Italian special forces pull into the parking lot, standing
          tall in their jeeps, macho western super troops, triumphant. Salvation!
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Wild cheering, flowers draped around necks, kisses. Westerners,
          Rwandans, dance and sing in celebration.
          
          Paul SEES: Colonel Oliver off to the side, with the commanders of the      
          French special forces.
          
          
                      OLIVER
          CLOSE ON:                                                                  
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                       You have a battalion, you could stop this
                       now. The Hutu army is no match for you.
          
                                   FRENCH COMMANDER
                       Those are not our orders.
          
          Oliver pulls off his blue beret, throws it on the ground, points his       
          finger at the French and Italian officers.
          
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                       You will remember this day for the rest
                       of your lives.
          
          He walks off, returns, picks up his beret.
          
          Paul watches as he storms into the lobby.
          
          Paul follows.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL BAR. DAY
          
          Paul follows the Colonel into the Kigali Club. The place is empty, the     
          bartender missing, gone to celebrate.
          
                                   PAUL
                       Colonel, what can I get you?                                  
          Paul gets behind the bar.
          
                                                                           65.
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                      Anything. Strong.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Canadian Club?
          
          Oliver cracks a weary smile. Paul pours two drinks, slides one across.    
          He raises his glass.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Congratulations, Colonel. You have saved                      
                      us all.
          
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                                   
                            (raw cynicism)
                      Congratulations. You should spit in my
                      face.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Excuse me, Colonel.                                           
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                      We think you are dirt, less than dirt,
                      worthless.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I don't understand.
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                      Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the
                      smartest man here. You have them all
                      eating out of your hand. You'd own this
                      fucking hotel, except for one thing.
          
          Paul doesn't answer.
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D)                           
                      You're fucking black! You're not even a
                      nigger, you're African!
                           (downs his drink)
                      They're not staying to stop this thing.
                      They're gonna fly right out of here with
                      their people.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (shocked)
                      Their people?
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                      They're only taking the whites.
          
                               
          
                                                                           66.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. DAY
          
          Paul opens the door. Tatiana and the kids pack bags, prepare to leave.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Children, go into the hallway.
          
          Tatiana and the children stop what they're doing, puzzled.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      (to the kids) Please, go.
          
          The kids leave.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What's wrong?
          
          Paul takes her hands in his.
          
                                  PAUL
                      All the whites are leaving.
          
          Tatiana's grip tightens.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      They are being evacuated.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What about us?
          
                                  PAUL
                      We have been abandoned.
          
          Tatiana clings to hope.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      The soldiers will stop the killers.
          
          Paul looses it.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Listen to me woman. I said all the whites
                      are leaving. The French, the Italians,
                      even the Belgian UN soldiers.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      But who is left?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I don't know. Colonel Oliver says the UN                      
                      has three hundred soldiers for the whole
                      country. Black soldiers, Pakistanis.
          
          
          
          
                                                                              67.
          
          He looks up at her.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      The most the Colonel can spare for the                           
                      hotel are four men, and they're not
                      allowed to shoot.
          
          He takes her hand, makes her sit down.
          
                                   PAUL (CONT'D)
                      If anything should happen, if the Militia
                      arrive, you must take the children and go
                      to the roof.
          
          Tatiana's eyes are wide with fear.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What for?
          
          Paul takes his anger out on Tatiana.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Do what I say, woman. You hear me? I will
                      meet you there.
          
          He storms out.
          
                                                                         CUT TO:

          REVEAL: A chaos of luggage, white tourists, AID agency people, Italian
          and French soldiers, elite, slick.
          
          On the edges, clumps of Rwandans, watching, silent, fearful.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          A torrential African rain storm soaks everything. Porters with big
          umbrellas run the white evacuees to the buses.
          
          French and Italian commanders check off names on clipboards.
          
          Jock films the evacuees boarding buses.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          At the front desk, Paul, dripping wet from working the convoy,    listens
          to a French tourist who refuses to pay his bill.

                                     FRENCH TOURIST
                         Why should I pay to stay in a, in a
                         holocaust? Tell me.
          
          Paul, stone-faced, polite, destroys this asshole.
          
                                     PAUL
                         You are not staying sir, you are leaving.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Paul watches in the rain as the final agency people are being loaded
          onto buses.
          
          Several white aid workers weep uncontrollably as they are dragged away
          from frightened Rwandan coworkers.
          
             PAUL in the rain.
          
           cross the parking lot Colonel Oliver watches from his jeep.              
          Jock and his sound man embrace two beautiful young HOOKERS.
          
          One girl begs Jock to take her with him.
          
                                     HOOKER
                         Please, please, they will put me on the
                         street. They will chop me.
          
                                     JOCK
                         Darlin', believe me, if I could...
          
          He digs in his pockets, pulls out money, cigarettes. Everything he has
          he gives to her.
          
          Then he pulls her toward Paul, digs out his wallet.
          
                                       JOCK (CONT'D)
                         Here. Here.
          
          He pushes two Visa cards into Paul's hands.
          
                                     JOCK (CONT'D)
                         Give her what she wants, room, food,
                         anything. Charge it all. Don't you put
                         her out, Paul.
          
                                     PAUL
                         I would never do that.
          
                                     JOCK
                         I know that, Paul. I'm sorry.                              
                         Here take this.

          Jock pulls a Rolex off his wrist.  
                                                  
                                  PAUL
                      This is a Rolex, I can't take it.   
                                     
                                  JOCK                                               
                      Take it for Christ sake. I wish it was a                       
                      fucking aeroplane.       
                                                
          Jock embraces Paul, tears in his eyes.
          
          Gloria watches from the doorway. Embarrassed by Jock, She becomes
          officious.

                           (turns on her)
                      Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are
                      we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are
                      you? Well, are ya'?

                      You're drunk.
          
          Gloria marches onto the bus.

                      What are we waiting for?
          
                                  FRENCH SOLDIER
                      We have to evacuate some nuns from a
                      convent. They are on their way.
          
          Jock kisses the hooker, heaves his camera onto the bus.
          
          Then there is a disturbance on the driveway.
          
          A group of French nuns, along with maybe a hundred Tutsi women and
          children come running up the driveway. They are all terrified. One nun
          leads them with a French flag.
          
          French soldiers run forward. A commander orders them to form   a line,
          blocking the refugees.
          
          French soldiers begin pulling nuns from the terrified crowd.
          
          Several nuns begin hysterically weeping, pulling Rwandan children with
          them. Panic breaks out among the crowd.
          
                                                                           70.

          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Nuns cling to young children. French soldiers wrench the nuns away,
          lift them off their feet, carry them to the bus.
          
          JOCK films, as A FRENCH OFFICER screams at him.
          
          The last nun is dragged onto a bus.
          
          Jock looks to Paul, then gets on the bus.
          
          The convoy - French jeeps, buses, Italian jeeps, UN jeeps takes off,
          through the refugees, turns a corner, gone.
          
          Paul, drenched, is left alone to fend for his new guests:                 
          Weeping women, frightened children.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FRONT GATE. DAY
          
          The convoy passes the gate house.
          
          Across the road, two jeeps of Rwandan Army soldiers watch the convoy
          leave. They get on the radio.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Where five minutes before the lobby was a frenzy of wealthy Europeans
          and aid workers, the groups of clustered black faces are silent except
          for the crying of babies and sobbing mothers. Paul picks his way among
          them. Zozo catches up.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      What do we do with all these people?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Open up the ballroom, we'll put them
                      there. And Zozo tell the kitchen to make
                      rice and beans - a lot of it.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. DAY.
          
          Paul enters, drops to the bed. Tatiana curls up next to him.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      You could leave, Paul.
          
                
          
          
                                                                           71.

                        Your card says Hutu. Take our children,
                        go and get the twins, pay money at the

                        Enough of this. We stay together. Let me
                        rest, I will feel better then.
          
          Paul puts on his walkman earphones, presses play, the rich cowboy drawl
          of Don Williams singing ???
          
          Close on: Paul as his eyes droop and to the music.
          
          A kalidiscope of colors filter through drooping eyelids as
          
          Close on Paul's face, as the music plays.
          
          His eyes open wide, disturbed, music playing
          
          Paul's POV, an Army lieutenant stands over him, other soldiers around.
          
          The lieutenant reaches down, pulls the earphones from Paul's ears.
          
                                    LIEUTENANT
                        You are the manager?

                        Yes, sir. What is wrong?

                        Everyone must leave the hotel now.
          
                                    PAUL
                        Why sir?
          
                                    LIEUTENANT
                        It's an order. Get everyone out now.
          
                                    PAUL
                        I...ah...need some time. Please give us
                        twenty, thirty minutes. People are
                        sleeping.
          
          The lieutenant is not impressed.
          
                                    PAUL (CONT'D)
                        Please, have some cold drinks. I will be
                        as quick as I can.
          
          'Cold drinks' softens the soldiers' attitudes.
          
          
          
                                                                           72.
          
                                  LIEUTENANT
                      We will be outside, ten minutes.
          
          The soldiers march off. Paul goes back inside. The kids, sensing the
          menace, sit still and wide-eyed on the floor. Suddenly Tatiana notices     
          Roger is missing.                                                          
                                  TATIANA                                            
                      Where's Roger?        
                                                   
          Danielle points to under the bed.    
                                                
          CLOSE ON:                                                                  
          Roger trembling under the bed, as Paul's face appears.   
                            
                                  PAUL                                               
                      Come on son, everything is all right.                          
          He slides him out, clutches him in his arms, then turns him over to
          Tatiana as he phones the front desk. 
                                                
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)

                      Who is this? Zozo. I know. Get them beer.                      
          
          He turns to Tatiana.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Go to the roof now.
          
                                  TATIANA
                           (terrified)
                      What for Paul.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (forceful)
                      Do as I say. I will be there soon.
          
          He hurries out.

          Paul's door opens, his head appears round the corner.
          
          The corridor is empty of soldiers. Now, frightened Tutsis peer out from
          their rooms. A group of men, among them the politician Xavier, are
          gathered in the hallway. Paul spots one man holding a pistol. He runs
          up.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (to the man with the pistol)
                      Are you mad? They will gun us all down.
          
                                                                           73.
          
                                  PISTOL MAN
                      Better to die by the bullet than the
                      machete.
          
          Paul pulls the gun off him.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Wait here, please.
          
          Paul hands the gun to Xavier, hurries off.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul bursts in, sits by the phone and dials.
          
                                  PAUL (ON PHONE)
                      Good day, General Bizimungu please. Do
                      you know where he is? Please ask him to
                      call Paul Rusesabagina. It is urgent.
          
          Phone again.
          
          A SERIES OF FLASH CUTS: increasingly frantic calls.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Colonel Bagsora. Where? Can you find him?
          
          ANOTHER CALL:
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Who would order such a thing?
          
          ANOTHER CALL:
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Did you find the General?
          
          Paul hangs up the phone defeated. He looks at his watch. His head flops
          onto the desk, onto the Sabena logo. He sees it.
          
          
          INT. SABENA PRESIDENT'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          The Sabena president and two VPs sit on couches.
          
                                  PRESIDENT
                      If British Airways abandons the route we
                      should bid for it.
          
          His intercom buzzes, he's annoyed then.
          
                            
          
                                                                             74.
          
                                  SECRETARY (ON PHONE)
                      I'm sorry, sir. I have a call from Paul
                      in Kigali. He says it's urgent.
          
          The president goes to the phone, hits the speaker button.
          
                                  PRESIDENT
                      Paul. Are you alright?
          
                                  PAUL (O.S.)
                      We have a big problem. The Hutu army have
                      come and ordered us all of us out of the
                      hotel.
          
          The president is baffled.
          
                                   RESIDENT
                      Out? Where are you going?
          
                                   PAUL
                      I do not know, sir. I think they will
                      kill us all.
          
          The president can barely form words to reply.
          
                                  PRESIDENT
                      All. What do you mean all?
          
                                  PAUL
                      The staff, the guests.
          
                                  PRESIDENT
                      The staff and guests! How many?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Now we have eight hundred guests and one
                      hundred staff. I have ten minutes left.
                      I wish I could have done more, sir.
                      Please, thank all my friends at Sabena.
                      You have been good to me and my family.
          
                                  PRESIDENT
                      (panicked) Paul, wait, wait, I'm going to
                      put you on hold for one minute, stay on
                      the phone.
          
          He hits the hold button. Looks to the other executives. They are
          stunned to silence by Paul's profound farewell.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul listens to music on the phone.
          
          
                                                                           75.
          
          
          INT. SABENA EXTERIOR OFFICES. DAY
          
          Pandemonium - the president has everyone working the phones.
          
                                  PRESIDENT
                      Get the prime minister's office. Call
                      General Chareaux. Louis get the UN. Tell
                      them this is Belgian property.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          The music is suddenly interrupted.
          
                                  PRESIDENT (O.S.)
                      Paul, are you there?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes, thank you Mr. President.
          
                                  PRESIDENT (O.S.)
                      Paul, if you have one call in all the
                      world to stop this, who would you call?
          
          Paul thinks.
          
                                  PAUL
                      The French. They supply the Rwandan army.
          
                                  PRESIDENT (O.S.)
                      Paul, do everything you can to buy time.
                      I will call you back.
          
          Paul hurries from the room.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Zozo at the computer, printing something. Paul walks up, sees: The
          Hotel's Registry printing. Paul grabs it, studies.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What are you doing?
          
                                  ZOZO
                      The lieutenant wants the register.
          
          He pushes Zozo toward the elevator.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Go and get more beer.
          
          Now Paul is on the computer, typing.
          
                                                                           76.
          
          ON SCREEN: The register shows that day's date: April 13.
          
          Paul hits a few keys.
          
          ON SCREEN: The date above the register is April 4.
          
          Paul hits the print button. The printer clicks to life.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Paul with the printed registry and Zozo with beer walk to the jeeps.
          The soldiers don't wait for the Captain's order, they mob Zozo, grab
          beers. The lieutenant marches up to Paul.
          
                                  LIEUTENANT
                      Where's the guest list?
          
          Paul hands him the printout. He studies it, reads.
          
                                  LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)
                      Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier. What is this?
          
                                  PAUL
                      The guest list. It hasn't been updated
                      since the murder of the president.
          
          The lieutenant grabs Paul by the shirt.
          
                                  LIEUTENANT
                      Are you trying to make a fool of me?
                      There are no Europeans left in that
                      hotel. Get me the names of all the
                      cockroaches in there.
          
                                  PAUL
                      That will take time.
          
                                  LIEUTENANT
                      You don't have time. If I do not have the
                      names, so that I can pick out the
                      traitors, then I will kill everyone here
                      in this car park. Get in there now.
          
          Paul turns to walk back in. The lieutenant hurries to his men, pulls
          beers from their hands, smashes them on the ground. One soldier comes
          running to him with a radio. Paul watches. The lieutenant listens, then
          calls to Paul.
          
                                  LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)
                      Hey you, come here.
          
          Paul returns.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           77.
          
                                     LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)
                         Who did you call?
          
                                      PAUL
                         Call, sir?
          
                                     LIEUTENANT
                         Don't lie to me. What's your name?
          
                                     PAUL
                         Rusesabagina. Paul Rusesabagina.
          
                                     LIEUTENANT
                         I will remember that name. (turns to his
                         soldiers) Let's go.
          
          The soldiers roar off down the driveway.
          
             ZOZO looks to Paul, a thank you Jesus look.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL ROOF. DAY
          
          Paul emerges onto the roof, sees Tatiana, his children, and many of the
          neighbors sitting huddled together. (They do not know the soldiers have
          left.)
          
          Tatiana is frozen to the spot.
          
                                     PAUL
                         They have gone.
          
          Tatiana grabs him. Tears of joy. Paul's neighbors swarm him, touch him,
          thank him like a messiah. This effects him. He seems genuinely moved as
          he shakes hands and hugs them.
          
                                     ZOZO
                         Sir. The president of Sabena is on the

          Paul arrives behind the front desk.
          
          Paul hits the button.
          
                                     PAUL
                         They are gone. Thank you, sir. What did
                         you do?

                                  SABENA PRESIDENT
                      I managed to get the President of France
                      on the phone.
          
                                  PAUL (O.S.)
                      Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
          
                                  SABENA PRESIDENT
                      Paul, I pleaded with the president to go
                      in and get you all. He told me it will
                      not happen.
          
                                     PAUL
                      Why?
          
                                  SABENA PRESIDENT
                      I can give you many political answers
                      Paul but the truth is that Africa is not
                      worth a single vote to all of them:
                      French, British, Americans.
          
          Silence.

                      You have to get out of there, Paul. I
                      will do whatever I can.
          
                                                                 SMASH CUT TO:

                      There will be no rescue, no intervention

                      will happen to us. Say goodbye but when
                      you say goodbye, say it as though you're
                      reaching through and shaking their hand.
                      Let them know if they let go of that
                      hand, you will die. (silence) We must
                      shame them into sending help.
          
          The others look stunned.
          
                                                                           79.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Get on the phones while we still can. At
                      least we can say they heard our cries.
                      Zozo come with me.
          
          Paul leaves.
          
                                                                      CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul looks around the lobby. It resembles a refugee center more than a
          five star hotel.
          
          He turns to a computer, calls up the register, then hits DELETE and
          erases the register.
          
          He picks up the phone, calls.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Send two of the housekeeping carpenters
                      to the lobby.
          
          Paul strides across the lobby, calls to Zozo.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Everyone gather together now. Zozo get
                      them all together.
          
          They herd together quickly.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      No one can remain in this lobby any
                      longer. I have rooms available. Who can
                      pay? The rental is six hundred francs per
                      day.
          
          About fifty percent of the hands go up.
          
                                  TUTSI WOMAN
                      I cannot pay?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Go with Zozo to the ballroom. We will
                      find you bedding. This is a hotel. No one
                      will be allowed to stay in the lobby.
          
          The carpenters arrive beside Paul.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Good. I want you to go around and take
                      all the numbers off the doors.
          
                                 
          
                                                                            80.
          
                                  CARPENTER
                      What shall we put in their place.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Nothing. I want no numbers on the doors.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY
          
          Paul going door to door, knocking. The rooms are all packed with Tutsi
          refugees. A door opens.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Good day. Here is your bill for the last
                      week. If you cannot pay, or think you
                      will not be able to pay, go to the
                      ballroom. Zozo will take care of you.
          
                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY.
          
          Paul knocks on a door. The Tutsi politician Xavier opens the door, sees
          that it is Paul.
          
                                  XAVIER
                      Come in Paul.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LUXURY SUITE. DAY
          
          A beautiful two-bedroom suite. Xavier lives in comfort compared to the
          other refugees.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'm afraid you will have to move room.
          
                                  XAVIER
                      Move? Where to?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'm going to put you on the third floor.
          
                                  XAVIER
                      The third floor are low class rooms.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes they are. However if the army return
                      they will expect important people such as
                      yourself to be in these grand rooms.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           81.
          
                                  XAVIER
                           (to his wife)
                      Pack the bags, we have to move.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Also, this is your bill for the last
                      week.
          
          Paul leaves, Xavier looks shocked.
          
                                                                     FADE TO:
          
          
          MONTAGE
          
          Paul and influential refugees, Odette, Benedict (with a bandage over
          his missing ear), Xavier and others call, plead, write and send faxes
          all around the world. We see this NIGHT and DAY; DAY and NIGHT --
          
           hen Odette on the phone.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      Yes, that's right. I helped set up the
                      treatment center in Nairobi. I'm in the
                      Mille Collines Hotel right now with my
                      husband, Peter, and my two boys. If you
                      do not help us we will be murdered.
          
          Zozo arrives.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Sir, General Bizimungu is here.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL POOL TERRACE. DAY
          
          The pool patio is deserted except for General Bizimungu and three
          soldiers who lounge at a table. Gregoire and his girlfriend sun on
          reclining deck chairs like movie stars. Paul and a waiter with a tray
          of drinks join the General.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      I am glad you are well.
          
          Paul hands the scotch to Bizimungu.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie.
          
                                   GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      As long as it is scotch.
                            (drinks)
                      Your white friends have abandoned you,
                      Paul.
          
                                 
          
                                                                          82.
          
                                  PAUL
                      The United Nations are still here.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      (laughs) The United Nations. Madmen are
                      on the streets, Paul. But I will take
                      care of you. (chugs his drink) Your
                      cellar is well-stocked, right?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes, General. I am glad you came by. I
                      overheard something that I think you
                      should know about.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      What did you overhear?
          
                                  PAUL
                      A discussion between an American Embassy
                      official and a UN Colonel.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      What did they say?
          
                                  PAUL
                      The American assured the colonel that
                      they would watch everything.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Watch everything? How? They are gone.
          
          Paul points surreptitiously to the sky. The General looks up.
          
                                    PAUL
                      Satellites.
          
                                    GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Satellites?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes, they can photograph the epaulets on
                      your shoulder.
          
                                   ENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      And what will they do with these
                      satellites?
          
                                  PAUL
                      The American said intervention is too
                      costly, better to get photographic
                      evidence and snatch up the high command.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      The high command? Our high command?
          
                         
          
                                                                           83.
          
                                  PAUL
                      'Snatch them up and put on a war crimes
                      trial. Lock them all away forever. No
                      political risk, and big publicity.'
                      That's what he said. (a beat) I thought
                      I'd better tell you.
          
          The General looks again to the sky then.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      The Americans! Who are they to put us on
                      trial. Let us imagine Paul when their
                      president Kennedy was shot, they said it
                      was a black man. Then their politicians,
                      their radio stations gave orders `we must
                      wipe out these black people before they
                      wipe out us.' What do you think would
                      have happened? No different.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Indeed, general. Excuse me momentarily.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL CELLAR. DAY
          
          Paul fills Bizimungu's briefcase with scotch, hands two six-packs of
          beer to Zozo. Paul notes his once packed storeroom, now considerably
          dwindled in stock.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Where has all our beer gone?
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Sir, Gregoire has been taking beers.
          
                                  PAUL
                      How much beer?
          
                                    ZOZO
                      Many beers.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL POOL TERRACE. AFTERNOON
          
          Paul arrives back at the pool, hands Bizimungu his briefcase. Zozo
          gives the beer to the soldiers.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I am worried about thieves and criminals
                      coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could
                      arrange for some police to guard us.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      The police are very busy.
          
          
                                                                             84.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I understand General, but when I last                            
                      talked to the president of Sabena he                             
                      promised me that anyone who helped                               
                      protect Belgian property would be                                
                      rewarded.                                                        
          
          Bizimungu understands this is a financial proposition.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU                                    
                      He did.                                                          
                                  PAUL                                                 
                      "Well rewarded" Those were his words.   
                                   
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      If I were to spare a few policemen, where
                      would I station them?
          
                                  PAUL
                      The front gate would be best, General.
                      They could check all guests.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      I will see what I can do.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I admire you, General. How do you keep
                      command of your men amidst such madness?
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I wish I were like you. Look at my staff,
                      they won't work, they listen to no one.
          
          Paul nods over toward Gregoire.
          
                                     ENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      He is staff?
          
           he General gets up.
          
          Gregoire, who is lying face down on the deck chair, doesn't see him
          approach. The General pulls the deck chair from underneath Gregoire and
          throws it into the pool. As Gregoire tries to scramble to his feet, the
          General propels him forward with a massive kick up the ass.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU (CONT'D)
                      Get to work, you slug.
          
          Gregoire races from the pool, followed by his girlfriend.
          
                                                                           85.
          
          The General clicks his fingers and his soldiers follow.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU (CONT'D)
                      Make sure, Paul, your guests are
                      generous.
          
          
          INT. LOBBY. DAY
          
          Benedict greets Paul in the lobby.
          
                                   BENEDICT
                      Paul, we would like to speak to you in
                      your office.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We, who is we?
          
                                  BENEDICT
                      A delegation.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul walks in and discovers the office packed with the elite Tutsi
          refugees including Xavier, Odette and Jean Baptiste. Paul's puzzled,
          there's an air of tension in the room.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Yes.
          
          A brief silence, then a Tutsi bank manager speaks.
          
                                  BANKER
                      You have no right to charge us rent.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Why not?
          
                                  BANKER
                      This is no longer a hotel, it is a prison
                      and you are profiteering from our misery.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      That is not true.
          
          Another accuser speaks up.
          
                                  TUTSI ACCUSER
                      Yes it is. He charges for food, for
                      everything. Where is all this money
                      going? We hear he has a deal with
                      Bizimungu.
          
          
                                                                            86.
          
                                  TUTSI ACCUSER #2
                      It is said that you work for the murderer
                      George Rutagunda.
          
          Murmurs of agreement. Paul has heard enough.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I confess. ( a beat) It's true I have a
                      deal with General Bizimungu. He was just
                      here. I worked out another money making
                      scheme for him. New arrivals will be
                      taxed at the gate.
          
          Silence.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Do you know what my deal is with
                      Bizimungu. I pay him and he keeps you
                      alive. Anyone want to take their money
                      back?
          
          PAUL pulls money from his pocket, hands it around, offers it.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Here, here take it. And you don't have to
                      pay your bill. I will move you into the
                      ballroom or out into the gardens.
          
          He walks among them.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      And, yes, I work with George Rutagunda.
                      I buy rice and beans, beer and soap. I
                      will have to visit his warehouse soon
                      because we are running out of food. Who
                      wants to come with me?
          
          Paul holds the door open.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Anyone who wants to come with me stay
                      behind. If not, please leave.
          
          They hurry out, duly chastised. But Odette and her husband Jean
          Baptiste remain.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                           (laughs)
                      You are most certainly not coming with
                      me. You will get me killed.
          
                                  JEAN BAPTISTE
                      You can't go to that place, they know
                      what you are doing here.
          
          
          
          
                                                                           87.
          
                                  PAUL
                      George will not hurt me, I am too
                      profitable to him.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      What if he is not there?
          
          Paul hasn't got an answer for that one. He leads them out.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Roger is asleep, on a couch in the living room, several kids sleep on
          the floor.
          
          TO THE BED: Where Tatiana suppresses bursts of laughter as Paul relates
          the Gregoire story in whispers.
          
                                  PAUL
                      As soon as the General left he came
                      running back. (mimics Gregoire) Help me,
                      sir, I have been possessed by a witch.
                      (Paul's own voice now) A witch you say?
                      (mimics) Yes, yes, I did not know I was
                      in that room. The president's room, why
                      would I be in the president's room? (own
                      voice) Indeed, the General asked me the
                      same. (mimics) Asked you what? (own
                      voice) Does Gregoire think he is
                      president now?
          
          PAUL mimics Gregoire's whimpers of fear.
          
                                  TATIANA
                           (laughing)
                      Stop, stop, we will waken the children.
          
          Paul lifts the bottle of fine bordeaux, pours more.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Lynch Bages, 84. Perfect with lamb, or
                      fine rare beef.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      So where is the lamb?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Maybe Gregoire and the witch ate it.
          
          They both chuckle, then Paul remembers, a cloud of anxiety comes over
          him.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What's the matter?
          
              
          
                                                                          88.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We're running out of beer and other
                      supplies.
          
          She kisses him.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      The foreigners abandon us and you do
                      inventory. You are so conscientious.
          
          She kisses him again, tries to cheer him.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I have to go out to get food.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Go out! Where?
          
                                  PAUL
                      To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      No, no.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I have to, Tatiana, we are only as                         
                      valuable as the service we provide.                        
                                  TATIANA
                      You cannot go alone.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'm not going alone. I'll take Gregoire
                      with me. He's a good Hutu, and he wants
                      to impress me now.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          The lobby is deserted except for Gregoire now neatly dressed.
          
                      G           PAUL
                       regoire it is good to see you back to
                      work.
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      Please, except my humblest apologies...
          
                                  PAUL
                      Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I
                      must go to visit my good friend George
                      Rutagunda. You know George?
          
          Gregoire nods, impressed.
          
                                                                           89.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Fetch the van.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAWN
          
          A thick mist blankets the grounds as Paul and Gregoire emerge.
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      (fearful) Where are we going, sir?
          
                                  PAUL
                      For supplies, you drive.
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      The fog is too heavy, sir.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Just drive, Gregoire.
          
          
          INT. VAN. DAWN
          
          They pass the gate, the policemen are asleep in the box.
          
          The van passes along the deserted main road, past a wrecked car, over
          broken glass, the fog swirls around them.
          
          Then Gregoire hits the brakes.
          
          In front of them, a makeshift barricade, long poles stretched across
          two oil drums.
          
          They wait for someone to appear from the fog: No one.
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      We should go back, sir.
          
          Paul wants to agree, but can't. He opens his door.
          
          
          EXT. ROAD. DAY
          
          Paul gets out, tentative.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Hello?
          
          Nothing. He moves to the barrier, lifts the pole, places it on the
          ground, hurries back to the van.
          
          
          
                                                                           90.

                      Let's go.
          
          They drive past the barricade.
          
          The van weaves through the fog-enshrouded streets.
          
           hey slow to check road signs in the fog - on one a woman's dress,
          shredded and soaked in blood, is draped like a banner.
          
          
          EXT. RUTAGANDA'S WAREHOUSE. DAWN
          
          The fog still hangs like a cloud. As they pull up, a group of young
          Militia emerge from Toyota trucks.

                      What do you want?
          
                                  PAUL
                      We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
          
                                  MILITIAMAN #1
                      The commander is not here.
          
                                  PAUL
                      He will be here.
          
                                  MILITIAMAN #1
                      Show me your ID
          
          Paul and Gregoire hand over their ID cards. The Militia man studies
          them, then pockets the cards.
          
                                    PAUL
                      Excuse me.

                      What?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Our cards, please.
          
                                    MILITIAMAN #1
                      What cards?
          
                                  PAUL
                      You have our cards.
          
          
          
          
          
                                                                           91.
          
                                    MILITIAMAN #1
                        No. But I make cards. Would you like me
                        to make you two cards?
          
                                      PAUL
                        How much?
          
                                    MILITIAMAN #1
                        One thousand francs.
          
          Then from out of the fog, three Toyota trucks roar up. George
          Rutagunda, heavily armed, in cut-off shorts and an open shirt, his
          barrel chest laden with bandoliers, jumps out.
          
           he Militia man pulls out the ID cards, hands them back.

                       joke.
          
          Rutagunda strides over.
          
                                    GEORGE
                        Paul. My old friend.
          
          Paul climbs out, greets George, as a Militia man swings open the doors
          of the warehouse. They walk in.
          
          
          INT. RUTAGANDA'S WAREHOUSE. DAY
          
          The warehouse is filled with looted televisions, artwork, cars. George
          points to the stacks of beer.
          
                                    GEORGE
                        Everything is double the price now, you
                        do understand that?
          
                                    PAUL
                        I need rice, beans, beer, and your best
                        whiskey.    G

                                    PAUL
                        You have no whiskey?
          
                                    GEORGE
                        No whiskey, no spirits. Your rich
                        cockroaches at the hotel, they will have
                        to do without their scotch. Anyway, I                       
                        have bled that cow enough Paul.

          Paul counts out the Rwandan francs.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What do you mean George?                                     
                                  GEORGE
                      Their money is no good to them. Soon all                     
                      the Ineysi will be dead.                                     
                                  PAUL
                           (incredulous) )                                         
                      You cannot kill them all.
          
                                  GEORGE
                                                                                   
                      Why not? We are half way there already.
          
          Paul's stomach heaves. He hides it, turns over the money, gets in the    
          van with Gregoire. George comes to the passenger window.                 
                                   EORGE (CONT'D)
                      Let me give you a tip my friend, our                         
                      generals in the army say 'do not go near                     
                      the Mille Collines or they will send the                     
                      Belgian soldiers back here'. But the                         
                      generals are about to leave, and we will                     
                      be in charge. It is time to butcher your                     
                      cow for the meat. (a beat)                                   
                      You can help us Paul. You have some very                     
                      important traitors at your hotel. The                        
                      politician Xavier. The liar Benedict. If                     
                      we were to get them, then maybe we could
                      let one or two cockroaches get away. You                     
                      understand, Paul.
          
          Paul says nothing, but Gregoire has been listening very carefully.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Let's go.
          
                                  GEORGE
                      Take the river road back. It is clear.
          
          The van takes off.
          
          
          INT. VAN. DAWN
          
          The fog has gotten thicker. They can barely see a yard ahead.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Are you sure this is the river road?
          
                                  GREGOIRE
                      I saw the sign.

          The van begins to bump erratically. Bump, bump, bump.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Stop. You've driven off the road.
                      You'll put us in the river.
          
          The van jerks to a halt.
          
          
          EXT. RIVER ROAD. DAWN
          
          Paul clambers out, stumbles, falls.
          
          And discovers he's looking at the face of a dead child, a young Tutsi
          girl, her hands clasped on her ears as though to block the sound of her
          own death - an African Munz's Scream.
          
          Paul clambers to his feet, sees that the van is on a road littered with
          dead bodies, men, women, children.
          
           he bumps were dead bodies, the van has driven over them.
          
          A breeze from the lake blows the fog clear for thirty feet.
          
          REVEALING: a carpet of bodies, hundreds of them sprawled all along the
          road as far as Paul can see. Paul wanders stunned among misshapen
          corpses, made more ghostly by wisps of fog.
          
          Finally, Paul clambers shell-shocked back into the van.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Go back! Go back!
          
          Gregoire throws the van into reverse.
          
           hey bump back over the carpet of bodies, each shake and crunch another
          horror.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL REAR DELIVERY AREA. DAY
          
          The van pulls up at the rear suppliers entrance. Paul hops out, turns
          to Gregoire.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Tell no one what you saw, do you
                      understand?
          
          Gregoire, Zozo and the porters begin unloading the van.
          
                   
          
                                                                              94.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL GARDENS. DAY
          
          Paul wanders to a bench set back in a manicured grove of bushes. Beyond
          him a crowd of Rwandan refugee children play in the swimming pool,
          laughing, jumping, splashing like they were at a municipal pool in
          Central Park.
          P
          
          PAUL watches. Tears stream from his eyes, the stream grows into a
          flood, he buries his face in his hands.
          
          Then a voice.
          
                                    LITTLE BOY (O.S.)
                      Mr. Manager.
          
          Paul wipes his eyes, turns.
          
          A little boy stands behind him, holding out his arm.
          
                                  LITTLE BOY (CONT'D)
                      Mr. Manager, sir.
          
          Then Paul sees what is wrong. The boy Has a big thorn imbedded in the
          muscle of his arm. Paul studies it.
          
                                  PAUL
                      That's a big one. (pinches the thorn)
                      Here we go.
          
          Paul pulls on the thorn, the kid doesn't flinch.
          
          Paul picks him up, carries him to the pool, throws him in.

                      Good evening, Papa.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Roger, you have no greeting for me.
          
          Roger tries to speak, struggles to mouth the words but nothing comes
          out, as though he has forgotten. Tears form in his eyes.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      There, do not worry, no tears.
          
          He hugs him, puts him back at his food, then takes Tatiana's hand,
          leads her to the door.
          
               
          
          
                                                                           95.

          They slip out.

          Tatiana stops.
          
                                   TATIANA
                       Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the
                       roof?
          
                                   PAUL
                       It's alright. This is the only place I
                       can find some peace.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL ROOF. NIGHT
          
          Paul slips out onto the roof. Tatiana follows. Artillery and mortar
          fire rumble in the distance. Flashes silhouette along the far hills
          above Kigali.
          
          He leads her to a blanket, a candle, two glasses and the bottle of
          wine. They sit. He opens the wine.
          
                                   TATIANA
                       (laughs) I hear we must pay for
                       everything. How much for this?
          
                                   PAUL
                       A kiss.
          
          They kiss.
          
                                   TATIANA
                       You are a very good man, Paul
                       Rusesabagina.
          
           he kisses him again.
          
                                   PAUL
                       I have a confession. When we met...
          
                                   TATIANA
                       In Ruhengeri?
          
                                   PAUL
                       Yes, when you worked as the nurse.
          
                                   TATIANA
                       Yes.
          
          
          
                                                                          96.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I had you transferred to Kigali.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I bribed the Minister of Health to have
                      you transferred to Kigali.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Why?
          
                                  PAUL
                      To be closer. So that I could marry you.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What was the bribe?
                           (silence)
                      What am I worth to you?
          
                                  PAUL
                      It was substantial.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Tell me what it was.
          
                                  PAUL
                      A car.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What sort of car?
          
                                  PAUL
                      What does it matter.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      I want to know.
          
                                  PAUL
                      A Volkswagen.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      A Volkswagen!
          
           he slaps him playfully.
          
                                  TATIANA (CONT'D)
                      I hope it was a new Volkswagen.
          
          She kisses him, they lie back on the roof, kiss passionately.
          
          
          
                                                                           97.

          Paul instructs the porters to clean around the entrance.
          
          The UN armored car comes up the driveway. Colonel Oliver gets out,       
          strides across the tarmac, he shakes Paul's hand.

                        out of here.

              voice calls out.

                                  TUTSI WOMAN
                      Colonel, sir. Why not take us all to the                       
                      airport? We can wait there to obtain
                      visas.

                      I can't do that. Our camp at the airport
                      is overwhelmed already. We could not
                      defend you there. You are better to stay
                      here and work to get an exit visa.
          
           Oliver jumps from the stage, pushes through the crowd.                    
          Paul's POV: Odette and Jean Baptiste are silently devastated. He pushes
          through to the Colonel now surrounded by those who didn't make the         
          list.
          
                                   PAUL
                      Colonel, Odette Camundu ... she must be                        
                      on the list.
          
           Oliver shakes his head no.                                                
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                     
                      Paul, only those I called can get on the
                      trucks. I do not want to have to pull
                      people off, you understand?
          
          Paul nods yes. Tatiana arrives beside him, pulls him aside.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      I will not leave without the twins.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We have to get out of here Tatiana.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Please, please try one more time.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'll try but we have to leave, with or
                      without them. I want you to promise.
          
          She reluctantly nods yes.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Mr. Garindi waits nervously in the lobby.
          
          Paul arrives.
          
          
                                                                           99.
          
                                  MR. GARINDI
                      It is dangerous to be here. The radio
                      says this is a nest of cockroaches.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I need one last favor. Go back and get
                      the twins.
          
                                  MR. GARINDI
                      (emphatic) No, it is impossible. That
                      side of town has been destroyed in the
                      fighting. The children are dead.
          
                                  PAUL
                      How do you know?
          
                                  MR. GARINDI
                      Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the
                      bodies in the street. I have to go.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I will give you my house.
          
          The businessman turns back.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      It's a fine house. Here is a paper.
          
          Paul spots an elegant woman carrying laundry toward the elevator. He
          runs to her.            P
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Madame Kawunda, please.
          
          Paul leads her over.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      I need you to witness this signature.
                           (to the businessman)
                      Madame Kawunda is the Minister for
                      Agriculture. She is a very reliable
                      witness.
          
          Paul signs, then hands the pen to the puzzled woman.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Please witness this deed.
          
          She signs. Paul pushes the deed into the man's hand.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      There, now go and find them. They have no
                      papers. No one knows they are Tutsi. They
                      will be alive.
          
          
          
                                                                          100.
          
          The businessman heads for the door.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      You must be back by 7:00a.m. tomorrow.
          
          Paul watches him go.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Seven, remember.
          
          The Mr. Garindi leaves.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL GARDENS. NIGHT
          
          Paul skirts the little groups of poor families bivouacked on the lawn.
          The smoke of cooking fires has replaced the Tiki lanterns. The grounds
          are a mini refugee camp.
          
          Paul joins Tatiana, Odette and Jean Baptiste who sit at a table by the
          pool.
          
                                   DETTE
                      Don't worry, Paul, we will make the next
                      list.
          
          ZOZO arrives, with beers, serves them, is about to leave. Tatiana grabs    
          him by the arm.                                                            
                                  TATIANA                                            
                      Sit with us Zozo.  
                                                      
                                  ZOZO                                               
                      No ma,am, I am too busy.   
                                              
                                  PAUL                                               
                      Zozo you are family, join us.                                  
          Zozo is shocked by this breach of protocol but sits.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      You are my dearest friends. I promise you
                      before God that I will not sleep until I
                      have you out of here. All of you.
          
          He embraces Jean Baptiste
          
                                  JEAN BAPTISTE
                      It is good that you are going, Paul,
                      because now we know we have one person
                      who will save us.
          
          Odette hugs and kisses him.
          
                                                                            101.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      We owe you our lives.
          
          Paul takes Zozo in his arms.
          
                                  PAUL
                      You are my family now, Zozo, my brother.
                      I will get you out of here.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Thank you, sir.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Let us remember this night and tell the
                      world that even in hell there are good
                      people.
          
          A unbreakable bond of faith with each other.
          
                                                                       CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          The lucky families are gathered: Tatiana and all her children; Xavier
          and his wife; Benedict; and others.
          
          Some of the unlucky ones peer around the door of the ballroom. A UN
          officer stands in their way.
          
                                  UN LIEUTENANT
                      Back. Everyone back. Only those with
                      letters of acceptance in the lobby.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          The UN convoy waits outside.   Tatiana waits nervously as Paul   checks
          his watch.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      A little longer, Paul?
          
                                  PAUL
                      We wait until 7:00. If he is not here
                      with the twins he is not coming. We
                      leave. That was your promise. Go help the
                      children.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul is in a horrible mood. The refugees in the ballroom try to push by
          the UN officer. Paul joins him.
          
          
          
          
          
                                                                          102.
          
                                     UN LIEUTENANT
                         Back, please. Stay back.
          
                                     PAUL
                         Zozo, tell those people to get back to
                         the ballroom. They can not be here.
          
          Zozo scampers off.
          
                                     PAUL (CONT'D)
                         What are we waiting for? Come on.
          
          Paul herds the convoy people toward the door.
          
          CLOSE ON: Gregoire watching from behind the front desk.
          
          Through the doors we see the trucks being loaded.
          
          Zozo returns.
          
                                     ZOZO
                         Sir, the others want to speak to you.
          
          Reluctant, Paul walks over to the ballroom dwellers.
          
                                     PAUL
                         Yes.
          
                                      TUTSI WOMAN
                         Good, sir we have letters, please take
                         them for us.
          
          Paul reaches out for the letters, takes them, reads the addresses:
          President Nelson Mandela. Pope John Paul. President Clinton.
          
                                     TUTSI MAN #1
                         If you leave, we are certain to die.
          
                                     ZOZO
                         I have a letter, sir.
          
          Zozo hands Paul the letter. He studies the address. It reads "To the
          great man Muhammad Ali."
          
           thers crowd around.
          
                                     PAUL
                         I will get you all visas. I promise. I
                         will get you out of here.
          
          Paul's at a loss. He has to tear himself away.
          
              fraid to look back, he heads for the convoy.
          
             
          
                                                                           103.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          The last of the evacuees clamber onto the UN trucks. The children are
          on board but Tatiana waits.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Ask them to wait a little longer. For the
                      twins.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Get on the truck, Tatiana.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      No.
          
          He checks his watch, then takes her in his arms.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Look, our children are crying, please get
                      on the truck.
          
          Paul helps Tatiana on board. He looks toward the door.
          
          POV: The unlucky refugees are now crowded at the windows, lost souls
          watching out from their prison at the lucky ones.
          
          Paul whispers to Benedict as he boards.
          
          
          INT. TRUCK DAY
          
          Paul clambers on beside him.   He reaches Tatiana as Benedict sits
          beside her.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I have to stay.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      No! Sit down now.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I cannot leave these people. I will wait
                      for the twins.
          
          Paul backs off. Tatiana tries to follow. Benedict grabs her.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Let go. Let me off this truck.
          
          A commotion as she tries to get up.
          
                                  TATIANA (CONT'D)
                      Let me go. Children get off.
          
          
                                                                          104.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I will follow on the next plane. Go.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY.
          
          The truck starts up. Paul runs beside it, shouts to Tatiana.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I love you. Keep the children safe.
          
                                    TATIANA
                      Paul!
          
          Then another voice.
          
                                    ROGER
                      Papa! Papa!
          
          The convoy takes off down the driveway.
          
          Paul, Zozo and other refugees cluster by the door.
          
          ZOZO looks round,
          
          I
          Sees: Gregoire put a phone down.
          
          
          INT. UN JEEP. DAY
          
          UN Colonel Oliver sits next to a UN PAKISTANI DRIVER.                      
           he convoy passes looters and small groups of Militia on the road but
          proceeds unheeded.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. DAY
          
          The room is still littered with clothes, kids drawings, the personal
          junk accumulated over four weeks.
          
          Paul tries to arrange things, then collapses on the bed, paralysed with
          doubt - Why did he do this?
          
          Then the door bangs.
          
                                  ZOZO
                      Boss, sir, quick, please, come quick.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY
          
          The door springs open, Paul confronts Zozo.
          
             
          
          
                                                                           105.
          
                                  ZOZO
                           (breathless)
                      Sir, the radio, you must hear, it is on
                      the radio.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL KITCHEN. DAY
          
          Paul and Zozo burst into the kitchen. The cooks and others are
          clustered, listening to the radio.
          
                                  RADIO ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                      ...Block the roads to the airport! The

                                  PAUL
                      Dear lord, how did they know?
          
                                  ZOZO
                      I saw Gregoire make a call, sir?
          
                                    PAUL
                      When?
          
                                  ZOZO
                      As the trucks go.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul bursts out of the kitchen - enraged.
          
          Gregoire is at the front desk. Sees Paul - understands instantly.
          
          Gregoire takes off, running for his life.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL GARDENS. DAY
          
          Paul chases after him, through the door.
          
          Gregoire disappears into the thicket of trees.
          
          Paul after him.
          
          Through the trees.
          
          Gregoire, younger, faster, climbs the high wire fence.
          
          Finally, Paul reaches the fence.
          
          
          
          
                                                                            106.
          
          Sees Gregoire escape into the bushes on the other side of the fence.
          
          Paul gives up, turns back toward the hotel.
          
          
          INT. JEEP TRAVELLING. DAY
          
          As the UN jeep turns a bend, Colonel Oliver SEES crowds of Interahamwe       
          swarming from beside houses, from gardens. They pull burning tires, old
          furniture, junk onto the road.
          
          
          INT. TRUCK TRAVELLING. DAY
          
          The UN truck suddenly lurches, then slows.    The refugees from the Mille
          Collines grow alarmed.
          
                                    TATIANA
                        What's happening?
          
          
          INT. HOTEL OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul is on the fax phone, begging.
          
                                    PAUL
                        Please, General, I will give you money,
                        whiskey.
          
                                    GENERAL BIZIMUNGU (O.S.)
                        You said you had no whiskey.
          
                                    PAUL                                               
                        Please, I have money. They're driving
                        into an ambush, it's on the radio.
          
          
          EXT. KIGALI STREET JUNCTION. DAY
          
          Swarms of crazed Militia fill the road. Gun fire breaks out.
          
          Colonel Oliver steps from the jeep, waving his pistol in the air.
          M                                                                            
           ilitia men swarm around him, push past to the truck.
          
          INSIDE THE TRUCK:
          
              MACHETE SLASHES through the canvas.
          
           hildren scream, HANDS GRAB at people.
          
          Benedict is hauled off the truck. Beaten.
          
          Tatiana protects her kids in a corner, kicking at the hands that grab
          for her.
          
          
          
                                                                          107.
          
          ON THE STREET: Xavier falls to the ground.
          
          Screams, shouts, MORE SHOTS.
          
          Oliver fights his way through to Xavier.                                   
          Oliver points his pistol.                                                  
          The crowd backs off slightly.
          
          Xavier gets to his feet.
          
          BANG - more gun fire. IMMACULATA falls, wounded in the foot.
          
          More are dragged from the trucks. Machetes flash in the sun.
          
          Then HORNS, GUNFIRE - RWANDAN SOLDIERS drive through the crowd in two
          jeeps. The crowd scatters, then re-forms as Rwandan soldiers push
          between the Militia and the refugees.
          
          As they do, another Militia gunman steps out, fires wildly at the
          refugees, but wounds A RWANDAN SOLDIER in the stomach.
          
          Suddenly fights erupt between the Militia and the soldiers.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Paul paces up and down, he can hear gunfire in the distance.
          
          MACHINE GUNFIRE - THEN SINGLE SHOTS.
          
          Paul jumps in the van, guns the engine, drives.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FRONT GATE. DAY.
          
          Paul's van speeds toward the gate.
          
          THEN - A LOUD METALLIC SCREECHING NOISE
          
          As a UN JEEP, its tires shot out, sparks cascading from wheel rims,
          screams up to the guard house.
          
          Paul slams on the brakes.
          
          The jeep is followed by the two trucks, their canvas slashed fluttering
          in the wind.
          
          Paul throws the van into reverse and clears the way.
          
          The convoy pulls up in front of the hotel.
          
          Bloody and battered, the terrified refugees fall from the trucks.
          
                      
          
          
                                                                             108.
          
          Paul and Odette run among the casualties. Then he sees them:
          
          Tatiana, clothes torn, scratches on her face.
          
          The kids screaming in terror.
          
             PAUL runs to them, grabs, kisses, weeps louder.
          
          Battered refugees everywhere, other hotel residents looking on -
          equally terrified because: They know they are doomed.
          
          Paul sees Roger, trembling, tears soak his face.
          
                                       ROGER
                         Papa! Papa!
          
          He grabs Roger up. Tatiana struggles to Paul, embraces.
          
                                     PAUL
                         Thank God you are safe.
          
          Tatiana breaks from the embrace.
          
                                     TATIANA
                         Did he bring the twins?
          
          Paul shakes his head no.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL GARDENS. DAY
          
          Paul sits alone on his secluded bench in the garden.
          
              cloud of despair shrouds him.
          
          As he watches several women dip cooking pots into the pool.
          
              e hurries toward them.
          
                                     PAUL
                         What are you doing?
          
                                     TUTSI WOMAN
          P              There is no water from the pipes.
          
          PAUL heads for the front doors. He's intercepted by the two Rwandan
          policemen stationed at the gate by Bizimungu.
          
                                     GENDARME
                          here is our beer? You promised us beer.
          
                                     PAUL
                         Did you explain to the good General that
                         I have temporarily run out of stock?
          
          
                                                                  109.

                      He said to ask Mitterand and the French
                      to send you more.
          
                                  PAUL
                      You will get it in due time. Now, please,
                      get back to the gate.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul enters, sees Zozo.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What is this about no water?
          
                                  ZOZO
                      It's true, sir, the water has been turned           
                      off.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL MANAGER'S OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul enters. Odette, Benedict watch CNN on the TV.
          
          PAUL shakes his head in disbelief.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We can still get CNN here in hell.
          
          A state department woman gives a press conference.
          
                                  ODETTE
                      The Americans are talking about us.
          
          
          ON TV:
          
                                  STATE DEPT. OFFICER
                      From the reports we have received from
                      Rwanda it appears that acts of genocide
                      have been committed.
          
                                  REPORTER
                      Excuse me, how many acts of genocide does
                      it take to declare this a genocide?
          
                                  STATE DEPT. OFFICER
                      I, ahh, there is, ahh we have
                      terminology, that has been.
          
                                                                          110.
          
                                  BRIT REPORTER
                      You haven't answered the question. How
                      many acts of genocide before your
                      government will declare this a genocide?
          
                                  STATE DEPT. OFFICER
                      I'm not prepared to, nor am I able.
          
          Everyone in the room is dumbfounded.
          
          Then Benedict begins laughing, a maniacal laugh, then he bangs on his
          chest, and hoots like a chimpanzee.
          
                                  BENEDICT
                      I've got it. I have the answer. Watch.
          
          They all stare as he begins beating his chest, and hopping about like
          an ape.
          
                                  BENEDICT (CONT'D)
                      We must become mountain gorillas. Then
                      they can put us on the endangered species
                      list. Come on, try it. They think we're
                      halfway there already.
          
          Benedict hops up onto a desk.
          
          The door flies open. It's General Bizimungu.
          
          He surveys the room, then points at Paul.
          
                                   GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Come here.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR. DAY.
          
          Bizimungu looks terrible, an alcoholic suffering D.T.s.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Where are my supplies?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I'm sorry, General. The cellar is empty.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      You have cockroaches dancing on tables
                      and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did
                      they drink my whiskey?
          
                                  PAUL
                      No. We have no way of finding other stock
                      but I have money for you from the guests.
          
                                                                          111.
          
          Paul pulls a bundle of notes, hands them to the General.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Rwandan francs! They are only good now
                      for wiping your ass. There is nothing
                      more I can do for you people. No police.
                      No protection. You're on your own.
          
          The General storms off.
          
          
          INT. LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul walks through the lobby. He carries an ash tray to a trash can,
          the futile task of a dedicated hotel manager on auto-pilot. He sees a
          UN jeep pull up outside.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Paul meets the UN soldiers, (They are the four Ghanians who guard the
          gate). They look frightened.
          
                                  UN OBSERVER
                      The policemen have gone. What happened?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I ran out of whiskey. Please go down and
                      guard us.
          
          Then ROAR of an engine and the CRASH of splintering wood.
          
          As a battered Toyota pickup appears, it races up the driveway. The
          truck drags the wooden gatehouse on a rope behind.
          
          Crazed Militia pack the bed of the pickup.
          
          BANG, BANG, BANG. A Militia man fires a pistol into the air.
          
          The Tutsi refugees camped on the lawn flee in panic as the Militia
          truck speeds around the driveway.
          
          The Militia taunt and yell at the Tutsi refugees.
          
          The truck does a screeching turn and heads back down the driveway,
          leaving a trail of splintered wood.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Get down there and stop them, please.
          
          Now the Ghanians are really frightened.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Get down and stop them.
          
                                                                          112.
          
                                  UN SOLDIER
                      You know we cannot shoot.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What do you mean you cannot shoot?
          
                                  UN SOLDIER
                      We are peacekeepers, it is not in our
                      mandate to shoot.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Then go and pretend you are soldiers.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL GARDENS. NIGHT
          
          Paul and Tatiana pass the clusters of families around their cooking
          fires. They pass the pool, now just a third full. He sits her on the
          bench in the grove.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      We are almost out of water.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We are almost out of everything.
          
          He takes her hand.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      We had a good life, you and I. I want to
                      make our peace. To thank God for the time
                      we had.
          
          He kisses her, total love.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      We have to have a plan.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What sort of plan?
          
                                  PAUL
                      Our children cannot see us die first. If
                      the Militia comes, you must hurry up to
                      the roof. I will meet you there.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Please do not talk like this.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We have to. If I do not come, you must
                      take them all by the hands and jump.
          
          She puts her hands to her ears. He pulls them down.
          
          
                                                                          113.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      The machete is no way to die. Promise me
                      you will do it.
          
          She cries harder and squeezes his hand in fear.
          
           uddenly, A BANG, from behind them and then above their heads a trail
          of fire - an RPG rocket - zigzags toward the hotel.
          
          A HUGE EXPLOSION on the wall, one-story beneath the roof.
          
          Paul throws Tatiana to the ground, covers her.
          S
          
           moke and concrete dust fall around them.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL STORE ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Paul, Zozo stand amongst the debris: a gaping hole in a wall. The room

                                  ODETTE
                      Was anyone hurt?
          
                                  PAUL
                      No. It was only a storeroom.                                   
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. NIGHT
          
          Colonel Oliver arrives in his armored truck. Paul, Odette, Benedict and    
          others gather around him.
          
                                  PAUL
                      They fired a rocket at us.
          
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                      Yes.   Where are the Rwandan police?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them
                      away.
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                     
                      That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you
                      this but we've heard rumors the Militia
                      are getting ready to storm the hotel.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Will you protect us.
          
          
          
          
                                                                       114.
          
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                              
                       I can't, I don't have the men.
          
                                   VARIOUS VOICES
                       We have no one...We will be killed.
          
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                              
                       There's one option.
          
                                     PAUL
                       What is it?
          
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                              
                       The rebels have fought their way into the
                       city. They have many Hutu prisoners.
                       They're willing to exchange them for you
                       all.
          
                                   ODETTE
                       Will the Hutu army agree?
          
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                              
                       I think so. They are in disarray now. The
                       rebels are winning, and the Hutu high
                       command are anxious to get some of their
                       men back.

                       How would we escape?
          
                                     COLONEL OLIVER                            
                       By convoy.
          
                                   XAVIER
                       This time the Militia will kill us.
          
                                   PAUL
                       They will surely kill us here. It's over
                       here. We have to take the chance.
          
                                   TUTSI WOMAN
                       No, we'll be chopped on the street.
          
                                   PAUL
                       We'll be chopped here.
          
          The crowd disperses. Colonel Oliver takes Paul aside.  
                   
                                   COLONEL OLIVER                              
                       A man came to my headquarters, asked that
                       I give you this.
          
          Colonel   Oliver hands a letter.                                     
          
                                                                          115.
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D)                            
                      Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two.
                      I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I
                      will have to scrounge it.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I can't. I have nothing left to bribe
                      with. Can your men at the gate hold out
                      for another day?
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                     
                      No, Paul, they're afraid. They've
                      demanded to be moved back to headquarters
                      now.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Give me their uniforms. I will put people
                      at the gate, in disguise.
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                     
                      I wish I could, Paul. Try to hold out.
                      One more day.
          
          Colonel Oliver leaves. Their is nothing more Paul can do.                  
          
          INT. HOTEL PAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT
          
          Tatiana is beside him. He opens the envelope, finds his makeshift house
          deed and a note.
          
                                   PAUL
                      It's from Garandi.                                             
                           (reads)
                      I am sorry. There is no hope for the
                      twins. The old lady's house has been                           
                      destroyed.

          Paul sleeps fitfully. It is almost dawn, then he sits up.
          
                                  PAUL
                      The Diplomat!
          
          Tatiana wakens, startled.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      What's wrong?
          
                                  PAUL
                      I have to go to the Diplomat.
          
                                                                          116.

                      General, sir. I am glad to find you. I
                      have found you some supplies.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU   (O.S.)
                      Whiskey?
          
                                  PAUL
                      The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come
                      and I will get them for you.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU   (O.S.)
                      I'll be over.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Bring back your policemen...
          
          ...But the line is already dead.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Bizimungu's jeeps arrives at the hotel. Paul greets him.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We must go to the Diplomat.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Get in.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Your police are at the gate?
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      After the Diplomat!
          
          Paul clambers in the back.
          
          
          INT. JEEP TRAVELLING. DAY
          
          The jeep turns away from the Mille Collines front gate.
          
          They travel at high speed along the road. Then the driver sounds his
          horn, because...
          
          Paul sees: A large crowd of Militia marching along the road toward the
          hotel, waving machetes and sticks.
          
          
          
                                                                          117.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Where are they going?
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      They can go where they want. They are in
                      charge now.
          
                                  PAUL
                      What do you mean, General?
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      We have decided to move the government to
                      Gitarama.
          
                                  PAUL
                      When?
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Today.
          
          
          EXT./INT. DIPLOMAT HOTEL. DAY
          
          Paul arrives into the lobby of the Diplomat. Looters have stripped the
          place bare. The convoy pulls up. General Bizimungu stands with his
          pistol out. The looters see him and disperse.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Maggots!
          
          
          INT. DIPLOMAT HOTEL OFFICE. DAY
          
          Paul enters the manager's office, followed by the General. It has been
          stripped clean, except for the safe, which is pock-marked with bullet
          strikes.
          
          
          
           LOSE ON: Paul: he sees a big problem. The dial is damaged.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Do your work.
          
          Paul goes to the safe and turns the dials, tries the handle - nothing.
          It is incredibly hot, and Paul is soaked with nervous perspiration, he
          takes off his jacket.
          
                                  PAUL
                      It might be damaged, General.
          
          Bizimungu's look says: it better not be for your sake.
          
          
          
                                                                            118.
          
          Paul starts again, turns the dials more carefully, tries and opens the
          safe door. CLICK.
          
          He pulls it open, sees six bottles of Glenfiddich, four bottles of VSOP
          brandy.
          
          Bizimungu is joyous as Paul hands him a bottle
          
          Bizimungu sits on a window ledge, takes a swig.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Here. (offers) To celebrate.
          
          PAUL takes a swig.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU (CONT'D)
                      You know what the Scottish call it?
          
                                  PAUL
                      No.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on
                      a tour once of the finest single malt
                      distillery in the world. Have you ever
                      been to Scotland?
          
                                  PAUL
                      No, sir.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Wonderful country, wonderful golf. I
                      wonder - will I ever go back? What do you
                      think?
          
          
          
                                  PAUL
                      I hope we all get to do many things. Can
                      we go now?
          
          The soldier arrives with a box. He whispers to Bizimungu.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      (to the soldier) Pack those carefully,
                      put them in my jeep, and guard them.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (looses his cool)
                      Please, General, call and put your
                      policemen back at the gate.
          
          The soldier packs the bottles. Bizimungu pours into Paul's cup.
          
                                                                  119.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      I am going to do you a great favor.
                      (studies glass) I am going to take you
                      with us to Gitarama.
          
                                  PAUL
                      I do not want to go to Gitarama, General.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      You cannot go back to the hotel. The
                      crazy men are going there now. Better to
                      come with me.
          
          Paul is now terrified.
          
                                  PAUL
                      The Militia are at the hotel?! We must go
                      back now, General, please, for my family.
          
          Bizimungu, now tipsy, drinks more.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      We are better here.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (desperate, forceful)
                      Listen, you need me.
          
          Bizimungu laughs.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      You are a marked man.
          
                                   GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      How so.
          
                                  PAUL
                      The Americans, and the UN they have you
                      as a war criminal. You are on a list.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      I am on a list! What list?
          
                                  PAUL
                      When the Europeans left, their soldiers
                      gathered lists.
          
          Bizimungu grabs Paul.
          
                                   GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      You lie.
          
          
                                                                  120.
          
                                  PAUL
                      If you do not help me, you will stay on
                      that list.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      I committed no war crimes.
          
                                  PAUL
                      Who will tell them? You need me to tell
                      how you helped the hotel. The others who
                      have gone, they blame you for all their
                      misfortune. They say you led the
                      massacres.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      (nervous now) I led no massacres.
          
                                  PAUL
                      You think they will believe you?
          
                                   ENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      You will tell them the truth.
          
                                  PAUL
                           (defiant)
                      I will do nothing unless you help me now.
          
          Bizimungu reaches for his pistol.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      What are you going to do, shoot me? It
                      will be a blessing. Go ahead shoot. I
                      will pay you to shoot my family. You can
                      do nothing to me!
          
          Bizimungu jumps up, grabs Paul, pulls him.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      You will tell them I did nothing.
          
          
          EXT. DIPLOMAT HOTEL. DAY
          
          Paul and Bizimungu rush out to the jeeps.
          
          
          INT. JEEP TRAVELLING. DAY
          
          Paul almost overcome with anxiety. Bizimungu worried.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAY
          
          Militia swarm around the front of the hotel.
          
          
          
                                                                             121.
          
          The jeeps race through, scattering them. They screech to a halt.
          Several refugees sit, huddled and battered. Bizimungu jumps out,
          snatches an A.K. from a soldier, fires in the air.
          
                                  GENERAL BIZIMUNGU
                      Get back! (to his soldiers) Get them out
                      of here.
          
          PAUL does not wait.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY. DAY
          
          Paul races into the hotel, past frightened refugees who flee.
          
          Then Paul sees a face he recognizes.
          
          It's Gregoire with the Militia! Paul ducks into the stairway.
          
          IN THE STAIRWELL
          
          He leaps the stairs four at a time.
          
          He makes it to the third floor, pushing past frightened refugees who
          race down the stairs.
          
          ON THE THIRD FLOOR
          
          He runs straight into a bunch of young Militia.
          
                                  MILITIAMEN
                      Rusesabagina. Show us Rusesabagina.
          
          They shove Paul along the corridor.
          
                                  MILITIAMAN #1
                      Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
          
                                  PAUL
                      They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
          
          The killers race off.    Paul gets to his feet and runs.
          
          
          INT. PAUL'S ROOM. DAY
          
          Paul bursts in.    The place is a mess. And it's empty!
          
                                  PAUL
                      Oh God, please Lord.
          
          IN THE CORRIDOR
          
          He careens out of the room.
          
          
                                                                           122.
          
          And sees Gregoire coming with a group of Militia.
          
                                   GREGOIRE
                       That's him. That's Rusesabagina!
          
          They charge toward Paul.
          
          Then a roar of gunfire. The ceiling and walls around Gregoire explode.
          General Bizimungu's men run up with weapons drawn.
          
                                   HUTU SOLDIER
                       Get out, or I'll shoot you.
          
          Paul rushes to the stairs.
          
          More gunfire echoes (soldiers clearing the Militia).
          
          AT THE STAIRS - Paul races upward, falls, pushes past others struggling
          to get down.
          
          AT THE ROOF - now, there are clumps of refugees who have fled up there,
          including Xavier who huddles in a corner.
          
                                   PAUL
                       Tatiana! Oh God. Have you seen Tatiana?
          
          Paul runs to the edge of the roof, looks over.
          
          SEES: bodies -   women, and children, still, on the ground beneath, by a
          row of hedge.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      (screams in agony)
                   TATIANA!
          
          The bodies move, look up, it's not them. It's refugees hiding. Paul,
          delirious with fear, runs along the parapet.
          
          BELOW he sees soldiers herding the Militia.
          
          He runs back to the stairs.
          
          INSIDE THE STAIRCASE: He jumps four stairs at a time.
          
          INSIDE THE CORRIDOR: Soldiers are chasing off the Militia.
          
          TO HIS ROOM: Paul staggers in, crazed with fear. He looks under the
          bed.
          
          INTO THE BATHROOM - empty.
          
          He's about to run out again, sees the connecting door to the adjoining
          hotel room is slightly open.
          
          
          
                                                                             123.
          
          INTO THE ADJOINING ROOM: It's empty, then A WHIMPER.
          
          FROM THE BATHROOM, he moves in, cautious.
          
          IN THE BATHROOM: Nothing. He moves over, pulls back the shower curtain.
          
          Reveals: A cluster of women and children, the older ones holding hands
          over the mouths of the younger ones. And there at the back: Tatiana and
          his kids.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      It's alright, they're gone.
          
          Tears, hugs, women tremble.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL FORECOURT. DAWN
          
          The grey of dawn, before the sunrise.
          
          Colonel Oliver in his jeep leads a convoy of UN trucks past the guard      
          house and Bizimungu's police and up the drive.
          
                                                                      CUT TO:
          
          THE UN TRUCKS
          
          Parked in front of the hotel. Tutsi refugees file up and are helped on
          board by UN soldiers.
          
          Paul helps Tatiana and the children onto a truck.
          
          An ARGUMENT breaks out towards the back of the convoy. Paul rushes
          toward Xavier and Benedict who argue.
          
                                  XAVIER
                      They should go one truck at a time. When
                      the first truck gets through to the
                      airport, then the others will follow.
          
                                  PAUL
                      We can't wait. We all go together or not
                      at all.
          
          Paul takes matters into his own hands. He locks the doors of the hotel.
          There is no going back.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      It is time to leave. The Mille Collines
                      is closed.
          
          Paul climbs onto the truck. The others follow, some reluctantly.
          
          Colonel Oliver gives the signal.                                           
          
          
          
                                                                          124.
          
          The trucks take off down the driveway.
          
          
          INT. TRUCK TRAVELLING. DAY
          
          Paul now at the front of the truck
          
          WATCHES out through a slice in the canvas.
          
          SEES, the convoy pull out of the Mille Collines.
          
          They travel along the road.
          
          Turn a corner, and the truck slows ...
          
          PAUL SEES: a great mass of Hutus fill the road:
          
          Militia, kids, soldiers discarding uniforms.
          
          No longer a mob, but a crush of Hutu refugees now fleeing toward them,
          fleeing the advancing of the rebel army.
          
          A crowd of Militia men wave their arms, shout at the trucks.
          
                                  COLONEL OLIVER                                    
                      Don't stop. Push through.
          
          The driver reluctantly speeds up.
          
          A break in the mass of Hutu refugees.
          
          Then GUN FIRE ahead.
          
          Children begin crying, it becomes infectious, spreading to Paul's
          children, some of the women.
          
          Then ahead, a gang of Militia men break from the bushes beside the
          road.
          
          They're running fast toward the truck, some carry rifles.
          
          There's more gunfire behind.
          
          The Militia are almost upon them now.
          
          Colonel Oliver has his pistol drawn.                                      
                                    COLONEL OLIVER (CONT'D)                         
                      Keep going.
          
          The Militia are at the truck.
          
          But they run STRAIGHT PAST!
          
            
          
                                                                          125.
          
          As a platoon of Tutsi rebel soldiers (in bush camouflage and   red and
          blue headbands) burst from the brush.
          
          Pursuing, careful, professional.
          
                                   PAUL
                       It's the rebels.
          
          The crying stops. Silent disbelief.

                       We've made it!
          
          Cheering breaks out. Children frightened again by the sudden euphoria
          break into cries of joy.

          EXT. KIGALI SOCCER STADIUM. DAY
          
          The trucks crawl into the chaos of the stadium, a mass of refugees, the
          wounded, lost children, abandoned old people, hundreds crammed
          together.
          
          Paul, Tatiana, and the others clamber off the trucks. They hug, cry, an
          outpouring of relief. Then Tatiana spots someone among the crowds.
          
          She rushes over.
          
                                   TATIANA
                       Have you seen my sister Fedens?
          
          Heads shak `no'. Tatiana moves on, more frantic, pushing through the
          crowds.
          
                                   TATIANA
                       Two little girls, twins, an old woman had
                       them.
          
          More `nos'
          
          Now she's desperate, pushing, tripping through the crowds, and around
          her we see others doing the same, then
          
                                      OGER (O.C.)
                       Mama, mama.
          
          He reaches her, pulls at her dress.
          
                                     ROGER
                       Mama, wait.
          
          She takes his hand.
          
          
                                                                             126.
          
                                  ROGER
                      No, mama, look.
          
          Tatiana turns .... and sees Paul carrying the twins in his arms.
          
          She squeals with joy, runs to him, snatches one from his arms.
          
                                  TATIANA
                      Oh, my babies.
          
                                  PAUL (CONT'D)
                      Anais, it is so good to see you.
          
                                    CARINE
                      I'm Carine!

                           (in Tatsi's arms)
                      And I'm Anais!
          
          Their laughter mix with tears of joy among the crushing mass of            
          survivors.
