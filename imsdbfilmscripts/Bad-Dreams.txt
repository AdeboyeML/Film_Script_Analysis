1   EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - SUNSET                                         1
    A serene landscape, mist collecting as the red ball of a sun
    dips behind the mountains.

    In the middle of a field stands a bare-chested man facing the
    sunset. He is HARRIS, forty-ish, greying but handsome, and
    very fit. His hands are outstretched as if embracing an
    invisible entity. He seems filled with some sort of
    transcendental power. Now, an air of fulfillment and resolve
    settles over him. He turns and walks away from us. CAMERA
    ADJUSTS and reveals--


2   EXT. UNITY HOUSE - LONG SHOT - SUNSET                             2
    Once the home of Victorian Gentry, a few seasons of amateur
    repair work have not compensated for decades of neglect. But
    now as Harris walks towards it, the fading daylight and long
    shadows turn it into a fantasy castle. MUSIC ECHOES faintly
    from within; it's "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" by Iron Butterfly. If
    the music didn't place the era for us, the battered VW
    MINIBUS parked outside the house does; it's covered with
    flower paintings, slogans, and the ubiquitous peace sign.

    As Harris approaches the house, a dozen or so YOUNG PEOPLE
    rush to greet him and embrace him. Extending his arms out to
    enclose them all, he goes inside.


3   INT. COMMON ROOM - SUNSET                                         3
    This was probably a stately parlor in its day. There is a
    funky assembly of odd handmade furniture. There are muslin
    curtains on the windows, crude paintings, and quilts covering
    ripped chairs and couches. Despite the squalor, there is a
    neatness to the place. Now, the CAMERA begins to ROAM
    through the room and down the hallways lined with fading
    wallpaper.

    All these comments are made in relaxed and good natured
    tones. Finally the CAMERA PANS OVER to a little storage
    alcove beneath the servant's stairway. A HAND reaches in and
    opens the door, and inside we SEE cartons, antique toys...
    and then CYNTHIA, a pretty 13 year old girl who wears funky
    clothing and a haunted, nervous expression.

    She shrinks back from the HANDS that are pulling her up and
    out, but they prevail, and she's up and on unsteady feet.
    The CAMERA stays with her as she's led back down the hallway.

    Revealing VICTOR, a handsome youth a few years older than
    Cynthia.

                 Easy, Cyn, easy. You don't want to
                 do this, that's okay... right,
                 Harris?

    The VOICES stop as everyone awaits an answer. CAMERA PANS
    across the common room, to the end we haven't seen yet.

    In the center of the room is a big cistern or font. As we
    watch, Harris has just DUNKED someone in it. The person
    steps out, laughing, sloshing in amber liquid. Standing
    around are other people, some already dripping wet, others
    awaiting their turns. Some are clothed and wet, others in
    varying degrees of undress. It all seems slightly off,
    slightly eerie, despite their smiles and cheer. Harris
    splashes himself with the amber liquid from the tub, pushes
    his hair back.

    He WADES CLOSER to the CAMERA, within reach of Cynthia,
    Victor and the others. Smiles again. It's the kind of a
    smile that inspires trust.

                           HARRIS (CONT'D)
                 Cynthia, do you trust me?

    She nods immediately.

                           HARRIS (CONT'D)
                 And have I ever lied to you?

    She shakes her head. He GESTURES. The people around Cynthia
    begin to GET INTO the tub. Some remove their clothing;
    others get in clothes and all. Toddlers and infants are held
    by their parents and playfully splashed.

                           HARRIS (CONT'D)
                 Then I say to you now... to all of

                 humanity and Godhead.

    He looks at Victor, who reluctantly lets Cynthia's hand go,
    gets in. Now only Cynthia remains.

                 Cynthia. Come. There is no shame
                 in this. No crime. No sin. Just
                 the final break with the old
                 world... As night falls, we start

    His last words melt her remaining resistance. Moving like a
    sleepwalker, she steps into the tub, wades forward. Then she
    stops, looks down at the fluid lapping at her jeans... runs
    her hand through it. Her eyes widen.
                                                               4.




6   EXT. HOUSE - LONG SHOT                                             6
    The sun almost gone now, red light reflecting on the gabled
    windows. Even the battered VW van looks good in this
    setting. It's beautiful.

    WINDOWS blow out. Splintered BEAMS propeller through the
    air. The VW camper on the lawn ROCKS with the shock wave.
    Then a SECOND EXPLOSION blows the Victorian cupolas and
    widow's walk off the roof. From somewhere in the distance we

    A plainclothes detective, he NODS to some uniforms, steps
    around some debris to move closer to the scene. He puts his
    collar up against the SPRAY which leaks from firehose
    connections. Seeing one of his men, he SHOUTS over the din.

     Medics run around the parked VW, which drips water and
     chemical foam. Rescue workers move a FALLEN BEAM and pull a
     soot-blackened form out of a hole. As the CAMERA PUSHES
     closer, we see that it is Cynthia. Her clothes are torn and
     singed, and she is unconscious, but as they work on her we
     see that she is largely unharmed.

     passionate, dreamlike. They are completely enjoying each
     other. The satisfaction seems spiritual. They stare into
     each other's eyes the entire time. They are lost.

     Gradually Victor's rhythm builds. As his momentum increases,
     as the ecstasy nears, Cynthia accelerates too. Heaving,
     gasping, they are approaching a beautiful climax.

     But just when it seems Victor is on the verge, the very
     threshold, he stops and JUMPS violently out of bed.

                           VICTOR

     Victor paces around the room, practically bouncing off the
     walls.

               Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

             Not wrong, Cynthia...right! The
             most right thing in the world!

He goes to his closet and pulls out a shoe box. He holds it
with a coy expression, like a kid hiding a frog. Cynthia's
annoyance with the break in mood fades in light of his
exuberance. Their tone with each other remains loving,
kidding.

     opens again against a purse--Miriam's purse. The elevator is

             Dr. Berrisford, what would you call

      There are metal grating steps leading up to a platform that
      sits adjacent to a huge spinning turbine, its six-foot blades
      WHIRRING at top speed. Air ducts lead in and out of the
      space.

      Connie is uplifted, frightened, exhilarated. Their clothes
      and hair are blown around. They ascend the platform, and sit
      across from each other. They each take a swig. They kiss
      softly, spiritually.

       This is a low passageway between floors. Edgar has to stoop
       under the ducts and pipes. He comes to a small hatchway in
       the coiling above him marked "CAUTION: Turbine."

       There is a latch which has to be pulled to release the
       hatchway. Edgar pulls. It's stuck. He yanks with his frail
       body. The latch barely moves.

       A TRICKLE OF BLOOD streams out at the edge, but Edgar doesn't
       see it.

       Edgar yanks and pulls with all his might, groaning and
       heaving. Finally he stops in frustration. He sits an a
       duct, resting.

       Just then the latch undoes itself. The hatchway slams open.
       Edgar is showered with red lumpy fluid. He is coated with
       it.

      The two security guards start     running over. One of them has
      his gun drawn. Alan wants to      run, but he sees there is no
      way out. He sticks his hands      in the air. The guards are
      upon him. They start leading      him away.

      He looks back at Hettie.    He sees a fire alarm.

      Suddenly, he grabs one of the Guard's guns.       He dives against
      the wall and pulls the fire alarm.

      Alan runs from the guards, shooting but missing. He runs up

      latch to secure the door. SIRENS and BELLS continue. Alan
      looks over. The room is dark, except for the red light
      flashing on and off. Cynthia is crouched in the far corner
      by the open window.

railing. Berrisford moves several yards to stay close...
begins to POUND on Alan's mutilated hand.

Alan's grip on her slips down to two fingers. They CRACK.
She yells from the pain. She swings in the breeze.

They start helping Alan up by Pulling his arm. As they help

wall. He leans against the wall and puts the gun to his
head. He trembles. He pulls the trigger.

      A mere skeleton of what it was. Daylight pours in through
      the faded, burnt slats of wood. Patches of woods have

Cynthia clasps her hand around the knife at her chest, Harris
lets go. She holds it there by herself, completely
hypnotized by his words, by his eyes.

She is weak now.    She is about to do it.

Her grasp tightens around the knife handle.      She's trembling.
She takes a deep breath.

      She swats the knife at them all. Victor's arm gets cut.
      Gilda has to dive away from her. Cynthia is knocking over

      She drops the knife. The knife is all rusty and corroded.
      The floor is a charred mass.

      Cynthia turns around.

      Alan comes in the front door. The room is again its empty,
      skeletal self, blackened and silent.

      She stands on the porch, holding onto a post, trying to calm
      herself. Alan comes out. As he starts the car, a gust comes
      up. The trees are thrashed around.

      by violent gusts as we MOVE TOWARD the structure.
