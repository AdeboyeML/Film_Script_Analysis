          EXT. PARIS FRANCE - PONT DE BIR-HAKEIM - DAY
                         
          PAUL (50's) stands on the street under a RAISED TRAIN BRIDGE.
          He covers his ears in UTTER DISGUST at the UNBEARABLE NOISE a
          train makes as it ROARS OVERHEAD.
                         
          He BELLOWS TO THE HEAVENS.

           FUCKING GOD!!!!
                         
          As the train moves on he walks, slowly, DESPONDENT. Lost in a
          private WORLD OF PAIN.
                         
          Behind him we see a woman in a fur collard coat and flowered
          hat walking, gaining on him. This is JEANNE (20's).
                         
          As she PASSES Paul, she turns to GLANCE at him. We read a
          HINT of EMPATHY on her face.
                         
          He is OBLIVIOUS to her or anything else for that matter.
                         
          She walks on, dodging STREET SWEEPERS as she covers the long
          walkway, trying to forget the SAD MAN she saw.
                         
          We see her walk toward a 6 story APARTMENT BUILDING.
                         
          Paul, with TEARS STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE, comes to reality as
          he also notices the building. He REGARDS it.

          Jeanne stands looking at the grandeur of the building at 1
          RUE JULES VERNE. She reads a FOR RENT sign on the door frame.
          She HESITATES but then RINGS THE BELL. She checks her watch.
                         
          She SMILES to herself then descends the nearby stairs.
                         
          She goes into a BAR.

           Thank you.
                         
          Jeanne goes to the TELEPHONE/WASHROOM.
                         
          The telephone booth is OCCUPIED.
                         
          As she waits, she watches in disgust as an OLD LADY cleans
          her DENTURES with a toothbrush and then puts them back in her
          mouth.
                         
          Jeanne STUDIES her own face in the MIRROR, puffing her cheeks
          up in judgement. As she does, Paul exits the phone booth,
          still LOST IN ANGUISH.
                         
          After watching him leave, Jeanne USES THE PAY PHONE. She
          speaks to her MOM.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Mama? Yes, it's Jeanne. I've found
           a flat to rent in Passy. I'm going
           to see it.
                         
          She puts her foot up on the seat. We see her LONG BOOTS as
          her SHORT SKIRT hikes up.
                         
                          JEANNE (CONT'D)
           Then I've got to go to the station
           to met Tom. I promised him. OK, see

          Jeanne talks to THE CRAZY CONCIERGE through a SMALL WINDOW
          who is SMOKING and has ROLLERS in her hair.
                         
                          JEANNE

           the sign.

          The Concierge joins Jeanne AT THE WINDOW.
                         
                          CONCIERGE
           It's always the same! Nobody ever
           tells me anything.
                         
                          JEANNE

           They rent, they leave and I'm the
           last to know. Do you think that's
           right?
                         
          She sits at her desk and PUTS OUT HER CIGARETTE.

           Go on. I'm afraid of spiders. The
           key is missing. Strange things
           happen.
          One of the APT. GUESTS puts an empty WINE BOTTLE outside
          their door. They both TAKE NOTICE.
                         
                          CONCIERGE (CONT'D)
           They drink six bottles a day.
                         
          Jeanne thinks the place is like a FUNNY FARM. As the
          concierge TRILLS OUT FIGARO, she gives up and walks away.

          Jeanne, against her better judgement, goes back to the desk.
          She holds out her hand. The Concierge puts the KEY IN HER
          HAND.

          LAUGHING CRAZY, HYSTERICAL. Jeanne has to forcefully break
          away from her grasp.

           her being arrested nude. We lived
           in this small town. Farming

           she'd be gone. In jail... or

           Yeah. Some. There was a farmer, a
           very nice guy. Old guy, very poor,
           and worked real hard. I used to
           work in a ditch, draining land for
           farming. And he wore overalls and
           he smoked a clay pipe. Half the
           time he wouldn't put tobacco in it.
           And I hated the work. It was hot
           and dirty and... it broke my back.
           And... all day long I'd watch his
           spit which would run down the pipe
           stem and hang on the bowl of the
           pipe. And I used to make bets with
           myself on when it was going to fall
           off. And I always lost. I never saw
           it fall off. I'd just look around
           and it'd be gone and then the new
           one would be there. And then we had
           a beautiful... My mother... My
           mother taught me to love nature.
           And... I guess that was the most
           she could do. And... we had... In
           front of our house we had this big
           field... meadow. It was a mustard
           field in the summer and we had a
           big black dog named Dutchy. And she
           used to hunt for rabbits in that
           field but she couldn't see them. So
           she'd have to leap up in this
           mustard field and look around very
           quickly to see where the rabbits
           were. And it was... very beautiful.
           And she never caught the rabbits.

           The first time? I was really late
           for school. I started running and
           it was downhill. All of a sudden,
           I felt a strong sensation here.
           So I ran and ran and I came as I
           ran. The faster I ran, the better
           it was and the more I came. A
           couple of days later, I tried to do
           it again, but no luck.

           That's not true. When you're full,
           you put a sign outside. I know the
           hotel. I'm sick of arguing out on
           the street. Call the owner. What
           are you waiting for? The owner has
           never made a fuss. Rosa and I are

           Oh,... please don't tell her you
           found me. I don't fancy it any
           more. Did you see her face? Once,
           my wife satisfied me. But now she's
           got a skin disease. It's like
           snakeskin. Put yourself in my

           example, adults...
                         
          He walks slowly toward her. They EMBRACE PASSIONATELY. They
          kiss.

           No, no. I've got to close the

          RAISED WALKWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          We suddenly see Paul. He watches her for a moment before
          TRAILING HER. He is more DRESSED UP then we have seen him
          previously.

           There's nothing to understand. We

           little hotel, a kind of a dump. But
           it's not completely a flophouse.
           And... I used to live on my luck,

          As Paul WAXES ON, we watch a TANGO CONTEST in progress. He
          wanders RUDELY between the DANCERS on the DANCE FLOOR,
          invading their space and lighting a cigarette.

           But you know, what the hell. I'm...
           no prize. I picked up a nail when I
           was in Cuba in and now I got a
           prostate like an Idaho potato. But
           I'm still a good stick man, even if
           I can't have any children. Let's
           see. I don't have any stomping
           grounds. I don't have any friends.
           I suppose if I hadn't met you, I'd
           probably settle for a hard chair
           and a hemorrhoid. Anyway, to make a
           long, dull story even duller, I
           come from a time when a guy like me
           would drop into a joint like this
           and pick up a young chick like you
           and... and call her a bimbo.
                         
          He reaches the other side of the dance floor where Jeanne
          waits for him. She is able to SMILE now at his SHENANIGANS.
