          FADE IN
          
          EXT. BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT
          
          On a FREEZE FRAME of a huge mortar on the edge of a dismal no-man's land, 
          surrounded by trees and overhanging branches. The distant roar of battle 
          RUMBLES ominously. SUPERIMPOSED TITLES appear and hold for a moment. 
          
          Abruptly, the image springs to life. The gun FIRES deafeningly. The nearby 
          branches shake violently. Another set of TITLES appears. The image FREEZES 
          again as a lone bugle plays a charge. Again and again and again, the image 
          moves, the gun DISCHARGES noisily, the image FREEZES and more sets of TITLES 
          appear with every FIRING.
          
          On the last discharge, the trumpet fades and all hell breaks loose:
          
          WAR MONTAGE
          
          Nothing but FAST, BRUTAL FLASH CUTS of:
          
          Cannon firing in all directions. 
          
          Massive explosions on the battlefield that light up the night. 
          
          Troops marching across a bridge as a shell hits the river below sending water 
          towering into the sky. 
          
          An entire cavalry division galloping hard over the battlefield, blazing mortar 
          fire visible above them on the horizon.
          
          Brief shots of the horses, their grim riders hanging on for dear life, their 
          muscles flexing, hooves pounding the dirt. Men yelling.
          
          FASTER AND FASTER, MORE AND MORE CHAOTIC:
          
          Mortar fire, explosions, smoke.
          
          A machine gunner fires.
          
          A soldier falls.
          
          Infantrymen, rifles in hand, press through the haze.
          
          More machine gunning.
          
          More soldiers go down.
          
          A massive gun fires.
          
          SMASH CUT of a tank tread bearing down on the CAMERA, blacking out the screen.
          
          Infantrymen trail behind the heavy machinery, firing pistols, rifles.
          
          A bridge explodes. A building explodes. The ground explodes.
          
          A bomb drops from an airplane.
          
          Aerial view of an exploding building.
          
          Anti-aircraft guns at work.
          
          Planes in the air.
          
          A machine gun fires skyward.
          
          Planes circle, filling the air.
          
          A single bi-plane.
          
          The plane's gunner, SHEP LAMBERT, looks down, surveys the situation, breaks 
          into a grin.
          
          Shep nudges his pilot, CARY LOCKWOOD, and points. Cary looks down to see:
          
          Another plane below. In it, pilot BILL TALBOT waves and salutes. FRANCIS, the 
          gunner, opens his mouth, smiles and nods up at them.
          
          An enemy plane arrives.
          
          The enemy pilot fires his twin machine guns.
          
          Bill and Francis' plane spins away.
          
          Bill cocks a snook at the enemy plane and waves dismissively at it, much to 
          Francis' amusement.
          
          The planes circle in the air.
          
          The enemy plane trails Shep and Cary. Shep FIRES his machine gun to no avail 
          as Cary watches.
          
          The enemy pilot returns fire.
          
          The two planes tango in mid-air.
          
          Shep FIRES.
          
          The enemy pilot grins and FIRES.
          
          Bullet holes riddle the side of Shep and Cary's plane.
          
          Cary warns Shep they've been hit.
          
          From the enemy plane's POV, Shep and Cary's plane streams black smoke.
          
          The two planes. Shep and Cary's plane goes into a steep dive, spinning out of 
          control.
          
          Cary rips off his goggles as smoke pours up from below him.
          
          Flames fill the cockpit as Cary's gloved hands desperately try to keep hold of 
          the red hot controls.
          
          The plane, streaming smoke, spins wildly downward.
          
          Shep, surrounded with smoke, looks skyward and salutes with mock gallantry.
          
          Above, Bill and Francis watch. Bill returns the salute with a smile and waves. 
          Francis, though, doesn't look happy.
          
          Shep twists in his seat and looks around.
          
          Cary's hands grasp the controls in the flaming cockpit.
          
          				SHEP (o.s.)
          		Level off, Cary! Level off!
          
          Despite the flames, Cary pulls back on the control stick.
          
          From the plane's POV: The landscape rushes by.
          
          The plane, now level, crashes into the ground and comes to an abrupt stop.
          
          Smoke. Flames.
          
          Cary jumps out of the cockpit and rushes back to Shep who is struggling to 
          clamber out.
          
          				CARY
          		Shep! Shep, are you all right?
          
          				SHEP
          		Can't make it, Cary. Can't make it.
          
          				CARY
          		Here, give me your arm! I'll get 
          		you out of here! Hang on there, 
          		Shep! Get a hold - Just hold tight, 
          		old fella.
          
          Cary pulls Shep out and hauls him away from the burning wreckage where the two 
          of them collapse to the ground, half-conscious.
          
          Flames consume the plane.

          A TEMPERATURE CHART
          for Lieutenant Shep Lambert, a patient at U.S. Army A.E.F. Base Hospital 145. 
          Shep's temperature readings for October 11th to October 26th are indicated by 
          a line on a graph, near a level marked CRITICAL. The distant sound of battle 
          continues to RUMBLE.
          
          ANOTHER CHART
          swings into view. This one is for Lieutenant Cary Lockwood whose readings for 
          October 27th to November 2nd are also below the CRITICAL mark. The line 
          continues and improves considerably by November 11th when the final reading is 
          marked NORMAL.
          
          					DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
          The battle sounds are now joined by a loudly TICKING clock. With no sign of
          energy or emotion, Shep and Cary sit together on a hospital cot in full 
          uniform. Shep wears dark eyeglasses. Cary has a coat draped over his hands. He 
          glances off. We follow his gaze, PANNING past other patients in the hospital 
          to a wall clock and calendar. It is November 11th and the time is almost 
          eleven A. M. The battle's RUMBLE drones on.
          
          SHEP AND CARY
          stare up at the clock. Behind his dark glasses, Shep's left eye twitches.
          
          THE CLOCK 
          slowly DISSOLVES to one last BRIEF BATTLE MONTAGE: soldiers yelling and 
          running, guns firing noisily, a plane crashing, explosions. The final image is 
          of a plane parked on the ground, its engine dying, its propeller slowing to a 
          stop as we DISSOLVE BACK TO the clock face. The center of the clock is lined 
          up exactly with the center of the propeller -- the slowing propeller blades 
          are replaced by the clock's hands -- as if to symbolically suggest that the 
          war has ended but time goes on. The NOISE of battle fades and only the TICKING 
          of the clock remains. DISSOLVE TO the calendar: November 11th, 1918 -- 
          Armistice Day. 
          
          SHEP AND CARY
          sit motionless side-by-side on the cot. Shep has a hand over his left eye.
          
          				CARY
          		Well, the old guerre is finie.
          
          				SHEP
          		That's right.
          
          				CARY
          		What are ya gonna do now, Shep?
          
          				SHEP
          		Get tight.
          
          				CARY
          			(turns to him)
          		And then what?
          
          Shep lets go of his eye and looks at Cary as if the answer were obvious.
          
          				SHEP
          		Stay tight.
          
          Cary grins wryly.
          
          					CUT TO:
          
          INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NOT LONG AFTER
          A nurse opens a door for Shep and Cary who enter. Shep wears his dark glasses. 
          Cary carries his coat to hide his hands. They pause as the doors they have 
          passed through close behind them.
          
          Their distinguished-looking doctor, a medical officer with a white gown over 
          his uniform, sits at his desk studying their papers.
          
          				DOCTOR
          		Lieutenants Lambert and Lockwood. 
          			(rises, joins them)
          		You two leaving us, eh? In a way, 
          		I'm sorry to release you two. I have 
          		no choice in the matter.
          
          Shep removes his glasses and presses his hand to his eye.
          
          				SHEP
          		What am I going to do, Major, about 
          		my-- oh, this rotten business?
          
          The doctor examines Shep's eye more closely.
          
          				DOCTOR
          		Mm? Spasmodic twitching of the 
          		muscles under the eye, eh, 
          		Lieutenant?
          
          				SHEP
          		Mm hm.
          
          				DOCTOR
          		What the French call a tic. T-I-C, 
          		tic. Little bothersome, isn't it?
          
          Shep puts his glasses back on.
          
          				SHEP
          		Yes, sir.
          
          				DOCTOR
          		I'm afraid time'll have to take care 
          		of that. Time and normal living. 
          
          Shep's lips tighten skeptically.
          
          				DOCTOR
          		You two are returning to the United 
          		States, I presume?
          
          Shep glances at Cary.
          
          				CARY
          		Ah, we haven't decided.
          
          				DOCTOR
          		I'd take the first boat home. Well, 
          		here you go.
          
          The doctor gives Shep his release form and shakes his hand, then turns to 
          shake Cary's. Cary merely looks down darkly and raises a bandaged hand at him.
          
          				DOCTOR
          		Oh, I forgot your burnt hands. 
          
          The doctor folds up the release and stuffs it in Cary's breast pocket.
          
          				DOCTOR
          		Neither of you is fully hospitalized. 
          		I'd undertake a systematic course of 
          		finger exercises -- to, uh, stretch 
          		them and loosen them up. In time, 
          		you'll regain their full use.
          
          				CARY
          		Thank you, sir.
          
          The doctor gives Cary a pat on the shoulder. 
          
          				DOCTOR
          		Bye, Lieutenant. 
          
          Cary manages a smile and salutes. Shep moves to the door, saluting the doctor.
          
          				DOCTOR
          		Bye, Lieutenant. Good luck.
          
          Shep opens the door and he and Cary head out. After the door closes, the 
          doctor rubs his head thoughtfully. He talks, apparently, to an offscreen aide.
          
          				DOCTOR
          		Well, there they go. Out to face 
          		life. 
          			(shakes his head)
          		And their whole training was in 
          		preparation for death.
          
          He moves off as we
          
          					CUT TO:
          
          EXT. HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER
          Shep and Cary exit the building but pause outside the doorway. They've seen 
          something coming toward them and glance at one another before clearing out of 
          its path. They watch glumly as a small group of wounded soldiers enter through 
          some metal gates, walk slowly past Shep and Cary without acknowledgment, and 
          head into the hospital. 
          
          					CUT TO:
          
          EXT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - PERHAPS SIMULTANEOUS
          The office window opens. The doctor -- no longer in white but wearing his 
          uniform -- and his aide take a break, standing in the window frame for a 
          little fresh air. The doctor smokes a cigarette as they discuss Shep and Cary.
          
          				AIDE
          		Why can't they go on with flying? 
          		You know, the air mails or 
          		something?
          
          				DOCTOR
          		I'm afraid they're unfit for further 
          		service in that direction. 
          
          The aide looks at him, quizzically.
          
          				DOCTOR
          		They fell, you know -- six thousand 
          		meters. 
          			(shakes his head, sadly)
          		Like dropping a fine Swiss watch on 
          		the pavement. Shattered both of them. 
          		Their nervous systems are deranged, 
          		disorganized, brittle.
          
          				AIDE
          		Spent bullets.
          
          				DOCTOR
          		Spent bullets. That's it. 
          			(nods)
          		They're like projectiles, shaped 
          		for war and hurled at the enemy. 
          			(gestures with cigarette)
          		They've described a beautiful,
          		high-arching trajectory. And now 
          		they've fallen back to earth. 
          		Spent. Cooled off. Useless.
          
          We slowly PULL BACK from the two men.
          
          				AIDE
          		Oh, well, if they take care of 
          		themselves, they'll pull through 
          		all right.
          
          				DOCTOR
          		Even if they do take care of 
          		themselves, what good are they? 
          		What can you expect of them? 
          			(shakes his head)
          		I hate to think what may become 
          		of them.
          
          We have pulled back far enough and now we

          EXT. HOSPITAL - NOT LONG AFTER
          Two uniformed men with familiar faces -- exuberant pilot Bill and reserved 
          gunner Francis -- arrive at the bottom of the stairs in front of the hospital. 
          Bill, with his arm in a sling, and Francis, using a cane, start up the stairs 
          and wave.
          
          				BILL
          			(Texas accent)
          		Hello, Cary!
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Hi, Cary!
          
          At the top of the stairs, Shep and Cary wave back, pleased to see them. 
          
          				CARY
          		Hello, Bill! Hiya, Francis!
          
          				SHEP
          		Hello, Bill! Francis!
          
          Unexpectedly, Shep and Cary hurry down the stairs past them.
          
          				CARY
          			(friendly)
          		Well, I see you got yours.
          
          				BILL
          			(pleasantly)
          		Yup. We crashed.
          
          Bill and Francis watch, surprised, as Shep and Cary hurry off.
          
          				BILL
          			(calls down, puzzled)
          		Hey! Where you going?
          
          Shep and Cary, already seated in the back of a waiting automobile, grin like 
          kids.
          
          				CARY
          		Paris!
          
          				BILL (o.s.)
          		Paris?! 
          
          From the stairs, Francis smokes a cigarette and looks down at Shep and Cary 
          uncertainly. But Bill takes the news in stride -- he smiles and waves his hat 
          at them.
          
          				BILL
          		See you in Paris!
          
          				FRANCIS
          			(waves his cigarette)
          		Yeah.
          
          Smiling, Shep and Cary wave back as their car drives off.

          			PARIS -- 1919.
          
          Traffic noise, taxi horns squeaking.
          
          					DISSOLVE TO:
          
          EXT. PARIS SIDEWALK - NIGHT
          Strolling down the sidewalk four abreast, as if they own the town, come our 
          heroes -- Bill, Shep, Francis and Cary -- in smart hats and dinner clothes. 
          
          Outwardly, they seem to have recovered from their wounds. But: 
          
          Shep still wears his dark glasses and we occasionally glimpse his eye 
          twitching. 
          
          Cary's bandages are gone but he has not regained full use of his hands. His 
          personality is dark and dry, more subdued than Shep's, and he comes across as 
          the most levelheaded, rational member of the group -- its unacknowledged 
          leader.
          
          Francis seems to have suffered the greatest toll psychologically. A 
          narcoleptic, strangely detached and unemotional much of the time, always on 
          the verge of dozing off, his speech slurs even when he isn't drunk.
          
          Only the athlete of the group, Bill -- a burly Texan whose full name is 
          William Talbot -- is in outstanding physical shape. But he is reckless, 
          restless, and temperamental, covering up unnamed insecurities with bravado and 
          forced exuberance.
          
          				CARY
          		How 'bout a cocktail?
          
          				SHEP
          		Not a bad idea at that.
          
          As a group, they turn and head into a nearby building.
          
          					BRIEF DISSOLVE TO:
          
          A GLOWING SIGN 
          made of light bulbs, outside the building. It spells out CLARIDGE'S -- a 
          popular Parisian drinking establishment for Anglo-Americans.
          
          					DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. CLARIDGE'S - NIGHT
          Numerous shelves holding numerous bottles of liquor. Employees in white 
          jackets hurriedly rush in and pull down a few bottles.
          
          					DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. CLARIDGE'S BAR - LENGTHY PANNING SHOT
          The place is packed with well-dressed men and women. The bar is crowded with 
          men (and men only, for no women are allowed to sit at Claridge's bar) smoking, 
          drinking, conversing. At the end of the PAN, we discover our heroes entering, 
          greeted by an employee who takes their hats.
          
          ANOTHER VIEW - NEAR THE BAR
          An attractive young woman with a wide, vacant stare stands against a wall 
          opposite the bar holding a champagne glass in her hands. Her name is NIKKI and 
          she seems to be in a world all to herself.
          
          Our four handsome heroes file past her, intent on finding a table. Only Cary 
          pays any attention to Nikki. After they have all passed her, he pauses to turn 
          and stare. She's extremely nearsighted and doesn't notice him. He looks at the 
          glass in her hand, puzzled. He starts off but then pauses. 
          
          After a second uncertain look, he moves off to join his friends who stand 
          together and peer around the crowded room, unable to find a place to sit. Cary 
          keeps looking at Nikki. He glances at the others and they follow his gaze:
          
          NIKKI
          still wearing a blank expression, clutches the glass in two hands.
          
          THE GLASS
          in her hands. Between her fingers, we glimpse its contents -- a complete set 
          of men's false teeth.
          
          We PULL BACK to discover that Cary has approached her. He's standing right 
          next to her and is staring at the glass. She finally notices him.
          
          				CARY
          		I beg your pardon. But, if I'm not 
          		too inquisitive, would you mind 
          		telling me what IS that you're 
          		drinking?
          
          				NIKKI
          		Teeth.
          
          				CARY
          		Teeth?
          
          After another look, Cary turns to his friends.
          
          				CARY
          		Hey, it's teeth!
          
          				BILL (o.s.)
          		Teeth?!
          
          Shep, Bill and Francis hurry over like children and crowd around to stare in 
          amazement at the teeth. Nikki is unimpressed by all the attention.
          
          				SHEP
          		Teeth!
          
          				NIKKI
          		That's right.
          
          				BILL
          			(enthusiastic)
          		Yup. It's a full set -- upper and 
          		lower.
          
          				CARY
          			(to Nikki)
          		It's a nice expression. 
          
          				SHEP
          		Hey, how come you're with those 
          		teeth?
          
          				NIKKI
          		I was just standing here. And a nice 
          		gentleman came along and begged my 
          		pardon and asked would I mind 
          		holding his teeth for a minute.
          
          				CARY
          		Well, what did he want you to hold 
          		his teeth for?
          
          				NIKKI
          		Said he wanted to biff somebody.
          
          				BILL
          			(excited)
          		Biff somebody?! Which way did he go?!
          
          				NIKKI
          		Just around to the right.
          
          				BILL
          		Come on, men! We're liable to see a 
          		fight.
          
          As quickly as they arrived, Shep, Bill and Francis depart. Cary starts after 
          them but stops to politely address Nikki who has gone back into her trance.
          
          				CARY
          		Would you like to come along?
          
          				NIKKI
          			(as if it were obvious)
          		Oh, no. I have to stay here and mind 
          		the man's teeth.
          
          They glance down at the teeth.
          
          				CARY
          		Oh, of course.
          
          Cary hurries off as Nikki's empty eyes rise to the ceiling.
          
          FLASH CUT - A MAN'S FACE
          as it takes a combination one-two punch from a pair of fists.
          
          FLASH CUT - THE MAN'S BODY
          dropping unconscious to the floor.
          
          OUR FOUR HEROES
          enter a hallway just in time to see two Claridge's employees reach down and 
          haul away the unconscious body. Our heroes have missed the fight but Shep and 
          Bill are delighted anyway. Bill brushes his hands (one of his favorite 
          gestures) with satisfaction, as if he had thrown the punches himself:
          
          				BILL
          		Well. THAT'S all fixed.
          
          Bill straightens his bow-tie. Already the group seeks a new distraction.
          
          				CARY
          		Let's go back.
          
          They head back to the bar.
          
          THE BAR
          Nikki, no longer standing against the wall, sits on a bar stool with her back 
          to the countertop, smoking a cigarette and holding an empty champagne glass. 
          Our heroes enter and, glancing at the wall, fail to see her. After a moment of 
          searching, Cary spots her at the bar.
          
          				CARY
          		Oh, there she is.
          
          All four crowd around her, pleased to be in her company.
          
          				BILL
          		Well, we missed it.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Did something happen?
          
          				BILL
          		Well, they carried a guy out.
          			(sees her empty glass)
          		Say! What's become of the teeth? 
          
          				NIKKI
          		Oh, the man came and got his teeth.
          
          				CARY
          		Well, what did he say?
          
          				NIKKI
          		He said thank you for holding his 
          		teeth.
          
          				CARY
          		What did he look like?
          
          				NIKKI
          		I think he fell in an airplane in 
          		the war -- and got his teeth knocked 
          		out.
          
          				CARY
          		Well, why do you think he was in the 
          		war?
          
          				NIKKI
          		Oh, he had a kind of little striped 
          		ribbon in his buttonhole.
          
          				CARY
          		What makes you think he was a flyer?
          
          				NIKKI
          		His eyes.
          
          				CARY
          		His eyes? 
          			(dry, to the others)
          		You can tell a flyer better by his 
          		ears.
          
          The men chuckle.
          
          				SHEP
          		Well, what do you say we have a 
          		drink?
          
          				BILL
          		Fine!
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Sure, here's some space.
          
          Seats have opened up at the bar so they grab stools next to Nikki. Shep greets 
          the bartender:
          
          				SHEP
          		Hello, Jean!
          
          				JEAN
          		Bon soir, Monsieur Lambert. 
          		Qu'est-ce que voulez-vous [?]
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Martini!
          
          				BILL
          		Martini!
          
          				CARY
          		Martini!
          
          				SHEP
          		Martiniiii!
          
          				NIKKI
          		Could I have a champagne cocktail?
          
          				JEAN
          		Certainment, Mademoiselle. 
          			(calls off)
          		Quatre Martinis pour messieurs! 
          		Champagne cocktail pour Mademoiselle 
          		Nikki!
          
          The men are all excited to find out her name. Francis uses a pretzel as a 
          monocle to eye Nikki.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Nikki?!
          
          				BILL
          		Nikki?!
          
          				CARY
          		Nikki?!
          
          For the first time this evening, Shep takes off his dark glasses.
          
          				SHEP
          		Can you imagine that, fellas? Her 
          		name is Nikki!
          
          				CARY
          			(considers the
          			situation)
          		Her name is Nikki. She holds men's 
          		teeth. She sits at the bar and she 
          		drinks champagne.
          
          				BILL
          			(significantly)
          		Boys, she's gonna be a lot of 
          		trouble.
          
          Drinks are served. A moment of silence as they imbibe. Nikki's hand shakes as 
          she lifts her glass, spilling some champagne. She laughs, embarrassed.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Oh, my, my!
          
          Shep, who has been watching her closely, also laughs.
          
          				SHEP
          		Poor sweet! She can't even hold her 
          		glass!
          
          Nikki notices Cary unsteadily using both his hands to hold his Martini.
          
          				NIKKI
          			(casually)
          		Oh, well, HE can't either. Besides, 
          		he has to use two hands.
          
          Nikki chuckles. A dark look crosses Cary's face as he looks at her and puts 
          down his drink. Seeing this, Bill and Francis exchange worried glances. Cary 
          abruptly rises and leaves the bar. Mystified, Nikki looks quizzically at Shep 
          who is suddenly grim and annoyed.
          
          				SHEP
          		Course he can't hold his glass. His 
          		hands are burned.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Burned?
          
          				SHEP
          		You have no right to spill YOUR 
          		drinks. He can't help himself.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Burned? How burned?
          
          				SHEP
          		He brought a plane down on fire.
          
          				NIKKI
          		An airplane? In the war?
          
          Shep demonstrates with his hands as he explains:
          
          				SHEP
          		He held the stick. But his hands 
          		began to slip. Then he held it 
          		inside his arms. He was trying to 
          		bring his rear gunner down alive.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Did he bring him down safe?
          
          				SHEP
          		Well... 
          
          Shep takes a swallow of his Martini, sets down the glass.
          
          				SHEP
          		Brought him down.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Oh, so that's why--?
          
          				SHEP
          		Yes! That's why he can't hold a 
          		glass.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Oh, I'm so ashamed. 
          
          				SHEP
          		Now, Cary's had a pretty thin time. 
          		His nerves are tricky. You should 
          		never call attention to his hands.
          
          AT A TABLE
          Cary sits with a fresh drink and is trying awkwardly to pick it up when a 
          handsome but humorless American journalist -- the unspeakable FRINK -- enters 
          and greets him casually.
          
          				FRINK
          		Hi, Cary.
          
          				CARY
          			(unhappily)
          		Oh, hello, Frink.
          
          Cary immediately turns his attention to a menu. Rebuffed, Frink wanders over 
          to the bar and sees the other men. He has a friendly pat on the back for 
          Francis and Bill.
          
          				FRINK
          		Hello, Francis. Bill. 
          
          Frink pauses to stare at Nikki's back, astonished to find a woman sitting at 
          the bar. Then he turns to Shep, amused.
          
          				FRINK
          		Shep. Drunk again?
          
          				SHEP
          		Say, don't you know any OTHER 
          		opening remarks? It's about all 
          		we've heard from you for a year.
          
          				FRINK
          			(signals the bartender)
          		Hi! Jean!
          
          Frink snaps his fingers at Jean and grabs a seat next to Shep. Jean asks for 
          Frink's order in French.
          
          				FRINK
          		Un sidecar.
          
          				JEAN
          		Sidecar ... [?]
          
          Jean moves off. Frink regards the others.
          
          				FRINK
          		Say, why don't you fellows go home 
          		and go to work?
          
          				SHEP
          		Work? What kind of work?
          
          				FRINK
          		Oh, anything useful.
          
          				BILL
          		What could we do? Sell washing 
          		machines? Drive a milk wagon? Mend 
          		old furniture or somethin'? Heh!
          
          				FRINK
          		Go back to flying. Fly the air 
          		mails. 
          
          				BILL
          		Aw, we couldn't fly a kite. 
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Maybe a small kite.
          
          Francis holds his fingers to indicate a very small kite. Bill chuckles.
          
          				FRINK
          		Well, there must be something you 
          		can do.
          
          				SHEP
          		We've got to tend to our drinking. 
          		We don't get much opportunity. 
          
          				FRINK
          		Lots of things going on outside. 
          		Sun shining, trees growing, people 
          		walking around.
          
          				BILL
          		Say! Is that STILL going on?
          
          				SHEP
          			(laughs) 
          		Sounds pretty pre-war to me.
          
          During all this, Nikki has been in her own little world. Frink leans over and 
          whispers to Shep.
          
          				FRINK
          		Hey. Don't I rate an introduction? 
          		Who's your swell friend?
          
          				SHEP
          		Oh, her? Just an old hussy we found 
          		scattered around. 
          
          Around her neck, on a slender chain, Nikki carries a small lorgnette. It opens 
          with a spring and has small rectangular lenses. She uses it frequently, 
          peering at unfamiliar objects in her helpless, nearsighted way. On Shep's 
          remark, she whips it out to stare at him, mildly offended. He raises his drink 
          to his lips and turns to her, speaking out of the side of his mouth:
          
          				SHEP
          			(off Frink)
          		Pay no attention. Sometimes he goes 
          		away.
          
          Nikki looks away glumly as Shep grins at her. She turns and sees something. 
          She raises her lorgnette for a better look at:
          
          CARY
          who sits at his table, staring into space, holding his unread menu in his lap.
          
          NIKKI
          is pleased to see Cary.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Oh! He didn't go.
          
          She rises to join him.
          
          CARY
          startled, rises and stares at Nikki as she approaches.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Oh, I'm so sorry. Your hands... 
          
          She tries to take his hands but he pulls them away in horror and stuffs them 
          in his pockets.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Oh, your poor hands! Your poor, poor 
          		hands.
          
          Wildly uncomfortable, Cary glances around like a cornered animal and finally 
          stalks away without a word, hands still stuffed in his pockets. Stunned, Nikki 
          watches him exit the building. She realizes she's done something terribly 
          wrong and moves to follow him.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Oh!
          
          But Shep intercepts her. Upset, she whimpers. 
          
          				SHEP
          			(more in disbelief 
          			than anger)
          		If you aren't the WORST! First, you 
          		insult his hands and make him mad. 
          		Then you cry over them and make him 
          		self-conscious. Come on back here. 
          		Come on.
          
          He clasps her hand and leads her to:
          
          THE BAR
          Francis and Bill watch, disturbed, as Shep guides a crying Nikki onto a stool 
          beside them. Shep sits next to her as she continues to sob. She pulls out a 
          compact to fix her tear-stained face.
          
          				SHEP
          		Well, that's torn it. He'll never 
          		come back now.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Then we'll have to find him.
          
          				SHEP
          		What for?
          
          				NIKKI
          		To explain how sorry I am.
          
          				SHEP
          			(amused at her 
          			distress)
          		We-ell. You don't have to get so 
          		emotional about it.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Who's getting emotional?
          
          				SHEP
          		You are. You're coming all apart. 
          			(hands her a glass)
          		Here. Take a drink of this. Make 
          		you laugh and play.
          
          Nikki takes a sip, then busies herself with putting away her compact. 
          Meanwhile, Bill leans in.
          
          				BILL
          			(to Shep)
          		Say, what's she crying about?
          
          				SHEP
          		She's crying on account of they 
          		didn't wash her strawberries this 
          		morning.
          
          				BILL
          			(to Nikki)
          		Didn't they wash your strawberries 
          		this morning? Well, there ain't a 
          		whole hell of a lot that we can do 
          		about that now.
          
          				NIKKI
          			(agrees, sadly)
          		No.
          
          ANOTHER VIEW
          Frink watches suspiciously as Shep pays the tab, rises and whispers to Nikki.
          
          				SHEP
          		Let's go.
          
          Nikki obediently hops off her stool and Shep leads her away from the bar, 
          toward the exit. Bill and Frink are distressed to see her go. Bill calls after 
          Shep:
          
          				BILL
          		Hey! Where're you goin'?!
          
          				SHEP
          		Oh, out.
          
          				BILL
          			(rises)
          		Out where?!
          
          				SHEP (o.s.)
          		Out to get a drink.
          
          Bill gestures grandly toward the bar with its many shelves of liquor bottles.
          
          				BILL
          		Don't you suppose you could arrange 
          		that here?!
          
          				SHEP
          		Nope. We gotta go somewheres else.
          
          				BILL
          			(without missing a beat)
          		Okay. Come on, Francis. We got to go 
          		somewheres else to get a drink.
          
          Francis and Bill head out the door. After a moment, Frink follows behind.
          
          					DISSOLVE TO:
          
          EXT. AVENUE DES CHAMPS ÉLYSÉES - LATER THAT NIGHT
          A taxi cab -- filled with Bill, Francis, Shep, Nikki and Frink -- pulls up to 
          a restaurant. As it stops, Bill rises and points to someone at a sidewalk 
          table.
          
          				BILL
          		Hey! There he is!
          
          The others look.
          
          				SHEP
          		Where?
          
          				BILL
          		Come on!
          
          The group cheers, spills out of the taxi and heads for:
          
          THE SIDEWALK TABLE
          where Cary sits reading a newspaper. 
          
          				SHEP (o.s.)
          		Cary!
          
          Cary looks up. He rises, a little startled, and politely removes his hat. The 
          others crowd around him.
          
          				BILL
          		Say, what are you tryin' to do, 
          		disown us?
          
          				CARY
          			(genuinely polite)
          		Hello. Won't you sit down?
          
          				BILL
          		Sure we'll sit down. What'd ya think 
          		we'd do? Stand around?
          
          They all take seats around the little table. During this, Frink brings a chair 
          for Nikki who grabs a seat of her own. When he tries to use it to sit next to 
          her, Bill commandeers it for himself.
          
          				BILL
          			(with a wave, to Frink)
          		Thank you. 
          
          A waiter joins them as they settle in.
          
          				SHEP
          		Hello, Cary.
          
          				CARY
          		Hello, Shep. Hello, Nikki. What will 
          		you have to drink? 
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Martini!
          
          				BILL
          		Martini!
          
          				SHEP
          		Martini!
          
          				FRINK
          		Martini!
          
          				WAITER
          		Quatre Martinis?
          
          				NIKKI
          		Uh, could I have champagne, please?
          
          				WAITER
          		Champagne? Oui.
          
          The waiter departs. Off her order, Bill gives Nikki a look.
          
          				BILL
          		Boys, she's goin' to be a problem.
          
          				NIKKI
          			(explains, to Bill)
          		That's what I started on. 
          			(to Cary)
          		It upsets me if I change over to 
          		anything else.
          
          				CARY
          			(to Bill)
          		There's a lot of things wrong with 
          		this one. 
          			(to Nikki)
          		What were you doing at the bar at 
          		Claridge's anyway? 
          
          				SHEP
          		Yes. Don't you know you're not 
          		supposed to be there?
          
          				FRANCIS
          		There's a sign on the wall says 
          		ladies must sit at the back.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Can't read signs.
          
          				SHEP
          		Well, we'll just have to take care 
          		of her, that's all.
          
          				BILL
          		Do you think she's good-lookin' 
          		enough?
          
          				NIKKI
          		Oh, I know I'm not very good-
          		looking but--
          
          				CARY
          		But what?
          
          				NIKKI
          		But when I was a little girl, my 
          		mother always said I had the nicest 
          		hair-ribbon.
          
          Shep laughs derisively. The others give him a look and he shuts up. The drinks 
          arrive. All the men, save Cary, snatch up their glasses. Bill removes the 
          toothpicked olive and swallows his Martini whole. He watches Nikki rubbing her 
          champagne's drinking straw between her hands as if she were a Boy Scout trying 
          to start a fire.
          
          				BILL
          		Then there's her drinking.
          
          				NIKKI
          		What's the matter with my drinking?
          
          				BILL
          		You're a sissy drinker.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Well, maybe I can improve.
          
          Meanwhile, Cary attempts -- with some success -- to drink his Martini with one 
          unsteady hand. Bill inspects Nikki's mouth.
          
          				BILL
          		Then there's her teeth. Why, one of 
          		'em is turned sideways.
          
          				NIKKI
          			(points)
          		You mean this one?
          
          				BILL
          		That's it.
          
          				CARY
          		Why don't you have it turned around?
          
          				NIKKI
          		I don't have it turned around on 
          		account of it's a kind of help.
          
          				CARY
          		Well, in what respect does it kind 
          		of help?
          
          				NIKKI
          		Well, you see, when anyone kisses me 
          		too hard, it splits my lip. And you 
          		could tell when anyone kissed me too 
          		hard on account of my lip would 
          		bleed. So now I don't let anyone 
          		kiss me -- hard. 
          
          The men are amused. Nikki sips her champagne.
          
          				CARY
          		Well, we'll let that pass.
          
          Bill chuckles. Shep abruptly rises and walks off, presumably to the rest room.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Where's he gone?
          
          				CARY
          		Shep went off to sharpen his skates.
          
          				BILL
          		Now, about your nose.
          
          				NIKKI
          		What about my nose?
          
          				BILL
          		It isn't straight. It kind of turns 
          		up at the end.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Well, when I was a little girl, I 
          		got bumped by a swing.
          
          				CARY
          		How'd you happen to get bumped?
          
          				NIKKI
          		I just walked through the gate. I 
          		was only seven.
          
          				CARY
          		Oh, poor dear. Didn't you see it?
          
          				NIKKI
          		I can't see very far.
          
          				CARY
          		Did it hurt?
          
          				NIKKI
          		It made me dizzy all day.
          
          				CARY
          		Well, I guess we can't hold that 
          		against her.
          
          				BILL
          		We all make mistakes.
          
          				CARY
          		That's right. Michelangelo painted 
          		Adam with a navel.
          
          Bill and Nikki laugh at this. Suddenly, Nikki grows thoughtful. 
          
          				NIKKI
          		All the same, he'd look funny the 
          		other way -- even in a painting.
          
          They all consider this for a moment as a fresh round of drinks arrives. Frink 
          abruptly rises and walks off, presumably to the rest room.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Where's he gone?
          
          				BILL
          		He went off to shave a horse.
          
          				CARY
          		Have you got a husband or anything?
          
          				NIKKI
          		No husband. 
          
          				CARY
          		A mother?
          
          				NIKKI
          		Mother, yes. But we haven't met in 
          		quite a long time.
          
          				CARY
          		Why not in a long time?
          
          				NIKKI
          		Well, on account of my mother's name 
          		was Beulah. Now, you can't have a 
          		mother named Beulah. So I changed it 
          		to Jane. And that's how it all began.
          
          An odd CHIMING sound distracts them. They look off to see:
          
          FRANCIS
          the narcoleptic, arms folded, asleep in his chair. He awakes with a frown, 
          pulls a pocket watch from inside his jacket, opens it, and looks at it. The 
          chiming ends and he rises without a word and exits. 
          
          AT THE TABLE
          Nikki watches Francis' exit curiously. Bill waves her off before she can ask:
          
          				BILL
          		He's goin' off to tame an alligator.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Who is he, anyway?
          
          				CARY
          		Francis used to fly with us in the 
          		94th. The best shot in the squadron.

          				NIKKI
          		I like him.
          
          				CARY
          		He carries a chiming watch on 
          		account of he's always falling 
          		asleep in the daytime.
          
          				NIKKI
          		What kind of chimes?
          
          				CARY
          		Oh, Westminster, Canterbury, and 
          		Whittington.
          
          				NIKKI
          		I'll take vanilla.
          
          Cary puts a fist on his hip and gives Nikki an exasperated look. Taxi horns 
          squeak. Francis, Shep and Frink return from their various adventures and sit 
          down as Bill gives Nikki his opinion of Francis.
          
          				BILL
          		I think he's a washout.
          
          				SHEP
          		Well, just because you're a big 
          		bombardier and an All-American--
          
          				NIKKI
          			(interrupts)
          		All-American what?
          
          				SHEP
          		Halfback.
          
          				FRINK
          		Where?
          
          				CARY
          		Oh, Montana State or somewhere. 
          		Idaho or Nebraska or the Carlisle 
          		Indians or something. Didn't you 
          		never read about Bill? Bronko Bill 
          		-- the Alabama Flash?
          
          Bill grins as Nikki inspects him closely through her lorgnette.
          
          				NIKKI
          			(skeptical)
          		I think it's a forgery.
          
          Bill's face falls. He looks at Nikki.
          
          				BILL
          		Say! What do you want me to do? 
          		Tackle a horse?
          
          She nods. Shep is amused.
          
          				SHEP
          		Sure. Go ahead. Tackle a horse.
          
          				BILL
          			(with a dismissive wave)
          		All right, all right, I'll tackle a 
          		horse.
          
          Shep looks down the street.
          
          				SHEP
          		Here comes one now.
          
          They all look to see:
          
          A HORSE-DRAWN CAB 
          rolling down the street in their direction.
          
          AT THE TABLE
          Everyone watches as Bill rises and suddenly bolts in the direction of the cab.
          
          				BILL
          		Look out, horse!
          
          THE HORSE-DRAWN CAB 
          rolling along as Bill runs in and tackles the horse, locking his big arms 
          around the animal's front legs to trip up the poor creature.
          
          ON THE SIDEWALK
          Cary, horrified, stands and yells:
          
          				CARY
          		Hey, Bill! Bill! Come back here!
          
          Cary runs off, toward Bill, leaving a thrilled Shep and a worried Francis with 
          a distressed Nikki. They all stare in concerned amazement as a crowd of 
          pedestrians stops to watch the excitement.
          
          				NIKKI
          			(distraught)
          		Oh, Bill!
          
          AT THE HORSE-DRAWN CAB 
          Cary rushes up to the startled cab driver who is pulling hard on the reins.
          
          				CARY
          		Hey! What's the idea -- runnin' 
          		down my friend like that? Here! 
          
          Cary forces a wad of francs into the driver's hand. The cabman protests in 
          French but takes the cash.
          
          WIDER VIEW
          of the fallen horse as the driver descends from the cab. Standing up now, Bill 
          tries to haul the horse to its feet while Cary tries to placate the driver.
          
          				CARY
          		Never mind. Look where you're going 
          		in the future now. You just watch out 
          		where you're going!
          
          ANOTHER VIEW
          Bill grabs the horse by its bridle and tries to pull it up. The horse, sorely 
          annoyed, gets up on its own and shakes its head violently to drive Bill away. 
          Bill hangs on and tries to calm the horse. Cary tries to pull Bill away as 
          Frink, Francis and the driver gather around. Bill is more interested in 
          petting the horse which understandably shies away from him.
          
          				CARY
          			(admonishes Bill)
          		Now listen, come on out here, you 
          		old fool. 
          			(to the shying horse)
          		Whoa, whoa. 
          
          				BILL
          		Nice horsie.
          
          				CARY
          			(to Bill)
          		Now, listen, you ought to be ashamed 
          		of yourself. You old fool! You know 
          		what you'll do? You'll kill yourself 
          		one of these days. Now, come on, get 
          		out of here. Now, listen--
          
          Satisfied with the outcome of all this, Bill heads back for the sidewalk.
          
          				CARY
          			(to the driver)
          		You all right now, brother?
          
          The driver nods but is more concerned with reining in his skittish horse.
          
          				CARY
          		All right. Now, you just keep your 
          		horse, see? You got your money.
          
          The cabbie salutes Cary but pays more attention to his horse.
          
          BACK AT THE SIDEWALK TABLE
          The waiter sets out a fresh round of drinks as the group returns. Bill happily 
          dusts off the sleeve of his dinner jacket. Cary, beside him, leads him to his 
          seat. They all sit down under the following:
          
          				CARY
          		Hey, listen, Bill, you're All-
          		American, see? You're TWO All-
          		Americans! The lady's convinced 
          		you're the whole team. You don't 
          		have to tackle any more horses. 
          		How 'bout that? Drink your drink.
          
          				BILL
          			(pleased with himself)
          		Ahhh. Wasn't that a great spill?
          
          Nikki abruptly rises.
          
          				SHEP
          		Hey! Where are you going?
          
          				NIKKI
          		Would you all excuse me for a 
          		moment?
          
          				CARY
          		Well, where are you going?
          
          				NIKKI
          			(a grave announcement)
          		To take a Chinese singing lesson.
          
          Francis immediately understands that she's become one of them. He raises an 
          olive in the air and cheers:
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Hooray!
          
          The men rise and all but Frink cheer her lustily as she departs:
          
          				MEN
          		Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
          
          NIKKI
          walks proudly into the restaurant as the men cheer. A smiling maitre d' 
          directs her to the ladies' room.
          
          BACK AT THE TABLE
          Frink watches Nikki disappear from view and, after a glance at the others, 
          rises and follows her. Shep, Bill and Cary remain at the table, laughing and 
          drinking. Bill turns to Cary with a smile.
          
          				BILL
          		Hey. What kind of a girl do you 
          		think Nikki is?
          
          Cary glances in Nikki's direction and tells Bill confidentially:
          
          				CARY
          		I think she's the kind that sits 
          		down on phonograph records.
          
          Bill thinks about this and nods.
          
          INSIDE THE RESTAURANT
          As Nikki returns from her Chinese singing lesson, Frink puts his arm against a 
          wall, blocking her way.
          
          				FRINK
          		Say, Nikki, let's ditch these 
          		drunks and go off somewhere by 
          		ourselves. These crazy fools are 
          		liable to do anything.
          
          				NIKKI
          			(hopeful)
          		Do you think so?
          
          				FRINK
          		Since the war, they don't care what 
          		happens.
          
          				NIKKI
          		And do you?
          
          				FRINK
          		I'll say so. I've got more 
          		important things to think of.
          
          				NIKKI
          		What more important things?
          
          				FRINK
          		Well, my work.
          
          				NIKKI
          		What kind of work?
          
          				FRINK
          		I'm the foreign correspondent for a 
          		New York newspaper syndicate.
          
          				NIKKI
          			(genuinely)
          		How nice for you!
          
          Nikki pushes his arm away and heads for the table. Frink watches her go, a 
          dark look on his face.
          
          BACK AT THE SIDEWALK TABLE
          The men rise briefly as Nikki rejoins them and sits.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Nikki? Are you the kind of girl that 
          		sits down on phonograph records?
          
          Nikki lowers her eyes.
          
          				NIKKI
          			(a bit defensively)
          		People shouldn't leave their records 
          		lying about.
          
          				CARY
          			(to Francis)
          		What did I tell you?
          
          				NIKKI
          			(abruptly brightens)
          		Take me dancing?
          
          				BILL
          		What place you wanna go?
          
          				NIKKI
          		What places you got?
          
          				CARY
          		Well, we got Maxim's, only it's too 
          		early. We've got Florida, Perroquet, 
          		Pigalle, Le Rat Mort, Moulin Rouge, 
          		Bal Tabarin.
          
          				NIKKI
          		I'll take vanilla.
          
          Cary gives her a look. Bill clears his throat.
          
          				BILL
          		Somebody pay for the drinks!
          
          Bill rises and claps his hands with enthusiasm.
          
          				BILL
          		We're off in a "billizzard" of 
          		horse-radish!
          
          Whatever that means. The men rise and retrieve their hats.
          
          					DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. BAL TABARIN BALL ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
          A festive Parisian night spot. Dance MUSIC plays while a floor show, lit by 
          moving spotlights, unfurls in the huge, darkened ballroom which is ringed with 
          crowded tables. A handsome male dancer, in tuxedo and top hat, whirls 
          exuberantly around the floor, surrounded by beautiful chorus girls. 
          
          Somewhere above all this, Nikki, lit by spotlight flashes, sits on the edge of 
          a ringside balcony observing the show with eager interest through her 
          lorgnette.
          
          The show continues: after a few twirls, the dancer links arms with the girls 
          to form a line and do some precision high-kicking. The music continues but the 
          dance apparently ends and the lights come up. Impressed, Nikki is breathless.  
          
          				NIKKI
          		My, my! Isn't this nice?!
          
          Nearby, the men sit at a roped-off table for six on a low balcony. Cary and 
          Francis sit glumly on one side of the table as Bill tries to tell a story to 
          the others (Frink; a nameless young woman nicknamed "Kiss-Me-Quick" who 
          appears in this scene only; Shep and Nikki). 
          
          				BILL
          		Now, listen, men. I'll tell ya 
          		something funny. 
          
          Cary and Francis look doubtful about this. Bill sits at the table. 
          
          				BILL
          		I was only four years old once.
          
          				FRANCIS
          			(to Cary)
          		What'd he say?
          
          				CARY
          		Said he was only four years old 
          		once.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Amazing.
          
          				BILL
          		And my aunt had a very low-neck 
          		dress on.
          
          				FRANCIS
          			(to Cary)
          		What'd he say?
          
          				CARY
          		Said his aunt had on a very low-neck 
          		dress.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Can't believe it.
          
          				BILL
          		And she sat right across the table 
          		in front of me. And I said, "Auntie 
          		-- I can see your knees!"
          
          Nobody laughs or even changes expression. 
          
          				CARY
          			(pointedly, after 
          			an awkward pause)
          		I wonder what's doing in Portugal 
          		tonight.
          
          Bill is disappointed at the response.
          
          				BILL
          		Maybe I'd better do my match trick.
          
          				NIKKI
          		If you do match tricks, I'll recite.
          
          				CARY
          		Recite what?
          
          				NIKKI
          		Poetry.
          
          				CARY
          		Whose poetry?
          
          				NIKKI
          		My poetry.
          
          				CARY
          		You write poetry?
          
          				NIKKI
          		I'll send you a photograph of my 
          		poetry.
          
          Cary gives her a look, then rises and peers with one eye into the open bottle 
          of champagne on the table between him and Nikki. He gestures at the bottle as 
          he sits back down.
          
          				CARY
          		Say, I wonder if there's anything 
          		intoxicating in that.
          
          Everybody cracks up -- except Nikki, who looks a little hurt. 
          
          An empty champagne bottle is placed on the floor.

          By now, a dozen empty champagne bottles have been placed on the floor.
          
          CLOSE SHOT - FRINK'S HAND
          strays to Nikki's legs and up her dress.
          
          WIDER
          Nikki rises indignantly and turns on Frink. 
          
          				NIKKI
          		Just what ARE your plans?
          
          WIDER STILL
          The other men seated at the table understand instantly what's going on and 
          stare darkly at Frink.
          
          				SHEP
          		You'll have to watch that lad, Nikki. 
          		He's a member of the Wandering Hands

          		time. 
          
          Frink nervously adjusts his necktie. Cary glares at him.
          
          				CARY
          		Your behavior, sir, is unseemly, 
          		unethical, indelicate and lousy.

          Frink, pretending chagrin, looks at Nikki.
          
          				FRINK
          		All right. My mistake. I'm sorry.

          		man.
          
          				NIKKI
          		It's getting pretty late, isn't it?
          
          				CARY
          		Do you want to go home, Nikki? 
          			(rises)
          		I'll take you home. Where do you 
          		live?
          
          				NIKKI
          		Hotel Carlton.
          
          The others, except for Frink, begin to rise, too. Shep pays the waiter.
          
          				BILL
          		I'll take her home, too.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		So will I!
          
          				SHEP
          		We'll match to see who takes her 
          		home!
          
          				BILL
          		Nothin' doing! We'll ALL take her 
          		home.
          
          				CARY
          		I saw her first.
          
          				BILL
          		It makes no difference. She belongs 
          		to us all now!
          
          Nikki laughs as they all depart. Frink rises wearily to follow them out.
          
          					DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. HOTEL CARLTON - LOBBY - LATER THAT NIGHT
          The group enters the spacious, empty lobby, laughing loudly. Someone says, 
          "Wheeee!" Others say, "Ssshhh!" They cross to the front desk.
          
          AT THE FRONT DESK
          The clerk is fast asleep, his head down on the desk. Nikki is about to wake 
          him when Bill bounds forward.
          
          				BILL
          			(quietly, to Nikki)
          		Sh! Let him sleep. What's your 
          		number?
          
          				NIKKI
          			(whispers)
          		Eighty-eight.
          
          Bill waves the others on and they exit toward the elevators. 
          
          Once they've gone, Bill, the athlete, vaults the front desk and lands -- with 
          a little noise -- on the other side, without waking the clerk. 
          
          He cautiously checks the clerk to make sure the sleeping man hasn't awakened, 
          then fetches Nikki's key from its cubbyhole. 
          
          Bill leaps up on top of the desk, landing on his rear end, swinging his legs 
          around -- nearly kicking the clerk in the process -- then silently slides off 
          the desk to the floor. 
          
          Watching the sleeping clerk warily, Bill tiptoes away. 
          
          At the last possible moment, Bill purposefully WHACKS the signal bell with his 
          hand, making it RING noisily. The clerk awakens with a start and grabs a 
          nearby telephone just as Bill disappears from view.
          
          IN THE HOTEL ELEVATOR
          Amused, the group piles into the "ascenseur". Last one in is Bill who shuts 
          the door and the metal safety gate behind him.
          
          				BILL
          		Here we are. Goin' up! 
          
          				CARY
          		Who's gonna pilot this craft?
          
          				BILL
          		I'll take her off. Where's the 
          		throttle?
          
          Bill looks for the controls as Cary turns playfully to the others.
          
          				CARY
          		Got your safety belts buckled?
          
          				SHEP & OTHERS
          		Mm hmm.
          
          Bill finds the appropriate lever and grabs hold.
          
          				BILL
          		Here it is. Contact?
          
          				SHEP
          		Contact!
          
          Bill pulls the lever and the car rockets up the shaft.
          
          				BILL
          		We're off!
          
          Most everybody cheers. They watch with great interest as the floors pass by 
          rapidly.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Shut her off!
          
          				CARY
          		Hold her nose! She's headed for the 
          		hangar!
          
          				SHEP
          			(nervous)
          		Hey, stop it, will ya?
          
          				NIKKI
          		We've gone an' passed my floor.
          
          				BILL
          		Gone an' passed your floor? I'll fix 
          		that.
          
          Bill brakes the car and starts it back down the shaft.
          
          				SHEP
          		Put her tail down!
          
          				CARY
          		Bail out, boys! She's gonna crash!
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Wheeeee!
          
          				FRINK
          			(nervous)
          		Stop it! Stop it!
          
          				NIKKI
          		We've gone an' passed my floor 
          		again.
          
          				BILL
          		Say! How do you stop this thing?
          
          Bill brakes the car too quickly -- it slams to a halt and everyone loses their 
          footing, nearly falling down. Part of the light fixture above them breaks 
          loose and crashes down on Frink's head, much to everyone's amusement -- they 
          laugh as Frink clutches his head, annoyed.
          
          				FRINK
          		That's right, laugh.
          
          				CARY
          		We should've brought our parachutes!
          
          				BILL
          		Get a good hold, Millie. We're off 
          		again.
          
          Bill reaches for the controls but Shep grabs the tail of Bill's jacket and 
          pulls him away.
          
          				SHEP
          		Nothing doing! Let Cary take the 
          		controls. You'll run us through the 
          		roof.
          
          Bill brushes his hands, his pride a little hurt.
          
          				BILL
          		All right, all right.
          
          				CARY
          		All set? 
          
          				SHEP
          		Let her go!
          
          The car starts up the shaft again.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Hurray!
          
          				SHEP & FRANCIS
          		Hurray!
          
          				CARY
          		There we are.
          
          					DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - FIFTH FLOOR - MINUTES LATER - LONG TRAVELING SHOT
          The elevator door opens. Cary leads the way as everyone else spills out 
          happily into the hall. Shep puts a congratulatory arm around Cary.
          
          				SHEP
          		Say! That's a pilot for ya.
          
          				BILL
          		You deserve a medal.
          
          Bill pins Nikki's room key to Cary's vest pocket. Smiling, Cary holds it up 
          proudly to Nikki.
          
          				BILL
          		All right, come on, men.
          
          They head down the hallway in a drunken, disorganized fashion. Shep walks an 
          imaginary tightrope, wobbling spectacularly. Cary, bringing up the rear, shuts 
          the elevator door and escorts Nikki.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		I need a rest, I need a rest.
          
          Francis drops into a handy chair and lights a cigarette but Bill immediately 
          hauls him up:
          
          				BILL
          		Come on, come on.
          
          Bill, whistling and pretending to ice skate, leads the group down the hall. 
          Francis tries to enter a room but Frink pulls him out of the doorway. Bill 
          backtracks to help Frink escort Francis. This allows Cary and Nikki to take 
          the lead. Nikki indicates the correct doorway to Cary.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Right here.
          
          				CARY
          		Oh! Eighty-eight! Here we are!
          
          The group cheers. Cary unlocks the door. The group enters Nikki's hotel room.
          
          INT. NIKKI'S HOTEL SUITE - SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          Laughing, the group files into the darkened room and spreads out.
          
          				SHEP
          		Wheeeee!
          
          Nikki switches on the lights. Bill marvels at the luxurious suite.
          
          				BILL
          		Well, for--! Well, I'll be a--!
          		Look! Nikki's got a whole apartment! 
          
          				SHEP
          		And a gramophone!
          
          Delighted, Shep starts to crank up the gramophone.
          
          				CARY
          			(unimpressed)
          		Yeah! And chairs and tables and 
          		floors and ceilings and everything.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		So THIS is where Nikki lives!
          
          Amused and pleased by their reaction, Nikki heads for her bedroom.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Yes, this is where Nikki lives.
          
          Shep picks up a book and admires it grandly.
          
          				SHEP
          		And she's got a book!
          
          The gramophone comes to life and MUSIC plays from a record. Nikki passes into 
          the bedroom and switches on a light.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Got all the comforts of home.
          
          Frink tries to follow Nikki into the bedroom but Bill pointedly intercepts 
          him. Disappointed, Frink looks past him into Nikki's bedroom and Bill follows 
          his gaze to see:
          
          PERFUME BOTTLES
          on Nikki's glass-topped dressing table -- dozens of them. 
          
          				BILL
          		Hey! Look at all the bottles! 
          
          Bill enters and inspects the table closely.
          
          NIKKI'S BEDROOM
          as the other four men respond to Bill's enthusiastic summons and enter.
          
          				BILL
          		Hey! Come on in and look at Nikki's 
          		bottles! 
          
          Cary joins Bill at the table as the Texan picks up one of the bottles and 
          reads the label.
          
          				BILL
          		Ylang! Ylang!
          
          				CARY
          		Hey, don't be handlin' her things. 
          		Put 'em down.
          
          But Bill goes right on, delighted. The others crowd around the table.
          
          				BILL
          		Chichi!
          
          				CARY
          		Leave 'em alone.
          
          				BILL
          		Salammbo! Chypre! Reve de Vestale! 
          		Jinko!
          
          				SHEP
          		Hey, you big bombardier--
          
          				BILL
          		Chiki chiki!
          
          During this, Francis has casually inspected a curtained walk-in closet near 
          the table. He pulls the curtain to reveal a rack of carefully hung dresses and 
          a floor covered with dozens of shoes organized in impeccably straight lines.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Say, I never saw so many shoes.
          
          The others gather to peer into the closet. Frink loses interest immediately 
          but whistles at the sight of Nikki's sheer nightgown draped across her bed. He 
          moves to it eagerly. 
          
          Nikki sits on the edge of the bed removing her shoes as Frink picks up her 
          silk bedclothes and examines them with a grin. Bill pointedly takes the gown 
          out of Frink's hand. Tight-lipped, Frink stares at him. Suddenly, Bill points 
          to a small wind-up clock on Nikki's night table. 
          
          				BILL
          		Look! 
          
          Bill drops the garment on the bed and moves to the night table.
          
          				BILL
          		She never winds her clock! 
          			(picks up the clock)
          		It says eleven and I've never been 
          		anywheres at eleven.
          
          Nikki removes her earrings as Frink walks off and Cary takes a seat at the 
          foot of the bed.
          
          				CARY
          			(dry, to Bill)
          		What time are you anywhere?
          
          Bill shakes the clock and puts it to his ear, listening.
          
          				BILL
          			(to Cary, ignoring Nikki)
          		Two o'clock. It's always two o'clock 
          		in my life. Hey, listen. Besides 
          		never having any matches and always 
          		spilling her drinks, she never winds 
          		her clock! Think I'll go in the 
          		bathroom and see if she leaves the 
          		cap off her tooth paste.
          
          Bill heads for the bathroom but then stops and turns back to Nikki.
          
          				BILL
          		Is it all right?
          
          				NIKKI
          		Help yourself.
          
          Bill disappears into the bathroom, leaving Nikki and Cary sitting on the bed. 
          Nikki peers at Cary through her lorgnette.
          
          				NIKKI
          			(friendly, sympathetic)
          		Hello.
          
          				CARY
          			(grins)
          		Hello, yourself.
          
          The phonograph MUSIC ends just as Bill's voice calls from the bathroom.
          
          				BILL (o.s.)
          			(excited)
          		TURTLES!
          
          Cary turns toward the bathroom.
          
          				CARY
          		Turtles?
          
          				SHEP (o.s.)
          		Turtles?
          
          Shep runs past and hurries into the bathroom. Cary rises from the bed to 
          follow. Nikki is perhaps mildly surprised by the excitement.
          
          HIGH ANGLE SHOT - TWO TURTLES
          swimming in shallow water at the bottom of a bathtub. A couple of decorative 
          lily pads lie next to the drain. The turtles' shells are inlayed with 
          brilliants.
          
          BATHROOM
          Bill kneels by the tub as Frink, Shep, Francis and Cary join him. Bill points 
          out his discovery to the others.
          
          				BILL
          		Turtles!
          
          				OTHERS 
          		Turtles?! 
          
          				SHEP 
          			(thrilled)
          		It IS turtles!
          
          Francis picks up a turtle and shows it to Cary.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Hey! Look, Cary! It's turtles!
          
          Cary examines the turtle for a moment, placing a finger on it.
          
          				CARY
          			(with a nod)
          		Nice work, boys. It's turtles.
          
          Cary and Francis inspect the turtle.
          
          BATHROOM DOORWAY
          Nikki enters and addresses the men.
          
          				NIKKI
          		And now do you suppose you could 
          		all excuse me? 
          
          Cary joins her.
          
          				NIKKI
          		On account of I'd like to go to bed.
          
          				CARY
          		Sure we'll excuse you. I'll clear 
          		everybody out of here. 
          			(to the others)
          		Come on, you fellas. Nikki wants to 
          		go to bed.
          
          AT THE BATHTUB
          The other men, still lined up at the tub enjoying the turtles, are 
          disappointed.
          
          				BILL
          		Go to bed?
          
          				SHEP
          		Awww! Bed?
          
          They rise reluctantly. Bill shakes water off his hand.
          
          				BILL
          		Yup, all right. 
          
          They file out of the bathroom.
          
          				SHEP
          			(waves to the turtles)
          		So long, turtles. 
          
          				BILL
          		Good night, turtles.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Night, turtles.
          
          Frink follows the others humorlessly, without a word to the turtles.
          
          TRACKING SHOT - THROUGH THE SUITE
          The entire group exits the bathroom, passes through the bedroom and heads into 
          the sitting room.
          
          				BILL
          		Poor Nikki. Do you wanna go to 
          		sleep?
          
          				NIKKI
          			(nods)
          		Mm hm.
          
          				SHEP
          		Sleep? You should NEVER go to sleep!
          
          				BILL
          			(with a wave, to Nikki)
          		Well, good night.
          
          As Bill enters the sitting room, he looks around and hurries away toward 
          something he sees off screen. Shep and Francis follow.
          
          				SHEP
          			(with a wave)
          		Nighty-night, Nikki.
          
          Francis says nothing.
          
          				FRINK
          		Good night, Nikki.
          
          Frink is the last out the bedroom door, though Cary stays behind to linger a 
          moment with Nikki.
          
          SITTING ROOM
          Bill takes a pillow from the sofa and tosses it across the room. He proceeds 
          to leap feet first onto the sofa, fall on his back with his feet in the air, 
          then stretch his legs out across the sofa, lying down to go to sleep. 
          
          				BILL
          			(satisfied)
          		Ah!
          
          Shep, watching this, scratches his head, confused, then moves to join him. 
          Frink watches Francis drag some sort of heavy fringed rug to the floor near 
          the sofa, apparently preparing to lie down on it.
          
          AT THE BEDROOM DOOR
          Nikki and Cary stand close, exchanging warm goodnights. 
          
          				NIKKI
          			(dead serious)
          		Good night, Cary.
          
          				CARY
          			(playful)
          		Good night, Nikki.
          
          Cary, perhaps pleased with Nikki's attention to him, watches her withdraw into 
          the bedroom and shut the door. He turns from the door to see:
          
          LOW ANGLE SHOT - SITTING ROOM
          Four men, happily situated, settling in for a night's sleep: Bill and Shep on 
          the sofa, Frink on a chair, their three pairs of feet propped up on a table. 
          Francis, his head on a pillow, lies on the floor, stretching his legs and 
          yawning as only a narcoleptic can.
          
          				BILL
          		Say! I like this place.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Say, I like this place, too.
          
          				SHEP
          		I think it's swell.
          
          CARY
          peers at them skeptically, hands on his hips.
          
          				FRINK (o.s.)
          		It suits me.
          
          				CARY
          		You fellas think you're gonna PARK 
          		here?
          
          				BILL (o.s.)
          		Sure!
          
          				FRANCIS (o.s.)
          		Sure.
          
          Cary hears the bedroom door open behind him and turns to see:
          
          NIKKI
          opening the door, wearing a robe, carrying a bottle of eau de Cologne and some 
          towels.
          
          				NIKKI
          			(innocently)
          		Will somebody please scrub my back?
          
          LOW ANGLE SHOT - SITTING ROOM
          Excited again, Bill jumps to his feet, upsetting the others in the process.
          
          				BILL
          		Will somebody scrub your back?! Look 
          		out, boys!
          
          The men struggle to their feet and follow him to:
          
          NIKKI   
          holds the bottle in her hand. The men's hands reach for it but Bill is quicker 
          than the others and commandeers it with authority.
          
          				BILL
          		I got it, I got it, I got it.
          
          From over Nikki's nearly bare back, we watch Bill whistling jauntily as he 
          shakes eau de Cologne onto a towel.
          
          CARY
          now seated, watches this coolly as he takes out a cigarette and lights it.
          
          BILL AND NIKKI
          Bill examines Nikki's back with delight.
          
          				BILL
          			(impressed)
          		Mmmmmm mm!
          
          His eyes pop. For Nikki, though, this is an asexual activity.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Scrub hard.
          
          Bill places her head on his left shoulder and prepares to scrub with his 
          right.
          
          				BILL
          		Did anyone ever see such a back in 
          		their life? 
          
          He scrubs a little.
          
          				BILL
          		Did anyone ever HEAR of such a 
          		thing? 
          
          More scrubbing -- his tongue sticks out of his mouth as he studies his work.
          
          SHEP, FRINK AND FRANCIS
          watch all this with envy and interest.
          
          				BILL (o.s.)
          		Just look at that back. Just look at 
          		that thing, won't you?
          
          BILL AND NIKKI
          Bill keeps scrubbing, adopting the air of a professional back scrubber.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Harder.
          
          He lifts her hair to inspect her neck.
          
          				BILL
          		My, my! 
          
          He scrubs her neck.
          
          				BILL
          		I could go on doin' this a long time.
          
          More scrubbing and then an amusing pantomime: To Nikki's bewilderment, Bill 
          pulls back the hair over her ear, looks down into her ear, cleans it out with 
          his little finger, flicks wax off his finger daintily, buffs the ear with the 
          towel, and finally blows sharply into the ear, causing her to wince. She 
          places her head on his shoulder again. More scrubbing.
          
          TRACKING SHOT - SITTING ROOM
          We start on Cary, who sits rocking in a tilted chair and smoking, watching 
          Bill and Nikki with amusement. After a pause:
          
          				CARY
          		Nikki? Are you rich?
          
          				NIKKI
          		Well, practically. Beulah is rich.
          
          				CARY
          		Well, just how rich IS your mother?
          
          				NIKKI
          		Leave a lady a few secrets, can't 
          		you?
          
          By now, we've pulled back far enough to take in the whole group. Bill finishes 
          his scrubbing and Nikki adjusts her robe.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Thank you, William. That was EVER so 
          		cool and nice. 
          			(takes bottle and 
          			towels from him)
          		Good night.
          
          				BILL
          		Good night.
          
          				NIKKI
          			(to the others)
          		Good night.
          
          				THE MEN
          		Good night, Nikki.
          
          They watch her move off. We hear the bedroom door close. Bill realizes 
          something, snaps his fingers, claps his hands and starts off.
          
          				BILL
          		Come on, fellas!
          
          He rushes off. Shep, Francis and Frink rise and follow. Cary merely collects 
          his hat and cane and heads for the front door.
          
          SITTING ROOM - ANOTHER VIEW
          Bill and Shep carry the sofa over and place it directly in front of Nikki's 
          closed bedroom door. Francis brings his rug and pillow. 
          
          CARY
          watches them, amused, from the front door.
          
          				CARY
          		You're gonna stay here, huh?
          
          SITTING ROOM - ANOTHER VIEW
          The men settle in for the night.
          
          				BILL
          			(to Cary)
          		That's right! She might need some 
          		more help!
          
          Bill waves good night and collapses on the sofa. Frink, glancing at Cary, 
          brings his chair and sits in it. Francis lies on the floor. Shep fluffs 
          pillows on the sofa, etc.
          
          CARY
          turns, shuts off the lights, opens the front door and exits the darkened room, 
          closing the door behind him.

          INT. CARLTON BAR - NEXT MORNING
          The drinking hole in Nikki's hotel. A French woman noisily arranges dirty 
          drinking glasses as Bill, Francis and Shep enter -- horribly hungover, moaning 
          and yawning -- and line up at the bar. A bartender greets them to take their 
          order.
          
          				BARTENDER
          		Messieurs.
          
          				SHEP
          		Morning.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Morning.
          
          				BILL
          		Um, prairie oyster.
          
          				SHEP
          		Prairie oyster.
          
          Shep has to nudge Francis with an elbow.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Prairie oyster.
          
          				BARTENDER
          		Prairie oyster for three.
          
          Bartender moves off. Shep puts on his dark eyeglasses.
          
          CARLTON BAR - ANOTHER VIEW
          We start on a CLOSE SHOT of three drinking glasses as the bartender breaks a 
          raw egg into one. Beside them are the other ingredients of a potent hangover 
          remedy. We PAN OVER to the three men:
          
          				SHEP
          		Say, we'd better get back to our 
          		hotel.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		There's no Nikki at our hotel.
          
          				BILL
          		That's right.
          
          				SHEP
          		And the bar doesn't open so early.
          
          				BILL
          		Say! Why don't we move in here?
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Sure. Let's stay here.
          
          				BILL
          		But - what about Cary?
          
          				FRANCIS
          			(to Shep)
          		What about Cary?
          
          				SHEP
          			(to Francis)
          		What ABOUT Cary?
          
          Francis shakes his head, he has no idea.
          
          				BILL
          		We can move him in, too.
          
          Francis nods in agreement. Shep thinks it over as the drinks arrive.
          
          				SHEP
          		Not a bad idea!
          
          Shep pays off the bartender who departs with a mumbled "thank you." The three 
          men each down their nasty hangover cures in a single swallow and move off one 
          at a time -- first Shep who exhales deeply, then Francis who takes it in 
          stride. Finally, Bill exhales happily and claps his hands as he follows the 
          others out, their hangovers apparently remedied.
          
          				BILL
          			(cheerfully)
          		Well, come on, men. Let's go.

          FADE IN
          
          INT. NIKKI'S SUITE - LATER THAT DAY
          Phonograph music plays as an Asian maid, the hotel's specialist in Chinois 
          Pedicure, paints Nikki's toenails. We PAN UP to discover Nikki wearing a robe, 
          sitting in a chair next to the phonograph, smoking a cigarette and checking on 
          the progress of her paint job. A snappy knock at the door.
          
          				NIKKI
          			(wearily)
          		Entrez!
          
          THE FRONT DOOR
          opens and Bill, looking dapper, enters.
          
          				BILL
          		Hi, Nik!
          
          Then, Shep enters, wearing his dark eyeglasses and carrying a bouquet of 
          flowers.
          
          				SHEP
          		Hello, Nikki!
          
          Next, Francis enters, sleepily.
          
          				FRANCIS
          			(in mid-yawn) 
          		Hello.
          
          Finally, Cary, who closes the door behind him.
          
          				CARY
          		Good morning, Nikki.
          
          The men are all: wearing suits and ties, pleased to see her, and stone sober. 
          Francis finds his way to the sofa, which has been returned to its proper spot 
          in the room. He lies down and shuts his eyes.
          
          				NIKKI (o.s.)
          		Hello, Bill. Hello, Shep. Hello, 
          		Cary. Hello, Francis.
          
          				FRANCIS
          			(from the sofa)
          		Morning, Nikki.
          
          				NIKKI 
          		I didn't expect to see you all so 
          		early.
          
          Shep puts the flowers in a vase.
          
          				BILL
          		We camped on your doorsteps last 
          		night. And this morning we all moved 
          		in.
          
          Cary leans over her affectionately.
          
          				CARY
          		Despite your practically innumerable 
          		faults, we adore you. We've decided 
          		to adopt you.
          
          Bill and Shep kneel next to Nikki. Bill notices the toenail painting.
          
          				BILL
          		Well, for heaven's sakes! Look at 
          		Nikki! What are you having done to 
          		yourself, gal?
          
          				SHEP
          		Whatcha having your toes painted 
          		for, Nikki?
          
          Cary stands behind Nikki as she looks down at her toes.
          
          				NIKKI
          		I don't know. 
          			(looks at Bill and Shep)
          		Seemed like a good idea at the time.
          
          Cary smiles. Nikki, Bill and Shep share a laugh. The Asian woman goes right on 
          painting as Bill and Shep study Nikki's legs. During this, Nikki hands her 
          cigarette to Cary who moves to put it in an ashtray by the window.
          
          				BILL
          		Why, look at Nikki's legs, would 
          		you? That there is practically the 
          		loveliest pair of legs I ever saw in 
          		all my born days.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Like my legs?
          
          Cary stares out the window at a rainy day. 
          
          				SHEP
          		Look at those legs, Cary. My, they 
          		nearly match. 
          
          Cary turns from the window. 
          
          				SHEP
          		Did you ever see such a swell set of 
          		legs?
          
          				CARY
          		Well, what do you want me to do 
          		about it? Burst into tears?
          
          				SHEP
          		Would it embarrass you, Nikki, if 
          		Cary were to burst into tears?
          
          				NIKKI
          			(looks at her legs)
          		On account of my legs? Oh!
          			(turns to Cary,
          			heartfelt)
          		I think that would be sweet.
          
          Cary manages a slight grin. As he does, there's a knock at the door. Everyone 
          hollers, "Entrez!" Shep runs to the door and opens it.
          
          				SHEP
          		Oh, boy! Here come the drinks!
          
          The others cheer happily. Two hotel employees enter carrying trays loaded with 
          already poured drinks. Shep hands a glass to Nikki.
          
          				SHEP
          		Here, Nikki, drink this. 
          
          				CARY
          		Make you laugh and play.
          
          				NIKKI
          		That's what I want to do, laugh and 
          		play.
          
          Shep hands Bill a glass.
          
          Francis sits groggily on the sofa, a drink in each hand. He polishes off one 
          and then the other. He leans over and sets one empty glass on the floor but 
          holds on to the other as he puts his head to the nearby pillow and dozes off.
          
          Cary, Bill and Shep crowd around Nikki who is still seated -- all have drinks. 
          The tray-carrying hotel employees have apparently exited. Bill proposes a 
          toast.
          
          				BILL
          		Here's to Nikki's dainty legs. As 
          		smooth and hairless as an egg.
          
          				SHEP
          		Wheee!
          
          				CARY
          		Hurray!
          
          				NIKKI
          		'Ray!
          
          They drink. Another knock at the door. They all yell, "Entrez!" The door opens 
          to reveal Frink -- whose face falls when he sees the other men with Nikki. The 
          others are not happy to see him, either.
          
          				CARY
          		Well! Here comes that licentious 
          		old man. Who invited him?
          
          Cary hands his glass to Bill and moves to meet Frink as he enters.
          
          				FRINK
          			(sneering)
          		Still drinking?
          
          				CARY
          			(shakes his head 
          			mockingly)
          		How can you tell?
          
          Cary watches Frink approach Nikki.
          
          				FRINK
          		Morning, Nikki.
          
          After a pause, Nikki looks up at him uncertainly as if she doesn't recognize 
          him. Then she peers at him through her lorgnette.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Oh, it's you. 
          			(after a pause,
          			reluctantly polite)
          		Won't you sit down?
          
          				FRINK
          		Thank you.
          
          Frink moves off to find a chair. Shep sets down his drink and follows him. 
          Frink starts to move a chair but Shep stops him.
          
          				SHEP
          		Say, I don't think Nikki likes you.
          
          				FRINK
          		Oh, no?
          
          				SHEP
          		No. What do you wanna hang around 
          		for?
          
          				FRINK
          		Well, what do YOU hang around for?
          
          				SHEP
          		Me? Why, I came to bring Nikki some 
          		posies. I'll bet you didn't bring 
          		Nikki any posies.
          
          				FRINK
          		I-- Well--
          
          During the above dialogue, Bill nudges Cary mischievously and they glance down 
          at the tray in front of them. They exchange knowing nods, pick up some drinks, 
          bring them over, and offer one to Frink.
          
          				BILL
          		Have a drink?
          
          				FRINK
          		No, thanks.
          
          				SHEP
          		Cure the shakes.
          
          				FRINK
          		I haven't got the shakes.
          
          				CARY
          		Let's see. Hold out your hands.
          
          Bill and Shep watch with interest as Frink holds out his hands, palms up.
          
          				CARY
          		No, turn them over.
          
          Frink turns them over, palms down. Cary looks at Frink's steady hands, 
          impressed.
          
          				CARY
          		Say, that's pretty good. 
          
          Cary looks down at the drink in his own hand.
          
          				CARY
          		Let's see if you can hold this.
          
          Cary sets the glass on top of Frink's downturned hand. Frink balances the full 
          glass with ease.
          
          				CARY
          		Say, that's great.
          
          Cary places a second full glass on Frink's other hand. Frink balances both 
          glasses with ease. Cary expresses keen admiration.
          
          				CARY
          		Steady as a rock!
          
          Frink looks at the others, a little smugly. Cary slowly backs away and walks 
          off, as do the others. Frink's face falls as he realizes he has been left 
          standing in the middle of the room with two drinks balanced on top of his 
          hands and no way to safely remove them.
          
          Cary, Shep and Bill return to Nikki and crowd around her.
          
          				CARY
          		Well, I guess that'll keep his hands 
          		out of mischief for a while.
          
          Frink, abandoned, reluctantly pleads with the others.
          
          				FRINK
          		Hey. Take these off.
          
          But the others simply ignore him.
          
          				CARY
          		Now, let's see. Where were we before 
          		we were so rudely interrupted?
          
          				BILL
          		We were talkin' about Nikki's legs.
          
          				CARY
          		That's right. We were talkin' about 
          		Nikki's legs. And havin' a fine time, 
          		too.
          
          The Asian maid who has been working on Nikki's feet abruptly rises.
          
          				WOMAN
          		Finis.
          
          The men cheer, "Yay!" and Nikki smiles at the woman as she exits with her 
          tools. The men crowd closer to peer down at Nikki's legs.
          
          				SHEP
          		Let's inspect the job.
          
          But Nikki quickly covers her toes with a hand.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Oh, my poor toes. Don't look too 
          		close.
          
          Nikki wraps her robe around her legs and stuffs them under body. Since she's 
          no longer using her footstool, Cary commandeers it and sits on it.
          
          				CARY
          		Well, what's the matter with your 
          		toes?
          
          Nikki grows extremely somber and begins to tell a story -- very slowly. Her 
          eyes stare into space and her voice conveys terrible sadness.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Well... when I was a little girl...
          
          A worried look crosses Cary's face.
          
          				NIKKI
          		... my mother bought me a new pair 
          		of shoes. ... And they were WAY too 
          		short. ...
          
          Shep and Bill listen soberly.
          
          				NIKKI
          		... And I had to walk all the way to 
          		Sunday school and back. ... Down the
           		road. ... And it was hot and dusty.
          
          				BILL
          			(hand to his face)
          		Oh, take her away! She's breakin' 
          		my heart!
          			(sobs)
          
          				NIKKI
          		And when I got home ...  my toes 
          		were spoiled.
          
          				CARY
          			(on the verge of tears)
          		Oh, dear, oh, dear. 
          
          				SHEP
          		That's such a sad story. Let's all 
          		have a drink, quick!
          
          Their eyes pop. The men jump up eagerly and run off. Nikki, thoroughly 
          nonplussed by this, takes a sip of her drink. Shep, Cary and Bill crowd around 
          a tray and start imbibing. 
          
          Meanwhile, Frink looks around unsuccessfully for a way to lose the two glasses 
          that are still balanced on his hands.
          
          For the first time in this scene, Nikki is on her feet. She walks over to the 
          drink tray and puts a friendly hand on the shoulders of Shep and Cary.
          
          				NIKKI
          		And now would you all excuse me? 
          		On account of I'm gonna put on a 
          		dress.
          
          				CARY
          		Well, why not?
          
          Nikki walks off, exiting into her bedroom. The men continue to stand around 
          the tray, drinking. In the background, Francis sleeps on the sofa.
          
          Over by the fireplace, a frustrated Frink, still balancing the two drinks, 
          casts a dirty look at the others. He angrily hurls the glasses into the 
          fireplace, smashing them loudly. Francis, startled awake by the noise, jumps 
          off the sofa. The others stare at him. 
          
          				SHEP
          		My, my. What's HE getting so excited 
          		about?
          
          Frink, furious, rubs his hands with a handkerchief and stuffs it in his 
          pocket. 
          
          				FRINK
          		You guys think you're so darn smart.
          
          Shep, Bill and Cary laugh at this. Cary consults his pocket watch.
          
          				CARY
          		Well, cheerio, fellas. I'm off. 
          
          Bill waves goodbye. Cary eats a last olive, tosses the toothpick and heads for 
          the front door.
          			
          				CARY
          		See ya later.
          
          Cary exits as Nikki's voice drifts in from:
          
          THE OPEN BEDROOM DOORWAY
          
          				NIKKI (o.s.)
          		What are the plans for the day?
          
          Shep, drink in hand, enters and leans on the wall outside the door.
          
          				SHEP
          		Well, on account of it's raining and 
          		everything, we thought we'd go over 
          		to the Cluny and play billiards and 
          		drink beer.
          
          				NIKKI (o.s.)
          		How about Cary?
          
          				SHEP
          		Went to get his hat and coat. He's 
          		going to Père Lachaise.
          
          				NIKKI (o.s.)
          		Père Lachaise? What's Père Lachaise?
          
          				SHEP
          		A cemetery. How 'bout you coming 
          		with us?
          
          				NIKKI (o.s.)
          		No. I'm going with Cary.
          
          				SHEP
          			(concerned)
          		You've been invited?
          
          Nikki appears in the doorway, dressed to go out.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Do you think Cary might object?
          
          				SHEP
          		Well, I have an idea he'd like to be 
          		alone.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Why alone?
          
          				SHEP
          		Well, Cary likes to be alone. He's 
          		as brittle as a breadstick. One 
          		silly crack from you and he might 
          		break up in sections.
          
          				NIKKI
          			(thinks about this)
          		Well, then, I don't think he should 
          		be left alone. 
          			(beat) 
          		Tell me, what's Cary doing in Paris?
          
          				SHEP
          		What are we all doing in Paris?
          
          				NIKKI
          		I know. But why doesn't he go home?
          
          				SHEP
          		Well, he's not ready to go home. 
          		What could he do if he went home? 
          		Have people cry over his hands?
          
          				NIKKI
          		Well, it seems - a pity to go on 
          		like this. He's such a sweet soul.
          
          				SHEP
          		One of the best.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Isn't he just sort of wasting 
          		himself?
          
          				SHEP
          		On the contrary. He's trying awfully 
          		hard to get hold of himself. 
          
          Lost in thought, Nikki moves off and a worried Shep follows her to:
          
          THE FRONT DOOR
          Shep stops Nikki from leaving. She's a little downcast as he admonishes her:
          
          				SHEP
          		Now, listen. If you tag along, for 
          		heaven's sake, be careful what you 
          		say. Don't start getting sorry for 
          		him and don't cry over him. 
          			(with a chuckle)
          		And, above all, don't make any 
          		unfortunate remarks, hear?
          
          				NIKKI
          			(earnest)
          		Oh, I won't. Why, who ever heard of 
          		such a thing?
          
          Nikki opens the front door and exits into:
          
          THE HALLWAY
          where Cary -- carrying coat, hat and cane -- emerges from a suite across the 
          hall from Nikki's and heads for the elevator. He stops when he hears Nikki 
          calling to him. She runs to join him.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Cary?! Cary? I'm coming with you. 
          
          Without waiting for a reply, she starts for the elevator, then stops to look 
          down at her shoes.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Oooh! 
          			(to Cary)
          		Ooh, wait for Nikki!
          
          She leaves him and runs back to:
          
          THE FRONT DOOR
          of her suite where Shep still stands. He watches with surprise as Nikki runs 
          in.
          
          				NIKKI
          			(calls back to Cary)
          		Wait for Nikki!
          
          Puzzled, Shep follows Nikki who rushes to:
          
          HER BEDROOM CLOSET
          Nikki draws the curtain to reveal her enormous collection of dresses and 
          shoes. Shep, drink in hand, wanders in slowly and leans against the doorjamb 
          as he watches Nikki pull off one pair of shoes and put on a seemingly 
          identical pair of red ones.
          
          				SHEP
          		What are you changing your shoes 
          		for?
          
          				NIKKI
          		On account of I can walk faster in 
          		red shoes.
          
          Shep watches her hop and scurry off.

          EXT. AVENUE CASIMIR-PERIER - LATER THAT DAY
          Passerbys carry umbrellas on this rainy day. A taxi cab pulls up to a sidewalk 
          café -- LA REGENCE, according to the awning that covers the little iron 
          tables. Cary emerges from the cab and pays off the driver as Nikki hurries 
          under the awning. Cary joins her and, after a word to the driver ("Restez 
          ici."), looks at the rain.
          
          				CARY
          			(to Nikki)
          		Perhaps we'd better stay here a 
          		while till it clears up.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Could we sit down here, do you 
          		suppose?
          
          				CARY
          		I think so. Would you like something 
          		to drink?
          
          They move toward the café. As Cary hangs up his hat, a waiter arrives.
          
          				NIKKI
          		What should I drink now, do you 
          		suppose?
          
          Cary orders the drinks as Nikki moves to sit at a table.
          
          				CARY
          			(to the waiter)
          		Deux picon citrons.
          
          The waiter acknowledges this and heads inside, calling out the order to his 
          bartender. Cary joins Nikki at the table and sits down. She removes her gloves 
          and fixes her face while he takes out a cigarette and lights it under the 
          following:
          
          				NIKKI
          		Picon citrons?
          
          				CARY

          		That's what you always promise. 
          			(suddenly serious) 
          		Cary, why does Shep Lambert go on 
          		drinking so desperately?
          
          				CARY
          		Don't we all?
          
          				NIKKI
          		Not like Shep.
          
          				CARY
          		Well, Shep has that tic under his 
          		eye, you know. Takes a lot of drinks 
          		to keep that quiet.
          
          				NIKKI
          		But isn't there some kind of 
          		treatment or something?
          
          				CARY
          		Shep could never stand a long course 
          		of treatment. Drinking's the only 
          		corrective so far as he's concerned. 
          		He's found out the tic doesn't work 
          		when he's tight. So he stays tight.
          
          The waiter arrives with the drinks. As he spritzes seltzer water into their 
          glasses, Cary leans over to light a cigarette for Nikki. The waiter leaves and 
          they drink.
          
          				NIKKI

          as the couple sits near the tomb. They show each other the stones in their 
          upturned hands. Nikki takes the heart-shaped stone from her palm and places it

          He looks down at the heart-shaped stone held awkwardly in his stiff hand. His

          		Hello.
          
          Shep walks over and confronts her.
          
          				SHEP
          		Cary's in a state. Says he's going 
          		away. Can't stand it any longer and 
          		all that sort of thing. 
          			(sits on the bed)
          		What happened between you two, 
          		anyway?
          
          				NIKKI
          		Cary seemed so sad and everything -- 
          		on account of I'd taken up his whole 
          		afternoon. 
          			(sighs)
          		So little Nikki said, all merry and 
          		bright, "Well, anyway, we'd found a 
          		name for my turtles."
          
          				SHEP
          		A name for the turtles? 
          
          Shep cracks up with laughter and falls backward on the bed, his head dangling 
          over the edge.
           
          				SHEP
          		That's funny! 
          
          Shep keeps laughing, twists around on the bed and sits up again.
          
          				SHEP
          		Name for the turtles! That's so 
          		funny, all right! 
          
          Shep holds a hand to his head and catches his breath as Nikki joins him on the 
          bed.
          
          				SHEP 
          		Why do you always HAVE to be funny 
          		at the wrong time? Didn't I tell you 
          		Cary was brittle? How did he respond 
          		to THAT line?
          
          				NIKKI
          			(morosely) 
          		Pulled down the iron curtain.
          
          Shep cracks up again. Worried, Nikki tugs at his sleeve.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Did he say he was going away?
          
          				SHEP
          			(through his laughter) 
          		Yup. Gotta get away from it all.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Then, you've got to go to him right 
          		now! 
          
          Nikki rises and urgently pulls Shep, helpless with laughter, to his feet.
          
          				NIKKI
          		And explain that I didn't mean 
          		it! Tell him how it was and 
          		everything!
          
          				SHEP
          		Listen--
          
          				NIKKI
          		No, go on. You go right now before 
          		it's too late!
          
          She pushes him toward the door.
          
          				SHEP
          		But Nikki--!
          
          				NIKKI
          		You go right straight to Cary.
          
          They exit.

          INT. CARY'S ROOM - LATER
          Cary removes clothes from a rack as a now serious Shep, drink in hand, stands 
          nearby trying to reason with him.
          
          				SHEP
          		Now, listen, Cary, you don't have to 
          		behave like an old Easter egg. 
          		You're breaking Nikki's heart. She 
          		doesn't know any better.
          
          				CARY
          		She doesn't know any better? Well, 
          		whether she does or not, I'm going 
          		a long ways away from Nikki. Nikki 
          		and her turtles. 
          
          				SHEP
          		Whew! You sure are in an uproar. 
          		What YOU need is a drink!
          
          Cary packs a weathered suitcase.
          
          				CARY
          		I need more than a drink. I need a 
          		lot of geography between me and that 
          		girl.
          
          				SHEP
          		Where do you want to go?
          
          				CARY
          		Anywheres. So long as it's a long 
          		way from Nikki. 
          			(pauses, looks at Shep)
          		You know -- that girl does things to 
          		me. 
          			(back to packing)
          		I've got to get away.
          
          				SHEP
          		Well, I wonder what's happening in 
          		Portugal tonight.
          
          Cary stops packing and gives Shep a look.
          
          				CARY
          		Say ... 
          			(thinks it over)
          		I wonder what IS happening in 
          		Portugal tonight.
          
          Shep stares at Cary, astonished, and moves off. Cary sets his packed suitcase 
          upright.

          INT. NIKKI'S SUITE - LATE THAT NIGHT
          Bill and Shep set a large steamer trunk upright.
          
          				BILL AND SHEP
          		Heave ho!
          
          Bill opens the trunk.
          
          				BILL
          		Ah! There you go.
          
          Nikki appears, carrying a suitcase.
          
          				NIKKI
          		If Cary's going to Portugal, why 
          		can't we go to Portugal, too? Ain't 
          		we got any rights?
          
          				BILL
          		Sure we got rights!
          
          Getting organized for their own impromptu Portuguese expedition, Bill, Francis 
          and Shep fill the trunk with Nikki's things as Frink leans on it, smoking a 
          cigarette and eyeing Nikki coolly.
          
          				SHEP
          		Cary better not think he can screw 
          		up in Portugal and leave old Shep 
          		behind.
          
          				FRINK
          		Say, when's he leaving?
          
          				SHEP
          		Ten-thirty in the morning. Sud 
          		Express.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Don't we have to have passports and 
          		things?
          
          				SHEP
          		Sure we gotta have passports!
          
          Bill joins Nikki.
          
          				BILL
          		What kind passports you like?
          
          				NIKKI
          		What kind passports you got?
          
          				BILL
          		We have ebony, cocoanut, 
          		thornberry passports.
          
          				NIKKI
          			(grandly)
          		I'll take vanilla.
          
          She brushes past him and crosses to a table where she is joined by Frink.
          
          				FRINK
          		Good night, Nikki. I'll see you on 
          		the train.
          
          				NIKKI
          		You're goin', too?
          
          				FRINK
          		Why not? 
          			(with a sly smile)
          		I might, uh, pick up a couple of 
          		features for my paper - in 
          		Portugal.
          
          Frink walks out the door. Nikki sighs a little and then busies herself with 
          carrying items the trunk. Shep arrives with a selection of dresses as the 
          group crowds together. Chaotic overlapping dialogue:
          
          				SHEP
          		Nikki, do you want --?
          
          				NIKKI
          		Did you put all my shoes in?
          
          				BILL
          		You bet. There they are--
          
          				SHEP
          		I don't know how you're going to get 
          		all these dresses in, Nikki.
          
          From the trunk, we
          
          					DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. NIKKI'S SUITE - NEXT MORNING
          A mountain of trunks and other luggage piled on the floor. Nikki sits down 
          near Shep who finishes packing a suitcase on the floor.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Don't we have to go like anything? 
          		The train leaves in twenty minutes.
          
          Francis leans casually on the towering pile of luggage. Bill stands next to 
          him, smoking a cigarette and calling ironically to Nikki:
          
          				BILL
          		Are you SURE you have everything?
          
          				NIKKI
          			(misses the irony)
          		I - I think so.
          
          Francis clicks his tongue as he regards the pile.
          
          				FRANCIS
          			(dryly)
          		Hardly seems enough.
          
          Suddenly, Nikki gasps and rises.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Oh, my turtles! My turtles!
          
          THE TURTLES
          are plucked from the tub and placed in ...
          
          ... A BASKET
          by Nikki's little Asian maid. The fancy beribboned wicker basket has an 
          oversized handle which makes it a rather improbable turtle carrier. Bill 
          secures a wire mesh covering over the basket and carries it out of the 
          bathroom, handing it grandly to Francis. 
          
          				BILL
          		Here you are, Francis! You're the 
          		custodian of the turtles! Now don't 
          		fall down on the job.
          
          Bill walks off. Francis calls after him, worried:
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Hey! I never tended turtles before.
          
          Nikki arrives with a bottle of water and soaks her hand.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Now, all you have to do - 
          
          She gives Francis the bottle and sprinkles the turtles with water from her wet 
          hand. 
          
          				NIKKI
          		- is to sprinkle 'em now and then, like 
          		this.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Oh, yeah. I see.
          
          Some of the water ends up in Francis' eye which he wipes with the basket's 
          ribbon. Nikki walks off and Francis practices soaking his hand and sprinkling 
          the turtles.
          
          IN THE BEDROOM
          Five bellhops march in and, under the direction of Nikki and the men, proceed 
          to carry off the luggage, chattering in French.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Well, we're off. 
          			(to a bellhop, 
          			about the trunk)
          		Be careful of that one.
          
          Burdened with luggage, the bellhops file out through the suite. Bill, suitcase 
          in hand, follows them out, beckoning to Francis behind him.
          
          				BILL
          		Uh, come on, Francis! Take those 
          		turtles!
          
          Francis hurries along carrying the basket, followed by Shep and Nikki.

          FADE IN
          
          EXT. TRAIN STATION - LATER THAT MORNING
          A whistle BLOWS. Their luggage already aboard, Francis, Nikki, Shep and Bill 
          walk down the platform, parallel to the train. Bill claps his hands 
          exuberantly.
          
          				BILL
          		There she is, boys! The Sud Express!
          
          				SHEP
          		Can you imagine Cary tryin' to run 
          		away and leave us behind?
          
          Bill laughs. Nikki peers at the train through her lorgnette.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Do you suppose he's really gonna 
          		be here?
          
          				BILL
          		Sure he'll be here. He's never 
          		missed a train in his life.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Say, do you suppose the turtles'll 
          		be all right with that porter?
          
          Bill gives Francis a supportive pat on the back.
          
          				BILL
          		Aw, sure they'll be all right. All 
          		you got to do is -
          			(gestures with his hand)
          		- sprinkle 'em!
          
          Francis nods soberly. Bill laughs. Nikki points, excited.
          
          				NIKKI
          		There he is!
          
          FARTHER DOWN THE PLATFORM
          Cary buys a paper from a newsboy and steps onto his train.
          
          				BILL (o.s.)
          		Say, Cary!
          
          On the train steps, Cary stops and turns as his friends arrive and gather 
          around him, grinning.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Hello, Cary.
          
          				CARY
          			(surprised)
          		Well, hello. What are you all doing 
          		down here?
          
          				BILL
          		We just came down to see you off is 
          		all.
          
          				CARY
          		Well, that's darn decent of you.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Ya got a nice seat?
          
          				CARY
          		Yeah, right by a window.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Oh, how nice for you!

          			(with childlike desire)
          		Come on! Show us your seat by the 
          		window!

          		Yeah, come on, Cary! We wanna SEE 
          		that seat by the window.
          
          Climbing the steps, Bill and Shep crowd a confused Cary and force him into the 
          train. Following the others, Francis helps Nikki up the steps.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Come on, Nikki.
          
          They all board the train and head for:
          
          INT. CARY'S COMPARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER
          The group crowds into the small compartment.
          
          				BILL
          		My, my, what a swell train.
          
          				SHEP
          		Sud Express, Train de Luxe. Say, 
          		I wonder if a chap can get a drink 
          		on this train.
          
          				BILL
          		Sure! I don't see why not. Push the 
          		button.
          
          Bill pushes a button for the porter.
          
          				CARY
          			(flustered)
          		Well, I'm afraid you won't have time 
          		for a drink. We're gonna start in a 
          		minute. You'll have to get off.
          
          Everyone but Cary grabs a seat. Astonished, Cary stares at each as they speak: 
          
          				BILL
          		Get off?! Gosh, no. We LIKE this 
          		train!
          
          				FRANCIS
          		This is a Train de Luxe.
          
          				SHEP
          		Yes, we like trains de luxe, don't we, 
          		Nikki?
          
          				NIKKI
          		Sure! Trains de luxe is what we like.
          
          The whistle BLOWS. Cary panics.
          
          				CARY
          		Hey! He's blowing the whistle. 
          			(grabs Shep's shoulder)
          		Hey, we're gonna start.
          
          				SHEP
          		Well, let her start.
          
          The trains starts. Bill jauntily throws his hat up to the luggage rack above 
          and the others settle in for their journey.
          
          				BILL
          		Let 'er go Gallagher. Who cares?!
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Who cares?!

          		Who cares?!
          
          				NIKKI
          		Who cares?!
          
          Frink enters casually.
          
          				FRINK
          		Hello, everybody.
          
          Cary is stunned. Frink sits down with the others.
          
          				CARY
          		And you, too?
          
          				FRINK
          		That's right.
          
          The group takes in the train's departure with perfect composure. Cary stands 
          and looks at them for a moment before breaking into a understanding grin.
          
          				CARY
          		That's right. Who cares?
          
          Cary sits. As the train hurtles out of the now empty station, Nikki suddenly 
          turns to the window and waves goodbye to no one at all:
          
          				NIKKI
          		Goodbye! Goodbye! Don't forget to 
          		write!
          
          Shep, Bill and Francis quickly join in, waving and shouting goodbye, much to 
          Cary's amusement. Even Frink manages a smile at this.
          
          					DISSOLVE TO:
          
          THE TRAIN'S WHEELS
          racing down the track.

          INT. CARY'S COMPARTMENT - IN THE HEAT OF THE EVENING
          The compartment doorway. We hear the men laughing. Bill -- drink in hand, his 
          necktie loosened and his coat off -- appears in the doorway, coming from the 
          train's corridor.
          
          				BILL
          		Hi, men! Look what I found.
          
          With a grand gesture, Bill presents an elderly British gentleman who follows 
          him into the little room, greeted with a cheer of "Hooray!" from the men who 
          sit around, similarly coatless (save Frink), smoking and drinking. 
          
          Various bottles stand on a central table. The old gentleman is greeted warmly 
          but it's never clear whether he is an old friend or a total stranger.
          
          				SHEP
          		Come in.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Sit down.
          
          				CARY
          		Have a drink.
          
          				GENTLEMAN
          		Ah, thank you, no, not I. 
          
          Bill and the old gentleman sit down. Nikki dozes in her seat by the window. 
          The basket of turtles hangs from above.
          
          				GENTLEMAN
          		I - I say, are you all going to 
          		Portugal?
          
          				SHEP
          		Yup. We're going down there to 
          		investigate conditions.
          
          				GENTLEMAN
          		Investigate conditions?
          
          				BILL
          		Drinking conditions, mostly.
          
          				SHEP
          		By the way, what ARE conditions?
          
          				GENTLEMAN
          		Don't you know what conditions are?
          
          				SHEP
          		No. Never saw one in my life.
          
          				BILL
          		The drinking conditions are pretty 
          		bad right here.
          
          				GENTLEMAN
          			(chuckles skeptically,
          			glancing at the bottles)
          		Ahh, indeed.
          
          				BILL
          		My beer's full of cinders.
          
          				CARY
          		Good for ya. Make ya lay hard-shelled 
          		eggs.
          
          The men laugh. A whistle BLOWS. The conductor appears briefly in the doorway 
          to announce in French that the mademoiselle's compartment is ready.
          
          				CARY
          		Nikki? The man says your 
          		compartment's ready.
          
          Nikki wakes, rises, and clutching her pillow, heads for the doorway.
          
          				NIKKI
          		I'm glad -- on account of it's been 
          		so hot and I'm so tired and I want 
          		to go to bed.
          
          				SHEP
          		Going to bed? Who ever heard of such 
          		a thing?
          
          Bill rises to confer with her at the door.
          
          				BILL
          		Can we help you undress?
          
          				NIKKI
          		No, thank you, William.
          
          The old gentleman looks rather astonished at this casual exchange.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Take off your shoes? 
          
          				SHEP
          		Undo your hair?
          
          				BILL
          		Scrub your back or something?
          
          				NIKKI
          		No, I can manage quite well by 
          		myself. Good night, everybody.
          
          The men say, "Good night." Frink, who has been watching Nikki with a predatory 
          eye, is the most polite:
          
          				FRINK
          		Good night, Nikki.
          
          Nikki turns and disappears down the corridor. The old gentleman mops his brow 
          with a handkerchief and stuffs it in his collar.
          
          				CARY
          		Can you imagine that ungrateful old 
          		trollop? She wouldn't let them help 
          		her undress.
          
          				GENTLEMAN
          		Can't understand it at all.
          
          				CARY
          		You know, she's not very pretty. But 
          		when she was a little girl, her 
          		mother always said she had the nicest 
          		hair-ribbons.
          
          				GENTLEMAN
          		Indeed?
          
          				CARY
          		She got one tooth turned around, she 
          		can't see very far, and she's ALWAYS 
          		speaking out of turn. Otherwise, 
          		she's a mighty fine piece of 
          		architecture.
          
          				GENTLEMAN
          		Mm, seems to need a few repairs.
          
          During the next exchange, Frink, seated by the door, grins at Bill and Shep, 
          then notices Francis dozing off. Frink cautiously rises and exits into the 
          corridor without anyone noticing his departure.
          
          				SHEP
          		She's got eyes like an Assyrian 
          		Queen's got eyes.
          
          				BILL
          		You ain't never seen no Assyrian 
          		Queen! You're just a-makin' that up 
          		outta yore own head!
          
          				SHEP
          		I did SO see an Assyrian Queen.
          
          				CARY
          		In whose green hat?
          
          				SHEP
          		In the Metropolitan Museum's green 
          		hat, that's whose green hat.
          
          Francis' pocket watch CHIMES. He wakes, rises, puts on his hat and moves 
          absently toward the door. Seeing this, Shep, Bill and Cary shout at him: 
          "Whoa!" Francis pauses in the doorway and sleepily turns to the others.
          
          				CARY
          		Hold on there! Where you goin'?
          
          				SHEP
          		You're not going anywhere. You're on 
          		a train.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Sorry.
          
          				SHEP
          		You go back to your turtles, hear? 
          		You've been neglecting your 
          		assignment.
          
          Francis moves to the hanging basket of turtles, takes off his hat and, bottle 
          in hand, wets his fingers and sprinkles the turtles. Curious, the old 
          gentleman rises to join him. Francis explains as he works:
          
          				FRANCIS
          		I have to sprinkle the turtles, see?
          
          				GENTLEMAN
          		Sprinkle the turtles?
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Sure. 
          
          The old gentleman nods and clicks his tongue with understanding.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Cool 'em off. 
          
          				GENTLEMAN
          		Hm?
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Turtles get feverish on trains.
          
          				GENTLEMAN
          		Ahh! Uh huh.
          
          A woman's SCREAM drifts in from the corridor.
          
          				NIKKI'S VOICE
          		Cary!
          
          				FRANCIS
          		What's that?
          
          				GENTLEMAN
          		Hm?
          
          The men hear Nikki SCREAMING. 
          
          				CARY
          		Nikki!
          
          Francis, Cary, Bill and Shep -- in that order -- scramble out the door,
          leaving the old gentleman behind.
          
          				NIKKI'S VOICE
          		Cary! Bill! Shep!
           
          The men rush down the corridor to:
          
          INT. NIKKI'S COMPARTMENT - A MOMENT LATER
          Frink grapples with a half-dressed Nikki, his lips pressed to her neck as she 
          struggles to free herself from his grasp.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Cary!
          
          Energized by Nikki's peril, Francis bursts in and pulls Frink away from her.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Say! 
          
          Nikki grabs a wrap from the turned-down bed and covers herself as Frink pushes 
          Francis hard into a nearby wall, knocking him to the floor.
          
          				FRINK
          		Get out of here!
          
          Frink turns back to a defiant Nikki as Cary enters and sees a dazed Francis 
          slumped against the wall, clutching his head. Cary grabs Frink's shoulder and 
          spins him around.

          				FRINK

          		get out of here? This isn't your 
          		compartment, is it?
          
          				CARY

          				BILL
          			(savagely)
          		Put him out? I'll snap his spine and 
          		throw him off the train!
          
          Cary rolls his eyes at this remark and wisely holds Bill back.
          
          				CARY
          		Hold everything, Bill!
          
          Distraught, Nikki sinks down on a chair.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Oh, dear, does everybody have to act 
          		like this?
          
          Frink turns to her in protest.
          
          				FRINK
          		I'm not gonna let these silly drunks 
          		tell ME where to get off.

          				FRINK
          		Yes. And that goes for the whole 
          		bunch of you.
          
          				BILL

          				FRINK
          		You will, eh?
          
          Frink starts to strong-arm Cary. Cary punches Frink in the jaw, knocking him 
          onto the bed.
          
          				SHEP
          		Socko!
          
          As Frink slumps down to floor and leans against the bed, half-conscious, 
          Francis rises and watches the proceedings with a hand on his head.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Oh, dear!
          
          Cary, fist still tightly clenched, stands over the dazed Frink as Bill 
          brightens considerably and wipes his hands with delight.
          
          				BILL
          		Mm! Now, ain't that nice? Have you 
          		ever seen anything so cute?
          
          Francis exits uncertainly.

          		Here, Francis. Do your stuff.
          
          Bill and Shep carry Frink in and dump him on the seat opposite Francis. Bill 
          walks off, wiping his hands happily. The others are grim, furious at Frink for 
          his actions. Shep watches a disgusted Francis soak his hand and sprinkle Frink 
          as if he were one of Nikki's turtles. Frink snaps out of his daze.

          Francis pointedly sprinkles Frink one last time. They give each other a dark 
          look. Francis fingers the neck of the water bottle as if he were going to use 
          it to smash Frink in the face. As they glare ominously at one another, we

          protagonists enjoying the night life: Nikki's image dominates at the center, 
          surrounded by images of the men in dinner clothes. Everyone drinks, except 
          Frink who smokes a cigarette and stares, desirous and snakelike, presumably at

          party horns, taking a bottle or two with them, and waving to an unseen

          And the music and the montage end.

          INT. CARY AND SHEP'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY
          Cary, wearing a robe, sees Shep still asleep in bed. Cary puts on a party hat, 
          sits on the edge of his own bed opposite Shep's, picks up a party horn and 
          blows into it, hard. The horn SQUEALS horribly. Shep wakes with a start and 
          sits up in bed, completely unnerved. Cary laughs at him and, with his clenched 
          hands, picks up a bottle.
          
          				CARY
          		Wake up, ya big sissy. 
          			(pours a drink)
          		Here, drink this. It'll make you 
          		laugh and play like any old thing.
          
          Shep groans and sighs as Cary hands him a glass with his fists. 
          
          				SHEP
          		Say, Cary, what day is this?
          
          				CARY
          		It's Wednesday.
          
          				SHEP
          		Wednesday? Wednesday what?
          
          				CARY
          		The twentieth.
          
          				SHEP
          		What month, I mean?
          
          				CARY
          		You mean to say you don't know what 
          		month this is? 
          
          				SHEP
          		I knew once but I forgot.
          
          				CARY
          		Well, it's June. The merry month of 
          		June.
          
          				SHEP
          		June? Say, maybe I better get up. 
          
          Cary looks at Shep, amused.
          
          				SHEP
          		What town are we in?
          
          				CARY
          		You're in Lisbon, Portugal.
          
          				SHEP
          		Lisbon. That's where I thought it 
          		was. I just wanted to check up is 
          		all.
          
          				CARY
          			(a little concerned)
          		Say, what's the matter with you, 
          		Shep? Don't you really know where 
          		you are or what day it is?
          
          				SHEP
          		I kind of lose track of things.
          
          				CARY
          		Say, this is getting serious.
          
          Cary lets the goofy hat fall off his head into his hand and sets it aside.
          
          				SHEP
          		Serious? Is anything serious any 
          		more?
          
          				CARY
          		Well, it's serious when you don't 
          		know where you're at. What's gonna 
          		become of you?
          
          By now, Shep has polished off his drink. He sets down the empty glass.
          
          				SHEP
          		Oh, I'll be all right when I've had 
          		a couple of drinks. Say, what town 
          		did you say this was?
          
          				CARY
          		I just told you, Lisbon. Come on, 
          		now, pull yourself together, Shep. 
          		We gotta get organized for the 
          		bull-fight.
          
          Shep, excited, gets out from under the bedcovers.
          
          				SHEP
          			(like a little kid)
          		Bull-fight? Are we going to a 
          		bull-fight?
          
          				CARY
          		Sure. A Portuguese bull-fight.
          
          				SHEP
          		Is that guy Frink coming along?
          
          				CARY
          		'Fraid so.
          
          				SHEP
          		Gee, isn't there any way we can get 
          		rid of that guy? 
          
          				CARY
          		Somebody'll have to shoot him.
          
          Shep rises and walks off.
          
          				SHEP
          		Not a bad idea at that.
          
          Cary watches him go and blows his party horn, wryly.

          A bugler blows his own horn, grandly, while standing before colorful bull-
          fight posters that read: CORRIDA DE TOUROS
          
          A crowd files in under an arched entranceway. Our little group enters, dressed 
          for a day at the fights.
          
          				BILL
          		Praca de Touros! 
          
          And, sure enough, the words over a decorated archway read: PRACA DE TOUROS
          
          				BILL
          		I wonder if there's a bar inside or 
          		anything.
          
          A friendly, English-speaking Portuguese man named Pedro overhears this and 
          joins them.
          
          				PEDRO
          		Sure, there IS a bar.
          
          				SHEP
          		Let's find the bar. We gotta get 
          		organized for the bull-fight.
          
          				PEDRO
          		Right this way.
          
          Pedro leads and they happily follow.

          Led by their guide, Pedro, the group files in and lines up at the bar. A tiny, 
          extremely drunken old man is the only other customer.

          		Oh, boy! Lookit that bar, would ya?

          			(to the bartender)
          		Hey! Vermouth!
          
          Bill, glass raised, proposes a toast. On the wall behind him is the shadow of 
          the drunken old man, standing in roughly the same pose.
          
          				BILL
          		Well, men, fire and fall back!
          
          As Bill drinks, the old man's shadow wobbles forward. Bill hears the sound of 
          liquid SPATTERING. He stops drinking and looks puzzled.
          
          A stream of liquid pours down onto Bill's right foot, soaking his sock and shoe.
          
          Bill turns to find the drunken old man leaning at an unsteady angle, the 
          alcohol spilling steadily out of a glass in the man's hand and onto Bill's 
          foot.
          
          				BILL
          		Hey! What's the idea?
          
          The others, lined up at the bar, see this and laugh. The drunken old man 
          brushes some lint off Bill's jacket as Bill shakes his pant leg, amused.
          
          				BILL
          		Well, I hope I don't catch a cold 
          		in my left ear.
          
          Band MUSIC plays. Cary looks up, concerned.

          		Hey, drink your drinks! We'll miss 
          		the parade!
          
          The group hurriedly finish and exit. Shep pays the tab. Bill, followed by the 
          old man, shakes his pant leg and limps along after the others.
          
          					CUT TO:
          
          EXT. ARENA - MINUTES LATER
          The crowd CHEERS and the band PLAYS as a parade of matadors, picadors and 
          banderilleros enters the ring.
          
          Led by their guide, Pedro, the group takes seats in the front row, back of the 
          trenches. They have to sit close down so Nikki can see things. The drunken old 
          man from the bar tags along behind Bill like a puppy dog and tries to sit next 
          to him but Pedro pointedly directs him to a seat in the second row.
          
          When Bill rises to cheer the parade, the drunken old man also rises and taps 
          him affectionately on the shoulder. Bill turns and greets him pleasantly, 
          shaking his hand.
          
          				BILL
          		Well! My old pal!
          
          The old man tips his hat to Bill and sits. Bill shakes his pant leg and gives 
          the old man a wry look before also sitting. 
          
          IN THE RING
          The parade ends. A matador throws his montera (his black woolen hat) into the 
          crowd.
          
          IN THE FRONT ROW
          Cary catches the hat, much to the group's delight -- they shout "Hooray!" 
          Immediately, a cape is hurled at Bill who drapes it over the railing before 
          them. Cary offers the hat to Nikki.

          		Nikki, here's a present for you.

          				PEDRO
          		Oh, señor, no, no, no -- you must 
          		not keep the hat. You must put a 
          		little present in it and return it 
          		to the matador after the fight.
          
          				CARY
          		What kind of present?
          
          				PEDRO
          		Well, eh - a little jewelry. 
          		Something you have like the chain or 
          		the watch or the - the - the 
          		cigarette case or the cuff links or 
          		- or the--
          
          				CARY
          		Vanilla?
          
          				PEDRO
          		Yes! Vanilla!
          
          A trumpet FANFARE. The crowd CHEERS. Bill points, excited.
          
          				BILL
          		Look! Here he comes!
          
          IN THE RING
          A bull charges into view. Bull-fighter and bull face off. The bull makes ten 
          passes, faster and closer each time.
          
          IN THE FRONT ROW
          Bill sits next to Pedro.
          
          				PEDRO
          		Nice work! Good work.
          
          				BILL
          		What's so good about it?
          
          				PEDRO
          		He works close to the bull.
          
          				BILL
          		Is that so dangerous?
          
          				PEDRO
          		Sure, it's dangerous. Bull-fighting 
          		is very dangerous. It takes a lot of 
          		courage to go into the bull ring.
          
          Bill scoffs and waves dismissively. Cary leans in with a query.
          
          				CARY
          		Is it true the bull is blind when he 
          		charges?
          
          				PEDRO
          		He sees only the cape -- perhaps.
          
          IN THE RING
          Bull-fighter and bull continue their duel. Finally, the bull gets the 
          advantage and others must rush in to distract the bull.
          
          IN THE FRONT ROW
          Bill is unimpressed.
          
          				BILL
          		Bet I could run that bull bow-legged. 
          		You know, I should have BEEN a 
          		bull-fighter.
          
          				PEDRO
          		You should have started at twelve 
          		years of old.
          
          				BILL
          		I bet I could start right now.
          
          				CARY

          			Bill's shoulder)
          		Sit still and behave yourself.
          
          				PEDRO
          		Bull-fighting is not for Americans.
          
          				BILL
          		You think we haven't got the nerve 
          		or something?
          
          				PEDRO
          		Why, listen, bull-fighting is just 
          		for us, the Latins.
          
          				BILL
          		He thinks we're a-scared!
          
          				NIKKI
          			(helpfully)
          		He tackled a horse once.
          
          				PEDRO
          			(stares at Bill)
          		Tackle a horse? 
          
          Full of himself, Bill nods. 
          
          				PEDRO
          			(turns away; flatly)
          		Is not the same!
          
          Everyone suddenly stares in shock as:
          
          IN THE RING
          the bull knocks down the matador. Others rush in to distract the bull which 
          runs wild, out of control.
          
          IN THE FRONT ROW
          Frink nudges Francis awake and points out the carnage in the ring. Francis 
          glances at the spectacle briefly and then sleepily applauds. Frink gives him a 
          look and nudges him to stop clapping. Francis simply goes back to sleep.
          
          WILD BULL MONTAGE
          The toreros try to control the bull but it refuses to cooperate. 
          
          The crowd watches intently. Bill takes off his own hat and picks up the 
          matador's cap that Cary had caught.
          
          Toreros scramble and run for their lives. The bull chases them down, runs 
          across the ring, forcing them to jump the barrera, the protective wooden 
          barrier that circles the inside of the arena. 
          
          Bill, now wearing the cap, can't resist leaning over and mocking a group of 
          toreros who huddle in the callejon, the safe side of the barrier, just below 
          him.
          
          				BILL
          		Nice work, Tony! Nice work, Joe!
          
          The toreros look up at Bill in surprise. One of them responds in Portuguese 
          with a gesture toward the ring, as if to ask "If it's so easy, why don't you 
          try it?" The other toreros laugh.
          
          Bill stares into the ring, a savage look in his eyes. He puts a leg up on the 
          railing.
          
          He jumps down into the ring.
          
          				CARY'S VOICE
          		Hey! 
          
          Cary rises, stunned.
          
          				CARY
          		Bill! Come back here!
          
          But it is too late. Bill's coat is already off and he waves it like a cape as 
          he stalks after the bull.
          
          The bull turns and sees him.
          
          Bill moves toward it, waving his coat and grinning like a madman.
          
          Shep is frozen. Beside him, Nikki screams and turns away.
          
          The bull begins to charge.
          
          Cary climbs over the railing.
          
          The bull charges.
          
          TRACK FAST TOWARD Bill who holds the coat before him -- big eyes, big grin.
          
          The bull is on him. The bull roars.
          
          Bill's face snaps backward in a blur, his coat follows. 
          
          The bull gores him through his coat. His face twists in pain. 
          
          CUT WIDE as the bull knocks Bill's body around the ring like a rag doll. He 
          hits the ground hard. Screams from the crowd.
          
          Four toreros rush in.
          
          They surround and distract the bull. Bill lies motionless.
          
          Cary runs across the ring.
          
          More toreros and others rush in, surrounding the bull, finally leading away.
          
          In the front row, Shep, Nikki, Francis, Frink and Pedro watch with concern as 
          ....
          
          ... toreros converge on Bill and try to move his body. Cary joins them.
          
          				CARY
          		Bill!
          
          But Bill is unconscious. A torero says something to Cary in Portuguese. Cary 
          and the others lift Bill.
          
          				CARY
          		Take it easy! Take it easy!

          INT. ARENA INFIRMARY - MINUTES LATER
          A group of toreros straighten their gleaming spangled jackets and walk off to 
          reveal Cary standing over a bloodied Bill and holding his hand as medical 
          personnel prepare to operate. Bill lies flat on a table and smiles, amused 
          with himself.
          
          				BILL
          		Cary? I slipped.
          
          				CARY
          		Too bad. You were doing fine.
          
          				BILL
          		Wasn't I, though? Heh. It's a cinch. 
          		Bull-fighting? Just as easy-- 
          
          Bill breaks off and raises his head to look at the doctor off screen.
          
          				BILL
          		Hey, Doc?! Be careful. What are you 
          		doing? 
          
          To distract him, Cary pulls out a handkerchief and mops Bill's brow which 
          glistens with sweat.
          
          				BILL
          		You know why I slipped, Cary? 
          
          				CARY
          		No, Bill. Why?
          
          				BILL
          		On account of that beer in my shoe. 
          
          Bill breaks off and raises himself up again.
          
          				BILL
          		Hey, Doc! 
          
          Cary gently eases Bill's head back down.
          
          				BILL
          		Cary, that bull certainly was 
          		hostile.
          
          Pedro escorts Shep (in his dark eyeglasses again) and Nikki into the room. The 
          doctor, in surgical gear, puts on gloves and looks annoyed by the intrusion.
          
          				SHEP
          		You hurt, Bill?
          
          				NIKKI
          		You all right, Bill?
          
          				BILL
          		Sure. I'm all right. I was a big 
          		success.
          
          The doctor has some sharp words for Pedro who acknowledges this and approaches 
          the others:
          
          				PEDRO
          		He wants that we should go right 
          		away.
          
          Pedro exits.
          
          				BILL
          		I'm sure glad that I - I wore my new 
          		blue shorts. I'll be a big success 
          		in the hospital.
          
          Nikki places a hand on his head.
          
          				NIKKI
          		I'll send you my turtles, Bill. And 
          		THEN you'll be a big success.
          
          She turns away, trying not to cry. Shep follows her as they leave.
          
          				SHEP
          		So long, Bill.
          
          				BILL
          		So long.
          
          Shep follows Nikki out.
          
          				CARY
          		Goodbye, Bill.
          
          Bill reaches up and pats Cary on the shoulder. Cary looks at the doctor, then 
          at Bill, before retreating to the door. He turns to look back at Bill who 
          grins at him.
          
          				BILL
          		See ya later - Cary.
          
          Cary can't return the smile. He turns and goes, closing the door behind him. 
          Bill's attention turns to the doctor whose approaching shadow is cast on the 
          wall behind him. Bill's smile fades.

          Cary emerges and joins the group who are gathered glumly on some steps.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		How is he?
          
          				CARY
          		They've just put him to sleep. 
          
          Nikki, emotionally fragile, hands Cary his hat.
          
          				CARY
          		Why, thank you, Nikki. There's 
          		nothing you can do. You'd better go 
          		back to the hotel. 
          			(to Francis)
          		Put Nikki in a taxi. We'll wait here.
          
          As Frink and Francis exit with Nikki, Pedro approaches Cary with a couple of 
          journalists.
          
          				PEDRO
          		Señor, the reporters want to know 
          		why your friend descend into the 
          		bull ring.
          
          Cary looks off and thinks for a moment.
          
          				CARY
          		Tell them -- that it seemed like a 
          		good idea - at the time.
          
          Pedro stares at Cary in astonishment. Cary joins Shep and the two of them 
          stand with their backs to the others as we

          EXT. CARNIVAL - NIGHT
          The amusement park at Port Mayer. Crowds, carnival NOISES, a carousel with 
          appropriate MUSIC.
          
          At a nearby refreshment stand, we find the group, minus Bill. Everyone is 
          unusually silent and wearing dinner clothes. Francis holds a mug upside-down. 
          Frink leers at Nikki who ignores him while she, Shep and Cary down their 
          drinks. They hear:
          
          GUNSHOTS. 
          
          They look over to see:
          
          A little shooting gallery where customers rent genuine guns to shoot various 
          colorful targets and win prizes. 
          
          				CARY
          		Sounds like old times.
          
          				SHEP
          		Let's go and shoot.
          
          				CARY
          		Not a bad idea. 
          			(to Nikki)
          		What say, Annie Oakley? Like to 
          		fire off a gun at something?
          
          				NIKKI
          		No objection.
          
          				SHEP
          			(to their bartender)
          		We'll be right back. Hold 
          		everything.
          
          The group starts over to:
          
          THE SHOOTING GALLERY
          where an assortment of rifles and pistols are neatly laid out. Cary and Shep 
          escort Nikki to the arsenal while Frink and Francis tag along behind. An 
          attendant joins them to collect their money and ready their weapons.
          
          				SHEP
          		First one to miss pays for the drinks.
          
          				CARY
          		What'll we shoot at?
          
          				NIKKI
          		Shoot one of those pussycats and see 
          		what happens.
          
          				SHEP
          		All right. Look out, pussycat.
          
          Shep FIRES and misses the moving cats that float across the base of the range 
          on an endless chain and disappear. But he hits a tinier target: a clay pipe 
          behind them.
          
          Shep's eyes pop with surprise.
          
          				SHEP
          		Well, that's what I was aiming at, 
          		a clay pipe. 
          			(stares in amazement)
          		Whole thing's been misrepresented 
          		to me.
          
          Cary laughs at him.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Cary, let's see you shoot something.
          
          Cary takes careful aim.
          
          				CARY
          		Look out, ball!
          
          He FIRES and hits a ball balanced atop a stream of water.
          
          				NIKKI
          		What'd YOU aim at?
          
          				CARY
          		Well, let's see you shoot something.
          
          Nikki awkwardly raises her little target rifle to her shoulder. The end of the 
          barrel describes uncertain circles in the air. A multiple exposure point-of-
          view shot of the targets reveals that Nikki is a little too tipsy to be 
          handling a gun. Cary moves to help her.
          
          				CARY
          		Oh, no, no, no, Nikki.
          
          				NIKKI
          		How do you hold it still?
          
          				CARY
          		Listen, Nikki, on your right 
          		shoulder. Now, put your hand out 
          		there and hold up-- No, don't cover 
          		up the site. No, no, no, that's 
          		right. Now just hold it evenly--
          
          Rapid GUNSHOTS. Cary looks up in surprise. He and Shep turn to watch in 
          amazement as Francis cuts loose with an automatic rifle, shattering a whole 
          row of pipes with split-second firing.
          
          The others cheer as Francis lowers the weapon and stares moodily at an 
          astonished and, apparently, very drunk Frink. Cary takes this moment to 
          encourage Nikki.
          
          				CARY
          		You can do better than that. Show 
          		him up.
          
          She again tries unsuccessfully to hold the rifle steady. Amused, Frink picks 
          up a pistol and imitates her.
          
          				FRINK
          		What are you waving at, Nikki?
          
          Cary sees Frink pointing his gun at Nikki and moves to intervene, grabbing 
          Frink's wrist with both hands.
          
          				CARY
          			(angry)
          		Look out! Why, you fool. Don't you 
          		know better than that?
          
          Shep and Francis move to shield Nikki.
          
          				FRINK
          		What's the idea?
          
          				CARY
          		Pointing a loaded gun at Nikki?
          
          				FRINK
          		Take your hands off me.
          
          				CARY
          		Put down that gun!
          
          				FRINK
          		Let go of my wrist!
          
          Frink violently pulls free of Cary's grasp and, as he does, the gun goes off 
          with a BANG. Francis hurries Nikki to safety in the opposite direction. Shep 
          backs away, clutching his side -- for a moment, it looks very much as if he's 
          been hit. Cary pursues and confronts Frink.
          
          				CARY
          		Put down that gun!
          
          Frink backs up to a nearby lamp post and, wielding the pistol, points it at 
          Cary. His face is tense, savage.
          
          				FRINK
          		Listen, you keep your hands off me! 
          		I've had enough from you! You try 
          		any more of your rough stuff on 
          		me--!
          
          A nervous crowd of passersby pauses to watch the showdown.
          
          				CARY
          		Oh, so that's how it is. I thought 
          		we taught you how to behave.
          
          Frink, drunk and frustrated, starts to lose it completely.
          
          				FRINK
          		You taught ME how to behave?! Listen, 
          		you'd better behave now or you'll 
          		get hurt!
          
          				CARY
          			(calmly)
          		I don't think so. I'll give you 
          		three to put down that gun. It'll be 
          		just too bad if you don't.
          
          				FRINK
          		Too bad for who?!
          
          Frink cocks the hammer.
          
          				CARY
          		One ...
          
          Cary moves slowly toward Frink.
          
          				FRINK
          		Keep away from me! I'll shoot, I 
          		tell ya! I'll shoot!
          
          				CARY
          		Two ...
          
          Frink and Cary are less than a yard apart.
          
          				FRINK
          		I'll shoot! I'll shoot!
          
          GUNSHOTS. Cary flinches. Frink drops the pistol, his face twisted in pain. He 
          starts to fall.
          
          Nearby, Francis coolly FIRES his rifle, pumping seven bullets into Frink.
          
          Members of the crowd SCREAM in terror. Instinctively, Shep (still clutching 
          his side) and Nikki each put a restraining hand on Francis' arm. Francis 
          lowers the rifle, staring in horror and amazement at what he's just done. 
          
          				CARY'S VOICE
          		Francis? 
          
          Cary rushes over and pulls the rifle out of Francis' hands.
          
          				CARY
          		Francis?
          
          Francis snaps out of his trance as Cary hurriedly returns the rifle to the 
          gallery. Shep and Nikki watch, stunned, as Francis immediately moves to Cary 
          and shakes his hand.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Goodbye, Cary. 
          
          Francis turns to Shep and Nikki for equally heartfelt handshakes, an odd look 
          on his face.
          
          				FRANCIS
          		Shep. Nikki.
          
          They realize he is saying a final goodbye. The crowd presses in as Francis 
          glances back at Frink before turning and hurrying off. 
          
          As a huge crowd rushes in the direction of the shooting gallery, Francis 
          threads his way through it in the opposite direction and, with only the 
          briefest glance backward, rounds a corner to disappear behind a building.
          
          Cary stares at Frink's body as the gathering crowd streams into view, then 
          quickly starts to lead a shaken Shep and Nikki away from the shooting gallery.
          
          				CARY
          		We've got to get out of here. Come 
          		on, Shep. Come on.
          
          They slip through the thick fringe of excited people fast gathering in front 
          of the shooting gallery and hurry off in the same direction as Francis who is 
          now:
          
          BEHIND THE CARNIVAL BUILDINGS
          on a dark, deserted street. Distant crowd NOISE and carnival MUSIC drifts in. 
          Under the light of a street lamp on the edge of the carnival, Francis strolls 
          casually into view and swings a leg over a slackly hung boundary rope, pausing 
          to glance backward. He sees ...
          
          ... Cary, Shep and Nikki as they round the corner and pause, a little 
          breathless, to lean against a wall. Shep, his fist still at his side, slumps 
          weakly as Cary and Nikki stare at ... 
          
          ... Francis who briefly makes eye contact and then, without a word, turns, 
          steps over the rope and, pulling his jacket collar up around his neck, walks 
          off, instantly swallowed up by the darkness.
          
          Cary and Nikki stare after him, astonished.
          
          				CARY
          		That's the last of Francis, I'm 
          		afraid. We'll never see him again.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Did you notice his eyes? That's the 
          		first time I ever saw Francis really 
          		happy. What'll happen to him, do you 
          		suppose?
          
          				CARY
          		Don't worry about, Francis. He'll 
          		take care of himself. Let's get out 
          		of here. Let's walk.
          
          Shep leans weakly against the wall, his eyes glassy.
          
          				SHEP
          		No. Don't want to walk. Let's take 
          		a cab.
          
          Cary quickly moves to a signal a cab parked nearby. Nikki rests a sympathetic 
          hand on Shep.

          As the cab jolts down an uneven street and drives slowly through the crowded 
          carnival, the MUSIC continues. Cary and Shep sit on either side of Nikki. Cary 
          is as edgy as Shep is subdued.
          
          				CARY
          		Did you see the way Francis poured 
          		lead into that fellow? 
          
          				SHEP
          		Fast work.
          
          				CARY
          		Fast? Chain lightning!
          
          				SHEP
          		Nice shooting.
          
          				CARY
          		Those slugs went right past my ear. 
          		If I'd've moved an inch, I would've 
          		caught one of them myself.
          
          				SHEP
          		"Sudden Death," all right.
          
          Nikki takes out a cigarette.
          
          				CARY
          		What's the matter with you, Shep? 
          		I've never known you so quiet 
          		before.
          
          				SHEP
          		That's right. I am kind of quiet.
          
          				NIKKI
          			(holds her unlit 
          			cigarette)
          		Not smoking?
          
          				SHEP
          		No.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Your lighter working?
          
          				SHEP
          		Good ol', Nikki -- never has any 
          		matches.
          
          				NIKKI
          		No.
          
          As Shep puts his hand in his inside jacket pocket to pull out his cigarette 
          lighter, a strange look crosses his face.
          
          				SHEP
          		Sure you want a light?
          
          				NIKKI
          		That's what I want, a light.
          
          Shep pulls out the lighter and flicks it on -- revealing bloodstains on his 
          white shirt. Nikki stares down at the blood in horror.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Shep. Shep!
          
          Nikki jumps up and moves away from Shep, into a seat opposite.
          
          				CARY
          		What is it?
          
          				NIKKI
          		Shep's hurt!
          
          Cary turns to Shep, who slumps back weakly against his seat with a strange 
          look of release and satisfaction on his face.
          
          				SHEP
          		It's a forgery.
          
          Cary examines Shep, reaching in to feel his bloody wound.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Do something for him, Cary! Oh, 
          		Shepard!
          
          				CARY
          		He's been shot!
          
          				NIKKI
          		What can we do, Cary?! What can we 
          		do?!
          
          				CARY
          		Shep, why didn't you say you were 
          		hurt?
          
          				SHEP
          		Good old Cary. Sweet Nikki. You may 
          		not believe it but this is the best 
          		thing that ever happened to me.
          
          				CARY
          		Oh, Shep, Shep, don't say that. 
          		You'll be all right. We'll get you 
          		to a hospital.
          
          Shep puts a hand on Cary's arm as the taxi continues to jolt along down the 
          street. 
          
          				SHEP
          		No, no, Cary. Don't rush me anywheres.
          		Let's sit here for a while. The-- 
          		Hurts, the jolting.
          
          Urgently, Cary reaches over and bangs on the glass between themselves and the 
          cab driver.
          
          				CARY
          		Stop! Stop! 
          
          In front of the carnival's slowly revolving carousel, the cab rolls to a stop. 
          The carousel MUSIC drifts in. Shep hardly moves -- head back, blank eyes 
          staring, voice dreamy and weak. Cary puts his face close to Shep's, listening 
          intently.
          
          				SHEP
          		That's better. You know, Cary, I feel
           		- just like we're falling -- long 
          		time ago. Do you remember? Spinning 
          		... spinning ... spinning. Only you 
          		brought me down safe. Oh, Cary. Good 
          		old Cary. 
          			(sighs)
          		Best flyer in the service.
          
          Nikki, seated opposite, is distraught.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Oh, Shepard, Shepard, darling.
          
          				CARY
          			(reassuring)
          		We're gonna make a safe landing 
          		again, Shep.
          
          				SHEP
          		Not this time, Cary. Ol' Shep's 
          		gonna crash. 
          			(beat)
          		Say, but we're spinning fast. Level 
          		off. Cary, level off.
          
          Shep's head slumps down. His face presses against Cary's shoulder. 
          
          				NIKKI'S VOICE
          		Oh, Shepard, Shepard, darling.
          
          Cary can't look at him. Eyes wide, Cary slowly presses his cheek to Shep's.
          
          				CARY
          		Shep? - Shep?! - Shep!
          
          Cary looks as if he is on the verge of tears. And yet he cannot bring himself 
          to cry.

          INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT
          Nikki cranks her portable phonograph, turns it on and puts the needle to the 
          record -- Toselli's "Serenade," that strange, sad composition that haunted 
          Europe at the close of the Great War. 
          
          As the bittersweet romantic music plays, she listens for a moment. Then she 
          turns and sidles over to sit next to Cary who is seated by the window, 
          scribbling something on a piece of paper beside a small lamp.
          
          				NIKKI
          		What are you writing, Cary?
          
          				CARY
          		A letter. A letter to Shep's mother.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Mind if I read it?
          
          				CARY
          		Certainly not.
          
          Nikki reads the letter silently. A long pause.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Why, Cary. Cary, that's the most 
          		beautiful letter I've ever read. 
          
          Nikki turns away and begins to cry, quietly.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Please forgive me for crying, Cary. 
          		I can't help it. You don't mind if I 
          		cry just a minute, do you? 
          
          				CARY
          		No, Nikki.
          
          Cary puts aside the letter.
          
          				NIKKI
          		Can't you cry, Cary?
          
          				CARY
          		No.
          
          				NIKKI
          		But you have cried sometime in your 
          		life, haven't you?
          
          				CARY
          		Long, long time ago. Before the war.
          
          				NIKKI
          		And you can't cry now? Not even for 
          		Shep?
          
          				CARY
          		Shep Lambert spent his life in the 
          		war. He had nothing more to give. He 
          		had died once. And he was ready to 
          		die again.
          
          				NIKKI
          		This time he was played out with 
          		music. That was the way he wanted it.
          
          				CARY
          		And Bill Talbot was a big success in 
          		the hospital in his new blue shorts.

          		And Francis?

          		Maybe Francis will forget to wind 
          		his chiming watch one day and go on 
          		sleeping. Till the end. It doesn't 
          		matter now. Without them, nothing 
          		matters. We only had each other. 
          		Comradeship was all we had left. 
          		And now that's gone, too.
          
          				NIKKI
          		And you, Cary? You? You're alone 
          		now.
          
          				CARY
          		That's right. I'm alone now.
          
          				NIKKI
          		I don't want you to be alone, Cary. 
          		Let me stay with you. Let me be with 
          		you. 
          
          He takes her hand, looks at her affectionately.
          
          				CARY
          		Why, Nikki. You're sweet.
          
          He kisses her hand. A strange, apprehensive look crosses her face as she turns 
          her hand over in his hands and opens it -- to reveal a heart-shaped stone. 
          Cary looks at her in surprise.
          
          				CARY
          		Why, Nikki, you kept it. You didn't 
          		forget.
          
          She lowers her eyes for a moment, then looks at him.
          
          				NIKKI
          		No harm can come to our true love.
          
          				CARY
          			(amused, skeptical)
          		No harm can come to our true love? 
          			(genuinely)
          		Oh, Nikki, you've become very dear 
          		to me. I want to help you. Can't I 
          		do something for you, too? What do 
          		you want? What can I get you?
          
          				NIKKI
          		Well, I've always wanted a pair of 
          		Spanish earrings.
          
          He gives her an uncomprehending look but then breaks into a smile as she 
          buries her head lovingly in his shoulder. He kisses her hand again.
