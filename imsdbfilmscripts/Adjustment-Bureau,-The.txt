          INT. SOME SORT OF LOBBY -- DAY

          DAVID NORRIS, 33, is having a private moment, looking down,
          thinking. He wears a suit and tie. He seems relaxed and
          confident. Content. Completely in his element.
          In one of his hands he's absentmindedly twirling a couple of
          individually-wrapped Ricola throat lozenges. We hear the
          muffled voice of someone on a PA system outside:

          A man in a BLUE BLAZER walks up to David.

          Now REVEAL that we're Â±fl: the entry hall of the Admin Building
          at St. Johns University. A thousand people crowd the quad
          out front. "Norris for Senate" placards everywhere.

          Just wait 'till you see how they
          respond to him..
          David pops a cherry lozenge into his mouth and straightens
          his lapel pin, which is shaped like New York State.

                         DAVID

          Charlie. He'll be disappointed.

          The crowd, many of them in their twenties, roars with
          approval as David walks out to the lectern on the steps of
          the Admin Building.

          MONTAGE -- SENATE CAMPAIGN
          --David finishes a speech at the FDNY Academy's graduation.
          The cadets jump to their feet and give him a standing
          ovation.
          --David shakes the hands of workers entering a .Con Edison
          plant in Buffalo. He's a natural at this. Unlike most
          politicians he actually seems to enjoy campaigning.
          --Flashbulbs go off as he plays a game of pick-up basketball
          with a group of Bronx teenagers. Charlie is nearby.
          --David takes a ceremonial shovel full of dirt to begin
          redevelopment of an old military base upstate.
          --He gives a speech at a Harlem church. Audiences watch
          David the way they watched JFK, the way they watch Obama
          today. He inspires, makes them believe, makes them want to
          follow him. Especially young people.
          --David walks through a suburban mall happily shaking hands
          as cameras follow him and citizens snap pictures with their
          camera-phones. People crush around him. He:doesn't seem to
          mind at all. He welcomes it. He feeds off it.
          --He pops a cherry lozenge in his mouth and climbs up onto a
          tractor to speak to a gathering of upstate farmers, speaking
          into a bullhorn to compensate for his hoarse voice. Charlie
          stands nearby watching him speak:.

          INT. SHERATON HOTEL ROOM --UPSTATE SOMEWHERE -- DUSK

          David enters his hotel room. The silence contrasts starkly
          with the noisy energy of the campaign trail.
          He turns on the TV. Scrolls through the channels. After a
          moment shuts it off. Total silence again. It bothers him.
          He opens up his briefcase. Pulls out a thick file -- his
          itinerary for the next three days. Dozens of speeches and
          meetings across the state.
          He glances at the summary page on the top. Glances down the
          page with his finger, stopping, almost at random, on a speech
          he's giving two days from now at the Westchester County Open
          Space Initiative.

          out at the trees.

          Charlie enters the lobby. Stops suddenly: spots David,
          holding court at`the hotel bar. Fifteen strangers around him
          as he regales them with a story, despite the fact that he's
          clearly losing his voice. Charlie walks over, pulls him
          aside.

          you have to be up at four AM for us
          to make it in time.
          David is holding ,a beer, in his left hand. With his free hand
          he picks up a cup and saucer.

          This provokes a quizzical look from Charlie. Fifteen

          David watches the election coverage on TV. Pundits are
          discussing the New York Senate race, which CNN has already
          called for David's opponent.

                         PUNDIT #1
          Congressman Norris has a reputation
          for being very direct, even blunt,
          in his campaign speeches, which is
          great until you say too many things
          you wish you hadn't. Then you
          start to look like an amateur.

                         PUNDIT #2
          That's bad for any candidate but
          it's fatal if you're running for
          Senate at the age of 33, your
          opponent keeps calling you an
          "impulsive kid," and you almost
          killed your entire political career
          five months ago with an act of
          immaturity that ended up on the
          front page of`.the New York Post.
          David winces slightly. This is excruciating. Just then
          Charlie enters.. The nerve center.suite is visible through
          the open door behind him.

                         -CHARLIE

          David puts on a brave face. . .but this is the first moment
          that he realizes not only is he going to lose, but he's going

          a shockingly poor showing in both
          Suffolk county and in his home
          county, Kings, it now appears that
          David Norris will lose this

          A sound behind him. David spins to see a WOMAN exiting one
          of the stalls. She's in a stunning ball gown and carrying an

          As David walks down the aisle a couple of passengers
          recognize his face. . .but they don't say anything.
          David nears an empty aisle seat. A woman is curled up in the
          window seat, sleeping. She wears a funky mini-dress, knee-
          high argyle socks under leather boots, and a (clashing)
          argyle bucket cap.
          David sits next to her. And stares.

          page and we get our first good look at that circuit diagram:
          Thousands of interconnected lines. Dozens of geometric
          symbols at intersection points. And written notations in a
          language as complex as Sanskrit crossed with Chinese.
          And, maybe it's just a trick of the light but several of the
          lines appear to re-arrange themselves on the page.

          David's still grinning as he reaches his downtown office

          Empty, except for a bored-looking security guard at the other

           David enters to find the office suite quiet... Not a soul
          in sight. Not a single secretary is here.

          (loud, playful)
          Doesn't anybody bother getting in
          before eight at this place?
          David passes a couple of empty offices on his way towards a
          large corner suite where a secretary sits outside an office
          marked "Charles Traynor, Chairman." She's smiling.

          He leans across her desk, touches her arm. She stays dead
          still. David rushes through Charlie's door:

          He is surrounded by four men in bulky, metallic silver
          protective suits .(think airport firefighter gear).
          One of the men adjusts three metal. probes which are attached

          David sprints toward the door he came in. It closes as he
          gets there. He grabs it. It's locked.
          He sprints away into an internal hallway. Richardson emerges
          from a door in the middle of the hallway.

          You can't get away, David.
          David spins and rushes back into the main office, then down
          an internal staircase to the floor below. Jumps the last
          five steps and hits the floor hard.
          As he comes up he runs smack into another RSR employee who is
          frozen solid.
          David curses, then dives around the frozen employee to find
          Richardson, coming out of another office. down the hall.

          from the rooftops) stand behind David, about 20 feet away.

          sprints toward an open door forty feet across the warehouse.

          Why does it'matter?

                         RICHARDSON
          You weren't ever supposed to see
          her again.

                         DAVID
          Why do you care.?

                         RICHARDSON
          Because, David, you can't be with
          her. And we didn't want to have to
          resort to this--
          Four big guys grab David and pull his arms backwards like
          prison guards incapacitating a prisoner. Richardson reaches
          into David's pocket and pulls out his wallet--

                         DAVID
          What the hell-- What are you--
          Richardson removes the piece of paper that Elise wrote her
          number on from David's wallet--

          Richardson places the wallet back in David's pocket, then
          pulls out a lighter--

                         DAVID (CONT'D)
          No!
          And burns Elise's number. David strains and tries to pull
          loose from the vice-like grip of the four Intervention Team
          men. But he can't get free.

                         DAVID (CONT'D)
          What is wrong with you people?!
          Richardson drops the paper on the floor and lets it burn.

          David exits through a steel door., it clangs shut behind him.
          He stands there unable to proceed for a long beat then starts
          walking to the corner to orient himself.
          Down one street he spots the Manhattan Bridge, down the other
          the Brooklyn Bridge. He's in DUMBO.

          David sits alone at the bar. His hand trembles slightly.

          Harry can see that David is still very shaken.

          it's always been. You just

          A thousand-yard stare on his face, David walks toward
          downtown Manhattan amid dozens of--pedestrian commuters.

          David stands in ftontof the corner office labeled "Steve
          Kincaid." He hesitates, then opens it. He sees an empty
          office with a killer view of New-,York Harbor. It's strangely
          disorienting for him.

           EXT. PIER -- ADJACENT TO WEST SIDE HIGHWAY -- DAY

           David sits on a bench looking at the water. The wind picks
           up and he puts his hands in his,coatpockets to keep them
           warm. His right hand feels something. He pulls out a
          ticket for the 4 pm Circle..Line tourist boat cruise.
          EXT. CIRCLE LINE CRUtgE -- DAY
          The boat pulls away front=the dock. It's misting rain so
          there's only asmattering of tourists on-board. David stands
          looking back at Manhattan. Harry is next to him.

                         HARRY
          A lot of people just collapse when
          they see what you've s'een. Their
          personal choices suddenly seem
          meaningless to them. Life starts
          to feel pointless.

                         DAVID
          I was` raised to believe there's
          something behind the curtain. I
          just never pictured it quite like
          this.

                         HARRY
          Most people don't.
          Harry looks over his shoulder, scans for any signs of his
          colleagues. He's far from relaxed.

                         HARRY
          How are you feeling?

          how far to go with this. Finally:

                         HARRY
          Richardson was just trying to scare
          you.

                         DAVID
          He knew what color I was thinking.

                         HARRY
          Because he set it up as a choice.
          "Choose a color. Choose a number"

                         DAVID
          So?
          Harry looks away. He's crossing a line. He's really putting
          himself out there:

                         HARRY
          We can't read your mind or hear
          your thoughts. But before you make
          a choice your brain weighs options,
          and we percpite that. We know if
          you're going to go off Plan "or not
          because, as long as we're close
          enough, we cansense it when it's
          about to happen.

                         DAVID
          it-;' s like a sixth sense for you?

          What did they do too Charlie?

                         HARRY
          Made some small change in the way
          he assesses risk.

                         DAVID
          What type of risk?

                         HARRY
          (this is beside the point)
          I don't know. Something arcane.
          Something to do with mortgage-
          backed securities.

                         DAVID

          Yes.

                         DAVID
          What would your colleagues do to
          you if they knew what you were
          telling me?
          This is precisely what Harry has been worried about.

                         HARRY
          That's why we're meeting out here.

                         DAVID
          They're not following me?

                         HARRY
          We don't have the manpower to
          follow everybody all the time.
          They're checking in on you. Just
          not here. Not right now.
          ON David's face considering this.

          EXT. UPPER DECK DAY

          Moments later. They stand out of earshot of the few
          tourists up here.

                         DAVID
          Why are you helping me?

                         DAVID

          Harry looks back at him. Taken aback a bit by how much David
          seems to care.

          All I know is, given the amount of
          resources they've used, keeping you
          from her is pretty important to
          them.

          You're going to look for her aren't

          Again, David is silent.

          Huge shafts of morning sunlight cut across the park outside
          David's apartment. The trees are blooming. It's Spring now.

          INT. BEDROOM -- MORNING

          An alarm clock reads 6:29 am. David lies alone in bed. He's
           already awake, staring at the ceiling...
           After a long beat the alarm clock rings. David shuts it
          off. But then just lies there...

           It's the same apartment -- except it's bigger now. Instead
           of two large windows on the park, his apartment is now six
          windows across. (He has bought the two one-bedrooms next to
           his and knocked the walls down). Three years have passed.
           No files on the table, like there were the last time we were
          here. David is on the phone in a new park-view study.

           CHARLIE (PHONE V.O.)
          How are you feeling about the
          speech?
          David has not noticeably aged and yet he's more tempered and
          subdued than when we last saw him. We `hear it in his voice:

                         DAVID
          I'm ready... I changed a few
          things last night.

          THROUGH THE WINDOW AT DAVID
          David finishes his call, then looks out the window. There is
          a detachment in h-s eyes that didn't exist before. After a
          moment, he gets his=coat and heads for the door.

          EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING

          David exits Starbucks with a coffee. He walks across the
          park toward the same Fifth Avenue bus stop he did three years

          David enters the Ml bus. He feeds his Metrocard into the
          reader as he looks down the aisle scanning the riders.. .more
          out of habit than actual hope. He walks back to take a seat.

          INT. BUS -- MINUTES LATER -- MORNING

          David stares idly out the window. His Blackberry buzzes with
          a text message. Looks down at it. Then looks back out the
          window. Suddenly his eyes snap into focus.
          DAVID'S POV: The bus passes a woman walking on the sidewalk.

          David's head whips around, only able to see her from the back
          now. She walks like Elise. She's dressed in the same
          eclectic style. He slams the red "next stop" strip, jumps
          to his feet, and runs to the front of the bus.

                         DAVID

          The bus stops. David jumps out on Broadway. FOLLOW him as

          catches up to her at University Place.

          She spots something on her bookshelf (we can't see what) and
          her smile fades. She takes it and puts it in a drawer.

          unequivocal.

          chemistry between them, the
          constant inflection points, and the
          kicker of course: you pulling them
          apart only to have "chance" put
          them back together. Twice. That

          does the front page of the Arts section catches his eye.
          There is a big photo of Elise, doing an "airborne split,"
          accompanying an article titled "Dance Takes a Quantum Leap."

          Charlie turns the Arts section around for David to see it.
          Elise's photo has a noticeable impact on David. He glances
          at the article for a moment.

          It's pouring rain. David walks down Carroll Street. Most of
          the row houses display "Norris for Senate" signs.
          Most of the housing here is run-down but this block is
          clearly in the early'stages of gentrification.

          There's a "Norris for Senate" sign prominently displayed in

          the bartender.

          Do you still serve neighborhood

          thought it was a hallucination at
          first. Eventually I realized it's
          how you move around so fast.
          (off Harry's reluctance)
          If you don't want to help me
          because of what they'll do to
          you...okay, that's your choice.
          But if this is about protecting me
          then shouldn't the choice be mine?

          complicated it is to navigate
          through those doors... how many
          thousands of permutations there are

          to forty or fifty people between
          when I walk, through' the door and
          when I start speaking. But when
          I'm done with the speech I can call

          Lower Manhattan is a nightmare.
          Layer upon layer of substrate --
          that's what we call the system of
          doors -- has been added over time.
          That makes it a lot more complex to
          navigate down here than it is
          uptown. And a lot slower.
          Harry dumps out several hundred photos of doors, interior and
          exterior, all below Canal Street.

          We see THE CHAIRMAN from behind only ..but we can still tell
          he is utterly calm and in complete control.
          An aide comes to The Chairman's--desk,.sets two open leather
          folios in front of him.

          EXT. SHEEP MEADOW -- DAY

          Thompson and a dozen other men with hats step out into the
          rain, scan the horizon for any sign of their quarry.

          EXT. HARLEM -- DAY

          They emerge through a door on the 125th Street Metro-North
          platform. Run down the stairs to street level.

          INT. BANANA REPUBLIC -- DAY

          Thompson and a half-dozen minions emerge from the same
          dressing room David and Elise did. The seventeen year-old
          attendant presses back against the wall, totally freaked now.

          EXT. HARLEM -- DAY

          David and Elise head toward a storefront church.

          Thompson and his men pour out onto the street flashing NYPD
          badges and asking questions. /

          David and Elise enter the church and--

          REVEAL that they are standing at the base of the Statue of
          Liberty...
          Elise looks out at the harbor and the city. Rain pelts her
          face. And she smiles. Exhilarated. Like a prisoner who has
          just broken her chains...

          EXT. COLUMBUS AVENUE -- DAY

          Rain bounces off the dozen long black raincoats worn by
          Thompson and his men. A black Suburban with under-grill
          police lights pulls up fast.

           David and Elise exit into a hallway with eight doors on it.

                         DAVID
          Perfect.
          David picks a door. It's locked. He tries another. It's

                         ONE --
          locked too. He tries a third. Locked. Elise tries
          shakes her head.

          They're not supposed to be locked!
          David hears sounds coming from the building's central
          staircase. He looks down it to see four men in silver suits
          climbing up the stairs.

          silver suits.

                         ELISE
          This one's open!
          Elise is standing at the door to the roof. David runs to her
          and they go up the stairs together to--

          EXT. ROOF -- DAY

          David pushes the roof door shut, barricades it with some
          concrete blocks sitting on the roof. Rain pours down on
          them.
          They rush to the edge of the roof. ,Three Con Edison vans are
          parked haphazardly on the street below. And a dozen
          civilians on the sidewalk are frozen..11: ;
          David grabs Elise and they go to the side of the roof, the
          roof of the building next door is ten feet below them. They
          hang their legs over the edge and jump.
          They sprint across the roof of the building next door --
          except somehow they find themselves running across the same
          roof they were just on.
          David sees the concrete blocks he placed against the door a
          moment ago. The door bangs against theme being shoved open
          from inside.
          David and Elise run back in the c5,pposite direction. At the
          building's edge they climb over again and... run...
          Only to find that theyare still on the first roof they were
          on. It's like they're in an.Escher painting.
          They stop, and look at each other. David takes her hand as
          Adjustment Team trsapers appear all around them from adjacent
          roofs. They're completely surrounded.

                         ELISE
          Kiss me.
          Tears well in her eyes. And his.

          Close your eyes and kiss me.
          He does. And they kiss in the rain...

          They hold each other for a long beat ... . and then, finally,
          open their eyes.. .ready to accept their fate--
          They see an empty roof. The Silver Suits are gone. And the
          rain has stopped. A strange silence envelopes them...
          They spin the other direction to see The Chairman, standing
          there, alone.

                         THE CHAIRMAN
          Hello, David... Good morning,
          Elise.
          His voice is gentle, paternal.

          I could control 'everything. You'd

          try to .keep things from getting too
          out of control. But that has a
          cost. Most people go through life
          like pinballs, reacting predictably
          to the stimuli I apply. They
          accept the path they find
          themselves on. And perform
          accordingly. But every once in a
          while someone comes along who
          refuses to be bound by his fate,
          someone who understands that Free
          Will is a gift most people are too
          afraid to use.

          better. Because that's the other
          part.
