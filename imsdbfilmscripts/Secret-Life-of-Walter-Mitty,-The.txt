          The cafeteria is a large white room, with massive black and
          white Life photographs serving essentially as wallpaper.
          Particularly, they are images of physical and human immensity
          (photographs of the summitting of K2 and the beachheads of
          Normandy) and make the office workers here (Life magazine's
          low-level corporate workers among whom Walter is one) seem
          tiny in terms of their personal accomplishments but also
          physically. Walter and a co-worker TIM NAUGHTON sit in front
          of the Massive K2 mountain summit photograph.

          Walter walks up to Battery Park to find (really) a grand
          piano sitting in the park. He stops and stares at it awhile.

          Regular NY foot traffic passes around him. He absentmindedly
          starts playing the first bars of Cheers. Then he just keeps
          doing it because he's thinking of other things.

          Then Walter sees Cheryl Mellhoff and her son RICH (9), headed
          his way from across Bridge Street. They've got two
          skateboards. Walter smiles when he sees them and waves.

          Cheryl, Walter and Rich push the grand piano toward quiet
          Bridge Street. It's on its wheels and a couple skateboards.
          It's rolling down the street pretty well. They're about to
          push it out onto the street.

                    down a street and get honked at by
                    everybody in New York?

          They do. The honking begins right away, but they keep rolling
          the grand piano down Bridge Street. It looks like it might be
          fun.

                    screwed up and got my mom a
                    apartment on the 15th floor. The
                    movers weren't equipped to get it
                    up there. She didn't have the money

          water. It's the stern of a fishing trawler. Its vessel name
          and registry number are visible. She's the Erkigsnek SO709.

                    Hey, fuck you, man.
                         
          There's been a little bit of a shoving, shoulder thing. It's
          getting a little hot.
                         
          INT. BUS, MOVING, NY - LATER
                         
          Walter's on the bus. He's looking at the out of focus print
          again.
                         
                                             WALTER

                    What is this?
                         
          Some time passes. Then Walter puts on his loupes (eye glasses
          with a center magnifying lens). Then his cell phone vibrates.
          He's got an email. He reads it.
                                                                   82.
                         
                         
                         
           it looks weird because we're seeing it through Walter's
          magnifying loupes - but much of it is clear: It's from human
          resources and reads in part: because you have been terminated
          with cause you do not qualify for severance or to salary
          beyond your last day of work. This message confirms that
          today's date (11/12/11) constitutes the last day of your.....
                         
          Walter is stunned.
                         
          EXT. STREET, BROOKLYN - LATER
                         
          Walter's among some others, walking up a sidewalk home, but
          he's been so thrown by being fired in this manner that he's
          forgotten to take his head-mounted loupes off. It's an
          unusual image.
                         
          This is a view through Walter's loupes as he walks through
          Brooklyn trying to get his head together. The middle images
          are magnified but the outside circumference isn't - it's
          unusual and sort of pretty - to see people pass by, sometimes
          enhanced, then not, all a little dizzy, like Walter's
          feeling.
                         
          INT. ELEVATOR, WALTER'S BUILDING - LATER
                         
          Walter rides up the elevator with some normal-looking
          residents in his head-mounted loupes.
                         
          INT. WALTER'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Walter walks into his apartment. He sits down in the small
          living room (he's still wearing the loupes). Some time
          passes. Nothing seems to happen. Then, slowly, after
          considerable time, a look of powerful and complete
          astonishment comes over him. He's looking at something that
          has just shifted his world.
                         
          We see things from Walter's perspective (through the loupes).
          Most everything is out of focus because he's wearing them.
          But he's looking, in real life (in his apartment), at exactly
          the out of focus image that he has been carrying around a
          photo of. The object is in his apartment. He looks at this
          out of focus (because of the loupes) real object. Then he
          looks at the photo he still holds. They are indisputably the
          same. Then he looks back at the real object and removes his
          loupes to bring it into focus. It's the piano.

                    sure. There are fears of a repeat
                    of the violence in Seattle at the
                    WTO. And there are three thousand

          Behind her you can see a great number of young people, anti-
          establishment and anti-capitalist chanters. It looks like a

          The G8 summit attendees (business leaders and government
          leaders from across the industrialized world) are being
          hustled past the crowds of chanting young people. Some are
          fielding reporter's questions hastily, then heading up the
          hotel steps for the summit. There's a huge number of people
          here, protestors, reporters, police (many). It already feels
          a little like mayhem.
                         
          Business leader MARK CHATHAM is wrapping up an exchange with
          CNN on the sidewalk outside the steps, then he starts being
          peppered with a request from Walter who's amid the chanting
          protestors on the other side of the barricades.

          It's awkward for Chatham, observed and on camera by CNN. He
          can't blatantly ignore Walter now.

          the midst now, trying to push people back. It's getting a
          little rough, ugly.

          the 7th floor of the residential building Walter secured for
          his mom. Walter and Odessa stand in Battery Park, looking up
          at the piano. The movers are setting it into the removed
          window space. It looks like it's going to fit.
                         
          INT. VILLA, ROOM, RETIREMENT - LATER
                         
          The piano has fit easily here. Odessa and Edna are
          straightening up, putting the last few things away. The
          room's in good shape. It's really pretty nice. Edna seems at
          home.
                         
                                             ODESSA
                                       (TO WALTER)
                    Hey, babe, come on. We'll go grab
                    lunch.
                         
          Odessa and Edna head out the door.
                                                                  119.

                    I'll be right out.
                         
          They go. The room is quiet. Walter looks around again. Making
          it happen took considerable effort no one but Walter will
          know about. After a moment, he goes and sits at the piano.
          Some time passes. Then Walter plays the beginning of Cheers.
          Then he gets up and follows his sister and mom out.
                         
          EXT. 5TH AVENUE - LATER
                         
          Walter's walking with Odessa and Edna. They've come past a
          newsstand with magazine displays. Walter was going to walk
          right on by like Edna and Odessa did. But he's noticed
          something on the magazine racks that's stopped him. He stands
          there for a while looking at it.
                         
          It's the last issue of Life Magazine. Its cover is a black
          and white photograph of Walter siting on a cement bench out
          front of the Time-Life building. He's got his lunch in a
          brown bag beside him; he's looking over photo prints with his
          loupe, working carefully on some day in the past to fulfill
          the wishes of Life's photographers- a person who's work the
          world never knew took place. It's really good. You can see
          the word LIFE on the building sign above the bench. So the
          last photograph, on the last cover of Life, elegantly honors
          the people who quietly worked there and cared for it.
                         
          Walter stands in front of the newsstand looking at it. It's
          the first time he's seeing it. It's a message that to Sean,
          at least, and possibly to others his work was meaningful.
                         
          EXT. BATTERY PARK, NYC - DAY
                         
          On another day, Walter's sitting in Battery Park across the
          little street where his mom lives. He's with Cheryl. Her son
          Rich skateboards around the park.

                    I don't know yet. Would you have
                    lunch with me? Somewhere not in the

          Some time goes by. Walter looks tired, worn out from his
          extended journey and his large efforts to keep the lid on the
          critical matters of his life. But he also looks relieved and
          satisfied. Piano music continues. The title appears again:
          The Secret Life of Walter Mitty. Then CREDITS BEGIN.
