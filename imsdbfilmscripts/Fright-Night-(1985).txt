          EXT. FULL MOON - NIGHT (AND CREDITS. ROLL)

          Clouds obscure the starless heavens for a moment, heavy and
          ominous in the black firmament. Then suddenly they clear,
          exposing a full moon streaked with red like a killer's
          face, a stalking moon staring down at man's evil on the
          earth below.
          A HOWL breaks the night, a wolf pursuing its prey perhaps,
          or perhaps something much, much worse. VOICES break the
          perfect stillness.

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          What was that?

          MISS NINA (V.0.)
          Just a child of night, Jonathan.
          Come, sit here beside me on the
          veranda.

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          It's chilly out here.

          MISS NINA (V.0.)
          Oh, no, it isn't. It's beautiful. I
          love the night so.

          2 EXT. RANCHO CORVALLIS - NIGHT

          A middling size town lost somewhere in the Southwest, the
          lights of its sixty some thousand residents twinkling like
          so many Christmas lights in the night.

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          I've never seen you so beautiful
          before, Nina. So pale, so
          luminescent, so
          He suddenly stops. There is a moment. Then:

          MISS NINA (V.0. )
          Yes?

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          Your lips are so red.

          MISS NINA (V.O.)
          Are they? Would you like to kiss
          them?
          The CAMERA STARTS TO PUSH IN CLOSER AND CLOSER on the town
          as though searching for the source of the voices.

          3 EXT. CHARLEY'S STREET - NIGHT

          It's a typical middle class suburban street, full of pre-
          1 World War II houses, the substantial places they built
          then, two and three story homes with attics and basements.,
          porches and detached garages.
          There is the SOUND OF A LONG DRAWN OUT KISS as Jonathan and
          Miss Nina's lips meet. The CAMERA. MOVES DOWN the street,
          still looking for the voices.

          4 EXT. DANDRIGE AND BREWSTER HOUSE - NIGHT


                         V
          The CAMERA PAUSES TO STARE AT the Dandrige house, so dif-
          ferent in look and feel from all the other houses on the
          street. It's huge, almost forboding, its windows dark and
          vacant, its lawn overgrown and weed-infested, a home that
          has obviously been untended for a long time, unlived in and
          uncared for. However the "For Sale" on the lawn has a
          "Sold" sign just beneath it.
          The CAMERA PANS to the Brewster house next door, still
          SEARCHING for those voices. It's in sharp contrast to the
          Dandrige house, newly painted, its lawn neatly shorn, a
          house almost dwarfed in comparison to the Dandrige house,
          but a happy home, its windows lit and smiling out warmly at
          the night.
          The voices seem to be coming from the Brewster house, spe-
          cifically from a dark second-story window that is open to
          the night breeze.

          JONATHAN (V.0.)
          Why are you looking at me so
          strangely, Nina?

          MISS NINA (V.0.)
          Not you, Jonathan. Your neck. Has
          anyone ever told you it was
          beautiful?

           JONATHAN (V.O. )

           No.

           MISS NINA (V.0.)
           Come, lay your head on my breast.
           The CAMERA SLOWLY STARTS TO PUSH IN on the second-.story
           window.

          The CAMERA MOVES THROUGH the window, past the billowing
          drapes to find itself staring at a TV, the flickering
          screen the only light in the room.

          One of those terrible AIP/Hammer horror films is on the
          tube, a woman, obviously a vampire, talking to one of those
          vapid juveniles used so much in these types of films, the
          two of them standing on a veranda to some huge, old house.
          The young man rests his head against her breast, incredibly
          enough, unaware that she is bending toward his neck with
          these huge fangs.
          Just as. she is about to sink them into his jugular, a tall,
          saturnine man steps out of the darkness., wearing a rather
          daffy Victorian suit and carrying a stake and mallet in his
          hand. His name is PETER VINCENT.

          PETER (V.0.)
          Stop, you creature of the Night!
          The vampiress leaps to her feet, her hapless, intended
          victim forgotten. She faces Peter with a, hiss, her fangs
          sparkling in the moonlight.

          MISS NINA (V.O.)
          Who are you who interrupts my nightly
          feeding?

          (drawing himself up to
          his full height)
          Peter Vincent, vampire killer!
          He rushes her, the stake held high to plunge into her
          breast and the CAMERA TURNS AWAY from the TV as the sounds
          of the movie CROSS FADE with the SOUNDS OF HEAVY BREATHING,
          LIPS MEETING, TONGUES INTERTWINING in the room itself.
          Only the room, a typical teenager's lair, seems devoid of
          life, the bed empty, schoolbooks untouched sitting on the
          desk. The CAMERA BEGINS TO SEARCH the room, looking for
          the source of this new sound, much more interesting than
          the old flick on the tube.
          And then it finds them, CHARLEY BREWSTER and AMY PETERSEN,
          two sixteen-year olds, on the floor to the far side of the
          bed, wedged between the bed and the window. They are both
          as American as their jeans and making out like crazy. They
          twis.t and turn on the floor, Amy alternating between enjoy-
          ing it and fighting Charley off, both of them white hot
          with their mutual need. As he tries to slip his hand under
          her blouse, she catches-a glimpse of the TV.
          The horror movie has faded out to be replaced by the
          interior of a local TV studio, a tacky graveyard set the
          centerpiece, the visage of Peter Vincent, much older now,
          rising out of a papier mache coffin and filling the screen
          as CREDITS END.

          This is Peter Vincent, bringing you'
          Fright Night Theatre. Tonight's
          journey into horror is "Blood Castle,"
          one of my favorites. And for a very
          good season. I star -in it.
          He does this booming laugh that goes through about ten echo
          chambers as Charley, totally oblivious to the TV, works on
          Amy's bra, trying to get it undone, obviously something she
          doesn't want. She tries to distract him.

          Behind them, the station break segues into a commercial, a
          bunch of kids singing and dancing joyfully to a Coca-Cola
          commercial. On the floor, Charley finally gets Amy's bra
          undone. That's it for her; she twists away.

                         AMY
          Charley, stop it.
          Be doesn't listen, going for her again, their finger fight-
          ing behind her back, hers trying to get the bra resnapped,
          his trying to keep it undone and get her blouse off at the
          same time. She suddenly pushes him away, really hard this
          time.

                         AMY
          Charley, I said stop it.
          Charley rolls over, leaping to his feet, frustrated as
          hell.

          Jesus, give me a break, Amy. We've
          been going together almost a year and
          all I hear is "Charley, stop it!"'
          They stare at each other angrily, both of them breathing
          hard, their young hormones roiling inside them. Then they
          look away, not wanting to see the other's anger, staring at
          the TV for lack of any better place to look.

          cence, his basic decency winning out over his lust. Sud-
          denly she steps into his arms, kissing him as she never has
          before. She breaks, staring up into his face nervously.

          scene, then the wall, and finally out the window over Amy's
          shoulder.
          And he freezes. There, below in the side yard, he sees two
          shadowy figures carrying what looks very much like a coffin
          toward the storm doors to the Dandrige house next door.
          His mouth drops open as Amyâ¢slips out of his arms and onto
          the bed, completely unaware of what he's seeing. She
          starts to take off her blouse, Charley no longer looking at
          her, his gaze glued to the weird scene he's seeing out his
          window.
          As her blouse comes off, she lays back in the bed, looking
          up at him, waiting for him to join her.

          the large, oblong box, and Charley gasps. It's a beautiful
          piece of work, huge, ornate, obviously incredibly old, and
          bound in brass.

          chair before his window, all the lights off in his room,
          only the flickering TV to keep him company. It's Peter
          Vincent on Fright Night, another one of his films on, this
          time the volume turned off. Charley holds his binoculars
          in his hand, staring at the dark window of the house next
          door, waiting.

          18 ZNT. CHARLEY'S ROOM - MUCH LATER THAT NIGHT
          The TV is just flickering snow now, the channel having
          signed off hours before. Charley still sits in front of
          his window, but he's sound asleep, breathing deeply, lost
          in his dreams. Soft, sensual MUSIC snakes through his open
          window, enveloping him slowly and dragging him awake.
          Groggily he opens his eyes to find himself staring into the
          lit window of the bedroom next door. He sits up with a
          start.
          There is no drawn shade now. Be can see clearly into the
          room and a beautiful teenage girl with long blonde hair
          stands there, framed in the window, slowly taking her
          blouse off. Charley rubs his eyes., hardly able to believe
          what he's seeing. As he watches she drops the blouse to
          the floor and stands there, bare breasted. Charley gulps,
          fumbling for his binoculars.
          He gets them to his eyes just as Jerry Dandrige steps out
          of the shadows behind the girl, gliding across the room
          toward her with incredible grace. To Charley the whole
          thing has.a dreamlike quality, Jerry more an impression
          than a reality. He's thirty maybe, almost beautiful with
          alabaster skin and chestnut hair. He stops behind the

          neck. He slowly leans down as though to kiss her.
          As Charley watches through his binoculars, unable to tear
          his eyes away, Jerry Dandrige's upper lip slowly begins to
          pull back,. revealing just the hint of fangs, long, razor
          sharp, and sparkling pearly white in the moonlight.
          Suddenly, Jerry Dandrige stops, the fangs poised an inch
          above the girl's throat. He slowly raises his head, star-
          ing out the window across the side yard and into Charley's
          bedroom.

          .There, among a clump of bushes, he crouches down, watching
          the black Jeep. The rear door is open as though to receive
          some burden, the yard empty, Billy Cole no longer'there.
          Suddenly the back door to the Dandrige house opens again
          and Billy comes out carrying a large bundle in a plastic
          trash bag over his shoulder. 'Charley's mouth falls open as
          he realizes the bundle could'easily be a woman's dead body.
          Billy dumps it in the back of the Jeep and slams the door,
          crossing. in front of the vehicle for the driver's door.
          Suddenly there is a terrific WHOOSH'through the air over
          Charley's head, the moonlight momentarily blotted out, the
          BEATING OF LARGE WINGS above causing the bushes around him
          to bend and sway. It's almost as though a huge bird, a bat
          perhaps, just swooped over his head from the top floor of-
          the Dandrige house. And then silence returns.
          Charley lifts his head, peering about in the darkness just
          in time to see a shape, more a shadow than a man, step out
          of the darkness no more than ten feet away. It's Jerry
          Dandrige.
          He glides toward the Jeep, tossing Billy a woman's purse.

          Here, you forgot this.
          Billy one-hands it out of the air, turning back for the
          Jeep. Just then the back door to Charley's house bangs
          open, sending a shaft of light into the darkness. Judy
          Brewster stands there in the doorway, calling to her son.

          look at the back door to the Brewster house, inadvertently
          staring right at the clump of bushes where Charley.is hid
          .ing.
          Dandrige takes a step forward, his eyes probing the dark-
          ness as though he can actually see through the murky black-
          ness right to where Charley hides.
          Terrified, Charley suddenly leaps to his feet and races
          back into his own yard, disappearing through the back door
          with his mother. Billy steps forward as though to follow
          the boy. Jerry puts out a restraining hand, stopping him.

          monsters', models, the floor littered with horror comics.

          hidden, sweet, sickly rot just beneath the perfect pale
          skin.

          He sleeps fitfully in his chair, his door locked behind
          him, his window barricaded with his desk.

          48 INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL - NIGHT

          Suddenly the shadowy outline of.what might be a huge bat
          swoops past the window outside followed by the BEATING OF
          MIGHTY WINGS. A second later something is heard landing on
          the roof with a heavy THUD.

          49 INT. CHARLEY'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Charley sits bolt upright in his bed as he hears it, lis-
          tening hard. But now there's nothing but silence. He
          stares up at the ceiling, listening and waiting.
          Then he hears what SOUNDS LIRE FOOTSTEPS walking across the
          roof. And then silence again. Grabbing the cross and
          holding on to it tightly, he walks toward his door.

          50 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          He unlocks the door and pokes his head out, looking up and
          down the hall. Nothing. Then he hears it, a NOISE from
          the floor below. It sounds like fingernails scratching-.
          across glass. He tiptoes to the landing, staring down at
          the shadow enshrouded portico below. The NOISE IS LOUDER
          now, spookier, more insistent. Clutching his cross, he
          starts down the stairs.

          51 INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT'

          Jerry Dandrige stands above Judy, staring down at her
          sleeping peacefully in her bed. The window behind him is
          now fully open. He glides across the room past Judy's
          bureau with her wigs sitting on it, past the wall mirror
          without leaving a reflection to mark his passing, and out
          the door with unnatural silence.

          52 INT. HALLWAY -.NIGHT

          Jerry closes the door behind him, giving it a sharp tug
          that slightly dislodges it-from it hinges, wedging it..tight
          against the frame. It's something no man of ordinary
          strength could accomplish that easily. He turns away,
          gliding across the hall toward the open door to Charley's
          bedroom.

          53 INT. STAIRWAY - PORTICO - NIGHT

          Charley stands on the stairs, staring through the doorway
          into the living room. There is nothing but shadows in
          there. And then he sees it, the source of the scratching
          sound.

          wail. Charley slips to the floor, all the air knocked
          out of him. Jerry advances on'him as Charley fights to

          between the door to the hall and Charley, the SOUNDS of
          Judy struggling to get her bedroom door open becoming
          louder all the time.
          The door across the hall starts-to give with a groan. With
          a hiss of frustrated fury, the vampire whirls, throws open
          Charley's door, and dashes out into the hail.

          hitting the corner and sliding to the cold pavement, almost
          curled up in a fetal ball, tears streaming from his eyes.

          He cuts across the floor on a diagonal to intercept Jerry
          and Amy, the black bouncer dragging Charley after him in a

          jerks Amy out of Jerry's hand, passing her to the black
          bouncer, nodding at her and Charley.

          back slightly, the hint of fangs beginning to protrude over
          his upper lip as rage overtakes him. He raises his right
          hand, holding it out in.front of. the bouncer's face so the
          man can clearly see what is happening. The nails on the
          four fingers pop out, literally elongating several inches
          in front of the man's eyes, growing into razor sharp claws

          swipe, scattering blood everywhere, blinding several of the
          dancers swirling.by, hitting people drinking at the bar, a
          couple necking in a corner, blood flying everywhere.
          Jerry steps around the corpse as it topples backward over a
          table of coke users, the bouncer's dead eyes staring up at
          them. Leon dashes up, - lunging for Jerry. The vampire's
          hand snaps out, grabbing`him by the throat, squeezing,
          driving those claws deep into the man's neck, holding him
          like a chicken, enjoying a second of his death throes and
          then casually flinging him into the center of the floor,
          bringing the music and all the dancing to a shrieking halt
          as this new group of people stare at another dead body.

          in front of him, Peter hugging his back. Behind them, down
          at the foot of the stairs,,Billy slowly sits up. Peter and
          Charley continue climbing, their gazes fixed ahead. Behind

          weight.

          the huge man coming up the stairs toward them, a thin trail
          of blood leaking from the bullet hole in his forehead.
          Peter whips his pistol out with trembling hands and UNLOADS
          THE ENTIRE REVOLVER into the man, casting a pale of
          gunsmoke in front of him and Charley, obscuring their view
          of the stairway below.
          Suddenly Billy Cole appears through the thick cloud, back-
          ing them up the stairs. Peter stumbles, falling backward,
          .unable to rise in time. Billy leans down, grabbing him and
          jerking him into the air like a ragdoll.,. about to fling him
          over the ballustrade to the floor far below.
          Charley suddenly leaps forward, slamming his stake into the
          creature's heart.

          crashing to the steps and staggers back, grabbing the rail
          for support, hanging there below Peter and Charley for what
          seems an eternity, the stake protruding from his heart..
          As the two watch in horror, Cole's face slowly begins to
          dissolve, skin putrefying and slipping away, revealing the
          grinning skull beneath, the process of dissolution acceler-

          Suddenly the legs turn to bone and.what remains of the
          body, no more than a skeleton in clothes now, tumbles
          backward down the stairs with a clatter, to land with a

          the chimney stands Jerry, waiting for the boy. Unaware of
          the danger., Charley reaches the chimney and stealthily be-

          a shadow that suggests Jerry is coming up the stairs
          from the floor below toward them.
          A STAIR CREAKS behind them and Charley and Peter whirl
          to see Amy step out of the stairwell. She looks incred-
          ibly beautiful as though somehow her moment with Dandrige
          has transformed her from virginal girl to a full grown
          woman, dripping with sensuality. Charley steps forward,

          comes more VIOLENT.
          Suddenly ALL THE CLOCKS on the wall below GO OFF, signaling
          that it's 6 a.m., dawn, time for Jerry to go to bed.

          above on the landing, Peter stares around, about to try
          another door when suddenly the huge stained glass window
          directly behind and above him bursts apart in an EXPLOSION

          stairs when Dandrige turns and stares down at him.
          Charley ignores him, starting up the stairs. Peter speaks
          to him, never taking his gaze from Dandrige.

          cross that indeed Peter has recovered his faith. He stands

          open window, the sun beginning to glint its golden rays
          even as he stares at it. He turns back to Peter, roaring
          with fury.

          floor below, turning into a whirling ball of spinning flesh
          only to suddenly emerge- from it no longer a man, but now an
          enormous bat.

          Charley gone, replaced by mad, driving hunger.
          At the other end of the room, Peter desperately weaves his
          way among the pieces of furniture dotting the floor,
          looking for the coffin. He stops before a huge armoir,

          when he glances down. There, at the corner of the armoir,
          is a small hole with rats scurrying in and out. Realizing
          something must be behind the huge piece of furniture, he
          shoves it aside, toppling it CRASHING to the floor.
          A hidden alcove, more a dais than anything else, is
          revealed, a huge window at the back covered with a blackout
          curtain, and Jerry's ornate brassbound coffin sitting in
          the middle, covered with CHATTERING, crawling RATS.

          coffin lid open, sees Jerry resting beneath him, the king
          vampire's eyes closed.

          With a snarl he sits right up in the coffin behind Peter,
          the man turning back only to find himself face to face with
          the enraged vampire. Jerry opens his mouth, about to kill
          him when Peter slams it home, missing his heart and
          impaling his shoulder.

          stopping in her struggle to kill Charley, both she and the
          boy staring.up at the huge vampire looming over all three.
          With superhuman deliberation, Dandrige pulls the stake
          from his chest and hurls it away. It smashes into a far
          wall, splintering a window, sending a thin ray of light
          into the room. Dandrige turns on Peter, his face con-
          vulsed with hatred. He leaps for him, smashing him into
          a wall, about to sink his fangs into Peter's neck as
