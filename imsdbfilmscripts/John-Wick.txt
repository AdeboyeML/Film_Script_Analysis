          A small, quaint, two-bedroom farmhouse: a classic. Nearby, a
          small barn -its paint chipped, wood worn- sits nestled within
          the setting. The homestead feels slightly abandoned, the
          facade -especially the roof- in dire need of an overhaul.

          The hour hand of an old, electric clock shifts slightly,
          marking six a.m. A soft alarm sounds. Beneath the blankets,
          a body shifts, a weathered hand reaching out to silence the
          antique.
                         
          A beat... a sigh... a groan... and JOHN WICK -early sixties,
          salt-and-pepper hair, three-day beard, former boxer, former
          military, tired, beaten down, and at wit's end- sits up,
          staring unblinkingly out at the day.
                         
          A beat... and he stands, donning a weathered robe and a pair

          As John makes his way through his home, we can see that it is
          cluttered and unorganized. Dirty, in fact, as if it hasn't
          been cleaned in months.
                                                                      2.

          John opens the door, retrieves the newspaper, closes, and
          locks the door behind him, without giving the outside so much
          as a glance.

          John unceremoniously tosses the newspaper onto the table,
          opens a cupboard, and measures out a couple of tablespoons of
          Folgers Coffee into an old percolator.
                         
          As it begins to bubble, John open the fridge, studies its
          contents for a moment or two, and then closes it, abandoning
          the thought of breakfast.
                         
          He pours himself a cup of coffee and sits at the table. The
          newspaper is ignored. He drinks in silence for a long, dark,
          brooding moment, the loneliness almost unsettling.
                         
          Suddenly, the phone on the wall RINGS.
                         
          John lowers his cup, staring at the device, his eyes tired.
          A beat... and he stands, walking slowly to answer it.

          As he listens to the voice on the other end, John remains
          still... stoic.

          slowly down into his chair.

          Having shaved and showered, wearing an old -but well-fitted-
          gray suit, John pushes open the garage door...
                         
          ...to reveal a legend in dire need of a total overhaul: a

          A smile plays at his lips as John walks into the garage,
          running a hand along the chassis, desperately in need of a
          wash and wax. Behind him, the wall is lined with tools: a
          mechanic's dream enclave.

          John takes a moment to breath it in: he loves this car...
          although he hasn't taken very good care of it as of late. A
          beat... and he slips the key into the ignition, twisting it,
          the motor coughing to life, the exhaust pipe belching black
          smoke.

          Carrying a humble bouquet of yellow daisies, John slowly
          makes his way down the eerily empty corridor. He pauses
          before a picture on the wall, glancing at his reflection upon
          the glass. He takes a deep breath, exhales, and enters a
          room.

          machinery, accompanied by the soft sounds of technology.
                         
          He removes the wilted daisies from the vase, tosses them in
          the trash, and replaces them with fresh ones.
                         
          He pulls over a chair, reaches out, and takes Norma's hand:
          she is comatose, her breathing synthetic... so many
          machines... so many wires, tubes, and monitors.
                         
          We never see her face:   just her silhouette.
                         
          He holds her hand for a long moment in heavy silence.

          Behind him, the DOCTOR -of a similar age to John- enters,
          placing a hand on John's shoulder. John lowers his head, and
          nods. With a bit of effort, he stands, staring down at her
          for a long moment, never once releasing his grip, and leans
          over to kiss her on the forehead.

          The doctor turns off the machine; lights dim, the room
          settles into silence, and Norma's body grows still.

          the other an office space with a lazy boy recliner and tube

          himself a healthy dose.
                         
          He opens his desk drawer, reaches into the back, and finds an
          old pack of cigarettes, half-empty. He taps one from, places
          it between his lips, and lights it, taking a deep pull. He
          holds it, and exhales, his body relaxing.

          CHORGI (half-Corgi, half-Chihuahua) looks out at him, her
          tail wagging fiercely.

          John swallows a handful of pills, clenches his teeth, and -
          using a pair of needle nose pliers- reaches into the wound,
          searching...

          John cleans the wounds with disinfectant, applies a number of
          pads/bandages, and studies himself in the mirror: he is a
          complete and total wreck... but alive.

          John takes a jacket off of the rack, tries it on -too small-
          moves on to the second one, and it fits. John flicks off the
          light, and leaves the room. A long beat...
                         
          ...and John returns, turning the light back on. From across
          the room, he stares at the young dog, studying it.
                         
          The dog makes no sound, tilting it's head from side to side.
                         
          A beat... and John walks to the cage, removing the clipboard
          from its side, reading it: we can see that the dog is
          scheduled to be put down tomorrow.

          opens its door.

          John takes a leash off of the wall, and clips it to Miko's
