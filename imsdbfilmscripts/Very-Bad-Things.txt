               TITLE SEQUENCE

               THE DEAD OF NIGHT

               Pitch black. Dead quiet. Dim faint light appears in the 
               distance, approaching, growing larger. As the light nears, 
               we recognize car headlights. Closer and closer until the car 
               is bearing down upon us with great force...

               INT. CAR

               Two men in the front seat, FISHER and MOORE. Fisher drives. 
               All seems quite normal until we take a closer look, sweat 
               matts hair, dirt stains on white tuxedo shirts hands are 
               blistered and bloody. They seem almost entranced.

                                     MOORE
                         That ought to be about the end of 
                         that.

                                     FISHER
                         Yup.

               SILENCE. PUSH IN ON Fisher...

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         "The Oakland Raiders have taken a 7 - 
                         6 lead in a, tough, football game 
                         and this crowd is standing..."

               FISHER'S VISION - GRAINY - OUT OF THE PAST THREE RIVER STADIUM - 
               DECEMBER 23RD, 1972

               Playoff game between the Oakland Raiders and the Pittsburgh 
               Steelers. Scoreboard reads: 22 seconds, 4th down, 10 yards 
               to go, 4th quarter.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         "Hang on to your hats, here come the 
                         Steelers out of the Huddle..."

               INT. CAR - FISHER

               transfixed...

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         "It comes down to one big play, 4th 
                         down, ten yards to go. Terry Bradshaw 
                         at the controls..."

               Bradshaw throws.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         "And Bradshaw, back and 
                         looking...Again, Bradshaw running 
                         out of the pocket... Looking for 
                         someone to throw to..."

               Bradshaw throws.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         ...Bradshaw fires it down the field 
                         and there's a collision!..."

               The ball bounces off the helmet of a Raider player and is 
               caught low by the Steelers' FRANCO HARRIS.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         "...and it's caught out of the air! 
                         The ball is pulled in by Franco 
                         Harris!"

                         zone, all but home..."

               Oncoming headlights illuminate Fisher's face...

               FADE IN ON:

               INT. LOS ANGELES CITY HALL - MARRIAGE LICENSE DEPT. - DAY

               SLOWLY TRACKING down a long line of couples. Some with kids, 
               some old, some young, all waiting to pay their $55 and pick 
               up their marriage license.

               We HOLD on a young couple, late 20's, KEITH FISHER and his 
               fiancee, LIZ GARRETY. Fisher has a blondish quality to him, 
               unassuming, pleasant, attentive, a bit more reactive than he 
               could be. Liz is quite attractive, but somewhat tense, and 
               not at all happy about having to stand in this very slow 
               moving line.

                                     LIZ
                         This is ridiculous.

                                     FISHER
                         Government cutbacks.

                                     LIZ
                         Why can't we do it through the mail?

                                     FISHER
                              (patient)
                         We missed the deadline.

                                     LIZ
                         Can't we do it on the phone?

                                     FISHER
                         I don't think so.

               In front of them a middle-aged MEXICAN COUPLE make-out 
               intensely while their chubby little THREE YEAR OLD stares at 
               Liz.

                                     LIZ
                         Why is this Kid staring at me?

                                     FISHER
                         I'm not sure.

               Liz pulls a note-pad out of her daypack.

                                     LIZ
                              (reading from her 
                              notes)
                         Did you send in all of the deposit 
                         checks?

                                     FISHER
                         I think so.

                                     LIZ
                              (pause)
                         What do you mean, you think so?

                                     FISHER
                         I sent a lot of checks, I'm not sure 
                         what all of them are.

                                     LIZ
                         The wedding cake check?

                                     FISHER
                         Sent it.

                                     LIZ
                         Photographer?

                                     FISHER
                         Sent it.

                                     LIZ
                         Florist?

                                     FISHER
                         Yup.

                                     LIZ
                         Caterer?

                                     FISHER
                         Yes.

                                     LIZ
                         Hotel for my parents, the tent, the 
                         band, the Judge...

                                     FISHER
                              (beat)
                         I think I forgot the tent.

                                     LIZ
                              (somewhat alarmed)
                         You forgot the tent?

                                     FISHER
                         I think so.

                                     LIZ
                         Why?

                                     FISHER
                         Why what?

                                     LIZ
                         Why did you forget the tent check?

                                     FISHER
                         I didn't mean to Liz. I'm sorry.

                                     LIZ
                         You can't play around with these 
                         tent people.

                                     FISHER
                         I'm not playing around. I forgot.

                                     LIZ
                         What else have you forgot?

                                     FISHER
                         How could I know what else I forgot?

                                     LIZ
                         I'm working my ass off here. I've 
                         taken care of absolutely everything 
                         Keith.

                                     FISHER
                         Because you wanted to. You wanted 
                         this to be your wedding not your 
                         parent's.

                                     LIZ
                         Don't you dare.

                                     FISHER
                         What?

                                     LIZ
                         Don't you put this on me. Don't do 
                         it, don't do it, don't do it, don't...

               A YOUNG TEENAGE COUPLE behind them stares at Liz, a bit 
               confused.

                                     FISHER
                              (trying to calm her)
                         Stop it. I'm sorry.

                                     LIZ
                              (trying to control 
                              herself)
                         You know how important this is to my 
                         mother. You know that.

                                     FISHER
                         I'm sorry. I'm sorry I forgot the 
                         tent. I don't think I forgot anything 
                         else.

                                     LIZ
                              (not bitchy)
                         I bet you didn't forget the bachelor 
                         party checks.

                                     FISHER
                         Are we going to do this again?

                                     LIZ
                         I'm just saying I bet those checks 
                         all found the mailboxes.

                                     FISHER
                         I wouldn't know.

                                     LIZ
                         It amazes me how organized you and 
                         your little fun bunch can be when it 
                         comes time to mobilize to Vegas.

                                     FISHER
                              (patient)
                         They organized this, not me. I have 
                         nothing to do with it.

                                     LIZ
                         Well it's bad timing.

                                     FISHER
                         How do you figure?

                                     LIZ
                         Right before the wedding?

                                     FISHER
                         It's a bachelor party. You sort of 
                         have to do it before the wedding.

                                     LIZ
                         I suppose Boyd is the creative force 
                         behind all this.

                                     FISHER
                         He is.

                                     LIZ
                         He's a moron.

                                     FISHER
                         He's my friend. He's not a moron.

                                     LIZ
                         David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.

               EXT. SANTA MONICA

               TIGHT ON a "Fred Sands" realty sign being pounded into the 
               ground. Pictured on the sign, as "offered by," is realtor 
               DAVID BOYD, 30-ish, short hair, smiling with bizarre 
               sincerity.

               WIDER to reveal, David Boyd in the flesh, suit jacket off, 
               pounding away, sinking the sign into the front yard of a 
               cute little house. His CELL PHONE RINGS. Boyd, gets the phone 
               from his jacket.

                                     BOYD
                              (into phone)
                         David Boyd. Tina. Great. Okay. Here's 
                         the deal, we're talking five guys. 
                         Hard Rock. Nice guys Tina. My friends. 
                         Yeah. I'm calling you directly so 
                         you don't have to go through the 
                         agency...
                              (suddenly, over his

                         HEY! DO NOT ENTER THE HOUSE!
                              (back into phone)
                         That's correct. Cash straight to 
                         you. Yes. Twelve hundred? I don't 
                         think so. It's just stripping. Just 
                         a show. Hold on.
                              (O.C.)
                         Could you please wait off the 
                         property?

               ANGLE ON A YOUNG COUPLE, obviously here to see the house.

                                     MAN
                         We're just trying to sneak a peak.

                                     BOYD
                         Just stay off the property until I'm 
                         off the phone.

                                     MAN
                         Why?

                                     BOYD
                         Cause that's the way they do it.

               Bewildered and somewhat intimidated, they back off.

                                     BOYD
                              (back into phone)
                         So it's five guys, Hard Rock Casino. 
                         Nine hundred bucks and you do the 
                         thing with the rubber hoses. Are you 
                         in? Tina, are you in? Good.

               Boyd hangs up, puts on his jacket and turns with the same 
               bizarre insincere smile in his photo. Hand extended...

                                     BOYD
                         David Boyd, nice to meet you.

                         Why do you feel the need to explore 
                         this side of your personality?

                                     FISHER
                         What are you talking about?

                         I'm talking about the kind of people 
                         you hang out with... about growing 
                         up, assuming responsibility of 
                         yourself.

                                     FISHER
                         I asked you to marry me. I'm ready 
                         for marriage. That's responsibility. 
                         That's growth.

                                     LIZ
                         I just think that at some point you're 
                         going to have to re-evaluate some of 
                         your friendships...

                         Who else?

                         Charles Moore for instants.

                                     FISHER
                         You don't like Moore? Since when?

                                     LIZ
                         It's not that I don't like him. But 
                         the wedding has really got me thinking 
                         and... I just keep myself opening 
                         up. Growning. And I want you keeping 
                         up with me here.

                         What does Moore have to do with your 
                         growing?

                                     LIZ
                         I just don't see him in the big 
                         picture.

                                     FISHER
                         I've known him since Cub Scouts.

                                     LIZ
                         He's weird.

                                     FISHER
                         He's quiet.

                                     LIZ
                         He's weird.

               TIGHT ON - CHARLES MOORE

               Late twenties, a chef in a very upscale, very busy KITCHEN. 
               His name, "Moore," is embroidered on his white chef's jacket.

               Food orders fly all around as Moore works with a mesmerizing 
               focus, a poetic sense of purpose, fifteen things going on at 
               once; he chops, sautes, braises, etc..., in a perfect mute 
               silence.

                         He just doesn't talk a lot.

                                     LIZ
                         Why? What's his problem?

                                     FISHER
                         He's a great chef.

                                     LIZ
                         He's weird. And I expect more from 
                         you.

                         You expect more what?

                         You're going to be hungover for three 
                         days. Like those guys on "Oprah" 
                         that get drunk and have disgusting 
                         sex with prostitutes and then say 
                         their vows with the stench of cheap 
                         hotel whore sex all over them.

                                     FISHER
                         Time out.

                                     LIZ
                         It's vile!

               People are staring.

                                     FISHER
                         That's absurd.

                                     LIZ
                         I've seen it on television.

                                     FISHER
                         I'm not going to marry you with the 
                         smell of prostitutes on my body.

                                     LIZ
                              (starts to cry)
                         I am not common Keith. I am not 
                         common. I am a creature like no other 
                         and I will not be commoned! Is that 
                         to much to ask?
                              (screaming)
                         Is that to much to ask!?!

                                     FISHER
                         You will not be common!!!

               Finally, at the head of the line, Liz steps up to the clerk.

                                     LIZ
                         Marriage license please.

               EXT. GOVERNMENT BUILDING

               Fisher and Liz emerge, start for the parking lot. Liz stops 
               to look at Fisher, her eyes well with tears, vulnerable and 
               apologetic.

                                     LIZ
                         Do you love me?

                                     FISHER
                         Of course.

                                     LIZ
                         How much?

                                     FISHER
                         With all my heart.

                                     LIZ
                              (vulnerable)
                         Kiss me...?

               FISHER takes her into his arms, pulls her to him, kisses her 
               hard, for all it's worth.

               INT. A LARGE MONEY MANAGEMENT FIRM

               Desk after desk after desk of identical men, seemingly 
               repeating the same task. We find Fisher at one of the desks, 
               number crunching. At the desk across from Fisher sits...

               MICHAEL BRENN, short, compact, with a severe personality 
               disorder, masquerading as semi-appropriate behavior.

                                     MICHAEL
                         That's just insecurity.

                                     FISHER
                         I don't know. She's really been 
                         stressing out.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut 
                         splinters.

                                     FISHER
                         What does that mean?

                                     MICHAEL
                         It means she's insecure.

                                     FISHER
                         About what?

                         out of their fucking sockets with 
                         all the repressed, ass-puckering 
                         rage in these soul-less lizards.

                         hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic 
                         Fisher and you better start addressing 
                         it. You're getting married and I'm 
                         not going to candy-coat it. It just 
                         gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel 
                         cement mixer that will crush every 
                         bone in your body.

               Fisher looks pale.

                         You're not breathing right?

                         Lately I'll just start getting

                         haven't breathed in like two minutes.

               ADAM BRENN, Michael's older brother, mid-30's, a bit soft in 
               the belly, approaches, more or less in charge.

                         I don't care for him.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Liz sits at the kitchen table, in a mild panic.

                                     LIZ
                              (into phone)
                         We've got problems here.

                                     FISHER
                         Problems?

               INTERCUT Liz and Fisher.

                                     LIZ
                         Seating problems.

                                     FISHER
                         Okay.

                                     LIZ
                         Keith do not trivialize this.

                                     FISHER
                         I'm not. What's the problem?

                                     LIZ
                         We're supposed to have gold-trimmed 
                         padded seats, now they're telling me 
                         that there was a mistake and we can't 
                         have padded.

                                     FISHER
                         What kind of seats can we have?

                                     LIZ
                         Not padded ones.

                                     FISHER
                         So what do we do?

                                     LIZ
                         You go down there.

                                     FISHER
                         Go down where?

                                     LIZ
                         Go down to the seat place and 
                         straighten this out.

                                     FISHER
                         Honey I don't have the time...

                                     LIZ
                         I need your help.

                                     FISHER
                         We're leaving in three hours.

                                     LIZ
                              (starts to cry)
                         I need your help.

                                     FISHER
                         I'll call them from the road.

                                     LIZ
                         Do you love me?

                                     FISHER
                         More than I ever imagined being able 
                         to love anyone ever.

                                     LIZ
                         Take care of those chairs.

                                     FISHER
                         We're leaving from Adam's. Come send 
                         me off.

                                     LIZ
                         Maybe.

               EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - SANTA MONICA

               BOYD, MOORE, FISHER in the middle, MICHAEL and his older 
               brother, ADAM, all in suits pose in front of Adam's brand 
               new, state of the art, Chevy Minivan while Adam's very 
               aggressive wife, LOIS, mired in domestic resentment, focuses 
               her camera.

                                     LOIS
                         Notice how clean and well-behaved 
                         they all appear, respectable members 
                         of modern society. Timmy, Adam Jr., 
                         take a good look at this...

               Adam's and Lois' kids, Timmy, 8, and Adam Jr., 10, watch 
               with Liz. (Adam Jr., in leg braces and crutches, suffers 
               from muscular dystrophy)

                                     LOIS
                         ...We will compare these before photos 
                         with whatever form of degeneration 
                         presented to us in 24 hours, no matter 
                         how low, how vile...

                                     LIZ
                         ...embarrassing, shameful...

                                     LOIS
                         ...regression of Modern Man to his 
                         most primitive, ape-like state...

                                     LIZ
                         The stone age.

                                     LOIS
                         The post-Vegas Man.

                                     LIZ
                         A mutant species.

                                     LOIS
                         Okay boys, smile!

               Lois clicks off photos of the men.

                                     LOIS
                         All right. As you were.

               The guys break. Fisher goes to Liz.

                                     LIZ
                         Will you please call the chair people?

                                     FISHER
                         I will.

                                     LIZ
                         Do you love me?

                                     FISHER
                         Of course.

                                     LIZ
                         Just call and let me know that your 
                         okay.

                                     FISHER
                         I love you.

                                     LIZ
                         Have a nice bachelor party.

               Adam kisses Lois and the kids goodbye. Adam Jr. nearly looses 
               his balance in the excitement, Adam catches him.

               Boyd starts to get in the drivers seat.

                                     ADAM
                         Not on your life.

               Boyd slides over shotgun, cranks the MUSIC. Fisher's the 
               last one in. He slides the big Minivan door shut and they're 
               off.

               Adam looks in the rearview mirror, Lois, Liz, Timmy wave 
               goodbye. Adam Jr. waves one of his crutches.

               EXT. HWY - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY

               The minivan cruises east: from Santa Monica; through downtown 
               Los Angeles; and the City of Industry. At the turn off, a 
               freeway sign reads; "Las Vegas 385 miles."

               INT. MINIVAN - LATER

                                     BOYD
                         You're a fucking moron.

                                     MICHAEL
                         It's my fucking opinion.

                                     ADAM
                         It's really a stupid opinion. You 
                         have developed an annoying habit of 
                         talking for what seems to be no other 
                         reason than to hear yourself speak.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Because my opinion threatens yours, 
                         it's poorly developed?

                                     ADAM
                         No, because your opinions are idiotic 
                         and have nothing to do with what any 
                         given conversation is about, which 
                         makes 85% of your eagerly injected 
                         thought process highly offensive to 
                         me.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Boyd brought up divorce statistics.

                                     BOYD
                         The hell I did!

                                     MICHAEL
                         The hell you didn't!

                                     BOYD
                         The hell I did!

                                     MICHAEL
                         You said one in two marriages end in 
                         divorce.

                                     BOYD
                         I never heard that.

                                     FISHER
                         You said that Boyd.

                                     BOYD
                         Well, I didn't mean it.

                                     MICHAEL
                         You're an asshole Adam.

                                     ADAM
                         You're an asshole.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Oh, and why am I an asshole?

                                     ADAM
                         Multiple reasons.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Name one.

                                     ADAM
                         I don't have to...

                                     FISHER
                         SHUT UP!

               DEAD SILENCE. As they ride through the lifeless desert, Fisher 
               dials his cell phone.

                                     FISHER

                         Is this Pico Party rents? Can I speak 
                         to whomever is in charge of chairs? 
                         Chairs.

               Boyd checks his watch.

                                     BOYD
                         Four hours and fifteen minutes. I 
                         can make Vegas in 3 and change.

                                     ADAM
                         I'm not getting a ticket.

                                     FISHER
                              (on cell phone)
                         Tony? This is Keith Fisher. You're 
                         doing my wedding and I'm calling 
                         about the chair situation. Yeah, 
                         I'll hold.

                                     BOYD
                         Who's up for making some real money?

                                     ADAM
                         Don't even start.

                                     BOYD
                         You want to hear me out?

                                     MICHAEL
                         Nope.

                                     BOYD
                         Moore?

                                     MOORE
                         No I don't.

                                     BOYD
                         Fish?

                                     FISHER
                         Not really.
                              (into phone)
                         Yes, the Fisher wedding chairs...

                              (no response)
                         An acquaintance friend of mine is 
                         professionally involved with a 
                         communications outfit in Denver that 
                         I just happen to know for a fact is 
                         about to be rewarded a very large, 
                         exclusive contract to rewire every 
                         state prison in Colorado. Yes sir.

               Nobody gives a fuck.

                                     FISHER
                              (into phone)
                         No, I'm holding for Tony. In chairs. 
                         Keith Fisher. Okay.

                                     BOYD
                         That would translate to government 
                         guaranteed contract in excess of 35 
                         million dollars.

                         out.

                         That's the whole point. They rarely 
                         work out. But on occasion they do. 
                         And when they do, they do big.

                         Right! That's exactly what I'm saying. 
                         My father said, first of all, I'm 
                         your father not your friend. I'm 
                         your father.

                         Then fuck what your father said, 
                         cause I'm gonna tell you right now... 
                         You'll know what it's all about, why 
                         you got married and why you love her

                         catching a corner of her face, like 
                         a sleeping angel. And her hair smells 
                         sweet and she's your's. She's all 
                         your's. Do you see where I'm going

                         who wish bad bad things for you and 
                         your people. For thousands of years 
                         the Jews are fighting everybody. It 
                         used to be they'd throw rocks, then 
                         the iron revolution and they would 
                         attack with spears. Then the gunpowder 
                         revolution. Now they're shooting 
                         fire power back and forth, all day 
                         bullets flying, babies getting shot.

                                     MICHAEL
                         What's your point?

                                     BOYD
                         Now if I'm the King of Israel and 
                         all these sand niggers are armed to 
                         the gills and you know it's just a 
                         matter of time... right? Am I right?

                                     MICHAEL
                         The Israelis can protect themselves. 
                         They got the Mossad thing happening. 
                         Mossad's for real, man. They scalp 
                         babies.

                                     BOYD
                         There's my point exactly.

                                     MICHAEL
                         What? What's your point?

                                     BOYD
                         Take Mexico.

                                     MICHAEL
                         What?

                                     BOYD
                         Look up the chickens, dig up the 
                         holy dirt, pack up the wailing crying 
                         wall thing they bang their heads on 
                         all day long, stick it all on a big 
                         fucking tug boat. The whole country 
                         picks up and takes Mexico.

               ANGLE ON

               MOORE crazed with the rhythm of the "Chemical Brothers," 
               jumps up and down on the table.

               ON BALCONY

               Fisher and Adam power shooting Tequila.

                                     FISHER
                         The bucks gonna stop right here.
                              (pounds his chest)
                         If my son doesn't know the six New 
                         England states, if he has trouble 
                         with geography, I won't stick it in 
                         his face. I'll help the little guy. 
                         I'll put him in the car and take him 
                         out there. I'll take him to Maine 
                         for a big Lobster dinner, go skiing 
                         in Vermont, hot dogs at Yankee 
                         Stadium... I won't stare him down.

                                     ADAM
                         Don't ever stare him down.

                                     FISHER
                         I won't do it.

                                     ADAM
                         Don't eyeball your kids.

               MOORE

               On the coffee table, dances the beasty dance.

               THE BAR

                                     BOYD
                         The Mexicans would love it. They're 
                         dying for a little order down there. 
                         They need direction.

                                     MICHAEL
                         They need leadership.

                                     BOYD
                         That's what I'm saying. Let the 
                         Israelis straighten it up. They got 
                         plenty of room down there, number 
                         one. Plus, and this is just a plus, 
                         they kind of look alike -- the Jews 
                         and the Mexicans. So I think on a 
                         whole your average Joe Mexican is 
                         gonna have less of a problem getting 
                         his head around the whole assimilation 
                         thing. Am I right?

               The DOOR BELL RINGS.

                                     ADAM
                         I tell mine that they're little men. 
                         I tell them they're strong. They 
                         make me feel joy. I let 'em know. So 
                         they really know that I need them 
                         just as much. You know. Just as much 
                         man. And you know, you're their 
                         godfather...

                                     FISHER
                         I know and I'm honored...

                                     ADAM
                         If anything ever happens to me...

                                     FISHER
                         I know...

                                     ADAM
                         Y'see? That's the real point here. 
                         That's what I'm driving for, when 
                         the big storm comes and knocks down 
                         all the forests and the rocks fall 
                         down and the leave's are bare. What's 
                         left? The little trees, the little 
                         fellas that the storm didn't see. 
                         The tiny little...

               Moore is on the balcony.

                                     MOORE
                         The stripper's here.

                                     ADAM
                              (bombed)
                         Excellent.

               He and Fisher stagger aside.

               HOTEL SUITE

               Boyd introduces TINA, a devastatingly sexy Asian girl, to 
               all the boys.

                                     BOYD
                         Gentlemen, this is Tina.

               The guys, wasted, attempt to greet Tina.

                                     TINA
                         Who's the lucky groom?

               The guys point at Fisher, roaring. Tina presses her lips to 
               Fisher's ear.

                                     TINA
                         Hi Fisher.

               Boyd dims the lights, cranks up the MUSIC as the guys stumble 
               for position on and around the couch. Tina starts to move, 
               very sexy.

               Michael tokes a joint.

                                     MICHAEL
                         God, I love women.

               TINA'S DANCE MONTAGE

               SERIES OF SHOTS:

               TINA dances, slowly peeling off her clothes.

               The guys are into it. Michael seems especially turned-on.

               Tina moves in on Fisher, starts a very nasty lap dance... 
               somehow incorporating a rubber hose.

               The guys hoop and holler...

               Michael is mesmerized...

               Tina grinds on Fisher's lap, touching her nipples...

               Michael's going crazy... He tries to touch her, she slaps 
               his hand away...

               Fisher can't take it anymore...

               Tina relents... moves on...

               Michael reaches for her leg like a dog in heat.

               She passes over him, teasing, tormenting him, and settles 
               onto Adam's lap.

               The guys roar in approval... Michael glowers...

               Adam turns bright red as Tina arouses and rides him...

               Michael starts to burn...

               The guys egg Tina on, she gets off on Adam's shyness, rubs 
               her breasts in his face...

               The guys are howling...

               Tina sucks one of Adam's fingers into her mouth...

               Michael looks like he's going to explode...

               Adam's overwhelmed, he politely bails out...

                                     BOYD
                              (whispers to Fish)
                         She's all your's Fish. Anything you 
                         want. Happy bachelor party.

                                     FISHER
                         I can't.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (jumps up)
                         I'll take a ride.

                                     FISHER
                         Go for it.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (to Tina)
                         Come on.

                                     TINA
                              (to Boyd)
                         You said just dancing.

                                     BOYD
                              (re: money)
                         I'll take good care of you.

                                     TINA
                              (dead flat; re: Michael)
                         With him.
                              (beat)
                         Lucky me.

               Michael moves in on Tina. Hesitantly, she leads him into the 
               master bedroom.

                                     MOORE
                         She's fucking hot!

                                     ADAM
                         I need a drink.

                                     BOYD
                         Tequila...

               Boyd reaches for the bottle as the beat goes on.

               HOTEL SUIT - MONTAGE

               Distorted, a bit crooked. MUSIC and DIALOGUE constantly 
               changing levels. We're not sure who's saying what. We're not 
               sure of physical geography. The one thing we are sure of is 
               that MICHAEL is fucking the hell out of Tina in the bathroom.

               SERIES OF SHOTS:

               MASTER BATHROOM:

               FISHER and ADAM, wildly high.

               BOYD sprays beer on Adam, who returns fire. Drunk they start 
               wrestling, throwing each other around the room, knocking 
               over furniture.

               BATHROOM:

               Michael, tightly, ties Tina's hands behind her back with her 
               rubber hose.

                                     TINA
                         Oh come on.

                                     MICHAEL
                         I want to play.

                                     TINA
                         It's gonna cost extra.

                                     MICHAEL
                         I will pay.

               SUITE:

               Fisher spraying beer all over Adam and Boyd as they knock a 
               table over and end up tangled and brawling on the floor.

               Michael screwing the hell out of Tina.

               SLOW MOTION INTERCUT:

               SUITE:

               Moore wildly leaps from the couch to the chair, to another 
               chair, back to the couch...

               BATHROOM:

               Michael plows like a monster into Tina, hands tied behind 
               her back...

               CLOSE ON her stiletto heels, digging into the marble floor... 
               One of her heels breaks... she starts to slip...

               SUITE:

               Moore jumps, misses the chair, falling down on the glass 
               coffee table, GLASS EXPLODES...

               BATHROOM:

               Tina falls, Michael reaches too late, she can't break her 
               fall with her hands tied behind her... she's going down...

               SUITE:

               Moore falls through the shattered glass, to the floor...

               BATHROOM:

               Tina hits her head hard on the porcelain toilet...

               SUITE:

               Fisher, Adam, and Boyd stop brawling, stare down at Moore 
               covered in glass.

                                     MOORE
                              (beat)
                         Cool.

               Moore is fine, not even a scratch. The guys break into ROARING 
               LAUGHTER, completely HYSTERICAL; shaking, roaring, releasing. 
               TIGHT SHOTS of each HOWLING until...

               One by one... they sober up... looking O.C.

               TIGHT ON FISHER as his smile slowly fades to confusion, he 
               stares O.C. at...

               MICHAEL

               Standing in the door, face ghost white, blood dripping from 
               his fingers...

                                     MICHAEL
                         I really fucked up.

               INT. BATHROOM

               The guys rush in. Stop dead in their tracks.

               TINA

               On the floor, legs twisted underneath her, lies growing in a 
               growing puddle of dark blood. SILENCE as the guys stare,

                                     ADAM
                         Don't touch her. Call 911.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (in shock)
                         I was just playing... we were playing 
                         just playing around.

                                     ADAM
                              (examines Tina)
                         She's dead.

                                     FISHER
                         No... No.

                                     MOORE
                         How do you know she's dead.

                                     ADAM
                         She's got no fucking pulse.

                                     BOYD
                         You don't know what you're doing.

               Boyd pushes Adam out of the way. Starts feeling her pulse.

                                     BOYD
                              (not getting anything)
                         Where do you look? What side of the 
                         neck?

                                     MOORE
                         Left side.

                                     ADAM
                         Either side you idiot. I'm calling 
                         911.

                                     FISHER
                              (semi-gone)
                         What happened? Oh my God...

                                     MICHAEL
                         We were playing... she slipped... 
                         she hit her head.

                                     ADAM
                              (incredulous)
                         Playing?

               SUITE

               Adam moves into the living room, heads for the phone. Boyd 
               intercepts him. They wrestle for the phone.

                                     BOYD
                         Wait!

                                     ADAM
                         What?

                                     BOYD
                         What are you doing?

                                     ADAM
                              (hysterical)
                         What are you talking about?

                                     BOYD
                         What do you think you are doing?

                                     ADAM
                         I'm calling the ambulance.

                                     BOYD
                         Just wait a second. Wait one second. 
                         Okay. What are you doing?

                                     ADAM
                         Calling the ambulance.

                                     BOYD
                         Why?
                              (beat)
                         Why? She's dead. Why are you calling 
                         an ambulance?

               A reasonable point. BEAT.

                                     ADAM
                         We have to call the ambulance.

                                     BOYD
                         Why?

               Fisher entering, freaked...

                                     FISHER
                         Oh, Jesus... call the police.

                                     BOYD
                         No.

                                     FISHER
                         She's dead. Call somebody!

                                     BOYD
                         Shut up.

                                     FISHER
                         Call 911.

                                     BOYD
                         Shut up.

                                     MICHAEL
                         She slipped.

                                     ADAM
                              (attacking Michael)
                         What did you do?

                                     MICHAEL
                              (defensive)
                         You never heard of accidents?! Get 
                         off me!

               Adam slaps Michael. Moore tries to break it up.

                                     BOYD
                         Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!

               SILENCE.

                                     BOYD
                         Listen to me. Please. Everybody just 
                         calm down a bit here. Okay... First... 
                         are we sure she's dead?

                                     ADAM
                         Her head's bashed in and her heart 
                         isn't beating.

                                     MOORE
                         She's dead.

                                     MICHAEL
                         It was an accident!

                                     BOYD
                         Are you sure this was an accident?

                                     ADAM
                         You're a lying deviant. What did you 
                         do?!

                                     MICHAEL
                         The floor was wet. She slipped!

                                     ADAM
                         Why was the floor wet?

                                     MICHAEL
                         I don't know why the floor was wet!

                                     ADAM
                         Why?!

               Fisher wanders back to the bathroom door where Moore is; 
               they stare down at Tina as the conversation rages in the 
               b.g.

                                     BOYD
                         Stop it! Listen to me. Let's just 
                         take a second here and take hold of 
                         the situation, OK? Let's just review 
                         our options here.

                                     ADAM
                         We have a dead woman bleeding all 
                         over the bathroom. What options? 
                         Call the police.

                                     BOYD
                         Call the police. Okay, that's one 
                         option.

                                     ADAM
                         That is not an "option." There is no 
                         multiple choice here.

                                     BOYD
                         Yes sir, there sure is an option 
                         here. There are always options.

               ON Fisher and Moore.

                                     MOORE
                         I've never seen a dead person.

               As Moore moves in, transfixed, to take a closer look...

                                     FISHER
                              (enraged)
                         Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!

                                     BOYD
                         Well we can definitely call the 
                         police. That's an easy call. If we 
                         call the police... What happens?
                              (silence)
                         They find a dead prostitute in the 
                         bathroom... They ask us... What 
                         happened? We say, ah... our friend, 
                         Michael...
                              (to Adam)
                         Your brother... got a little out of 
                         control... they were making love... 
                         and he got a little excited... and 
                         he, ah, sort of beat her head into 
                         the side of a toilet, while he choked 
                         her to death with a rubber hose...

                                     ADAM
                         Stop it!

                                     BOYD
                         There's more.

                                     ADAM
                         Just stop.

                                     BOYD
                         Just giving the facts.

                                     ADAM
                         I'm calling the police.

                                     BOYD
                         What were we doing officer? Why didn't 
                         we help her? Well... we're all a bit 
                         high, you know, bachelor party, that 
                         kind of thing. Fisher here is getting 
                         married in three days... Beautiful 
                         wife... he didn't have anything at 
                         all to do with it... It was all 
                         Michael here... just Michael...

                                     ADAM
                         You don't play games with Homicide 
                         police. There are no options here. 
                         There is not the luxury of worrying 
                         about how the fallout will settle.

                                     BOYD
                         I've known him for while maybe twenty 
                         years kind of a close friend but hey 
                         what the heck officer, take him away, 
                         go on it's for his own good.

                                     FISHER
                              (outraged)
                         What are you talking about? Adam's 
                         right. We don't have a choice here 
                         Boyd... I mean what are you talking 
                         about? What options???

                                     BOYD
                              (calm)
                         Bury her out in the desert.

                                     ADAM
                              (sarcastic)
                         Sure, why not.

                                     MOORE
                         He's right.

                                     BOYD
                         We can take her out to Red Rock. 
                         Find some quiet place... and put her 
                         in the ground.

                                     ADAM
                         You don't just casually walk out of 
                         a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.

                                     BOYD
                         We can do this. We can get her out 
                         of here.

                                     ADAM
                         Have you completely lost your mind? 
                         So you get her out of here. So you 
                         get her out into the desert somehow, 
                         without anybody seeing, so what, you 
                         don't think at some point somebody 
                         might notice that she's gone?

                                     BOYD
                         Nobody knows she's here. I called 
                         her personally. Nobody knows.

                                     FISHER
                         Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody 
                         must know she's here.

                                     BOYD
                         Nobody knows.

               PAUSE, as the guys digest this point.

                                     ADAM
                         Her blood is all over the bathroom. 
                         I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.

                                     BOYD
                         It's a marble floor, we can clean it 
                         up.

                                     FISHER
                         Oh God. This is insane.

                                     BOYD
                         What's insane is the fact that Michael 
                         here put a fucking girl's head through 
                         a toilet. That's insane.

                                     MOORE
                         They'll get us on accessory to murder.

                                     ADAM
                         Bullshit it's not accessory. I didn't 
                         do shit. You call the cops, you 
                         explain it was an accident...

                                     BOYD
                         Her fucking head was caved in.

                                     ADAM
                         So! I didn't fucking do it!

                                     BOYD
                         She's got bondage burns on her wrists. 
                         There's blow all over the room, Moore 
                         looks like he went at it with a 
                         mountain lion. This room looks like 
                         the Manson Family stayed here a month. 
                         Michael goes down, we all go down.

                                     MOORE
                         I'm not going to ruin my life over a 
                         dead whore.

                                     ADAM
                         That's a horrible ugly comment. "Dead 
                         whore?" She's a person!

                                     FISHER
                              (falling away)
                         I'm getting married...

                                     MICHAEL
                         I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

                                     ADAM
                         I've got a wife and two boys.

               Fisher shuffles to a corner, collapses, head in hands. 
               SILENCE.

                                     BOYD
                              (unflappably calm)
                         Lets take a vote. A simple vote. Two 
                         choices; we clean up the mess. Right 
                         now. Bury it in the desert, go home, 
                         and never look back. Or, we can call 
                         the police... Open those doors, roll 
                         the dice and hope that it's only 
                         Michael who falls. Let's take a vote. 
                         Desert... or police?

               BOYD looks around. BEAT. Raises his hand.

                                     BOYD
                         Desert.

               He looks at MOORE.

                                     MOORE
                              (beat)
                         Fucking desert.

               MICHAEL

                                     MICHAEL
                              (to Fisher)
                         Fish, I'm really sorry. I just... I 
                         owe you man.
                              (puts up his hand)
                         Desert.

               All eyes on FISHER, no response.

                                     BOYD
                         Nobody knows she's here.

                                     FISHER
                         Good God... Good God...

               All eyes on ADAM. He takes a while... Finally,

                                     ADAM
                         How do we get her out of here?

               A reasonable question. Boyd thinks. BEAT.

                                     BOYD
                         Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the 
                         car around to the back of the hotel, 
                         throw her off the balcony, put her 
                         in the car... Done.

                                     ADAM
                              (beat)
                         You don't think someone will have a 
                         problem with a body being thrown off 
                         a balcony?

                                     BOYD
                         We check out the area and wait for a 
                         time when it's clear.

                                     ADAM
                         What about the blood?

                                     BOYD
                         Someone goes to Walmart, gets some 
                         buckets, brushes, mops, Spic and 
                         Span, the works.

                                     ADAM
                         Have you ever done this before?

                                     BOYD
                         The reality is, you take away the 
                         horror of this situation, take away 
                         the tragedy of the death, take away 
                         the moral and ethical implications 
                         of all the crap you have had 
                         conditioned, beaten, into your head 
                         since grade one. What are we left 
                         with? What? A 115 lb. problem. 115 
                         lbs. that must be moved from point A 
                         to point B. Now, a straight line in 
                         the shortest distance but we are 
                         denied the luxury of a visible 
                         straight line. But that line exists 
                         and I see it. I see that line. Trust 
                         me. Adam. Trust me... I can take 
                         care of this.

               KNOCK KNOCK

               The five men stop breathing. Somebody's at the door.

               KNOCK KNOCK

               Stunned silence. The guys stare at each other in horror.

                                     RALPH (O.S.)
                         Hello? Is anyone in there?

               Boyd races to the door, eyes the peephole.

               BOYD'S POV, through the peephole, outside in the hall, a 
               man. RALPH, early 30's, fairly unassuming.

                                     BOYD
                              (calls out)
                         What is it?

                                     RALPH (O.S.)
                         Ah, yeah, hi. Is Tina there?

               Adam throws his head in his hands.

                                     BOYD
                              (through door)
                         What?

                                     RALPH (O.S.)
                         I'm with Tina. Is she there?

               Boyd indicates to the guys to be cool.

                                     BOYD
                         She's not here.

                                     RALPH (O.S.)
                         Where is she?

                                     BOYD
                         She's here. She's just... Hold on a 
                         second.

               Boyd turns as the guys freak. Crazed bits of panicked 
               conversation -- GIBBERISH.

               KNOCK KNOCK.

                                     RALPH (O.S.)
                         Could you open the door please.

               Boyd moves back to the door, slowly, opens it. Ralph steps 
               in. Takes a good look around.

               RALPH'S POV of the fairly destroyed hotel room and five 
               severely traumatized men.

                                     RALPH
                         Okay. Hi.

               SILENCE.

                                     RALPH
                         So who's the lucky guy?

               PAUSE.

                                     BOYD
                         Who?

                                     RALPH
                         The groom?

                                     FISHER
                         Me.

                                     RALPH
                         Cool...
                              (beat)
                         You all dudes from L.A.?

                                     BOYD
                         Yup.

                                     RALPH
                         Doing the bachelor party thing?

                                     BOYD
                         That's right.

                                     RALPH
                         Sin City. Devil's Playground. The 
                         Black Bitch. All day every day.
                              (beat)
                         Where's Tina?

                                     BOYD
                         She's in the bathroom... she's still 
                         working.

                                     RALPH
                         She's still working?

                                     BOYD
                         That's right.

                                     RALPH
                         Sweet deal.

               SILENCE. Ralph checks the rest of the guys. Some strange eye 
               contact. Extremely uncomfortable.

                                     RALPH
                         Is everything okay?

                                     BOYD
                         Great. Fine. Perfect.

               More SILENCE.

                                     RALPH
                              (indicating bathroom)
                         I'm gonna just tell her I'm waiting.

               He starts for the bathroom.

                                     BOYD
                         She's in there!

                                     RALPH
                         I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.

               And Ralph is on his way to the bathroom. And the guys are 
               freaking as Ralph moves through the bedroom up towards the 
               bathroom. Hand on door -- opening door -- stepping in -- and 
               Ralph sees Tina.

               RALPH, in shock, staring, back-peddles...

                                     RALPH
                         My God!

               As Ralph starts to turn --

                                     FISHER (O.S.)
                         No! NOOOO!!!

               ON BOYD -- his Boy Scout knife raised above his head -- 
               driving it into Ralph's neck!

               MAJOR ARTERIAL SPRAY as Ralph's jugular is severed. Ralph 
               struggles. Boyd wrestles him back toward the bathroom.

                                     BOYD
                         Help me! Don't let him bleed on the 
                         carpet!

               And MOORE is there. Helping Boyd wrestle the SCREAMING 
               thrashing Ralph into the bathroom. Ralph fights like a gilled 
               Marlin. They shove him into the bathroom. Boyd slams the 
               door shut. Holds it tight as Ralph tries to force it back 
               open.

                                     BOYD
                         He'll bleed out! He'll bleed dry. 
                         Help me hold the door.

               And help they do. Michael, Moore and Adam all hold the door 
               shut as Ralph continues to fight for his life. Slowly the 
               force of his POUNDING eases. We hear Ralph slowing down... 
               The thrashing slows... softer... The MOANS quiet... softer... 
               Just a slight GURGLE... Ralph is going... going... Ralph is 
               gone.

               AT THE DOOR

               Eight hands slowly peel off the bathroom door. Devastating 
               SILENCE as the guys attempt to process this, the latest of 
               developments... with Fisher staring, blotto.

               INT. THE BATHROOM

               The door slowly opens. Boyd first -- then the rest of the 
               guy's heads slowly appear in the doorway.

                                     MOORE
                         Oh God.

               And Moore is out the door, racing for a garbage can to relieve 
               himself.

               THE GUYS' POV

               An absolute blood bath. The walls are covered with Ralph's 
               arterial spray. Tina lies, still dead on her side. Ralph has 
               somehow "assumed the position" dead, head in the bathtub. A 
               bizarre and gruesome sight. Boyd surveys the carnage, takes 
               charge.

                                     BOYD
                              (with military 
                              precision)
                         All right people. New plan. Not even 
                         a new plan so much as a modification 
                         of the old plan.

                                     FISHER
                              (beyond shock)
                         I'm calling the police.

                                     BOYD
                         So help me God you touch that phone 
                         and I bury you with them.
                              (beat)
                         Surrender is no longer an option. I 
                         repeat -- It is not an option. Is 
                         there anyone who does not understand 
                         that?

               Fisher's response is to join Moore, as he searches for a 
               garbage can to puke in. Michael just stares.

                                     BOYD
                         A little gut check time fellas. A 
                         time for some serious self-
                         exploration. How do I function? For 
                         real? No more bullshit. Can I keep 
                         my cool when they bounce my bananas? 
                         When they won't play my fucking song? 
                         etc, etc. Do you get me? Do you get 
                         me?

                                     MICHAEL
                         Not really. no.

                                     BOYD
                         Not a problem. Understand not my 
                         words, but follow my orders. Follow 
                         my orders

               INT. WALMART - NIGHT

               The boys move down the isles of the massive 24 hour everything 
               store, Boyd pushes a cart, grabbing; cleaning supplies, tarp, 
               tape, giant pruning shears, etc...

                                     BOYD (V.O.)
                         We will organize, we will mobilize, 
                         we will maximize and prioritize.

               Moore grabs a plastic garbage can off a shelf and pukes in 
               it for all he's worth.

               INT. HARD ROCK CASINO

               The boys attempt to look natural as they stroll through the 
               casino with their supplies. Late night gamblers pay them 
               little notice.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE

               Boyd turns up the MUSIC.

                                     BOYD
                         Let's do it people.

               MUSIC OVER SERIES OF SHOTS:

               Moore and Fisher scrub blood from the carpet. Fisher keeps 
               forgetting to breath.

               Michael and Boyd put Tina and Ralph in the bath tub.

               Adam sits in shock on the floor.

               Fisher and Moore try to fix a broken chair.

               Boyd starts to dismember Ralph with the pruning shears, like 
               cutting the joints of a roasted chicken.

               Adam stares at the wall.

               Michael wraps one of Ralph's feet in plastic, puts it in a 
               suitcase.

               Boyd saws. Michael wraps. Fisher and Moore clean.

               Adam slowly straightens up a lamp, begins to help.

               UNTIL -- the last of the body parts, Tina's head, is wrapped 
               in plastic, packed in a suitcase.

               The bathroom has been remarkably cleaned up. Just a bit of 
               blood left in the tub. Boyd looks pleased.

                                     BOYD
                         All right. Looking good people.

               EXT. RED ROCK CANYON ROAD

               The minivan bumps along a deserted road at a snail's pace.

               INT. MINIVAN

               Adam drives, cringing with every bump and bang. Everyone is 
               tense. Boyd eyes the clock. It's 4 a.m.

                                     BOYD
                         Sun rises at 5:52.

                                     ADAM
                         I'm not wrecking the transmission!

               EXT. DESERT

               SERIES OF SHOTS:

               The guys off-loading the suitcases.

               Fisher and Boyd digging holes.

               They start putting the suitcases in the holes.

                                     ADAM
                         Wait. Wait a minute.

                                     BOYD
                         What?

                                     ADAM
                         We can't do this.

                                     BOYD
                         We've already done this.

                                     ADAM
                         No, I mean the suitcases. We can't 
                         bury them in suitcases.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Why?

                                     ADAM
                         It's sacrilegious.

                                     BOYD
                         How do you figure?

                                     ADAM
                         According to Jewish law, the blood 
                         and limbs are considered to be part 
                         of the human being. They must be 
                         buried together or their souls won't 
                         rest in peace.

                                     BOYD
                         So that's what we're doing.

                                     ADAM
                         No we're not. The bodies are all 
                         mixed up. We can't do this to them.

                                     BOYD
                         She's Asian. They don't have Jews in 
                         Asia.

                                     ADAM
                         That is absolutely not true.

                                     BOYD
                              (beat)
                         Well what the fuck are we supposed 
                         to do?

                                     ADAM
                              (as if reasonable)
                         Open the suitcases, unpack the body 
                         parts and reunite the limbs.

                                     FISHER
                         No way.

                                     ADAM
                         It has to be done.

                                     BOYD
                         We have to get going.

                                     ADAM
                         I am not flexible on this.

               PAUSE.

                                     BOYD
                         Alright. Let's do it.

               The guys start breaking down the body parts, ripping open 
               cases...

                                     BOYD
                         I got her arm.

                                     MOORE
                         Here's his head.

               As the guys put limbs with bodies...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Dirt being thrown on top of the reunited bodies until they 
               are all completely buried.

               EXT. GRAVE SITE

               As the last of the dirt is packed down by Boyd. The guys 
               stare down at the grave site.

                                     BOYD
                         Now I am the last to say that we 
                         have done here is a good thing. It's 
                         not. It's not a good thing. But it 
                         was, given the circumstances, the 
                         smart play. We did what had to be 
                         done. And... well... I'm proud of 
                         us. I'm proud of each and every one 
                         of us. We performed. Under the most 
                         complex and nerve shattering of 
                         situations, we stood fast and we 
                         delivered. I feel proud.

               SILENCE.

                                     ADAM
                         We are all going straight to hell. 
                         Either hell or prison, whichever 
                         comes first.

                                     BOYD
                         Wrong. That is flat out wrong. hell 
                         is for cowards, for hypocrites who 
                         fear to live by the strength of their 
                         own convictions. This is war. Given 
                         the circumstances and given the fact 
                         that we are alive and they are not, 
                         we have chosen life over death. Two 
                         wrongs don't make a right. So our 
                         conviction and execution would only 
                         mean more death here, not less.

                                     MOORE
                         Boyd... I don't know man... It just 
                         seems to me that ever since you took 
                         Tony Robbins self-help thing... you're 
                         all fucked-up in the head.

                                     FISHER
                         I got to agree with that.

                                     BOYD
                         That is a load of shit. Personal 
                         power has nothing to do with any of 
                         this. Tony Robbins has helped me to 
                         unlock energy and see my options 
                         more clearly, yes, but to give him 
                         credit for this, for all of this... 
                         Well that's just more than the man 
                         deserves.

                                     FISHER
                         I think we should say some words 
                         over the grave.

                                     BOYD
                         What kind of words?

                                     FISHER
                         I'm talking about prayer.

                                     BOYD
                         Go ahead.

               Fisher steps to the grave, looks down.

                                     FISHER
                         Dear God... I don't know how to pray.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Just go ahead and say what's on your 
                         mind.

                                     BOYD
                         Speak from the heart my brother.

               Adam turns in disgust.

                                     ADAM
                         This is pathetic.

                                     MICHAEL
                         You're pathetic.

                                     ADAM
                              (turning on Michael)
                         What did you say?

                                     MICHAEL
                              (pointing)
                         You're not a team player.

                                     ADAM
                         Don't point at me.

                                     MICHAEL
                         You never were a team player. That's 
                         why you never had any friends.

                                     ADAM
                         I have plenty of friends.

                                     MICHAEL
                         The hell you do.

                                     ADAM
                         The hell I don't.

                                     MICHAEL
                         You have acquaintances -- business 
                         friends and superficial golf buddies. 
                         You have always been a fringe player. 
                         You have some serious male on male 
                         intimacy problems.

                                     ADAM
                         What are you fucking talking about?

               Michael looks at Boyd.

                                     FISHER
                         Michael, now is probably not the 
                         best time for this.

                                     BOYD
                         No, this is the perfect time. This 
                         is real time. Adam. Your brother and 
                         I, as well as several others present, 
                         have always suspected that you...
                              (points to Adam)
                         ...are a fully repressed, living in 
                         major denial, locked down, fly-boy 
                         butt-fucker.

               DEAD SILENCE. Adam stares stupefied at Boyd, then Michael. 
               Finally, Fisher says his prayer.

                                     FISHER
                         Dear God, please forgive us for what 
                         we have done here tonight. We have 
                         lost our way. Speaking for myself, 
                         let me say...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MINIVAN - DRIVING

               Fisher's prayer over the guys driving home. Each lost in his 
               own thoughts.

                                     FISHER (V.O.)
                         ...I am deeply in love with the woman 
                         I am about to marry and I look very 
                         much forward to raising a family and 
                         being a positive member of society. 
                         We promise, if you forgive us, we 
                         will never forget this tragedy and 
                         will try with all our powers to use 
                         it as a daily reminder that we are 
                         here on earth to do good not evil. 
                         Let us go from this day forward with 
                         new purpose and spirit. You have 
                         given us a second chance and let us 
                         take that second chance and use it 
                         as fuel to feed our fires of 
                         productivity so that the spirits of 
                         the two we now bury live on forever 
                         in the good deeds and positive 
                         achievements we from this moment on 
                         shall make our life's work...

               Continue as the minivan disappears down the freeway, heading 
               back to Los Angeles. A freeway sign reads, "Los Angeles, 358 
               miles."

                                     FISHER (V.O.)
                         Thank you lord, and again, we ask 
                         for your forgiveness and guidance... 
                         Amen.

               EXT. CAR WASH - DAY

               Adam watches his mini-van move through the wash and rinse 
               cycle, staring, paranoid at the Mexican Towel Boy cleaning 
               the interior.

               MICHAEL tries to open a child proof bottle of Excedrin.

               BOYD plays "Mrs. Pac-man" in the corner.

               MEN'S ROOM

               Moore dry heaves for all he's worth.

               PAY PHONE

               Fisher finishes dialing, waits... Finally...

                                     LIZ (V.O.)
                         Hello.

                                     FISHER
                         Hey. It's me.

                                     LIZ (V.O.)
                         Where are you?

                                     FISHER
                         We're on our way home. I just... 
                         we're running a little late.

                                     LIZ (V.O.)
                         How late?

                                     FISHER
                         No. Just like an hour or so.

                                     LIZ (V.O.)
                         What about the chairs?

                                     FISHER
                         Okay.

                                     LIZ (V.O.)
                         What okay?

                                     FISHER
                         What!

                                     LIZ (V.O.)
                         The chairs.

                                     FISHER
                         I left a message. I think it's going 
                         to be okay.

                                     LIZ (V.O.)
                         You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?

                                     FISHER
                         No. No. I'll see you in about four 
                         hours.

               As he hangs up the phone...

                                     LIZ (V.O.)
                              (distant; unheard)
                         Do you love me?

               CLICK. Fisher, in a daze, turns and walks into right into 
               Adam who has been standing there listening. Adam doesn't 
               look so good.

                                     ADAM
                         I want you to hear me out.

                                     FISHER
                         What.

                                     ADAM
                         You and I have done nothing. You 
                         especially. We are innocent.

                                     FISHER
                         I don't think so.

                                     ADAM
                         We are. We go to the police. We tell 
                         them the truth. Now. Before they 
                         find out. Now. We save ourselves.

               The HISPANIC CAR WASH WORKER beeps the horn, Adam jumps. The 
               van is ready.

                                     BOYD
                         Let's go!

               Adam stares daggers into Fisher.

                                     ADAM
                         We save ourselves. It's our only 
                         chance.

               Adam heads back to the car, leaving Fisher alone.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

               EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - DAY

               The shiny clean minivan cruises to a stop in front of the 
               house. Adam Jr., "Little Adam," and Timmy play in the fenced 
               yard along with a couple of other kids.

               INT. MINIVAN

               Adam stops the car. The guys sit in silence as the kids 
               assault the truck, climbing all over it. Little Adam waves 
               his crutches wildly.

                                     ADAM JR.
                              (screaming)
                         Daddy's home! Daddy's home!

               Boyd addresses the fellas.

                                     BOYD
                         The past is the past. Today is the 
                         beginning of the rest of our lives.

                                     MOORE
                         Today is the best day of the rest of 
                         our lives.

                                     FISHER
                              (disgusted)
                         The first day.

                                     MOORE
                         What?

               As Lois, with camera, and Liz, come out the front door.

                                     FISHER
                              (disgusted & depressed)
                         It goes; "Today is the first day of 
                         the rest of our lives."

                                     BOYD
                         However it goes, the point is, nobody 
                         says anything to anyone ever. 
                         Right?... Right?

                                     MICHAEL
                         Right.

                                     MOORE
                         That's right.

               As the little kids put their lips up to the windows, making 
               funny faces,

                                     BOYD
                         You're goddamn right. Adam?

               Adam is silent, watching the beautiful chaos that is his 
               family.

                                     ADAM
                              (reluctant)
                         Right.

               EXT. SUBURBAN

               As the guys get out and are mauled by the hyper kids and 
               Lois and Liz.

                                     LOIS
                              (with camera)
                         Group shot. Here we go boys! Yes 
                         sir, compare and contrast time!

               She starts herding the boys into a group pose.

                                     LOIS
                         Feeling a little HUNGOVER are we? Do 
                         you kids take note?
                              (taking pictures)
                         See how pathetic Daddy and his jackass 
                         friends look?!

               Fisher makes eye contact with Liz.

                                     LIZ
                         What's the word on the chairs?

                                     FISHER
                         I'm working on it.

                                     LIZ
                         Then you'd better work on it in the 
                         car. We gotta go see the Judge.

               INT. JUDGE'S OFFICE

               ON JUDGE LAUREL TOWER.

                                     JUDGE TOWER
                         We don't say "love, honor and obey" 
                         anymore. And we don't say "till death 
                         do us part." Today we say, "respect, 
                         honor and cherish, as long as you 
                         both do love." How does that sound?

                                     LIZ
                         I kind of like "till death do us 
                         part." I mean, this is forever. In 
                         sickness and in health, through good 
                         times and bad. Honey, what do you 
                         think?

               Liz looks at Fisher who is a nuclear wreck, barely coherent.

                                     FISHER
                         Yea... It's great... seems like... I 
                         don't know you've got all the 
                         important stuff in there.

                                     JUDGE TOWER
                         All right then. It's refreshing to 
                         see two young people not afraid of 
                         real commitment. Will you have friends 
                         or family saying words -- singing or 
                         anything?

                                     FISHER
                              (beat)
                         Are we supposed to?

                                     JUDGE TOWER
                         It's not a question of supposed to, 
                         it's an entirely personal decision... 
                         Some do some don't.

                                     LIZ
                         We don't think so. I mean, we just 
                         want the singing when I come out.

                                     JUDGE TOWER
                         Okay great. What will that be?

                                     LIZ
                         We're just going to have the leader 
                         of the band sing alone with his 
                         guitar. Acoustic.

                                     JUDGE TOWER
                         What song?

                                     LIZ
                         "You Send Me."

                                     JUDGE TOWER
                         Oh I know that. How does it go...

                                     LIZ

                         Darling you... you send me... Darling 
                         you... You mend me.

                         Honey, sing it for Judge Tower.

               In lieu of an anxiety attack, Fisher...

                                     FISHER
                              (sings)
                         "Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, send 
                         me, Darli...ing you, ewe ewe ewe, 
                         mend me.

                         infatuation... But oh it's lasted so 
                         long..."

                         "Now I find myself wanting to marry 
                         you, marry you and take you home..."

               Judge Tower joins in and the three squeak out the chorus and 
               it's pretty pathetic.

               MUSIC OVER:

               INT. TUXEDO RENTAL STORE

               The guys are being fitted for their wedding tuxes.

               Lois takes pictures of the five groomsmen.

               Liz closely watches as the TAILOR makes adjustments to 
               Fisher's tux.

               Adam looks sick.

               EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - SUNSET

               Fisher and his dad walk along the pier eating hot dogs. A 
               father and son moment.

                                     MR. FISHER
                         I wanted to just take this final 
                         opportunity to visit with you. You 
                         know, just to be with you, father 
                         and son, before you run off and do 
                         your own husband, daddy thing.
                              (starts to choke-up)
                         I'm just so goddamn proud of you... 
                         God knows I didn't always play it 
                         right with you...

                                     FISHER
                         You did all right dad.

                                     MR. FISHER
                         I could have done it better. I'm a 
                         fucking ball-buster I am.

                                     FISHER
                         You never walked away dad. You could 
                         have walked away.

                                     MR. FISHER
                         I'm just so scared of that song. 
                         That fucking, "My son just arrived 
                         the other day... he says thanks for 
                         the ball, come on let's play. I got 
                         lots of bills come again next day. 
                         He's grown up just like me... My boy 
                         is just like me." Gordon fucking 
                         Lightfoot, Cat Stevens, whoever,

                         I love you so much it hurts. Me and 
                         your mother marvel at what you have 
                         become. You're going to have a 
                         wonderful journey with this girl. I 
                         feel it deep inside. A wonderful, 
                         magical journey.
                              (cries again)
                         And I'm, like I said, just so proud 
                         of how you turned out. (hugs Fisher) 
                         You go out and knock 'em dead Keith. 
                         Knock 'em dead!

                         No. I said nobody knew she was coming 
                         to the hotel.

                         Don't talk to me about character.

                         Any time fat boy!

               Boyd hangs up the phone, looks at his picture on the realty 
               sign he just pounded into someone's yard. Behind the bizarre 
               sincere smile we now see the eyes of a maniac. Boyd picks up 
               the sledge hammer and swings wildly, destroying his sign, 
               splintering it into kindling.

                         I love it. I just love, love, love, 
                         love it.

                         Are you guys gonna fill this place 
                         with kids? You sure got room for

                                     LIZ
                         We're in no hurry. I think we'll 
                         take some time to enjoy each other, 
                         enjoy our freedom before we surrender 
                         ourselves to kids.

                         for ourselves, and this house...

                                     MAGGIE
                         Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big 
                         picture, take your time. I wish I 
                         had.

                                     LIZ
                         That's our plan.

                                     MAGGIE
                         Well, I just need your signature on 
                         these contracts and a deposit check 
                         so I can get the ball rolling.

               Liz looks at Fisher. She really wants the house. He takes 
               out his checkbook. Liz throws her arms around Fisher, kisses 
               him.

                                     FISHER
                         How much?

                                     MAGGIE
                         Five percent should be fine for now, 
                         which is, let's see, twenty thousand 
                         dollars. Of course I'll be splitting 
                         my commission with your friend.
                              (beat)
                         He is a very sweet man.

               Liz stares at Fisher. His hand shakes as he writes the check.

               EXT. GAS STATION MINI-MART

               Adam, Lois and the kids pull into the mini-mart, up to the 
               gas pump.

               INT. ADAM'S MINI-VAN

               Adam, ghost white, fumbles for a credit card as the kids go 
               nuts in the back seat.

                         They're singing.

               A black sedan, looking like an unmarked police car, pulls up 
               nose-to-nose with them at the pump. TWO MEN in dark suits in 
               the front look like cops. Adam can't help but notice.

                                     ADAM
                              (getting out)
                         It's a disgusting song.

               EXT. CAR

               Adam slides his card through at the pump and starts filling 
               his tank as one of the "suits" gets out of the black sedan 
               and does the same.

               Adam and the "suit" make eye-contact.

                                     SUIT
                         How ya doing?

                                     ADAM
                              (nervous mumble)
                         What?

                                     SUIT
                         What's that?

                                     ADAM
                         What did you say?

                                     SUIT
                         I said how's it going?

                                     ADAM
                         I didn't hear you.

                                     SUIT
                         Well that's what I said.

               Adam nods, eyeing his gas pump, willing it to pump faster. 
               His heart starts to pound, he looks away, sees...

               An LAPD police car pull into the station, stops in front of 
               the mini-mart. TWO COPS inside.

               ON adam, eye-balling the cop car. He slowly turns to steal a 
               glance at the "suit."

                                     SUIT
                         How do you like that mini-van?

               Adam's tank is almost filled. He wants nothing more than to 
               get out of there...

               Lois rolls down the window.

                                     LOIS
                         Honey, go in there and get some 
                         Starbursts.

                                     ADAM
                         What?

                                     LOIS
                         They're screaming for Starbursts.

                                     ADAM
                         Later.

                                     LOIS
                         They're screaming like monsters and 
                         it's giving me a headache. Go get 
                         some fucking Starbursts.

               Adam looks from the suit to the cop car...

                                     ADAM
                         Fine.

               TRACK with Adam as he walks from the pumping across the 
               parking lot, past the cop car, his HEART POUNDING...

               INT. MINI-MART

               Adam quickly searches the candy section for Starburst. He 
               looks out the window...

               ADAM'S POV

               The "suit" has finished with the gas but he's not leaving... 
               He's taking a close look at Adam's van. He seems to be 
               checking the license plate...

                                     ADAM
                         Oh my God.

               Adam is blocking the aisle. He doesn't notice a YOUNG  
               UNIFORMED COP trying to get past.

                                     COP (O.S.)
                         Excuse me.

               Adam turns, panics, stumbles back, into the candy display 
               and topples to the ground. ADAM lies flat on his back in a 
               monster mess of candy.

                                     COP
                         You okay?

               Adam scrambles to his feet, trying frantically to fix the 
               major mess -- only making it worse. The IRANIAN STORE CLERK 
               approaches, pissed.

                                     CLERK
                         Just leave it!

                                     ADAM
                              (determined)
                         It's okay.

                                     CLERK
                         Leave it!

               Startled by his tone, Adam staggers back, into a Gatorade 
               display, slips and topples to the ground.

                                     CLERK
                         GET OUT!

                                     ADAM
                              (on his back)
                         I'm sorry.

               They young cop gives Adam a hand up. Adam stare at the cop.

                                     ADAM
                              (tears in his eyes)
                         I'm sorry.

                                     CLERK
                         GET OUT!

               Adam scurries out of the Mini-Mart, the Cop watches in 
               confusion.

               EXT. MINI-MART

               As Adam races back to his car, the "Suit" moves in on him.

                                     SUIT
                         The wife's begging me for one. How's 
                         the mileage.

               Adam jumps in the van, quickly starts it up.

                                     LOIS
                         Where's the candy?

                                     ADAM
                         There is no candy!

                                     LOIS
                         What do you mean? It's it's a goddamn 
                         Mini-Mart?!

                                     KIDS
                         Dad?!

               Adam, in a cold sweat, hauls out of the Gas Station, pulls 
               into traffic, nearly gets hit, slams on the brakes, Lois 
               rockets FACE-FORWARD into the dashboard.

               FISHER & LIZ'S REHEARSAL DINNER - COCKTAIL RECEPTION

               SERIES OF SHOTS:

               Fisher and Liz greet their guests.

               Moore smokes alone at the bar.

               Boyd and Michael charm a group of OLD LADIES.

               Adam arrives with his family, Adam Jr., Timmy and...

               Lois sporting a nose cast and two very black eyes.

               Boyd and Adam check each other out; hostile and suspicious.

               Adam takes Fisher aside.

                                     ADAM
                         Have you thought about what I said?

                                     FISHER
                         Jesus Adam, can we not get into this 
                         now please?

                                     ADAM
                         I got a migraine like a little monkey 
                         kicking in the side of my skull, 
                         Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge 
                         hammer trying to crack...

                                     FISHER
                              (cuts him off)
                         I got you.

                                     ADAM
                              (dazed)
                         Where's the bathroom?

               INT. REHEARSAL DINNER - NIGHT

               A large dining room in a Westside restaurant has been taken 
               over by the wedding party. Seventy-five guests, dressed up, 
               are into the desserts. The toasts are about halfway over.

               MR. FISHER stands in the middle of the room with the large 
               blown-up pictures of Keith at different stages of his life.

                                     MR. FISHER
                              (holding picture of 
                              Keith, age 4, on a 
                              mule)
                         And this is Keith at age four and 
                         his best friend "Bunker the Mule." 
                         Evidently, when they were in camp, 
                         Keith and Boyd got into some serious 
                         arguments over exactly who was Keith's 
                         best friend -- Boyd or the mule.

               Mr. Fisher holds up a photo of a young Fisher and young Boyd, 
               both scrappy and bloodied from a fist fight.

               Boyd sits with Moore at a table.

                                     BOYD
                         Fisher had a less than normal 
                         relationship with that Donkey.

                                     FISHER
                              (seated next to Liz)
                         You always were a jealous man.

               Mr. Fisher holds up a picture of Keith, Boyd, Moore and 
               Michael all in a Peewee Football uniforms.

                                     MR. FISHER
                         After camp came football, and for 
                         those of you not following the sports 
                         pages back in 1977, you might not 
                         remember the Peewee Powerhouse 
                         Oklahoma, who, under the brilliant 
                         leadership of your's truly, rolled 
                         to an auspicious league record of 0-
                         12 scoring exactly zero touchdowns.

               TIGHT ON Adam, looking extremely uncomfortable, surrounded 
               by his family.

                                     MICHAEL
                         The problem was coaching. Poor 
                         leadership.

               As the room LAUGHS, Adam becomes visibly upset. Not keeping 
               it together.

                                     BOYD
                         The problem was our quarterback had 
                         trouble remembering his right from 
                         left...

                                     FISHER
                         No, the problem, as I recall, was 
                         the lack of blocking...

               As the guys debate, in front of the room, who's fault 
               Oklahoma's 0-12 season really was.

               TIGHT ON Adam. He's had enough, excuses himself from the 
               table.

               TIGHT ON Fisher, seeing Adam, he quietly excuses himself.

               EXT. BEACH RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               Adam stands by his car trying to compose himself. Fisher 
               approaches.

                                     FISHER
                         You all right?

                                     ADAM
                         I can't fucking breathe. I'm sorry.

               Boyd, followed by Michael exits the restaurant.

                                     BOYD
                              (approaching)
                         OK. Definitely not cool! Definitely 
                         inappropriate behavior here.

                                     FISHER
                         Shut up Boyd.

                                     BOYD
                         Negative. This is not what we have 
                         worked out in terms of presented 
                         behavior.

                                     FISHER
                         He's having a problem here.

                                     MICHAEL
                         What's the problem Adam?

               Moore joins the group.

                                     MOORE
                         What's the problem?

               All eyes on Adam, who's eyes are starting to tear up.

                                     BOYD
                         What is your problem?

                                     ADAM
                         I can't do this.

               PAUSE.

                                     MOORE
                         Can't do what?

                                     ADAM
                         We're gonna get caught. I know we're 
                         gonna get caught. They were eyeballing 
                         my car.

                                     BOYD
                         What?

                                     ADAM
                         At the seven-eleven.

                                     BOYD
                         Who? What are you talking about?

                                     ADAM
                         They're on me. They're smoking me 
                         out!

                                     BOYD
                              (shouts)
                         Nobody's smoking anybody out.

                                     FISHER
                         Shut up.

                                     MOORE
                         Quiet.

               Liz is at the door of the restaurant.

                                     LIZ
                         Keith? Is everything okay, honey?

               Fisher bolts over to Liz.

                                     FISHER
                         Yeah baby. Everything's great.

                                     LIZ
                         Well, can you come back inside?

                                     FISHER
                              (not moving)
                         Yeah. Sure.

                                     LIZ
                         Now?

                                     FISHER
                         Yeah. Look honey, I'll be right in. 
                         I just... we're just taking care of 
                         some Groomsmen last minute business.

               Mr. Fisher approaches.

                                     MR. FISHER
                         Everything okay?

                                     FISHER
                         Yeah, Dad. It's great.

                                     MR. FISHER
                         Well, I'm in the middle of my goddamn 
                         toast here.

                                     FISHER
                         OK, OK. You guys just go back in. 
                         Dad, keep going with the toast, we'll 
                         be right in. Go on.

               Fisher ushers his father and Liz back inside, then turns, to 
               quickly head back to the parking lot where things are 
               escalating.

               PARKING LOT

                                     BOYD
                              (on Adam)
                         You got some mighty fucking fine bad 
                         timing Adam. We got a rehearsal 
                         situation here.

                                     ADAM
                         I don't give a damn.

                                     MICHAEL
                         About anybody but yourself. You never 
                         have.

                                     ADAM
                         And you're a little fucking reject.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Eat my ass!

               MICHAEL KICKS ADAM'S MINIVAN

                                     ADAM
                         Hey!

               Michael kicks it again, harder. Adam shoves him.

                                     ADAM
                         If you ever touch my minivan again, 
                         I'll make you sorry. Real sorry.

                                     MICHAEL
                         You're a loser.

                                     ADAM
                         You're the loser! A big black hole 
                         sucking up everything you touch! YOU 
                         MURDERED THAT GIRL! MURDERER! 
                         MURDERER!

                                     MICHAEL
                         You're the loser! You think your 
                         shit's so fucking righteous! FUCK 
                         YOU! You were there with us, boy! 
                         Right there! SIDE BY FUCKING SIDE!!!

                                     FISHER
                         Shut up!

                                     BOYD
                         Shut your fucking mouths!!!

               Boyd and Fisher separate the brothers.

                                     ADAM
                              (freaking)
                         I didn't do anything! I'll turn your 
                         pathetic ass in!

                                     BOYD
                         Adam! Calm down.

                                     ADAM
                         I won't calm down. I can't do this. 
                         We can't do this. It won't work. It 
                         will not work.

                                     BOYD
                         It has worked.

                                     ADAM
                         I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber 
                         optics, search parties, they got 
                         infrared scanners, FBI scientists. 
                         They figure this shit out. They always 
                         figure it out.

                                     BOYD
                         They won't figure it out.

                                     ADAM
                         I got children. I've got a life.

                                     MICHAEL
                         You got a retarded kid and a fat pig 
                         wife.

                                     ADAM
                         You fucking bastard!

               Adam attacks Michael, slashing, biting, mauling, the brother's 
               go down hard, slugging it out on the ground.

               EXT RESTAURANT

               Liz is back at the restaurant door.

                                     LIZ
                         Keith?!

               Fisher bolts over to Liz.

                                     FISHER
                         Everything's OK. Just some more 
                         preparations.

                                     LIZ
                         Are they fighting?

                                     FISHER
                         No baby. We'll all be right in.

               Fisher pushes her inside and charges back to the...

               PARKING LOT

               Fisher helps break the fight. Adam and Michael try to contain 
               their rage.

                                     BOYD
                         This is going to stop right now. 
                         Right now!

                                     MICHAEL
                              (seething)
                         You will not screw this up.

                                     ADAM
                         Don't you threaten me you little rat 
                         fuck.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Don't you fucking threaten me -- 
                         I'll fucking kill you.

                                     ADAM
                         Go home!

                                     MICHAEL
                         You go home!

               Boyd pulls Michael to his car.

                                     BOYD
                         Why don't you just cool out. Go home 
                         and go to sleep.

               Boyd opens Michael's car door, puts him in.

                                     BOYD
                         Just go home, chill the fuck out. 
                         Okay?

               Michael starts his car. Boyd shuts the car door.

                                     BOYD
                         Just go home.

               MICHAEL, eyeballs Adam. Adam eyeballs him right back. Michael 
               hits the gas and screeches away.

                                     BOYD
                         All right. Let's all go back in. 
                         Adam? You're cool right?

                                     ADAM
                         No. I'm not Boyd. I am not cool at 
                         all.

               Reluctantly, they start back in.

               A hundred or so feet away, Michael's car comes to an abrupt 
               stop. They all turn. Michael turns his car around, idles for 
               a moment.

               INT. MICHAEL'S CAR

               Michael in a trance, staring at the guys watching him.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Mr. Fucking Minivan...

               He hits the gas.

               EXT PARKING LOT

               Wheels spin, rubber burns. The guys watch as Michael speeds 
               full throttle, like a battering ram, right at Adam's beloved 
               minivan.

                                     ADAM
                         NOOOO!!!!

               Adam jumps between the minivan and Michael's car.

               INT. MICHAEL'S CAR

               Michael's expression turns to horror. He slams on the brakes, 
               but it's too late.

               EXT. PARKING LOT

               Michael's car crushes Adam like a sandwich meat between his 
               car and the minivan. Metal, flesh, severed limbs, Adam 
               explodes like a gnat.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE HORRIFIED EXPRESSIONS OF BOYD, MOORE AND FISHER

               INT. UCLA EMERGENCY - WAITING ROOM

               Chaos. The room is filled with people from the Rehearsal 
               Dinner.

               Black-eyed, nose broken, LOIS sobs, surrounded by her kids 
               and Liz.

               Boyd and Fisher talk to the POLICE.

                                     BOYD
                         It was just a crazy freak accident. 
                         He thought the car was in reverse... 
                         He didn't realize.

               The COP takes notes.

               MICHAEL sits in a corner by himself. Ghost white. Trembling.

                                     COP
                         Was there some sort of an argument?

                                     FISHER
                         No. Nothing like that.

                                     COP
                         We heard there was some arguing going 
                         on. Some loud talk.

                                     BOYD
                         No. No. We were just all outside 
                         just talking.

                                     COP
                         What were you talking about?

                                     BOYD
                         The wedding. We were talking bout 
                         how it was going to be one of the 
                         last times for us to all be together 
                         with Fisher not being married...

                                     COP
                         A lot of people seem to think there 
                         was some hostility out there.

                                     BOYD
                              (getting righteous)
                         Well I can't really comment on what 
                         "a lot of people" thought. I can 
                         only tell you that we had a horrible 
                         accident here and were all feeling 
                         extremely traumatized and your 
                         questions are a bit poorly timed. 
                         We're in full on grieving mode right 
                         now thank you very much Officer... 
                         Randone.

                                     FISHER
                         Easy Boyd.

                                     BOYD
                         No easy Boyd! I got a best friend in 
                         there in pieces. How about a little 
                         sensitivity?

               Boyd storms off, goes and sits with Michael. Fisher stays 
               with the cop.

                                     COP
                         That's all I wanted to know.

               A DOCTOR appears in the doorway.

                                     DOCTOR
                         His situation is critical. He's asking 
                         to speak to his wife.

               SHOTS of the guys eyeing each other nervously as Lois slowly 
               gets up and follows the Doctor into a treatment room.

               The guys move to the door, where they can see Lois, leaning 
               over the hospital bed, talking to Adam.

               POV GUYS

               Adam hooked up to dozens of wires, etc...

               Lois leans over to kiss him. Adam appears to be whispering 
               something to her.

               ON THE GUYS

               Watching Adam speak to Lois... Nervous.

               POV GUYS

               Lois has her ear to Adam's mouth. He is clearly speaking to 
               her. Lois is sobbing when... ALARMS GO OFF IN ADAM'S ROOM.

               A MEDICAL TEAM rushes into the room. Adam is a v-tach -- 
               Heart's not beating. The team injects medicine, defribulates. 
               Lois watches in horror as her husband dies in front of her... 
               Finally a DOCTOR calls time of death.

               Lois collapses on the floor.

               WAITING ROOM

               The guys have witnessed Adam's death. Michael turns in horror. 
               Boyd, Fisher and Moore stare. Liz rushes to Fisher, throws 
               her arms around him, overcome with grief.

               INT. DENNY'S - LATE NIGHT

               Fisher, Boyd, Moore and Michael eat eggs.

                                     BOYD
                         The need to know is clear. What did 
                         Adam tell Lois? That's the name of 
                         the game. What did Adam tell Lois? 
                         What does Lois know?

                                     MICHAEL

                         You want some breakfast meat, Michael. 
                         Is that what you want?

                              (inappropriately loud)
                         Harris has lead a group of investors 
                         in the purchase of the Park Sausage 
                         Company. By taking on the challenge 
                         of resurrecting Park's, Harris is 
                         engaged in the equivalent of a sudden 
                         death overtime.

                                     BOYD
                         Easy Michael.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (on a roll)
                         He must take an open-field run to 
                         profitability through excessive debt 
                         large competitors and dwindling market 
                         share. Before the clock runs out.

               CUSTOMERS are starting to pay notice.

                                     MOORE
                         Shut up Michael.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (screams)
                         I KILLED MY BROTHER!

               All eyes on Michael. Boyd is immediately up trying to get 
               Michael out of the booth. Casually, sweetly...

                                     BOYD
                         Okay. Time to fly.

               Fisher helps Boyd lift Michael, who is becoming more and 
               more frenzied.

                                     MICHAEL
                         I ran down my brother in cold blood. 
                         Shame on me! Shame! Shame! Shame!

               WAITRESSES, COOKS and LATE NIGHT DINNERS stare, confused as 
               the HOWLING Michael is carried to the door.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (struggling)
                         Time to pay the man. "For if we 
                         confess our sins he is faithful and 
                         just, to forgive us our sins, and to 
                         cleanse us from all unrighteousness."

               Fisher and Boyd struggle with Michael.

                                     FISHER
                              (tipping Waitress)
                         Thank you.

               She watches them haul Michael outside.

               POV WAITRESS

               Michael thrashes wildly in the parking lot.

               EXT PARKING LOT

                                     MICHAEL
                         "Kill one man and you are a murderer! 
                         Kill millions and you are a conqueror -- 
                         Kill all and you are a God!"

               Michael breaks free, starts running away. Boyd, Moore and 
               Fisher give chase. Moore dives on Michael's back. Fisher 
               helps Moore hold Michael down while Boyd gets the car.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (calming down)
                         "The memory of the just is blessed 
                         but the name of the wicked shall 
                         rot."

               Boyd is there with the car. They load Michael into the back 
               seat, climb in and disappear into the night.

               INT. CAR - DRIVING

               Boyd drives, Fisher rides shotgun, Moore's in the back trying 
               to contain Michael.

                                     BOYD
                         You will get yourself together here 
                         mister. Are you hearing me?

               Michael, now catatonic, stares out the window.

                                     FISHER
                         He's cracked up.

                                     BOYD
                         He is not cracking up.

                                     FISHER
                         Boyd... What have we done?

                                     BOYD
                         What did you ask me?

                                     FISHER
                         What?

                                     BOYD
                         What is the question you asked me?

                                     FISHER
                         I said, what have we done?

                                     BOYD
                         Yes, you did. Now that is the 
                         question! That is exactly the question 
                         we should be asking ourselves. You 
                         tell me Fisher. What have we done?

                                     FISHER
                         I don't know! I just want to get 
                         married.

                                     BOYD
                         Say it again.

                                     FISHER
                         What?

                                     BOYD
                         What you just said. Say it again.

                                     FISHER
                         I just want to get married.

                                     BOYD
                         Exactly! Exactly my point.

                                     MOORE
                         What's your fucking point?

                                     BOYD
                         I'm not talking to you?

                                     FISHER
                         What's your point?

                                     BOYD
                         You want to know what you are doing 
                         here?! You are love pumping. You are 
                         protecting all that is sacred and 
                         beautiful and in sync with poetry 
                         and sunsets and little newborn babies. 
                         You are walking the walk. This is it 
                         Fisher, the real stuff. You love 
                         this woman. Love is second to nothing. 
                         I love you. I love Moore. I love 
                         Michael. This car is full of love, 
                         and nothing -- absolutely nothing -- 
                         supersedes love, man. Nothing. We 
                         will do what it takes. Whatever it 
                         takes.

               Boyd takes Fisher's head in his hands and kisses him deeply 
               on the mouth.

                                     BOYD
                         Love does not lose.

               TIGHT ON Fisher, speechless.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN ON:

               ADAM'S FUNERAL - GRAVE SITE

               A Jewish ceremony. A hundred or so guests. A RABBI conducts 
               the service. Lois sits in shock flanked by her boys.

               Michael, Fisher, Boyd and Moore stand in positions of honor 
               up front. They're all eyeing each other.

               Michael starts emitting deep, uncontrollable, highly 
               inappropriate MOANS.

                                     BOYD
                         Easy Michael.

               Michael can't control himself as his body starts to seize 
               and tremble. Moore and Boys attempt to stabilize Michael who 
               breaks away, charges over to Lois and buries his head in her 
               lap sobbing deeply. Everyone is stunned but the Rabbi 
               Continues.

               INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Liz and Fisher.

                                     LIZ
                              (hysterical)
                         Cancel?! Cancel?! Are you out of 
                         your fucking mind?!

                                     FISHER
                         Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking 
                         about modifying.

                                     LIZ
                         No way.

                                     FISHER
                         Can we just talk this out?

                                     LIZ
                         Talk what out? We are locked and 
                         loaded here. We are non-refundable. 
                         I've got relatives on the airport 
                         right now! I've got...

               The phone RINGS. Fisher freezes.

                                     LIZ
                         Answer it!

               Fisher picks up the phone.

                                     FISHER
                         Hello?

               INT. LOIS' HOUSE

               Lois on the phone, near hysteria.

                                     LOIS
                         Keith. It's Lois. I just found a 
                         note up in Adam's study. It's some 
                         kind of crazy confession about killing 
                         a stripper and cutting up bodies 
                         and...

               INT. CANTERS COFFEE SHOP

               TIGHT ON FISHER

                                     FISHER
                              (explaining)
                         ...burying them outside of Vegas, 
                         about Boyd being the ring leader... 
                         She wants to know what the hell is 
                         going on and I'm starting to freak 
                         out here.

               Boyd, Moore and Michael, looking particularly traumatized, 
               are seated at a booth with Fisher.

                                     MICHAEL
                         We're goosed.

                                     BOYD
                         We're not goosed.

                                     MOORE
                         What's goosed?

                                     BOYD
                         What is her disposition?

                                     FISHER
                         Regarding what?

                                     BOYD
                         Does she sound pissed, scared, 
                         hostile? Did she mention the police?

                                     FISHER
                         No, but she's definitely pissed and 
                         hostile. And she's clearly starting 
                         to think that's something's not right.

               Michael starts sobbing uncontrollably.

                                     MICHAEL
                         We're goosed! Goosed by God!

                                     BOYD
                         Michael get a grip.
                              (to Fisher)
                         What did you tell her?

                                     FISHER
                         I told her that I have no idea what 
                         Adam was talking about in that letter.

                                     MOORE
                         Did she believe you?

                                     FISHER
                         I have no idea.

                                     MOORE
                         You can tell when people believe 
                         you. It's obvious.

                                     FISHER
                         Well I don't have that skill and if 
                         I had to guess I would say that in 
                         no way did she believe me.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (screaming)
                         Goosed!

                                     BOYD
                         Stop it!

                                     MICHAEL
                         Goosed!

               People are staring.

                                     BOYD
                         Stop.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Goosed!

                                     BOYD
                              (to Moore)
                         Give me the Valium.

                                     MOORE
                         He just had two.

                                     BOYD
                         Give me two more.

               Moore counts out two Valium, hands them to Boyd as michael 
               continues to freak.

                                     BOYD
                              (to Michael)
                         Open sesame.

               Michael complies like a puppy.

                                     FISHER
                         Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.

                                     BOYD
                         Suck my ass.

               INT. LOIS' KITCHEN

               TIGHT ON Lois, busted nose, eyes black.

                                     LOIS
                         I never liked you Boyd. You're a 
                         snaky little fuck. Always have been.

               WIDE ON the guys, seated around a little breakfast table. 
               Michael's in a Valium stupor.

                                     BOYD
                         What are you talking about?

                                     LOIS
                         Don't sweet lip me.

                                     BOYD
                         I don't understand where this personal 
                         attack is coming from...

                                     LOIS
                         You're a liar. I want to know what 
                         happened in Vegas.

                                     BOYD
                         Nothing happened in Vegas.

                                     LOIS
                         I don't want to hear it from the 
                         liar. Stick a plug in it Boyd. Fisher? 
                         What happened in Vegas?

                                     FISHER
                              (beat)
                         Nothing happened in Vegas.

                                     LOIS
                              (not buying it)
                         Moore?

                                     MOORE
                              (sheepish)
                         Nothing happened.

               Michael starts back in with the power sobbing. All eyes are 
               on him. Guilty, uncomfortable silence. Michael's coming 
               unglued.

                                     LOIS
                         Michael? Do you have something to 
                         tell me?

                                     BOYD
                         Michael. Tell Lois that nothing...

                                     LOIS
                         Shut up Boyd! Michael?

               All eyes on Michael.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (quiet)
                         Goosed.

               Fisher struggles to breathe. Boyd tenses up.

                                     LOIS
                         What?

                                     MICHAEL
                         Lois we were bad, we were very, very 
                         bad.

                                     BOYD
                         He's upset about Adam. We're all 
                         upset.

                                     LOIS
                         I will call the police right now if 
                         I don't start getting some answers.

                                     BOYD
                         Lois please.

               She heads for the phone.

                                     LOIS
                         Fuck you Boyd.

               The guys are freaking as she picks up the phone. Boyd looks 
               at the kitchen knives. Fisher sees him, intervenes quickly...

                                     FISHER
                         Okay. Lois... here's the deal.
                              (beat)
                         Adam was with a prostitute in Las 
                         Vegas.

               Lois freezes, puts down the phone. Boyd and Moore look stunned 
               at Fisher -- good lie.

                                     LOIS
                         What?

                                     FISHER
                         I'm sorry he was unfaithful to you.

                                     BOYD
                         And it wasn't the first time... He 
                         had a thing about prostitutes.

               Fisher gives Boyd a look. Lois starts to choke up.

                                     LOIS
                              (crushed)
                         My Adam?

               Lois crumbles before their eyes.

                                     BOYD
                         We're sorry.

               Lois starts sobbing. Michael joins in. Adam Jr. and Timmy 
               appear in the door, in their pajamas, awakened by the noise. 
               Seeing their mother in tears, they start to sob. The room is 
               filled with anguished tears. Boyd give Lois a glass of water 
               and a Valium.

               EXT. LOIS' HOUSE

               Fisher and Moore load Michael into the car. Boyd leans into 
               the back window. Adam Jr. and Timmy are in the backseat, 
               still in their P.J.'s.

                                     BOYD
                         Mommy just needs a little time out. 
                         Everything's gonna be okay. Okay?
                              (the boys don't answer)
                         Okay.

               Fisher starts to get in the car, Boyd pulls him aside, very 
               wound up.

                                     BOYD
                         After you drop the kids off, take 
                         Michael home. Put a few drinks in 
                         him so he'll sleep.

                                     FISHER
                         I don't think that's such a good 
                         idea.

                                     BOYD
                         Just do it.

                                     FISHER
                         What are you going to do?

                                     BOYD
                         Take care of business.

                                     FISHER
                              (accusing)
                         What does that mean?

                                     BOYD
                         And what does that mean?
                              (off no response)
                         Are you insane?!
                              (whispers)
                         You think I would hurt Lois?! She's 
                         the mother of those kids! What is 
                         wrong with you?

                                     FISHER
                         I don't know...

                                     BOYD
                         You got a nasty side to your thought 
                         process.

                                                               TIME CUT TO:

               INT. FISHER AND LIZ'S HOUSE

               TIGHT ON Fisher.

                                     FISHER
                         I'm sorry. Honey... it's just for 
                         tonight.

               Liz is in her robe, none too pleased. Adam Jr. and Timmy sit 
               in the b.g. at the kitchen table eating cookies and milk.

                                     FISHER
                         Lois is a mess and Michael's really 
                         upset. Everyone's upset.

                                     LIZ
                         We're not canceling.

                                     FISHER
                         I know.

                                     LIZ
                         I won't even discuss it.

                                     FISHER
                         No one's discussing it. I'm just 
                         gonna run Michael home. I'll be right 
                         back.

                                     LIZ
                         I need you to pick up the cake 
                         tomorrow.

                                     FISHER
                         Don't we already have someone to do 
                         that for us?

                                     LIZ
                         Yeah. You.

                                     FISHER
                         Okay. Okay.

               Fisher kisses Liz and goes.

               INT. BAR

               Dark, smoky, MUSIC. Michael, Fisher and Moore sit in a corner 
               booth.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (finger in his ear)
                         Do you hear buzzing fish?

                                     FISHER
                         Buzzing?

                                     MICHAEL
                         Yeah. I got some kind of buzzing. 
                         Like a zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz thing just 
                         chipping away in the back of my skull.

                                     FISHER
                         I don't hear it.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Yeah, well, it's a nasty problem.

                                     FISHER
                         Have another drink.

               INT. ADAM AND LOIS' HOUSE - NIGHT

               TRACKING SHOT down hallway into bedroom where Lois sleeps 
               peacefully.

               INT. BAR - NIGHT

               Fisher and Michael. Moore, drinking, just listening.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Dad used to bring home these sparklers 
                         to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 
                         'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 
                         'em up to the sky and watch the 
                         explosions of light. Sparks. And dad 
                         would be all... "Get ready"... "watch 
                         for it"... "here it comes," here 
                         comes the "wahoo"

                                     FISHER
                         The wahoo?

                                     MICHAEL
                         The sparkler would burn hot, then 
                         hotter, then even hotter... and there 
                         would be one moment of pure burn 
                         when that little fucker would cook 
                         just perfect. Perfect. It would only 
                         last a second, but that second was 
                         it. It was it. That's what dad had 
                         us looking for... You get me?

                                     FISHER
                         The wahoo moment?

                                     MICHAEL
                         That's my point! You see Man... 
                         burning at his absolute. To see all 
                         the forces just come together, just 
                         right, you know, just in perfect 
                         harmony. That's what I'm driving at. 
                         You get me?

                                     FISHER
                         I think so.

                                     MICHAEL
                         I've been looking for that flash and 
                         I look and I look and I can't find 
                         it. And what if I already had it? 
                         You know. My moment? What if it's 
                         gone? And I never saw it?
                              (finishes drink)
                         You're getting married, man. That's 
                         a fucking beautiful thing. Just a 
                         beautiful thing. I just can't stop 
                         breaking beautiful things.

               INT. LOIS' HOUSE - NIGHT

               Lois' bedroom. As Lois sleeps, Boyd softly enters the room. 
               Moving in on the sleeping Lois, another couple of steps, he 
               looms over her, reaches his hand to her throat when, suddenly, 
               Lois' eyes snap open. Boyd is startled. Lois grabs mace from 
               her night stand and sprays Boyd in the face. He MOANS, 
               stumbles back. Lois leaps on him like a shark slamming a 
               side of beef.

               They go down hard on the floor and start fighting like wild 
               animals.

                                     LOIS
                         You picked the wrong woman mother-
                         fucker!

               As Lois sinks her teeth into Boyd's balls.

               BACK AT THE BAR

                                     MICHAEL
                         You see for me it's over. Over baby. 
                         I'm gonna turn myself in. After the 
                         wedding of course. After the wedding. 
                         Out of respect.

                                     MOORE
                         I don't think that's a good idea.

                                     MICHAEL
                         I said out of respect. Respect for 
                         you Fisher. For you and your wedding 
                         and your beautiful bride. There will 
                         be no more rain. You see where I am 
                         here?

                                     FISHER
                         I appreciate it. I do, but... maybe 
                         you ought to just ease up on yourself 
                         a bit.

                                     MICHAEL
                         No. No. No. This is my doing. You 
                         see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark 
                         for my own. For Lois and the kids, 
                         for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna 
                         turn myself in. I am all that. I'm 
                         gonna do it for sweet Lois.

               LOIS' BEDROOM

               Boyd and Lois are choking the living shit out of each other. 
               Boyd pulls back, swings with a left, Lois ducks, she swings, 
               a right cross to Boyds eye. He goes down. She jumps on him. 
               Choking him like a mad dog. As Boyd struggles for air...

               THE BAR

               Fisher checks his watch as Michael fumbles with his eighth 
               shot of Yukon Jack.

                                     MICHAEL
                         If I was to think... If I were to 
                         think... No I mean I have thinked it 
                         over... I have. And without putting 
                         a lot of pressure on you I just... 
                         Well I just...

                                     FISHER
                         What is it?

                                     MICHAEL
                              (drunk-slow)
                         Well if you do think about names... 
                         Michael's a pretty good one... It's 
                         done me all right.

               Michael's eyes bore into Fisher, like he knows something 
               Fisher doesn't. Fisher's cell phone RINGS.

                                     FISHER
                              (answers)
                         Yeah.

               INT. LOIS' BEDROOM

               TIGHT ON Boyd, eye swelling, scratch marks, hair a crazy 
               mess.

                                     BOYD
                              (into the phone)
                         Okay. Here's the deal and it's a 
                         good one. Lois is cool. It's a 
                         pacified situation.

               INTERCUT BOYD AND FISHER

                                     FISHER
                         What does that mean?

               Michael stares at Fisher.

                                     BOYD
                         I'm talking about Lois having relaxed 
                         her anxiety. Only deal is... you 
                         still got Michael there?

                                     FISHER
                         Yeah.

                                     BOYD
                         Good deal. Lois just wants to hear 
                         it from Michael.

                                     FISHER
                         Hear what?

                                     BOYD
                         That it was all an accident. She 
                         wants to here it from Michael's mouth.

                                     FISHER
                         Now?

               Michael drunkenly nods his head as if can hear the 
               conversation.

                                     BOYD
                         That's right.

                                     FISHER
                         Isn't it a little late?

                                     BOYD
                         Hold on a sec.
                              (turns)
                         Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather 
                         do this in the morning?

               PAN OVER to see Lois, half hanging off the bed, strangled to 
               death. Boyd won.

                                     BOYD
                              (back into phone)
                         She says now's the time.
                              (quietly)
                         I got a peace treaty thing happening 
                         over here... let's get this over 
                         with.

               EXT. LOIS' HOUSE

               Fisher's car pulls up. Boyd is waiting outside. He opens the 
               back door. Michael is drunk in the back. Fisher and Moore 
               are up front.

                                     BOYD
                         Okay Michael, let's go.
                              (helps him out)
                         Upsy daisy big guy.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (hammered)
                         How about my Fatburger?

                                     BOYD
                         Come on tough guy. Listen to me.
                              (takes Michaels face 
                              in his hands)
                         You are going to tell Lois that it 
                         was all an accident. Okay cowboy? 
                         You got me?

                                     MICHAEL
                         I love you.

                                     MOORE
                         He's too drunk.

                                     BOYD
                         He's fine. Okay Mikey, let's go.
                              (to Fisher and Moore)
                         You guys stay here.

               Boyd leads Michael into the house.

               INT. CAR

               Fisher and Moore wait in silence...

                                     MOORE
                              (beat)
                         I'm thinking about maybe making a 
                         move.

                                     FISHER
                         A move?

                                     MOORE
                         Greenpeace.

                                     FISHER
                         Greenpeace?

                                     MOORE
                         Maybe go up to the North Pole, the 
                         Arctic. Tag polar bears with dart 
                         guns. I've always had a pretty good 
                         aim...

               A "POP" resounds from within the house. Moore and Fisher 
               lock eyes, frozen.

               Boyd comes jogging out the front door, hops in the back seat. 
               Fisher and Moore turn, eyes wide.

                                     BOYD
                         Michael was having an affair with 
                         Lois. That's what Michael and Adam 
                         were arguing about in the parking 
                         lot. Michael killed Adam in a jealous 
                         rage. Lois broke it off with Michael, 
                         he strangled her to death and then 
                         shot himself in the head.
                              (beat)
                         Happens all the time.

               Boyd touches the painful scratches on his face.

                                     BOYD
                         That Lois fought like a fucking 
                         Comanche.

               ON Fisher and Moore in stunned horror...

               INT. LAW FIRM

               TIGHT ON BARRY MORRIS, mid-40's, attorney.

                                     BARRY MORRIS
                         I don't see how this could have been 
                         kept from you. The facts are quite 
                         simple; last month Adam and Lois 
                         changed their will. They requested 
                         that you two, as a married couple, 
                         be the Custodians of Record for their 
                         estate including all properties, 
                         cash holdings, security holdings 
                         and... children. You are legal 
                         custodians of the Brenn Trust.

               ANGLE ON

               Liz and Fisher, flanked by Adam Jr. and Timmy, eyes wide, 
               they sit across from the attorney, totally bazooka'd. They 
               stare in horror at Morris.

                                     LIZ
                         My god.

                                     BARRY MORRIS
                         There's more.

                                     FISHER
                         More?

                                     BARRY MORRIS
                         Adam and Lois were not terribly 
                         prudent in terms of providing for 
                         the possibility of the unforeseen.

                                     FISHER
                         What are you talking about?

                                     BARRY MORRIS
                         I'm talking about Life insurance. 
                         I'm talking about money.

                                     LIZ
                         Money?

                                     BARRY MORRIS
                         Yes money. Adam had a five hundred 
                         thousand dollar Term Life Insurance 
                         Policy.

               PAUSE.

                                     LIZ
                         What does that mean?

                                     FISHER
                         That means we get five hundred 
                         thousand to help raise the kids.

                                     LIZ
                              (amazed)
                         No.

                                     FISHER
                         Yes.

                                     BARRY MORRIS
                         Actually, no. Adam was switching to 
                         a Whole Life Policy, but re-scheduled 
                         his medical exam... and failed to 
                         make his last payment... so his Term 
                         Life lapsed. So it's value is null 
                         and void.
                              (off Liz's horror)
                         Now he did have a pension account, 
                         worth another 150 thousand.

                                     LIZ
                              (relieved)
                         Well, oh...

                                     BARRY MORRIS
                         And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.

                                     LIZ
                         So where's that leave us?

                                     FISHER
                         150 plus 350... we still get 500 
                         thousand.

                                     BARRY MORRIS
                              (beat)
                         No. Not even close. With property 
                         values down, the house is worth 
                         100,000 less than 450 he paid for 
                         it. With three credit cards, the 
                         minivan payments, and other 
                         outstanding debts... Plus the Income 
                         and Estate Taxes assessed on his 
                         IRA...
                              (punches his calculator)
                         You'll get, oh... in the neighborhood 
                         of, ah... 14,223 dollars.

               Adam Jr. suddenly slips off his chair, lands flat on his 
               back, starts struggling to get up. Fisher tries to help Little 
               Adam up.

                                     LITTLE ADAM
                         Get away from me!

                                     FISHER
                         I'm just trying to help...

                                     LITTLE ADAM
                         I don't want your help!

                                     FISHER
                         Stop kicking. Stop kicking!

               Fisher manages to get Adam Jr. back up in his chair. Liz 
               looks rather horrified.

                                     BARRY MORRIS
                              (breaking the tension)
                         So. When is the wedding.

                                     LIZ
                         Tomorrow
                              (at Fisher)
                         We are getting married tomorrow.

               INT. CAR

               Fisher drives, Liz up front, Adam jr. and Timmy in the back. 
               Everyone is shocked in silence. Fisher looks deathly ill, 
               like he's about to vomit. He pulls the car over and gets 
               out.

               EXT. FISHER'S CAR

               Fisher leans on the trunk, puking. Liz gets out to help him, 
               he starts crying. Liz is gentle and loving.

                                     LIZ
                         It's okay... It's okay baby. Cry for 
                         Mama. Cry for Mama.

                                     FISHER
                         No it's not okay. It's not.

               The kids watch from the rear view window but can't hear.

                                     LIZ
                         Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.

                                     FISHER
                              (sobbing)
                         Liz we've got to cancel, we have to 
                         put it off.

                                     LIZ
                              (ice)
                         Don't even.

                                     FISHER
                         Do you love me?

                                     LIZ
                         What?

                                     FISHER
                         Do you love me?

                                     LIZ
                         What kind of stupid question is that?

                                     FISHER
                              (breaking down)
                         Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a 
                         woman. We...

                                     LIZ
                         What are you talking about?

                                     FISHER
                              (completely hysterical)
                         Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Michael 
                         crushed her skull. She was dead. 
                         There was nothing else to do. It was 
                         an accident.

                                     LIZ
                         Who's dead?

                                     FISHER
                         The prostitute.

                                     LIZ
                         You fucked a prostitute?

                                     FISHER
                         No Michael did. It was an accident.

                                     LIZ
                         You killed a prostitute.

                                     FISHER
                         Michael, by accident.

                                     LIZ
                         Call the police.

                                     FISHER
                         It's too late.

                                     LIZ
                         My God. You've got to call the police, 
                         tell them it was an accident. Where 
                         is she?

                                     FISHER
                         She's in the desert. She's out in 
                         the desert.

                                     LIZ
                         You left a dead prostitute out in 
                         the desert? Alone?

                                     FISHER
                         She's not alone... She's... Boyd... 
                         Oh God... He's gone nuts... He killed 
                         Lois and Michael... it's all...

                                     LIZ
                         Stop! You stop right here. I don't 
                         want to know anymore. I told you not 
                         to do this Bachelor Party thing. You 
                         were warned.

                                     FISHER
                         But...

                                     LIZ
                         No buts. I told you your friends 
                         were Jackasses.

                                     FISHER
                         But...

                                     LIZ
                         No buts. I've waited twenty-seven 
                         years, twenty-seven years I have 
                         focused and prepared to walk down 
                         that aisle. I will not be derailed! 
                         I will not be embarrassed! I will 
                         not be denied! I am walking down 
                         that aisle tomorrow come hell or 
                         high fucking water!

               Liz marches back to the car, gets in and slams the door. 
               Fisher just stares in shock.

               EXT./INT. CHURCH - FISHER AND LIZ'S WEDDING

               It's pouring rain outside.

               Shots of guests dashing from their cars to the church.

               Fisher's parents with Adam Jr. and Timmy, looking overwhelmed.

               Upstairs: Liz and her Bridesmaids help Liz get dressed. 
               Everyone looks depressed.

               INT. CHURCH BASEMENT

               Fisher and Moore in tuxedos. Boyd enters, shuts the door. 
               Fisher looks ill.

                                     BOYD
                         Okay, we're about two minutes out. 
                         Moore, better take your position.

               Moore looks at Fisher.

                                     BOYD
                         Chop chop.

               Moore goes. A long tense BEAT between Fisher and Boyd.

                                     BOYD
                         This is a situation that defies 
                         judgement. We have acted and showed 
                         courage that is not of a kind known 
                         by most.

                                     FISHER
                         I'm getting really tired of your 
                         bullshit.

                                     BOYD
                         My what?

                                     FISHER
                         You've got a warped thought process. 
                         Your brain doesn't function properly.

                                     BOYD
                         You care to add a little specification 
                         to that slanderous accusation?

                                     FISHER
                              (snaps)
                         I'm talking about some bad, bad, 
                         very bad things. Bad things! Those 
                         are bad fucking things!

                                     BOYD
                         Okay fine.

                                     FISHER
                         Fine? Fine what?

                                     BOYD
                         Whatever you say Kojak.

                                     FISHER
                         I'm serious.

                                     BOYD
                         I'm serious. I'm the serious one 
                         here. I'm the one making the play. 
                         I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my 
                         money.

               INT. CHURCH

               The organ is playing. The guests are seated. Liz and her 
               father are waiting in the front hall.

                                     LIZ
                         I told Boyd two fucking minutes!

               INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - CONT'D

                                     FISHER
                         What money?

                                     BOYD
                         Blood money. Insurance dollars that 
                         you have thus fucking far decided 
                         not to tell me about at all. In no 
                         way have you mentioned that money. 
                         And I find that to be very very 
                         offensive.

                                     FISHER
                         You're sick.

                                     BOYD
                              (veins pulsing)
                         And if you think you can fuck me, 
                         don't. Cause I'm fucking insulated 
                         Fisher. Protected. Backed up on 
                         floppy. Do you get me? I want my 
                         fucking money!

                                     FISHER
                         Not a prayer.

                                     BOYD
                         I'm a lifesaver. A lighthouse. Up 
                         all night in the rain, in stormy 
                         gale force wind, tornado and fucking 
                         earthquakes. I stay lit for you. I 
                         stay lit. I don't go dark. I never 
                         go dark!

                                     FISHER
                         You need help.

               Fisher turns away. BOYD combusts. He leaps on Fisher with a 
               wild cry.

                                     BOYD
                         I want that money!

               Boyd and fisher fight like animals; choking, pounding, 
               mauling, a fight to the death. Fisher is losing, Boyd is 
               choking the life out of him, killing him. Fisher is going 
               down, eyes rolling back, he's dying, until...

               CRASH. Boyd's head is caved in from behind. REVEAL Liz 
               wielding a big, heavy crucifix. Boyd slumps to the ground. 
               Fisher gasps for air. Boyd stirs. Liz beats him repeatedly 
               with the crucifix until he's dead as a door knob. Fisher is 
               stunned. Liz tosses the cross. Miraculously, only one perfect 
               droplet of blood has gotten on her wedding dress. She flicks 
               it off with her finger.

                                     LIZ
                              (composing herself)
                         Here comes the bride.

               Liz gathers up her train and marches out. Fisher looks at 
               Boyd, a bloody dead mess.

               THE WEDDING

               Fisher joins Moore at the alter. JUDGE TOWER smiles warmly 
               at Fisher.

                                     MOORE
                         Where's Boyd?

                                     FISHER
                              (whispers)
                         Downstairs in the closet.

               Before Moore can ask, the ORGAN begins playing the WEDDING 
               MARCH. Liz starts down the aisle, escorted by her father, 
               She smiles radiantly.

               Liz's father kisses her and gives her to Fisher. They stand 
               before the Judge who starts talking. TIGHT ON Fisher. His 
               head pounding. He hears none of what the Judge says until...

                                     JUDGE TOWER
                         May we have the rings please?

                                     FISHER
                         What?

                                     JUDGE TOWER
                         The rings?

               Fisher looks at Moore.

               INT. CHURCH BASEMENT

               Moore opens the closet. Boyd falls out.

               INT. CHURCH

               Everyone waits patiently. Fisher is sweating. He looks at 
               Liz who stares straight ahead.

               INT. CHURCH BASEMENT

               Moore rolls Boyd over, checks every pocket, trying not to 
               get blood on himself.

               INT. CHURCH

               Moore returns.

                                     MOORE
                         Got 'em.

               He hands the rings to the Judge, at which time, he, she, 
               Fisher and Liz all see blood on his white shirt cuff. The 
               Judge looks at Moore. He pulls his jacket sleeve down.

                                     JUDGE TOWER
                              (continues)
                         These rings represent the commitment 
                         Fisher and Liz make to each other on 
                         the day. Fisher do you take Liz to 
                         be your beloved wife, to respect, 
                         honor and cherish till death do you 
                         part?

                                     FISHER
                         I do.

               Liz slides the ring on Fisher's finger.

                                     JUDGE TOWER
                         Liz do you take Fisher to be your 
                         beloved husband, to respect, honor 
                         and cherish him till death do you 
                         part?

                                     LIZ
                         I do.

               Fisher slides the ring on Liz's finger.

                                     JUDGE TOWER
                         I now pronounce you husband and wife.

               Fisher kisses Liz. They turn to face their guests who applaud. 
               Liz cries tears of joy.

               WEDDING RECEPTION - TENT NEXT TO CHURCH

               Liz drinks champagne and talks with her guests.

               EXT. CHURCH - REAR

               Fisher and Moore load Boyd's body in the trunk of Fisher's 
               car.

                                     MOORE
                         He came to me early today, was talking 
                         about money, insurance money. Said 
                         he was gonna get what was his.

                                     FISHER
                         My God...

                                     MOORE
                         He said he was the Brain Trust. Said 
                         he was smarter than all of us. He 
                         started reading "Atlas Shrugged," 
                         staring at himself in the mirror.

                                     FISHER
                         Did he try to kiss you?

                                     MOORE
                         All week long.

               Fisher slams the trunk closed.

               WEDDING RECEPTION - MUCH LATER

               Only a few guests remain. Fisher's parents watch the boys. 
               The caterers are cleaning up. Fisher and Liz sit alone.

                                     FISHER
                         He kept saying he was protected.

                                     LIZ
                         What does that mean?

                                     FISHER
                         Like if something happened to him, 
                         he could still get us.

                                     LIZ
                         Like how?

                                     FISHER
                         I don't know. He could have told 
                         someone. He could have, like in the 
                         event of his death, somehow let 
                         someone know where those bodies are 
                         buried.

                                     LIZ
                         The only proof is those bodies.

                                     FISHER
                         So what do we do?

                                     LIZ
                         Move the bodies.

                                     FISHER
                         Move the bodies?

                                     OLD MAN (O.S.)
                         Excuse us?

               Fisher and Liz look up at a sweet OLD COUPLE, who talk at 
               the same time, oblivious to each other.

                         OLD MAN
                 We just wanted to say 
                 congratulations and 
                 wish you great 
                 happiness. Mazeltov. I 
                 just did. I said 
                 Malzeltov. You never 
                 listen to me.

                                                       OLD WOMAN
                                               We're your Uncle Henry's 
                                               parents. Opal and Earl. 
                                               Tell them from both of us. 
                                               Malzeltov. Wish them luck. 
                                               The secret to a good 
                                               marriage is to listen.

                                     LIZ
                              (cheerleader smile)
                         Thank you. Thank you. We will. Bye 
                         bye.

               The Old Couple shuffles away. Fisher watches them go, he 
               suddenly breaks down, crying...

                                     FISHER
                         I... Liz... all I ever wanted, was 
                         for you to be happy. I just wanted 
                         to give you the wedding, the life 
                         you always dreamed of...
                              (sobs)
                         ...I just love you so much... So 
                         much...

                                     LIZ
                              (beat; unmoved)
                         You and Moore move the bodies and 
                         bury Boyd with them. In fact, put 
                         Moore in the ground too.

                                     FISHER
                         What?

                                     LIZ
                         If you don't tie up all the lose 
                         ends it'll never be over.

                                     FISHER
                              (horrified)
                         No...

                                     LIZ
                         You put him down or don't bother 
                         coming back.

                                     FISHER
                         But...

                                     LIZ
                         Do you love me? DO YOU LOVE ME?!

               OFF Fisher...

               EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               Fisher's car blasts past a road sign reading, "Las Vegas, 
               358 miles."

               INT. FISHER'S CAR

               Fisher drives, Moore's in the passenger seat. They're still 
               in their tuxedos. Extreme silence. Fisher, almost in a trance.

                                     MOORE
                         You alright?

                                     FISHER
                         Yeah. I'm thinking about Michael's 
                         Franco Harris fixation. You know how 
                         Michael was always harping "Immaculate 
                         Reception?" I've seen that play. A 
                         lot of times... and I have to say 
                         this... Franco was lucky. Flat out, 
                         right place, right time. That's it. 
                         He was where the ball bounced. You 
                         get me?

                                     MOORE
                         I guess.

                                     FISHER
                         I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You 
                         work your entire life, all the 
                         training, focus, all the dedication, 
                         all irrelevant. Where does the ball 
                         bounce? My father spent his whole 
                         life trying to start a company, 
                         practiced every day, worked like a 
                         dog, finally got enough money. He's 
                         paid the dues, he's ready, does all 
                         the market research, picks his shot -- 
                         "Pup Corn."

                                     MOORE
                         Pup corn?

                                     FISHER
                         That's right, "Pup Corn." Doggie 
                         treats. Little snacks for dogs. He's 
                         figured it out. There is a hole in 
                         the market and he's going to fill 
                         it. Spends all out money, works 
                         himself into not two but three heart 
                         attacks getting this shit up. After 
                         fifteen months, the big day arrives, 
                         the first box of "Pup Corn" pops off 
                         the belt. He comes running home with 
                         that box, pulls us out of school. We 
                         all pile into the living room, must 
                         be fifty of us, and in comes 
                         "Shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "Here 
                         Shelmer," my dad cries. He's got 
                         that little fucking pup corn in his 
                         hand, "Here girl." This dog will eat 
                         anything, she eats rocks, anything. 
                         She walk's up to my dad's hand, looks 
                         down at the little pellet, licks it 
                         once, turns around, walks out of the 
                         room. Shelmer rejected the "Pup Corn." 
                         Fifteen months of my dad's life, 
                         right there. Not one dog ate Pup 
                         Corn. Not one. Three months later, 
                         "Pup Corn" shuts down. Chapter Eleven. 
                         My father never got over it. Never.

               SILENCE hangs again.

               EXT. DESERT - LATER

               Fisher and Moore search for the graves of Tina and Ralph 
               with flashlights and shovels.

                                     FISHER
                         I think it was over here.

               They move into a new area and start poking around. Nothing.

                                     MOORE
                         It was over by those rocks.

               Again they search, prodding into earth with their shovels. 
               Nothing.

               Fisher stops digging, tired, he pauses, shines his light 
               around until...

                                     FISHER
                         There.

                                     MOORE
                         Where?

               Fisher moves to a new spot.

                                     FISHER
                         There. This rock is where I stood 
                         when I said the prayer.

               He starts digging in front of the rock. The earth is soft.

                                     FISHER
                         Bingo.

               Moore and Fisher quickly start to dig, until, finally, Moore's 
               shovel makes contact.

                                     MOORE
                         Got it.

               And they dig some more.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               MOORE

               in the hole, passing the suitcases up to Fisher.

               FISHER

               loads the cases into the car.

               EXT. NEW BURIAL SITE

               The suitcases are unloaded. Fisher and Moore dig a new grave. 
               Moore's back is to Fisher as he digs.

                                     MOORE
                         I've been thinking about what you 
                         said that day. The prayer. About 
                         using this whole mess to bring out 
                         the good in me...

               Fisher is directly above Moore, holding the shovel, looking 
               down at the back of Moore's head.

                                     FISHER
                         Yeah?

                                     MOORE
                         I think there's a lot of truth in 
                         that. I'm gonna pursue some options. 
                         I want to join that Big Brother thing.

                                     FISHER
                              (slowly raises the 
                              shovel over his head)
                         That's a good one.

                                     MOORE
                         I want a black one. A little black 
                         brother. That's a big problem it 
                         seems to me. Lack of racial 
                         integration. That's a big one. You 
                         think?

               Moore looks up to...

               FISHER, tears running down his face, the shovel high above 
               his head, ready to bring it down hard onto Moore's skull.

               MOORE confused and then realization... CUT between Fisher 
               above, poised to strike, Moore below, still and vulnerable. 
               Their eyes locked for several beats. Finally...

                                     MOORE
                         What do you think?

               Slowly, Fisher lowers his shovel.

                                     FISHER
                         I think you'd make an excellent Big 
                         Brother.

                                     MOORE
                              (back to work)
                         That's what I'm thinking.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               THE GRAVE - LATER

               The cases are in the hole with Boyd's body. As Fisher and 
               Moore re-fill the grave with dirt we...

                                                        SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. FISHER'S CAR - HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               Fisher drives, Moore rides shotgun, both mean are dirty, 
               sweaty and tired.

                                     MOORE
                         Well that ought to be about the end 
                         of that.

                                     FISHER
                         Yup.

               TIGHT ON Fisher, staring deep into the road, a faint smile 
               creeps on to his face...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE IMMACULATE RECEPTION

               The distorted but definitely recognizable image of Franco 
               Harris running for his life.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         And it's Franco Harris running for...

               Franco makes it into the Raider end zone.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         A TOUCHDOWN FOR PITTSBURGH! 
                         UNBELIEVABLE!

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               FISHER

               Lost in his reverie, wakes up in a hair pin turn. The 
               speedometer reads 80. They run out of road. The car skids on 
               the shoulder, Fisher cranks the wheel, jumps the divider, 
               into oncoming headlights. Fisher and Moore lit up bright...

               HIGHWAY

               Fisher's car SMASHES head-on into another car. IN SLOW MOTION 
               Fisher and Moore are launched through the windshield in an 
               IMPLOSION of glass and steel, flesh and blood.

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

               We hear the sounds of SCRUBBING.

               SLOW FADE UP:

               INT. FISHER HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

               TIGHT ON Liz, on her hands and knees, scrubbing around the 
               toilet of what is clearly a filthy kids bathroom; soiled 
               jockey shorts, Tonka trucks, mess everywhere.

               O.S. we hear voices outside. Liz gets up off her knees, 
               brushes a piece of hair from her sweaty face and peers out 
               the bathroom window.

               TIGHT ON FISHER

               EXT. BACK YARD

                                     FISHER
                         Okay let's try it again.

               Adam Jr. and Timmy, in ill-fitted Cub Scout uniforms, recite 
               the "Scout Laws."

                         TIMMY
                 A scout is thrifty, 
                 saves for the future. 
                 A scout is clean, he 
                 keeps his body...

                                                       ADAM JR.
                                               A scout is brave. A scout 
                                               can face danger, even if 
                                               he's afraid...

                                     FISHER
                         Let's see the salutes!

               Timmy snaps out a fine salute. Adam balances on one crutch 
               to salute but looses balance and falls flat on his face. He 
               starts SCREAMING.

               REVEAL Fisher, in a wheelchair, both legs amputated above 
               the knee. He leans over, trying to help Adam Jr. up and his 
               wheel chair tips over. Fisher falls on top of Adam Jr. who 
               SCREAMS even louder, flailing arms and legs like a turtle on 
               its back.

               REVEAL Moore, in an electric wheel chair he operated with a 
               mouthpiece. As he is paralyzed from the neck down, he's no 
               help at all. Timmy suddenly snaps.

                                     TIMMY
                              (to Adam Jr.)
                         Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

                                     FISHER
                         It's okay, it's okay.

               THE BATHROOM WINDOW

               Liz watches the pathetic chaos that is her life with the 
               dull lifeless eyes of a concentration camp prisoner.

                                     FISHER (O.S.)
                         Timmy SHUT UP! Help your brother! 
                         ADAM! Let him help you!

               TIGHT ON Liz as her mouth slowly opens in an anguished SILENT 
               SCREAM.

               OUT THE WINDOW - DOWN IN THE BACK YARD

               Adam Jr. gets back on his feet, with the begrudging help of 
               Timmy. As Fisher struggles to hoist himself up, back in his 
               wheelchair...

                                     FISHER
                         Remember a scout is helpful! A scout 
                         doesn't scream in the face of 
                         adversity.

               Suddenly, O.S. from the bathroom, Liz WAILS. Fisher looks up 
               at the window... LONG BEAT...

                                     FISHER
                              (to the boys)
                         Okay, let's skip to the Scout's 
                         Oath...

                                     ADAM JR. & TIMMY
                         On my honor, I will do my best...

               The boys recite the "Scout's Oath" as Liz's deep, heaving, 
               wailing SOBS grow in intensity O.C.

                                     ADAM JR. & TIMMY
                         ...to do my duty to God and my 
                         country... To obey the Scout Law, to 
                         help other people at all times...

               SLOWLY PULL OFF Fisher, Moore and the kids...

                                     ADAM JR. & TIMMY
                         To keep myself physically strong, 
                         mentally awake, and morally straight.

               CRANE UP, past Liz at the window, out of the yard, over the 
               house, WIDER to reveal the surrounding track-like homes, 
               housing track-like families, with track-like nightmares as 
               Liz's plaintiff wails echo the communal despair of the human 
               village.

                                                              CUT TO BLACK:

                                         THE END
