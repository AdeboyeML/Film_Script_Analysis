              STEVEN SCHWIMMER, a drama critic, asleep on his bed. He
              wears a sleep mask.
          2
              The bed is a mattress on a makeshift platform.
          
              Papers strewn on the floor.
          
              An exercise bike.
          
              A desk with and old manual typewriter, reference works,
              periodicals, Styrofoam cups.
          
              A cast-off sofa with pants, shirts, sweater, underwear and
              socks tossed haphazardly on the cushions and arms.
          
              A counter that sets apart the kitchen area. A portable TV set
              on the counter. The remains of dinner for one.
          
              A row of stacked cardboard boxes with mail spilling out on
              the floor. Boxes are labeled in crayon: HATE MAIL.
          
              A coffee table with a candle nub in a saucer and six gleaming
              rounds of ammunition scattered next to a Llama Comanche .357
              Magnum with a checkered walnut stock -- overall length, nine
              and a quarter inches.
          
              A Port-O-San toilet, about seven feet high, orange, scarred
              and dented -- scavenged from a construction site.
          
              A snapshot on the bedside table. It's a blurry picture of
              Steven holding a cat. Steven wears a peaked cap, and a shadow
              falls across his face. Next to the picture is a clock radio,
              which comes on with a buzz as the clock shows nine AM.
          
              RADIO ANNOUNCER begins to speak --

                        Deegan right now but if you're
                        lucky enough to have a ticket for
                        tonight's game, be sure to leave
                        early because it's going to be
                        bumper to bumper.
          
              Steven does not stir.

                teven's loft is in an old squat building on 47th Street near
              Twelfth Avenue. The structure looks abandoned. Graffiti
              everywhere. Entranceway filled with debris.
          
          
          
                                                                       2.

                          Another day of traffic. Traffic
                          everywhere I look. Cars stop and
                          move and stop again. People sit at
                          the wheel thinking their thoughts.

              The shimmering glass facade of the United Nations Plaza
              Apartments at 48th Street and First Avenue. A man visible at
              a window on one of the high floors, a cup of coffee in his
              hand.

                          Day in, day out. Red light, green
                          light. Traffic on the major
                          arteries and traffic in the little
                          veins.
          
              From his POV we see the traffic below creeping along, nearly
              at a standstill.
          
                                    LONE EAGLE (V.O.)
                          Cars, vans, taxis, trucks, limos,
                          Mopeds, bikes and buses. Emergency
                          vehicles screaming and wailing.
                          Birth and death, walk and don't
                          walk.
          
              The man takes a sip of coffee.
          
                                    LONE EAGLE (V.O.)
                          Traffic yesterday, today and
                          tomorrow. Bumper to bumper, soul to
                          soul. This is Lone Eagle over and
                          out.

              The same man -- the playwright Nicky Rogan with his hand in
              the air, hailing a cab. He is forty-five, vigorous, wearing
              well-made sporty clothes.
          
              In a corner of the screen --

                          I used to drive a taxi.
          
                                                                          3.

                           Big hospital in USSR. This

                           I loved my taxi. Went twelve hours
                           nonstop. Stopped only to pee. I
                           peed under the Manhattan bridge.
                           Peed many times in parks and
                           playgrounds.

              47th Street and Third Avenue. A man is dancing with a life-
              size cloth doll. His tape player is on the sidewalk, playing
              and instrumental version of "Beautiful Dreamer" and there is
              a cigar box for donations. A few people look on from a
              distance. The man wearing an old cutaway, with running shoes,
              and the doll has long red tresses and wears a frilly gown.
          
              Nicky emerges from a taxi at the corner and walks rapidly
              past the dancing man.
          
              Nicky crosses the courtyard to Buchanan Apartments.

              JOANNA BOURNE reaching for the door. Joanna is fifty-ish,
              handsome, stylishly dressed.

               Nicky and Joanna embracing with wordless abandon.
          
               They are in the hallway clutching each other, stumbling. The
               walls on either side are hung with expensive art.
          
               They grapple past the living room. Fleeting look at the
               paintings by Longo and Fischl, a poster by the Guerilla
               Girls.

                he edge of the bedroom. Nicky is crawling into the room and
               Joanna is hanging on to him, being dragged. They are fully
               dressed except for one of Joanna's shoes.
          
               The bedroom. A Lichtenstein, a Hockney, a silk-screen of
               Joanna by Andy Warhol. A Jeff Koons piece. Nicky and Joanna
               roll on the floor until they are halfway under the bed.

               Muffled sounds from the bedroom. We track to:
          
               The maid's room. The maid is smoking a cigarette and reading
               New York magazine. The cover is partly obscured by her hand
               but we can see a blurry black-and-white photo of a man
               hurrying along a street with a newspaper over his face,
               shielding himself from the camera. Over the photo, three
               words visible: THE PHANTOM WHO -- A second line of type is
               too small to be legible.

               Nicky and Joanna are undressing after the fact, very slowly
               and distractedly. Joanna stands by a chair near the window.
               Nicky is on the other side of the bed and he alternates
               between standing and sitting as he takes off his clothes.

                         Last night. Alan Albright called me
                         a handsome woman. Second time he's
                         done that. Son of a bitch.
          
                                   NICKY
                         I hear Alan's sick.

                         Alan's very sick. He has to go to
                         New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm
                         solution.
          
                                   NICKY
                         You know about Adele.
          
                     
          
          
                    JOANNA
          What about her?
          
                    NICKY
          She's dying.
          
                       JOANNA
          She died.
          
                    NICKY
          I talked to her two days ago.
          
                    JOANNA
          Apparently it didn't help. You know
          about Peter, of course.
          
                       NICKY
          Our Peter?
          
                    JOANNA
          Peter Redmond. They found out why
          he can't remember his lines.
          There's something living in his
          brain. A parasite he picked up in
          Borneo, doing the movie.
          
                    NICKY
          Can he get through it?
          
                    JOANNA
          They're watching him closely.
          There's a special rehearsal set for
          this afternoon. To bolster his
          confidence. And that's not all.
          
                    NICKY
          I've got bigger problems, Joanna.
          Personal problems.
          
                    JOANNA
          That's not all, Nicky. I've been
          backing your plays for fifteen
          years. And I've never been more
          depressed.
          
                    NICKY

                    not worried about this guy.
          
                              JOANNA
                    Ever since he started reviewing the
                    Broadway theater, nobody in this
                    business has been worried about
                    anything else.

                    They can send their heartless
                    brilliant boy-critic. There's a
                    much bigger thing going on than
                    tonight's opening.

                    What?

                              JOANNA
                    You mean the World Series? I
                    thought the Red Sox were winning.
          
                              NICKY
                    Three games to two. But if you know
                    their history, you realize there's
                    a tragedy in the making. I've been
                    carrying this franchise on my back
                    since I was six years old.
          
                              JOANNA
                    It can't be all that personal.
          
          Joanna enters the walk-in closet to finish undressing and get
          a nightdress.
          
                              NICKY
                    If you have a team you've followed
                    all your life, and they raise your
                    hopes and crush them, and lift them
                    and crush them, do you want me to
                    tell you what it's like? It's like
                    feeling your childhood die over and
                    over.     J
                              JOANNA
                    I mean Nicky, really, no.
          
                                                                      7.
          
          
          
          Nicky follows her into the closet, still in his shirt and
          boxer shorts.
          
                              JOANNA
                    I'm proud of this play. It's so
                    different from anything you've
                    done.
          
                              NICKY
                    This is how we've managed to last.
          
                              JOANNA
                    We're able to surprise each other.

                              JOANNA
                    Because we're completely
                    mismatched.
          
                              NICKY
                    We don't even like each other, do
                    we?
          
          Nicky walks out of the closet, takes off his shirt, gets into
          bed.
          
                              JOANNA
                    I used to tell myself. Talent is
                    more erotic when it's wasted. Will
                    I see you tonight?
          
                              NICKY
                    The Red Sox blow a chance to win
                    their first World Series since
                    1918. You expect me to miss that
                    for an opening night?
          
          Joanna emerges from the closet in her nightdress and gets
          into bed.

                    It's all worked out. They'll lose
                    tonight. Then they'll lose
                    tomorrow. I see it with stunning
                    clarity.

                           They'll lose because they're my
                           team.

               INT. STEVEN SCHWIMMER'S LOFT
          
               Steven is just waking up. The radio plays soft music.
          
               He reaches over and hits the off button, then activates the
               cassette player. He struggles out of bed and Sufi music
               begins to fill the room.
          
               He stands at the foot of the bed, a man in his mid-twenties,
               hollow-chested, slightly potbellied, wearing rumpled pajama
               bottoms and a Mostly Mozart T-shirt.
          
               He does not remove the sleep mask.
          
               The music has a sensuous, driving beat. Voices begin to
               chant.
          
               Steven holds his arms parallel to the floor. Slowly he begins
               to turn, clockwise. The beat picks up and he whirls more
               quickly, his mouth coming open.
          
               Now he begins to whirl about the room. The chanting grows in
               intensity. Although he is blindfolded, Steve deftly avoids
               running into furniture and other objects.
          
               Steven stops whirling at the precise moment the music stops
               playing. He is back at the foot of the bed, arms stretched
               wide.

                         I am sitting here five years in

                         be?
          
               A taxi pulls up alongside. Nicky notices the young woman in
               the rear seat. It is his daughter Laurel. He opens his
               window.
          
                                   NICKY

                         Keep the meter running. And try to
                         stay abreast.

               Nicky pushes in next to her. Laurel is eighteen, slightly
               overweight, with a pleasant and expressive face. She is
               carrying books in a nylon haversack.

                    sharing memories, raising a

               The driver flees eastward. Nicky and Elliot run across
               Madison Avenue. A snowstorm of asbestos is shooting out of a
               man hole cover west of Fifth Avenue, reducing visibility to
               near zero. Cars and people are white shadows.
          
               The two men, with collars raised and hands over heads hurry
               into a restaurant on 47th Street between Madison and Fifth.

               A small narrow room. Handsome wall paintings -- a Tuscan hill
               town. Very slow day.
          
               Nicky and Elliot sitting with a carafe of wine, a bottle of
               mineral water and some bread sticks. Glancing at menus
               intermittently.

                         I'm trying to think. When did you
                         start looking so terrible? You look
                         awful.
          
                                   ELLIOT
                         I can tell you the year, the day,
                         the night, the minute.
          
                                    NICKY
                         You used to love life. You don't
                         exude this any more.

                                   NICKY
                         Suffering. You exude a person who
                         sits in a small dark apartment
                         eating soft white bread.
          
                                    ELLIOT
                         Tonight you find out what it means
                         to suffer.

          You mean because What's-His-Name.
          
                    ELLIOT
          You will suffer because he is in
          the theater. And you will suffer a
          thousandfold when his review
          appears.
          
                    NICKY
          It's just a review.

          That's what I said eighteen months
          ago.
          
                    NICKY
          What happened eighteen months ago?
          
                    ELLIOT
          Before his Broadway days. He
          reviewed the one-act I did at the
          Fulton Fish Market. We did this
          play at four AM, outdoors in the
          rain. One performance. For the fish
          handlers.
          
                    NICKY
          And he was there?
          
                    ELLIOT
          Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every
          word of this review.
          
                    NICKY
          That's awful.
          
                    ELLIOT
          I recite it to myself with
          masochistic relish.

                    still brooding?
          
          A patron approaches the table and stares at Nicky with a
          fixed grin of crazed recognition.
          
                              MAN
                    Yessirree Bob! Yessisree Bob!
          
          Nicky's jaw becomes set and he pours himself a glass of wine
          as the man backs off.
          
                              ELLIOT
                    You don't know about obscure
                    writers, Nicky. How we have our
                    anger to nurture and love. Our
                    murderous fantasies for any amount
                    of fame, money , power and sex.

          her mid-twenties.

               The food has arrived. Nicky is eating compulsively -- in
               contrast to Elliot, who sips his mineral water, dabs his
               mouth with a napkin, looks around the restaurant between
               bites. When Nicky is finished with his food, he begins
               picking among the items on Elliot's plate. Elliot uses his
               fork to deflect Nicky's fork and the two men have a brief
               duel with utensils, fencing silently but intently, using
               knives and spoons to vary action.

               The asbestos mist still clings. Men in protective suits and
               masks move slowly, like moon walkers. Halted traffic,
               abandoned cars. Mud covering the sidewalks and shop windows.
               A gauzy stillness, dreamlike.

               Stillness. A slow whirling 360-degree shot. The kitchen area
               is empty. The door of the portable toilet is open and no one
               is inside. The makeshift wardrobe is empty except for four or
               five hangers with shirts and jackets. There is no one at the
               desk or exercise bike.
          
               A sound, faint but persistent, like an intake of air.
          
               The bathroom. The toilet bowl has been ripped out and taken
               away, leaving a hole in the floor. Brownish water drips from
               the tap into the wash basin, which is indelibly stained. The
               drip makes a two-part sound and it matches the rhythm of the
               intake of air. One-two. Pause. One-two. The bathtub has been
               sprayed by a graffiti artist. Multi-colored swirls and
               arabesques.
               S
                teven is sitting on a mat in the tub, arms in the air and
               folded so that his fists are close to his ears. He is in
               lotus position, breathing in serious meditation -- a deep
               intake of breath followed by a softer expulsion, matching the
               beat of the dripping faucet.
          
               He is still wearing the sleep mask.

               The kitchen staff is eating at a group of tables pushed
               together. Nicky's table has been absorbed by this cluster and
               he sits reading the sports section in a tabloid and having an
               espresso with his cigar.
          
               Elliot, Paisley and actor-waiter stand at the small bar in
               conversation.
          
               Next to Nicky, two kitchen workers talk about the ball game.
          
                                   FIRST MAN
                         I got a good feeling about tonight

                         beautiful last time out.

                         Plus Darryl's due for a big game.
          
                                   NICKY
                         I hate the Mets.

                                   NICKY
                         When the Mets lose, they just lose.
                         It's a flat feeling. But the Red
                         Sox -- here we have a rich history
                         of interesting ways to lose a
                         crucial game. Defeats that keep you
                         awake, that pound in your head like
                         the hammer of fate.
          
               Paisley walks across the room toward the kitchen. Nicky
               pauses to watch her, then resumes speaking.
          
                                   NICKY
                         You can analyze a Red Sox defeat
                         day and night for a month and still
                         uncover layers of complex feelings -
                         - feelings you didn't know you were
                         capable of. The pain has a memory
                         all of it's own.

               practice.

               Cramped quarters. Intensely claustrophobic. Elliot at the

                         It gets funnier. See, Nicky? They
                         chart the laughs. This from a
                         critic who lives like a fallen
                         monk. Whose address is a carefully

                         was like, reading that review at

               Elliot watches Nicky embrace Giorgio. Nicky carries the
               tabloid he'd been reading -- the "Daily News". Elliot and
               Nicky stand at the door and watch the whitish mist that
               continues to linger.

               The street is deserted. Nicky holds the newspaper over his
               face for protection. Each man has an arm in the air, trying
               to hail a taxi. They are standing near a trash receptacle
               that carries an advertisement for "New York Magazine". It is
               a reproduction of the cover that we'd glimpsed earlier in
               Joanna's apartment when her maid was reading the magazine. A
               furtive man shielding his face with the newspaper -- and a
               headline about a Phantom. Nicky and Elliot do not see the
               receptacle.
          
               A bus comes down the street with a large horizontal ad
               covering its right side. It is the same ad -- five of them
               actually, five "New York Magazine" covers side by side.
               Elliot is trying to hail a cab and doesn't notice the ad. As
               the bus bears down, Nicky steps out of the way, removing the
               newspaper from his face and getting a clear look at the five
               photos on the side of the bus -- a man concealing his face
               with a newspaper.
          
               Nicky reads the text under the logo of "New York Magazine".

               Nicky is reading the newspaper. The driver is speaking

               Nicky walks along the main aisle, looking at a woman standing
               in the poetry nook.
          
               Only a few people in the shop.
          
               He enters the back room and gets a glimpse of a woman walking
               through the opposite doorway back into the main room.
          
               He squeezes past a browser and looks through the doorway.
               Someone is just leaving the shop.
          
               He walks to the rear of the store, where the office is
               located. The door is open, the room is empty.
          
               He re-enters the main room and sees a woman seated on the top
               step of the stairway that leads to the basement stacks. Her
               back is to Nicky and she is reading a book. He approaches
               slowly and then squats by the doorway to get a closer look at
               her.
          
               She turns. It is Paisley Porter.

                         I was one of those silent,
                         listening children. Glued to the
                         shadows.

                         I was all noise. Played the radio
                         loud. Battled constantly with my
                         brother and sister. Here I am,
                         world.

               Nicky has been cornered just inside the entrance by the stage
               manager, a small, fierce woman named RENEE SIMON.

                         I can't take this anymore. He
                         forgets simple lines. He forgets
                         where to stand. We tell him and
                         tell him and tell him. I know he's
                         a sweet man. I love Peter. It's not
                         his fault. But I've never worked in
                         a show where the leading man has
          4              parasites in his brain.

               Nicky sits down in the orchestra, looking darkly into space,
               brooding. He surveys the set, a working class kitchen, behind
               it a backdrop of dark streets and looming tennaments. A
               portly well-dressed man appears, moving along the row toward
               Nicky. This is SIDNEY FABRIKANT, the producer.
          
                                   NICKY
                          aybe we ought to postpone the
                         opening.

                         Joanna loves this play. She has
                         sunk tons of money. She is
                         completely Ncommitted.
          
                                   NICKY
                           appreciate that, Sidney. But our
                         leading man can't remember his
                         lines. And his understudy can't
                         carry the play.
          
               Nicky looks out at the rehearsal in progress on stage. The
               director, JACK HASKINS and the actor PETER REDMOND
               (50)confer, move about gesturing and blocking.

                         I had lunch with Joanna. She said
                         she told you about Peter. You
                         weren't concerned, she said.

                         worried about this kid who writes
                         these reviews?
          
               Nicky looks across the theatre. Paisley Porter sits alone,
               tenth row center, watching rehearsal with rapt attention.
          
                                   NICKY
                          'm not worried about this kid.
          
                                   SIDNEY
                         Well I am. Worried sick. Everybody
                         quotes Steven Schwimmer. He's here
                         to announce the death of
                         civilization. He kills a play every
                         time he farts.
          
                                   NICKY
                         Postpone. We have every right.
          
                                   SIDNEY
                         Too late. All the elements are in
                         place. Delay the opening and we
                         lose the theater.

                         I feel shaky about one line in
                         particular. If I can get past this
                         line. I think I can handle the last
                         long speech.
          
                                   RENEE
                         Which line, Peter?
          
                                   PETER
                         The Son says to the Father, This
                         could be it.
          
                                   NICKY
                         And the Father replies?
          
                                   PETER
                         That's the line I can't ever, for
                         the life of me remember. I just
                         can't get it.
          
                                   JACK
                         It's the same line. The Father
                         simply repeats what the Son says to
                         him.

                         I know it sounds easy. But
                         something happens between the time
                         I hear the line and the time I'm
                         suppose to Jrepeat it.

                         There's a certain kind of wounded
                         young man who uses his oddness to
                         get laid. Is that our Steven?
          
                                   PAISLEY
                         If I'm sleeping with him, and I
                         haven't said I am, then so what?
          
                                   NICKY
                             (quietly)
                         So everything. That's so what. So I
                         begin to hate him. So I want to do
                         him grave harm.
          
                                   PAISLEY
                         But you don't even know me. How can
                         you care what I do with whom?
          
                                   NICKY
                         I know you both. Enough. How much
                         knowledge does it take before a man
                         does something crazy.
          
                                   PAISLEY
                         Do you want to talk about doing
                         crazy things.
          
                                   NICKY
                         Yes.
          
                                   PAISLEY

               The Port-O-San. Steven emerges and goes to the stacked
               cardboard boxes against the wall. His hate mail. He is
               wearing a bath towel like a prayer shawl over his sweat
               clothes.
          
               He drags one of the boxes to the ratty armchair. He sits in
               the chair by the filthy window that looks west toward the
               early-setting sun.
          
               He takes a letter from the box, opens it, reads it, lets it
               fall to the floor. Takes another letter, opens it --
          
               There is a knock at the door.
          
               Steven tenses, does not move.
          
               Another knock.
          
               He moves warily toward the door.
          
                                   PAISLEY (V.O.)
                         Steven, it's me. Will you open
                         please.

                         You've come to me. I wanted to

               prowls the loft.
          
                                   PAISLEY
                         In other words I never understood
                         until today how much pain and
                         anxiety you've been causing with
                         your reviews. Steven, it's so
                         unfair.
          
                                   STEVEN
                         Of course it's unfair. The truth is
                         always unfair. Why do you think I
                         live this way? Hiding out. Stealing
                         electricity from a lamp post.
                         Because people who write the truth
                         are outcasts of society. I can't
                         live openly, in a nice clean
                         doorman building, with my name on
                         the mailbox. They'd come after me
                         in packs.

                         Not if you stopped hurting people.
                         Write the truth gently.

                         The truth is never gentle. Listen
                         to me carefully. Each of us lives
                         in the thinnest possible wrapping
                         of wishes and dreams. Truth is the
                         force that penetrates this wispy
                         skin. It hurts and maims.

                         Look how they hate me for telling
                         the truth. It's an education,

                         past and one future. I thought I

                         I don't want you, Steven.

               Elliot looks up and sees Paisley emerging from Steven's
               building. He crosses the street toward her.

               Nicky walking slowly backwards, arm raised, trying to hail a
               cab. It is getting dark. He glances left, sees a large two-
               panel poster in front of the theater. One half is a black-and-
               white photo -- a younger Nicky Rogan, in a tuxedo, holding an
               award in his raised hand.
          
               The other half is all type --

               He sees someone enter the theater lobby. It is his daughter
               Laurel. He follows, catching up to her at the end of a short
               line of people at the ticket window.
          
                                   NICKY
                         Laurel. Tickets are all set. I
                         double-checked.

                           I know -- why should a bitter
                           divorce interfere with tradition?
          
               Laurel reaches the window and speaks to the clerk.
          
                                     LAUREL
                           Rogan, Laurel. You also have a

                           I don't have a date. I don't want a
                           date.
          
               They leave the window with Laurel's ticket.

                           And you blame me. It's because we
                           never talk. Let's talk.

                           Can we talk later? Will you be at
                           the party?

                           I'm not sure.
          
               She is out the door, hurrying across the street. Nicky stands
               under the marquee, calling out to her.
          
                                      NICKY
                           I'll find you. After the show.

               Michael, Nicky's father, is making an omelette on the old

               Michael is eating his omelette at a small enamel-topped table
               in the kitchen. Nicky stands by the boxlike refrigerator,
               drinking a beer. This is the kitchen that is the centerpiece

                         small this place is. How did we do
                         it? Five people in these little
                         rooms.

                         I do know the answer to that. Why

                         We'll go to Mannion's.

                    the season. Against the Yankees.
                    The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they
                    lost on Sunday. First I cried for
                    twenty-four hours. Then I had fist-
                    fights the rest of the week.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    It's one thing for kids. You get
                    older, you Nhave other things.
          
                              NICKY
                    It's all connected, Pop. It's one
                    life. Baseball is memory. How do
                    fathers and sons show their love?
                    They go to a ball game together.
                    Thirty-five years later, they sit
                    in the kitchen and remember.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    But the son is suppose to stop
                    crying.
          
                              NICKY
                    I could have grown up happy. A
                    Yankee fan. A divorce lawyer.
          
          Nicky sees his father's glasses on a shelf above the stove.
          He puts them on the table.
          
                              NICKY
                    You'll need these. Tonight. For the
                    play.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Don't make me sit through one of
                    your plays.
          
                                                                       43.
          
          
          
                                   NICKY
                         Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the
                         commotion of opening night. But I
                         especially want you to see this
                         play. It's new territory for me.
                         And for you too. I have to know
                         what you think.
          
                                   MICHAEL
                         Since when did that matter?
          
                                   NICKY
                         Let's not start that again.
          
                                   MICHAEL
                         My back is killing me.
          
                                   NICKY
                         Where's your elastic brace?
          
                                   MICHAEL
                         I can't find it.
          
                                   NICKY
                         You're suppose to wear it when your
                         back gives you trouble.
          
                                   MICHAEL
                         I lost it. I lose everything.
          
                                   NICKY
                         I'll go get you another one. You
                         have to wear it.
          
               Nicky takes a roll off the counter, makes a sandwich for his
               scrambled eggs, takes a bite and heads for the door.
          
                                   NICKY
                         Be right back. Take a good look at
                         me.
          
               Michael puts on his glasses.
          
                                   MICHAEL
                         So I know who I'm letting in.
          
               Nicky leaves the apartment.
          
               EXT. THE STREET
          59                                                             59
               The man in the cutaway dances with his doll. The tape machine
               plays "In The Still of the Night.
          
                           
          
                                                                       44.
          
          
               " The street is completely empty except for the dancer.
               Nicky, a small paper bag in his hand, reenters his father's
               building.
          
               INT. MICHAEL ROGAN'S LIVING ROOM
          60                                                             60
               The room bears some resemblance to the living room set at
               the Barrymore. Michael sits at the end of the sofa, weary.
               Nicky is taking an athletic bandage -- about four feet long
               and three inches wide -- out of the package.
          
               He sits in a chair that is set perpendicular to Michael's end
               of the sofa, so that Nicky is looking at his father in
               profile.
          
                                   MICHAEL
                         `Why doesn't he come live with us?'
                         Because everything is here.
          
                                   NICKY
                         I know, Pop.
          
                                   MICHAEL
                         I'm lucky they don't knock down the
                         building. It could happen anytime.
                         And everything worth remembering is
                         right here.
          
                                   NICKY
                         I think the building's okay. At
                         least for the time being.
          
                                   MICHAEL
                         You didn't think it was okay when
                         you lived here. You wanted to get
                         out so fast I thought you were
                         running a marathon.
          
                                   NICKY
                         Normal boy's ambition. I like
                         coming back. You know that.
          
                                    MICHAEL
                         You tell your friends your father
                         used to work the docks. Callused
                         hands. But you had an attitude when
                         you were growing up that wasn't
                         easy for your mother and me to
                         understand.
          
               Nicky is gradually unbuttoning his father's shirt so that he
               can wrap the bandage around the old man's chest and back.

                                    NICKY
                         I was in a hurry to do big things,
                         make big mistakes. Any mistakes
                         were okay as long as it was big.
                         But I'm trying to see these things
                         clearly and honestly. That's the
                         play they're going to kill starting
                         tonight. There's a guy out there
                         getting ready to rip it apart. And
                         that's us. Who we were and where we
                         come from.
          
                                   MICHAEL
                         So what are you going to do about
                         it?
          
                                   NICKY
                         What do you want me to do?
          
                                   MICHAEL
                         Show him who we are.
          
               Nicky takes off the shirt.
          
               Michael struggles out of his T-shirt and we see that he is
               wearing the elastic bandage he thought he had lost.
          
               He is sitting with his head tilted up, eyes closed, and is
               unaware that he is wearing the bandage.
          
               Nicky takes the new bandage, winds it tightly and puts it
               back in the box.
          
               His father has gone to sleep.

               It is dark and cold. Nicky emerges and walks west, diagonally
               across the street, to a barbershop on the other side of Ninth
               Avenue.
          
                lliot is on the stoop waiting for him.

               Nicky sits in the barber chair. Elliot pulls up a customer's
               chair and sits with his back to the mirror, more or less
               facing Nicky. The barber, an elderly hawk-eyed man named
               Dodgie, begins his preparations for Nicky's haircut.
          
                                   NICKY
                         He carries a gun.
          
                                                                  46.
          
          
          
                              ELLIOT
                    Then you should carry a gun.
          
          He places the sheet over Nicky's upper body and fastens it at
          the neck.
          
                              NICKY
                    I used to carry a gun when I drove
                    a cab.
          
                              ELLIOT
                    Where is it?
          
                              NICKY
                    I gave it away. I thought, I'm a
                    writer now.
          
                              ELLIOT
                    That was a big mistake.
          
                              DODGIE
                    You should never be without a gun.
                    In this city?
          
                              ELLIOT
                    If he carries a gun, you have to
                    carry a gun.
          
                              NICKY
                    We're making too much of this.
          
                              ELLIOT
                    No, we're not.
          
                              NICKY
                    I'm not a lonely spooky writer like
                    you. Nursing a hundred grudges. I'm
                    a man who loves life.
          
                              ELLIOT
                    We're talking about something
                    deeper than grudges. How do we
                    respond to personal attack?
          
                              DODGIE
                    In this city? And you don't carry a
                    gun?
          
                              ELLIOT
                    How do we maintain our dignity and
                    self-respect?
          
                                                                  47.
          
          
          
                              NICKY
                    In other words why should we suffer
                    silently at this kind of abuse? The
                    man is out there ruining lives.
          
                              ELLIOT
                    It's your best play, Nicky.
          
                              NICKY
                    He'll hate it.
          
                              ELLIOT
                    He'll kill it. He'll write a review
                    so devastating it will shatter your
                    career and cause the most
                    unmanageable psychic grief. What
                    happens to your apartment on the
                    East River? Your house in
                    Connecticut, where you watch things
                    grow.
          
          Dodgie goes to the cabinet on which the cash register sits.
          He opens the cabinet door, slides out a drawer and removes
          some hand towels. There is something there he wants Nicky to
          see. An old pockmarked revolver.
          
          Nicky sees the gun.
          
                              NICKY
                    We were thinking of putting in a
                    pool.

                              ELLIOT
                    There are things that speak to us
                    from the past.

                    In this city you don't walk five
                    feet out the door and there is
                    somebody trying to take what's
                    yours.
          
                                                                  48.

                    Your truth is locked in your past.
                    Find it. Know it for what it is.
                        (beat)
                    Shoot him, Nicky.
          
                                 NICKY
                    Shoot him.
          
                              ELLIOT
                    The American theater doesn't need
                    people like that.
          
                              NICKY
                    Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we
                    really mean it. But where does he
                    live?
          
                              ELLIOT
                    Keep going west. Last building
                    before the river.
          
                               NICKY
                    How do you Eknow.

                    What do you mean?
          
                              ELLIOT
                    About an hour and a half ago. I saw
                    her come out of a place. She said
                    she was visiting a friend. But she
                    wouldn't tell me who.
          
                              NICKY
                    Had to be him.
          
                              ELLIOT
                    She was very evasive.
          
          Nicky gets out of the chair. Dodgie removes the sheet for him
          and Elliot smooths down his clothes and hair, like a pair of
          grooms attending a warrior.
          
          Nicky goes to the cabinet, gets the gun. He returns to the
          chair.
          
                              NICKY
                    I'm enjoying this more every
                    minute.

               Elliot takes an after-dinner candy out of his pocket -- the
               candy he pocketed in the Italian restaurant after lunch. He
               blows the lint off and eats it.

               Crowds of people pouring down the ramps from the train
               station, hurrying, late.
          
               The umpire's room -- six men nibbling cookies, smoking a last-
               minute cigarette, adjusting equipment.
          
               An unidentified room somewhere in there lower reaches of the

               Steven in front of a full-length mirror near the bed, putting
               on a bulletproof vest, which gives him a solid appearance,
               bulking his caved-in chest and concealing his pot belly.
          
               Steven putting on black trousers, a brash shirt with a bright
               bow tie, which he tips slightly askew. A pair of black and
               white shoes with elevator heels. Then his shoulder holster.
          
               Steven leaning over the coffee table, inserting bullets into
               the chamber of the revolver.
          
               With the gun in his holster, he stands in front of the
               mirror. Takes the gun out, aims it, puts it back in the
               holster.
          
               Does a dazzling karate move.

               The driver is a black woman around fifty. Next to her in the
               front seat is her grandson, Matthew, who is ten.
          
               The interior of the taxi is homelike. A plastic drinking cup
               magnetically rooted to the dashboard. A small battery-
               operated fan next to the cup. The steering wheel is
               upholstered. There are family photographs on the dashboard
               and visors.
          
               Matthew's schoolbooks are next to him on the front seat. He
               is doing his homework.

                           Put your face in the mirror. I know
                           I recognize you from somewhere.

                    Matthew, look at him. When I lived
                    in Roxbury, the media followed this
                    man everywhere. He was bigger than
                    ten movie stars.
                        (to Nicky)
                    Where's your white Lincoln limo?
          
          Nicky is delighted at the mistake and alters his voice
          slightly, using a gangsterish inflection.

                    hospital shift, so I pick him up at
                    school. We stop for a meal usually
                    around this time. He does his
                    homework and gets some experience
                    meeting people. But we never had a
                    famous mobster before.

                         The whole thing is my fault. I took
                         unfair advantage of your patience
                         and understanding. You understand
                         me.

                         You know why, don't you? Because I
                         am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.

                         You smoked because I smoked. We
                         were falling in love, remember? I
                         used to see certain movies only
                         because you had seen them. I wanted
                         to see what you saw.

                            thought her apartment was too
                            impersonal.

               strikes.
          
               Sound begins to fade. Wilson fouls off a pitch. Wilson takes
               a ball, outside. Wilson fouls off another pitch.
          
               Absolute, unnatural silence.
          
               Stanley prepares to throw. The silence suddenly breaks and

                Frozen moment: Buckner holding his glove hand aloft, the ball
                securely gripped. In the drama of the moment, Buckner seems

                Light from a flashlight plays across the seats and walls. The

                The crowd is slowly breaking up. A few people still clustered
                near the TV sets, which are showing replays.
          
                Nicky is standing alone near a small set at the back on the
                room. His clothing torn and stained. One shoe and pants leg
                dripping wet. A bruise on his forehead.
          
                He is watching a replay.

                Wilson hits the ball. It bounces twice, then goes under
                Buckner's glove. Knight scores from the third with the
                winning run. A 6-5 victory for the Mets.
          
                The main light in the tavern goes out. The TV sets keep
                replaying Buckner's error. Regular speed, slow motion, color,
                black and white.

                On the sofa, Laurel is straddling Steven, whose shirt is
                almost completely off, exposing his bulletproof vest. Laurel

                Steven begins removing the cosmetic putty around his
                naturally shallow chin. He uses Laurel's hair clip to scrape
                his jaw clean. Then he peels off his fake mustache. And
                borrows Laurel's dangling bra cup to wipe the bronzing agent

                          or that I saw because she had seen
                          them, and I'd say, `Watch him kick
                          in the door with one kick,' And it
                          might be Steve McQueen or Jeff
                          Chandler, holding the gun up like
                          this, and he would turn and kick
                          the door and it would fly open at
                          once, and I would say to Lillian,
                          `How completely phony. Whoever made
                          this movie has no idea how hard it

                          But it's not easy to kick in a
                          door. I knew they would lose and
                          they lost, so what are we so upset
                          about? They lost tonight, they'll

                We hear what he is saying in overlapping echoes and we

                Steven flees toward the shadows at the back of the loft, his
                hand moving toward the gun in his shoulder holster.
          
                Nicky picks up his gun and begins to stalk him.
          
                Steven fires twice striking a nearby lamp. The room is dark
                now. Lit only by the blue glow of the TV.
          
                The TV sports roundup, which has been showing football
                highlights, has switched to baseball -- highlights of the Red
                Sox-Mets.
          
                Nicky reaches Laurel.
          
                   
          
                                                                   79.
          
          
          
                              NICKY
                        (crying out)
                    This is my daughterrrrr!
          
          Steven is wide-eyed at the news.
          
                              LAUREL
                    I don't think he knew, Daddy.
          
          Nicky sees the photo of Steven and his cat. He shoots twice,
          blows it away.
          
                              LAUREL
                    Daddy, I'm sorry. But he was so
                    beautiful. I trusted him. When I
                    saw what he really looks like --
          
          A voice from shadows:
          
                              STEVEN
                        (OS)
                    Am I really so deeply repugnant?
          
                              LAUREL
                    Yes.
          
                              NICKY
                    Go home, Laurel. Tell your mother I
                    will be late.
          
          Nicky walks toward Steven's voice, toward the shadows.
          
                              NICKY
                    You're going to die. You're a dead
                    man. You're dead.
          
          He notices Laurel following behind him.
          
                              NICKY
                    Look. I'm sorry you keep running
                    into dishonest men. But you're only
                    eighteen. We can still turn it
                    around.
          
                              LAUREL
                    Except I won't have a father
                    anymore.
          
                              NICKY
                    I'll see you all the time. I'll get
                    a place right nearby. One room. No
                    distractions. We'll talk.
          
                                                                     80.
          
          
          
          He shouts into the darkness.
          
                              NICKY
                    YOU'RE DEAD!
          
          Laurel puts her hand on his shoulder.
          
                              LAUREL
                    What will we talk about?
          
                              NICKY
                    Everything.
          
          Nicky sees one of the New York Magazine ads, Steven
          Schwimmer's face mounted on the cardboard. He fires three
          times, wiping out Schwimmer's eyes.
          
                               LAUREL
                    Will I believe you when you tell me
                    something?
          
                              NICKY
                    There's nothing left for me to lie
                    about.
          
          Nicky starts into the darkness only to see Steven emerge from
          the shadows, his gun lowered. Oddly, he seems distracted by
          something on another part of the room. He is looking at the
          TV set on the counter.
          
          Nicky watches him approach the kitchen area. He follows, gun
          raised.
          
          Steven sits on a stool to watch TV.
          
          Nicky approaches warily, his gun aimed at Steven's head,
          which is blue-lit by the TV screen.
          
                              NICKY
                    You're dead. I see you on a morgue
                    slab drained of all fluids.
          
          Laurel follows at a distance to see what they're so
          interested in.
          
          Nicky puts the gun muzzle flush against Steven's temple.
          
                              NICKY
                    I see the outline of your body in
                    chalk on this very floor.
          
                                                                   81.
          
          
          
                              LAUREL
                        (whispering)
                    Daddy, wait.
          
          Steven is watching slow-motion footage of Bill Buckner
          missing the slow roller.
          
                              STEVEN
                    Then they lost?
          
                              NICKY
                    Why does it matter?
          
                              STEVEN
                    If they lost tonight, they'll lose
                    tomorrow. It's all over.
          
                              NICKY
                    Why do you care?
          
                              STEVEN
                    They're my team.
          
                              NICKY
                    No. They're not your team. They're
                    my team.
          
          Nicky cocks the hammer.
          
                              STEVEN
                    They're my team, too. I grew up on
                    Boyleston Street. Right by Fenway
                    Park. I went to fifty or sixty
                    games a year. All by myself. I was
                    one of those kids with scabby
                    elbows. I called out to the
                    players. `Look over here. Hi, I'm
                    Steven. My parents are divorced.'
          
                              NICKY
                    I went to college in Boston so I
                    could be near the Red Sox. I took
                    summer classes and the cut them to
                    go to the game. My wife is from
                    Boston. Lillian Ziegler?
          
                              STEVEN
                    The Red Sox were my world. I
                    surrendered my existence to a team
                    that couldn't win the big one.
          
                                                          82.
          
          
          
                              NICKY
                    If you're such a devoted fan, why
                    were you at the play tonight
                    instead of the game? Answer
                    carefully. This is important. You
                    could have gone to the theater last
                    night. There was no game last
                    night.
          
                              STEVEN
                    Because I can't bear to watch. When
                    they lose, I die inside. It's like
                    some little person named Steve just
                    crumples up and dies. I wait for
                    the scores. I still die, hearing
                    the scores, but it's over in a
                    second. I can't survive the game
                    pitch by pitch, inning by inning.
                    I've done it too many times. And I
                    can't do it anymore.
          
          Nicky lowers the gun.
          
                              NICKY
                    I was six years old the day Pesky
                    hesitated throwing home and
                    Slaughter scored all the way from
                    first. That's when I knew the Red
                    Sox were my team. Pity and terror.
          
                              STEVEN
                    When I traveled through Asia this
                    summer, I went to tremendous
                    trouble and expense to rent a car
                    with a phone so I could call up
                    Sports Phone in New York and get
                    the scores. I drove through the war
                    in Afghanistan calling Sports Phone
                    like every hour on the hour, for
                    updates.
          
                              NICKY
                    What about my play?
          
                              LAUREL
                    Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
          
                              STEVEN
                    It's your best play, Nicky.
          
                              LAUREL
                    See, Daddy.
          
                                                                  83.
          
          
          
                              STEVEN
                    I've seen it twice. I went back
                    tonight to be sure. It's a brave
                    and honest piece of work.
          
                                 LAUREL
                    What else?
          
                              STEVEN
                    An artistry and sensitivity you've
                    never shown before.
          
                              NICKY
                    And you're not saying that because
                    of the gun in my hand?
          
                              STEVEN
                    You're out of bullets.
          
          Nicky points the gun at the palm of his own left hand and
          pulls the trigger. A click.
          
                              LAUREL
                    See, Daddy.
          
                              STEVEN
                    And Peter Redmond helped immensely.
                    These pauses were exquisitely
                    timed. He made us wait and wait. He
                    built a gorgeous tension and
                    suspense.
          
                              NICKY
                    We worked very hard on the pauses.
          
          Nicky places it on the counter.
          
                              STEVEN
                    I called Sports Phone from Lhasa,
                    Tibet. Freezing in my little rented
                    Fiat. Sheep on a hillside. Rocky
                    debris dating back millions and
                    millions of years, from the time
                    the Himalayas thrust up when the
                    plates of India and Asia collided.
                    Red Sox 3, White Sox 2. A moment in
                    the history of the world.
          
          Nicky takes Steven's head and moves it tenderly against his
          chest. When Nicky releases the head, he has Steven's toupee
          in his hand. He looks at it briefly, then hands it to Laurel.
          
                                                                           84.

                A yellow taxi comes speeding past, moving eastward on 48th
                Street. We see it from various perspectives and elevations.
                It is a large checkered cab, the only thing moving in the
                night. Steam comes billowing from funnel vents. The taxi
                catches every light just before it turns red.

                Nicky is driving, his face showing intense satisfaction.
                Laurel sits next to him.
          
                Driver's name plate ---

                The driver sits in the middle of the rear seat, looking
                somewhat nervous.

                The taxi crosses Park Avenue, speeding past the bronze statue
                of a man hailing a cab.
          
                It approaches First Avenue, where a road divider bisects the
                thoroughfare. Nicky swings into a sharp turns, barely
                averting contact with the divider, and stops abruptly.
          
                Three doors open. On the empty street, Nicky hands the driver
                a wad of bills. Then he and Laurel step over the divider. He
                puts his arm around her shoulders and they cross the avenue
                to the glass tower where they live.
          
                The sun begins to climb out of the East River.
          
          
          
                                       THE END
