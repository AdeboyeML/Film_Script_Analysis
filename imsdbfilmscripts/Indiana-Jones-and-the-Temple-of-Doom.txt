                                --------------

       FADE IN:

1.     INT.  "THE DRAGON" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT                            1.

       A Chinese GONG SOUNDS and the glittering doors of an art Deco pa-
       poda slide open to reveal a mammoth silver stairway down which
       rows of beautiful women start descending   (BEGIN MAIN TITLES)

       The lovely ladies are a mix of races and they sing a strange,
       haunting melody -- one might think them a heavenly choir, if it
       weren't for their sexy, clinging lame gowns.

2.     INT.  CLUB ENTRANCE                                             2.

       From the ethereal beauties, we cut to a street urchin's dirty
       face: SHORT ROUND is a ten-year-old Chinese kis wearing a beat-
       up American baseball cap.

       Sneaking into the club, Short Round weaves past the fancy gowns
       and silk suits, heading toward the music in the main ballroom.

3.     INT.  THE BALLROOM                                              3.

       Short Round enters and stares across the smoky nightclub.  On the
       stage, he sees a giant paper-mache dragon laying curled around
       the pagoda.

       Now, the dragon's eyes light up, its nostrils exhale smoke and
       its enormous jaws open.  Out of the dragon's mouth walks the star
       of the stage show:

       WILLIE SCOTT, a dreamy beauty singing a sultry solo white the or-
       chestra wails the accompaniment.

       But Short Round's not here to ogle crooning dames.  He surveys
       the rich Chinese, American and European revelers.  Jewels flash
       and champagne flows.  Short Round finally spots a table of
       somber-looking Chinese men in suits.

       Short Round chews gum and stares at the men.  Then he turns to
       go.  WU HAN, a waiter with a scar across his cheek, watches Short
       Round leave.

4.     INT.  CLUB ENTRANCE                                            4.

       As Short Round hurries toward the exit, he bumps into a man in a
       tuxedo entering the club.  Short Round looks up at the man, but
       we don't see his face.

       Then Short Round is grabbed by the scruff of his neck and a door-
       man hustles him out the door, Short Round yelling insults all the
       way.

       A maitre d' apologizes to the man in the tuxedo and two hat-check
       girls smile at him familiarly as he continues into the ballroom.
       We notice something incongruous:  the man in the tuxedo is wear-
       ing work boots caked with mud.

5.     INT.  THE BALLROOM                                             5.

       The man in the tuxedo stops to watch Willie Scott singing sexily
       on the stage.  Then he looks around and sees the table of somber
       Chinese men that Short Round spotted earlier.

       As the man in the tuxedo walks toward the table, he removes a
       cigarette from a silver case.  He arrives at the table just as
       the chorus and orchestra reach a crescendo --

       And on the stage, a glistening, muscular slave swings a huge ham-
       mer toward an enormous brass gong --

       The man in the tuxedo leans to receive a light from a cigarette-
       girl and, as the GONG BOOMS, the match flares to reveal his face
       for the first time:

       It's INDIANA JONES.  Elegant in a tuxedo -- dressed to kill.  The
       TITLES END and over this a legend appears on the screen:

                                SHANGHAI - 1935

       At the table, the four Chinese man in suits stare coldly at Indi-
       ana.

                                   LAO
                       Dr. Jones.

                                   INDIANA
                       Lao She.

                                   LAO
                       Nee chin lie how ma?

       Lao's men laugh and assume that Indy doesn't understand his joke.

                                   INDIANA
                       Wah hung how, nee nah?  Wah hwey
                       hung jing chee jah loo nee kao
                       soo wah shu shu.

       LAO SHE looks angry and his men's smiles fade.

                                   LAO
                       You never told me you spoke my
                       language, Dr. Jones.

                                   INDIANA
                       I don't like to show off.

       Indiana takes a seat across the table from Shanghai's notorious
       crime-lord.  Lao is fifty, wealthy enough to now display some
       fat, but still muscular from his fight to the top of the garbage
       heap.

                                   LAO
                       For this special occasion, I
                       ordered champagne and caviar.

       Indiana looks at the pile of caviar on the plate in front of him
       -- and stubs his cigarette out in it.  The cigarette sizzles and
       Lao's smiles dies with it.

       There's applause as Wille Scott finishes her song.  At the
       table, Lao stares at Indiana with a strange intensity.

                                   LAO
                       So, it is true, Dr. Jones?  you
                       found Nurhachi?

                                   INDIANA
                       Sure, I found him.  Then last
                       night I had a little trouble.
                       Somebody tried to slit my throat.

       Indiana looks across the table at Lao's son, CHEN, who resembles
       a bulldog and snarls like one now.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       It was dark, but I think one of
                       your sons tried to get Nurhachi
                       without paying for him.

       Indy stares pointedly at Chen's recently bandaged hand.  Chen
       mutters and stands angrily -- Lao barks a command in Chinese and
       Chen sits down again.

                                   LAO
                       You have insulted my son.

                                   INDIANA
                       Next time I'll cut off more than
                       his finger.

                                   LAO
                       Dr. Jones -- I want Nurhachi.

       Lao pulls a wad of cash out of his pocket and puts it on the
       table.  Indiana glances at it.

                                   INDIANA
                       As I recall the deal was consid-
                       erably more.

       Now a pretty hand slips onto Lao's shoulder and he looks up to
       see Willie Scott.  Lao kisses her hand.  Willie is unaware of the
       explosive mood at the table and she smiles flirtaciously at Indi-
       ana.

                                   WILLIE
                                   (to Lao)
                       Aren't you going to introduce
                       us?

                                   LAO
                       This is Willie Scott.
                             (watching Indy)
                       And this is Indiana Jones, the
                       famous archaeologist.

       Willie sits down between Lao and Indy.  She takes out a small
       mirror to check her make-up.

                                   LAO (Cont'd)
                       Dr. Jones found Nurhachi for me
                       and is about to deliver him --
                       now.

       Lao nods across the table and Indy sees KAO KAN, Lao's second
       son, open his coat and remove a silver-plated pistol.  Indiana
       looks worried.  Willie doesn't notice as she fixes her make-up
       and coyly teases Indiana.

                                   WILLIE
                       Well -- I thought archaeologists
                       were always funny little men
                       searching for their mummies --
                                  (yelping)
                       Aaahhh!

       She looks down terrified at the knife Indy is poking against her
       ribs.

                                   WILLE (Cont'd)
                       I was only kidding, can't you
                       take a joke -- ?
                                  (to Lao)
                       Lao, he's got a knife!

                                   INDIANA
                       Put the gun away, sonny.

       Kao Kan glances at his father.  Lao finally nods to his son and
       he slips the pistol back into his pocket.

                                   INDIANA
                       Now I suggest you pay me what you
                       promised -- or your girlfriend
                       here is going to be squealing a
                       new tune.

       The ritzy patrons at the tables nearby are unaware of the tawdry
       drama quietly unfolding at this table.

       Willie eyes the blade and whimpers.  She looks imploringly at Lao
       and he slowly reaches into his pocket.  He puts ten gold coins
       next to the cash on the table.

       Indy leans forward to look at the gold coins -- so intently that
       he fails to notice Kao Kan spilling some powder into Indy's cham-
       pagne glass!

                                   INDIANA
                       Try again Lao -- the deal was
                       more.

       The knife pokes Willie and she whimpers again.  Lao reaches into
       another pocket and brings out a folded piece of rice paper -- he
       opens it and a large diamond and ruby spill out onto the table.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Bingo...you see, Lao, with a
                       but of persuasion, even you can
                       be an honest fellow.

       Indy smiles and jabs the knife into the middle of the table.
       Then he lifts his champagne glass in a toast to Lao -- who
       watches expectantly as Indiana moves the glass toward his lips --

       Suddenly Willie stands angrily, jostling Indy's arm so that he
       doesn't drink his champagne.

                                   WILLIE
                       Look at this!  He put a hole
                       in my dress from Paris!

       Lao sees Indy put his champagne glass down and he snarls at Wil-
       lie --

                                   LAO
                       Sit down!

       Willie quickly obeys.  Lao forces a smile at Indy and lifts his
       glass to seal the deal --

                                   LAO (Cont'd)
                       To your health, Dr. Jones.

       Lao sips hs champagne and watches hopefully as Indy picks up his
       glass and this time Indy does drink the champagne. Then he
       reaches for the cash --

       But Chen grins and puts a silver snuff bottle next to the cash,
       gold and jewels -- he tips the little bottle over and some white
       powder spills out of it --

                                   INDIANA
                       What's that?

                                   LAO
                       A bonus, Dr. Jones.  That is
                       poison.  You just drank the
                       rest of it.

       Indiana examines his champagne glass and sees a residue at the
       bottom of it.  He swallows and feels sick, wondering it it's fear
       or the poison already taking effect.

                                   LAO (Cont'd)
                       There is an antidote for this
                       poison.  You give me Nurhachi --
                       I give you the antidote.

       Indiana is sweating.  Willie looks at him and sees Indy's hand
       shaking.

                                   LAO (Cont'd)
                       The poison works fast, Dr. Jones.
                       Where is Nurhachi?

       Indiana finally reaches into his pocket.  Next to the cash, gold,
       jewels and poison, Indiana sets down a beautiful small box.  Lao
       and his men stare hypnotically at the exquisite gold and enamel
       box.

                                   WILLIE
                                (nervously)
                       This Nurhachi's a very small guy.

       Nobody pays any attention to her as Lao reaches for the box.

                                   INDIANA
                       Inside are the remains of Nur-
                       hachi -- the first Emperor of the
                       Manchu Dynasty.

       Lao opens the box carefully and stares reverently at the grey
       powder inside.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Now what about the antidote,
                       Lao.

                                   LAO
                             (holding the box)
                       At last I have the ashes of my
                       sacred ancestor!

                                   WILLIE
                       So, what's the big deal?  Let
                       me see it --

       Qillie grabs Lao's arm and some of the precious ashes spill out
       of the gold box.  Stunned by this desecration of his ancestor,
       Lao grabs Willie by the wrist and twists her arm --

                                   LAO
                       You fool!

                                   WILLIE
                       Ow, you're hurting me, you miser-
                       able little hood!

                                   INDIANA
                       Let go of her, Lao.  And give me
                       the antidote.

       Lao just laughs evilly -- until a waiter moves up behind Lao and
       the crimelord suddenly stiffens.  He lets go of Willie's wrist
       and raises his hands off the table.  Chen stops collecting the
       money and jewels.

       Kao Kan tenses and Indy smiles at Wu Han, the Chinese waiter with
       the scar, who is standing behind Lao.  Wu Han has a towel over
       his hand  --  under it, he has a pistol pressed against Lao's
       spine.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                              (smiling at Wu Han)
                       I like the service here.

                                   WILLIE
                                  (puzzled)
                       Hey, he's not a waiter...

                                   INDIANA
                       No, Wu Han's an old friend I
                       brought along.
                                   (to Lao)
                       So, the game's not over. Put
                       the antidote on the table, Lao.

       Lao carefully reaches into his pocket and puts a small glass vial
       of liquid next to the cash, gold, jewels, poison and sacred box.
       Indy looks relieved as he reaches for the vial of antidote --
       then he hears a muffled report!  And another!

       Wu Han groans and sways.  Indy starts to stand but Chen immedi-
       ately turns the smoking pistol with the silencer that he used to
       kill Wu Han -- Indy sees it pointed at him now and he remains in
       his seat.

       Kao Kan stands and grabs Wu Han, easing the phoney waiter into
       the chair he just vacated.  The muffled shooting hasn't attracted
       any attention.  The nightclub activity continues an Indy speaks
       emotionally to his dying friend.

                                   INDIANA
                       Wu Han  --  listen to me  --  I'm
                       going to get you out of here.

       In pain, Wu Han looks at Indy and struggles to speak --

                                   WU HAN
                       Not this time, my friend...
                             (smiling bravely)
                       I followed you on many adventures --
                       but into the great Unknown Mystery,
                       I go first, Indy...

       Wu Han dies and slumps forward.  Indiana is shattered by the
       death of his old friend.

                                   LAO
                       Don't be sad, Dr. Jones -- you
                       will soon join him.

       Indy's gaze shifts from his dead friend to Lao's sneering face.
       Then Indy sees the murderous Chen giggling perversely.  Indy's
       anger is compounded by the poison burning in his gut and his vis-
       ion of Chen's ugly face blurs into a double image --

       Indy stands up unsteadily.  Chen assumes he's about to keel over
       from the poison -- but Indy suddenly turns and grabs a real wai-
       ter at another table.  The waiter holds a long skewer of roasted
       pigeons that he's just set afire --

       Indy grabs the skewer of pigeons flambee and hurls is across the
       table!  Chen fires and misses -- and screams as the skewer stabs
       into his chest and the burning pigeons flame in front of his hor-
       rified face!

       This the other tables definitely notice.  There are screams and
       all hell breaks loose.  Indiana shoves past Willie and reaches
       for the vial on the table --

                                   INDIANA
                       The antidote -- !

       But he's grabbed from behind by Kao Kan.  Indy elbows the punk,
       reaches back and grabs his head -- and somersaults Kao Kan onto
       the table!

       As nubmer two son crashes into the table, the impact sends the
       Emperor Nurhachi's ashes billowing into Lao's stricken face!

       Indiana yells as he sees the vial of antidote rolling across the
       table -- and falling!

       Indiana dives and catches the antidote just before it hits the
       floor -- then Indy's hand is brutally stomped on by one of Lao's
       henchmen and the vial rolls away.

       Indiana angrily raises his head, smashing it up into the hench-
       man's groin -- the man howls like a banshee and hobbles away.
       
       Meanwhile, Willie watches Lao grabbing for cash from the table.
       Willie lunges past the pigeon-skewered Chen to snatch the jewels,
       but unfortunately Kao Kan knocks them off the table as he leaps
       to attack Indy.

       Indiana scrambles on his hands and knees after the rolling vial.
       People keep kicking it -- he almost has it when Willie runs into
       him, trips and lands on her back.

                                   INDIANA
                       Look out, damn it, I need that
                       antidote!

                                   WILLIE
                       Who cares?  Where's that diamond!

       Gunfire explodes and they both scramble in different directions.
       Indy dives through the fleeing nightclub patrons and slides be-
       hind a water-spewing fountain.  Water kicks up as Indy is shot at
       by Lao and his henchmen.

       Indy sees the vial of antidote kicked again and it spins across
       the marble floor -- feeling the poison, Indy shakes his head
       groddily and splashes water on his face.

       Meanwhile, Willie is chasing her diamond, shoving through the
       panicked crowd.  She spots the diamond!  Another elegantly
       dresses soman is bending to pick it up --

                                   WILLIE
                              (acidly polite)
                       Excuse me, but I believe that's
                       my diamond!

       Willie smiles and suddenly kicks the woman in the butt!  Willie
       reaches to get the diamond but not before the other woman tackles
       her.

       Behind the fountain, Indiana makes a break -- he runs and dives
       on top of a serving cart.  The wheeled cart hurtles toward an un-
       suspecting gunman, crashes into him from behind and sends him
       flying head first into a row of ice buckets.

       Nearby, Willie slugs the other lady in the jaw and grabs for the
       elusive diamond just as the ice buckets showers ice across the
       floor -- which camouflages the diamond!

                                   WILLIE
                       Aw nuts!

       Searching desperately for the jewel, Willie sees the vial of
       antidote spinning across the floor --as it slides by, she grabs
       it.

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       Hey,doll!  Don't move!

       She sees Indy speeding by atop the serving cart.  Lao and his
       gunmen rush out to block the way.  Indy rolls off the cart and
       slides behind a potted palm as Lao's men open fire again.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                           (shouting to Willie)
                       Hey, don't go away!  I need that!

       Willie smiles meanly as she slips the vial down the front of her
       dress, thumbs her nose at Indiana and walks away.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       If I wasn't dying, I'd kill her...

       Hiding behind the palm tree, Indiana looks around and spots a gi-
       ant statue at the side of the stage.  Indy makes a break for it.

       As the gunmen open fire, Indy springs onto a chair -- jumps onto
       a table -- and leaps onto the stage.  He grabs the golden broad-
       sword from the Chinese warrior statue!

       As bullets smash into the statue, Indiana hides behind it.  Then
       he jumps out and swings the large sword toward the enormous brass
       gong.

       The crimson cord holding the gong is SLASHED!  Indy slings the
       sword at his assailants and gives the three-meter-high gong a
       helpful shove --

       The giant gong rolls and echoes as it crashes down the marble
       steps.  Indiana ducks behind it as it gains momentum and rolls
       across the dance floor.

       Using the gong as an enormous shield, Indy evades the gunfire ex-
       ploding -- bullets ricochet off the rolling brass gong as Indy
       runs behind it.

       Ahead, Willie hurries toward an exit -- she hears something and
       turns -- her eyes go wide as she sees the mammoth gong bearing
       down on her!

       Willie yells as Indiana grabs her arm and pulls her behind the
       gong with him --

       Lao watches amazed as he and his gunmen dodge tables trying to
       get better firing positions -- and more henchmen come into the
       club now and start firing machine guns!

       As bullets clang against the gong, Indiana and Willie run behind
       it.  Willie hollers as they head directly for a towering, floor-
       to-ceiling window!

       Indiana grabs Willie around the waist and, after the huge gong
       crashes through the stained-glass window, they both fly after it!

6.     EXT.  "THE DRAGON" NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT                           6.

       In a shower of sparkling glass, the enormous gong sails out and
       crashes down a sloping green-tiled roof.  Indiana Jones and Wil-
       lie Scott hurtle into the night air after it!

       The gong rolls down the roof and they hit the tiles behind it,
       Indiana holding onto Willie as they roll one-over-the-other
       toward the edge -- Willie screams as they fall into thin air!

       Their entwined bodies plummet three stories:  ripping through a
       third-floor awning, crashing through an old man's mattress on a
       second-floor balcony --

       Finally they smash through the convertible top of a parked Duesen-
       berg and fall into the back seat!

7.     INT.  THE DUESENBERG                                           7.

       Willie sits up wide-eyed, speechless and amazed to be alive.
       Then she sees an equally astonished Short Round looking at them
       from the front seat.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Wow!  Holy smoke!  Crash landing!

                                   INDIANA
                       Step on it, Short Round!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Okey doke, Indy!  Hold onto your
                       potatoes!

       The twelve-year-old Chinese kid turns his baseball cap bill-
       backwards and steps on the gas!  The tires squeal as the car
       roars off --

                                   WILLIE
                       For crying out loud, a kid's driv-
                       ing the car?!

                                   INDIANA
                       Relax, I've been giving him lessons.

8.     EXT.  THE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT                                    8.

       The Duesenberg races past the entrace to the nightclub as Lao
       and his man rush out and jump into two black sedans.  The sedans
       screech off in pursuit of the Duesenberg.

9.     INT.  THE DUESENBERG                                           9.

       As Short Round eagerly swerves around a corner, Willie holds on
       for dear life.  Indiana suddenly puts his hand down the front of
       Willie's dress --

                                   WILLIE
                       Listen, we just met for crissake!
                       I'm not that kind of gril!

                                   INDIANA
                       Don't get your hopes up -- where's
                       the antidote?

       Indiana withdraws his hand, having finally found the vial.  He
       opens is quickly, tips the vial to his lips and grimaces as he
       swallows the stuff.

                                   WILLIE
                       You don't look very good.

                                   INDIANA
                       Poison never agrees with me.
                              (shouting forward)
                       Pull a right, Short Round, and
                       head for the Wang Poo bridge!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Check!  Gotcha!

       As the car accelerates, Indy peers out the back window at their
       pursuers.  Willie notices her reflection in the side window --

                                   WILLIE
                       Look at what you've done to me!
                       I'm a mess!  My lipstick's smeared,
                       I broke two nails, I've got an aw-
                       ful run in my stocking -- !

       Gunfire suddenly explodes, bullets whizz through the canvas top
       and the rear window shatters and sprays glass!  Willie ducks and
       cringes terrified in the corner --

                                   INDIANA
                       Somehow I think you've got bigger
                       problems.

       Indy grabs his shoulder bag and pulls a pistol out of it.  He
       pokes the gun through the broken window and starts firing back at
       their pursuers -- then he turns and looks ahead.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       There, Shorty!  Through the
                       tunnel!

       Through the windows we see the car racing into a tunnel.  Lights
       from the pursuing cars flash through the rear window and gunfire
       echoes in the tunnel.

                                   WILLIE
                       What're we going to do?!  Where're
                       we going?!

                                   INDIANA
                       The airport...No, look out,
                       Short Round!  Left, left!

       Indy reaches over the front seat and helps Short Round navigate.

10.    EXT.  A SHANGHAI SQUARE - NIGHT                                10.

       The Duesenberg tears around the square, followed by Lao's two se-
       dans.  People on the street dive for cover -- coolies pulling
       rickshaws go into hyper-jov --lanterns spanning the street crash
       down and are dragged behind the Duesenberg.  Bullets exlode and
       amazed prostitutes watch the cars zoom past.

11.    INT.  THE DUESENBERG - NIGHT                                   11.

       The chaotic chase continues -- bullets whine past and the shred-
       ded convertible top whips in the wind.

                                   INDIANA
                                 (shouting)
                       You got the tickets, Short Round?

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Sure, Indy -- three tickets!
                       You, me and Wu Han --

       Shorty throws an envelope back and Indy looks at the three
       tickets.

                                   INDIANA
                                   (sadly)
                       Wu Han's not coming, Shorty.

       Unaware of what happened at the club, Short Round thinks a mo-
       ment.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Don't worry, Indy.  Short Round
                       number one bodyguard now!

       Willie reaches for the extra ticket.

                                   WILLIE
                       I'll take the extra ticket.
                              (grabbing it
                                 from Indy)
                       Where's this plane going anyway?

                                   INDIANA
                       Siam.

                                   WILLIE
                       Siam?  But I'm not dressed for
                       Siam...

12.    EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                   12.

       Leaving behind the squalid port, the Duesenberg flies along the
       highway through the trees.  In a moment, Lao's two sedans race
       by.

13.    EXT.  NANG TAO AIRFIELD - NIGHT                                13.

       The Duesenberg swings around a curve and skids through gravel to-
       ward the airfield.  In the distance there is a small terminal but
       Short Round wheels the car toward the cargo area --

       A two-engine passenger plane is revving its motors and the last
       passengers are boarding.  The Duesenberg squeals to a stop and
       Indy jumps out with Willie and Short Round right on his heels.

       A contingent of airport Military Police move to bar their way
       until WEBER, a heavy-set Englishman, runs up pufffing and shout-
       ing.

                                   WEBER
                       No, no, they're all right!
                       Let them through please.

                                   INDIANA
                       Thanks, Weber.

                                   WEBER
                       Dr. Jones, this is positively the
                       last time our airline can hold a
                       plane for you.  Now you must hurry!

       While Short Round grabs a small bag out of the car, Weber and a
       stewardess take their tickets and rush them all toward the air-
       plane.

       Meanwhile, the two sedans skid to a stop and Lao and his son Kao
       Kan jumpsout with their henchmen.  The puzzled military police
       advance on them usspiciously  --

       Realizing he's outnumbered, Lao instructs his men to stay back
       and to put away their weapons.

14.    EXT.  THE AIRPLANE                                             14.

       Willie and Short Round charge up the ladder and onto the plane.
       Indy pauses at the top of the steps to give Lao a cocky farewell
       salute.  Indy boards the plane and the co-pilot slams the door.

15.    EXT.  THE AIRFIELD                                             15.

       The plane starts taxiing.  By the cars, Lao is buffeted by the
       prop wash as he angrily watches the plane roll away.  Behind Lao,
       his son, Kao Kan, stares at the plane taking off  -- a look on Kao
       Kan's face indicates that he hasn't given up yet...

       The plane lifts off the airfield, silhouetted against the clouds
       and the first light of dawn.

                                                               CUT TO:

16.    EXT.  THE DKY - MORNING                                        16.

       The sun flashes above the horizon and the plane banks through
       white billowing clouds at it heads west.

17.    INT.  THE PLANE                                                17.

       A door opens at the rear of the plane and Indiana Jones exits
       wearing more familiar attire:  a beat-up leather jacket over a
       khaki shirt and a snap-brim hat.  He passes a dozen passengers as
       he moves up the aisle carrying his rolled-up tuzedo.

       In the first row, Willie is busy fixing her make-up.  Shorty sits
       in the seat across the aisle from her.  Indy comes up and drops
       his tuxedo onto the floor.

       Willie sees him hook his coiled bullwhip over a coat-peg.

                                   WILLIE
                       So, what're you supposed to be,
                       a lion tamer?

                                   INDIANA
                       Since I was nice enough to let
                       you tag along, why don't you give
                       your mouth a rest?  Okay, doll?

       Indy pats her leg -- she removes his hand and reaches down and
       picks up his tuxedo coat.  She slips it on.

                                   WILLIE
                       I'm freezing.  What do you mean,
                       tag along?  From the minute you
                       walked into that nightclub, you
                       haven't been able to keep your
                       eyes off me.

                                   INDIANA
                       Oh yeah?

       He smiles and tips his hat down over his eyes to go to sleep...

18.    INT.  THE COCKPIT                                              18.

       At the same moment, the Chinese co-pilot tips his hat up off his
       eyes -- and looks scared to death!  He exclaims in Chinese --

                                   CO-PILOT (*subtitled*)
                       Good lord!

       He and the pilot see two biplanes materialize out of the clouds
       and dive directly toward them!  Suddenly, machine gunfire erupts!

                                   PILOT (*subtitled)
                       Dive for the clouds!  Dive!

19.    EXT.  THE SKY - DAY                                            19.

       The DC-3 banks into the clouds as the two biplanes attack.  In
       the back seat of the first biplane, we see Kao Kan watching the
       DC-3 like a hawk about to bring down a sparrow.

20.    INT.  THE COCKPIT                                              20.

       The biplanes swoop past both sides of the plane and bursts of
       gunfire rip along the fuselage.

                                   CO-PILOT (*subtitled)
                       They hit a fuel line!

                                   PILOT (*subtitled*)
                       Reduce speed -- get everyone out
                       of the plane!

21     INT.  THE PASSENGER CABIN                                      21.

       As the air battle rages, the passengers are tossed about and some
       start screaming.  Short Round peers out a window.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Lao send planes to kill Indy!

       Willie shakes Indy's arm but he continues snoring under his hat.

                                   WILLIE
                       Wake up!  It's the drug he drank
                       to stop the poison --

       The cockpit door bursts open and the Chinese co-pilot exits to
       make an announcement -- he smiles and speaks in CHINESE, then he
       smiles and speaks in FRENCH --

       Willie looks lost until the Chinese co-pilot smiles again and
       speaks in ENGLISH --

                                   CO-PILOT
                       Please to remain calm.  We start
                       passing out parachutes now --

       The co-pilot hurries toward the rear.  Willie looks petrified as
       a stewardess rushes up and hands her a parachute.

                                   WILLIE
                       You got to be kidding!  No!  No,
                       I can't!

       The pilot hurries out of the cockpit and grabs his parachute as
       he heads toward the back.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Wait -- who's flying the plane?!

       She opens the door to the cockpit --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Nobody's flying the plane ...

22.    EXT.  THE SKY - DAY                                            22.

       The DC-3 smokes through the clouds.  Passengers are bailing out
       -- parachutes billowing.  As one of the fighters swoops through
       the parachutes, Kao Kan searches the faces -- then he points at
       the DC-3.

                                   KAO KAN
                               (into the radio)
                       Jones!  Indiana Jones!

       The two planes roar off and start strafing the DC-3 again.

23.    INT.  THE PASSENGER CABIN                                      23.

       The co-pilot has a parachute on and is trying to get Short Round
       into one.

                                   CO-PILOT
                       Put it on!  What's wrong with
                       you?  You've got to jump!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       No, can't leave Indy!

       Short Round suddenly butts the co-pilot in the stomach with his
       head.  The co-pilot yells and falls out the door.  Short Round
       sees the co-pilot's parachute billow.  Then Willie rushes up.

                                   WILLIE
                       Give me that parachute, I
                       changed my mind --

       She grabs the parachute and starts to fight Shorty over it--

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       No, this last one!  It's for Indy!

       They scuffle until the parachute skids across the floor.  Short
       Round jumps for it -- the parachute falls out the door and Short
       Round starts to fall out after it!

       Willie grabs him by the seat of his pants and hauls him back from
       the abyss!

24.    EXT.  THE SKY - DAY                                            24.

       The fighters peel off toward the DC-3 with their guns flaming in
       another attack.

25.    INT.  THE PASSENGER CABIN                                      25.

       Short Round tries to wake Indy again.  Finally, Shorty grabs
       Indy's bag, pulls his holster out of it and runs toward the back.

       Indy continues to sleep -- until bullets smash the window by his
       head and a fire extinguisher is hit and starts spraying into
       Indy's face.

       He finally awakens and jumps up.  He looks around is disbelief at
       the battle-torn, nearly-empty airplane.

                                   INDIANA
                                  (groggily)
                       We there yet?

       Indiana sees Shorty shooting his pistol out the side door as the
       planes swoop by again.  Out of ammo, Shorty throws the gun
       angrily at the passing plane.

       Indiana picks up his whip and attaches it to his belt as Willie
       runs over to him.

                                   WILLIE
                       There's nobody flying the plane!

26.    INT.  THE COCKPIT                                              26.

       The door flies open and Indy rushes in with Willie behind him.
       Indy appraises the situation quickly and jumps into the pilot's
       seat with total confidence --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       You know how to fly?

       Indy surveys the control panels, the myraid of dials and switches --

                                   INDIANA
                       No.
                                  (hopefully)
                       Do you?

27.    INT.  THE PASSENGER CABIN                                      27.

       Willie runs screaming out of the cockpit, her last hope shatter-
       ed.  Shorty is pulling something out of the cargo compartment --
       he's found a machine gun and sets it up on a short tripod.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Come here, lady, hold this and
                       shut up please!

       He pulls Willie down to the floor and shoves her the ammunition
       belt that's draped toward the gun.  Then Shorty jumps behind the
       machine gun --

       As the first fighter appears off their side, Short Round blasts
       out the open door!  The machine gun explodes to life, chewing
       bullets, smoking and spitting shells at Willie --

       Willie hollers terrified by manages to feed the ammo belt as
       Short Round sights the blazing machine gun -- suddenly he shoops!

       Willie sees the fighter hit -- it smokes and veers away -- and
       then EXPLODES!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       I get it!

                                   WILLIE
                       You got it!

       The second plane swoops down and Short Round blasts away.  This
       time as he swivels the gun, he misses and hits one of the DC-3's
       own engines and it explodes!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Oh oh -- big mistake!

28.    INT.  THE COCKPIT                                              28.

       Trying to figure out the controls, Indy looks up to see their en-
       gine explose into flames --

                                   INDIANA
                                  (angrily)
                       Short Round, what in the hell
                       are you doing?

       Suddenly the DC-3 emerges out of a cloud and Indy sees they are
       headed directly for a mountain!  He pulls back hard on the con-
       trols as a rocky peak looms lethally in front of them.

29.    EXT.  THE SKY - DAY                                            29.

       The DC-3 lifts at the last second and smashes some snow off the
       uppermost pinnacle as it clears the mountain by inches!

       Kao Kan's fighter is glued to the DC-3's tail and continues to
       strafe -- but the fighter pilot pulls up too late -- and the
       fighter explodes as it hits the peak of the mountain!

30.    INT.  THE PASSENGER CABIN                                      30.

       Indy rushes out of the smoking cockpit to find Willie and Short
       Round crawling out from under the debris that's fallen on them.
       Then Indy spots something in the wreckage --

       He pulls at some yellow canvas and Willie sees as sign: EMERGENCY
       LIFE RAFT.  Indy drags the folded canvas over to the open door.

                                   WILLIE
                       Are you crazy, a lift raft?!  We're
                       not sinking, we're crashing!

                                   INDIANA
                       Get over here, damn it!  Short Round,
                       come on, grab onto me tight!

       Willie sees Short Round rush over to Indiana and grab him around
       the waist from behind.  Willie finally jumps up and runs over --

                                   WILLIE
                       Wait for me!

       She throws her arms around Indy's neck so that she and Shorty are
       both hugging him from behind.  Indy clutches the folded lift raft
       in front of him and surveys the mountainside rushing close be-
       neath the skinking airplane --

       Finally, an instant before the plane will hit, Indy dives and
       pulls the inflation cord!

31.    EXT.  THE SKY                                                  31.

       As the smoking DC-3 screams out of control toward the mountain,
       skimming the rocky snow-covered slopes, we see the lift raft
       spilling out the open door --

       The raft pops into its full shape, acting now as a spoiler, soar-
       ing against the rushing wind and finally crashing and bouncing
       against the snowy mountainside.

       In the distance, we see the DC-3 finally kiss the earth and ex-
       plode in a cloud of flame against a rocky escarpment -- metal and
       earth mushrooming in a million directions!

32.    EXT.  THE MOUNTAINSIDE                                         32.

       As the raft rockets down the snow, Indiana clutches the front and
       Willie and Short Round hold on for dear life on either side of
       him.

       The raft plummets down the mountain, crossing the timber-line and
       entering a forest.  Bouncing over a snow-hidden log, the raft
       shoots directly for a tree --

       Indiana pulls on the perimeter rope, rolls on his side and man-
       ages to swerve the raft so it caroms offthe snow-drifted side of
       the tree trunk.

       Continuing its downhill run, the raft smashes across a small
       steam, sending silvery water spraying.

       As the raft skids below the snow-level, it starts bouncing over
       rocky ground and its three passengers' teeth start chattering.

33.    EXT.  A BLUFF                                                  33.

       The yellow raft crashes through a tangle of bushes and then plum-
       mets toward a bluff!  The raft goes airborne over a small bluff
       and lands with a splash in a slow-moving river.

34.    EXT.  THE RIVER                                                34.

       The life raft drifts down the river and Indy looks around and
       smiles cockily at Willie and Short Round --

       Their faces don't show gratitude, but horror -- Indy hears some-
       thing and turns to see:

35.    EXT.  WHITE WATER RAPIDS                                       35.

       The raft is heading directly toward a surging stretch of treach-
       erous rapids.  Indiana looks less cocky as he and Willie and
       Short Round hold on again for dear life!

       The raft plunges into the roaring torrent, bouncing over rock-
       swollen waves, twisting and spinning through narrow gaps.  The
       three helpless passengers are drenched in the thundering cascades
       of white water.

       Willie is hallering, Short Round hangs on wide-eyed and even Indy
       looks terrified as the raft crashes down the rapids.  Finally,
       after one heart-stopping bounce, the raft seems to slow.

36.    EXT.  RIVER CLEARING                                           36.

       The raft drifts out of the main part of the river and glides to-
       ward a clearing.  Its three soaked and bedraggled passengers lie
       motionless in the bottom.

       Indy's hand drags alongside the raft, his fingers leaving a trail
       in the almost still water.  Battered and exhausted, but always
       Indy's "bodyguard", Shorty looks over at him worriedly --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy?

                                   INDIANA
                       Okay, Shorty.

       Indy looks over at Willie who is moaning.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       You all right?

                                   WILLIE
                       No... I'm not cut out for the
                       kind of life you lead.
                                  (moaning)
                       Oh no...I ripped my dress.  Where
                       are we anyway?

       The raft floats to a gentle stop -- we see it nudge against a
       pair of dark feet.  Indy squints up into the sun and sees some-
       thing.

                                   INDIANA
                       India...

                                   WILLIE
                       Holy cow -- India?  How do you
                       know we're in --

       She rolls over and yelps as she looks up at the bizarre, painted
       face of a SHAMAN.  Silhoutted against the blazing sun, the skin-
       ny little old man in a loincoloth stares down at them in the raft.

       An eerie wind rises and howls.  The old man places his palms to-
       gether and moves his hands up to touch his forehead.  Willie and
       Short Round watch mystified as Indiana returns the old shaman's
       silent greeting.

                                                               CUT TO:

37.    EXT.  THE MAYAPORE HILLS - DAY                                 37.

       Indya and Short Round follow the shaman and four peasants down a
       gutted path through barren rolling hills.  Willie is out of her
       milieu, stumbling along this forlorn landscape in high heels,
       tuxedo jacket and disheveled lame gown.

       She hears the old shaman talking to Indy and catches up with them
       to find out what's going on.

                                   WILLIE
                                (to Indiana)
                       What'd he say?

                                   INDIANA
                       He told me they knew I was coming
                       here.

                                   WILLIE
                       What do you mean -- how?

                                   INDIANA
                       The old man saw it in a dream.

                                   WILLIE
                       Dream -- nightmare is more like it.

                                   INDIANA
                       He said that's whey they were at
                       river -- they were waiting for
                       the plane to fall down.

       He looks at her bewildered face and smiles faintly.  As they
       walk, a hot wind swirls dust around them,  a wind slowly ravaging
       what soil is left in this terribly blighted region.

                                                               CUT TO:

38.    EXT.  MAYAPORE - DAY                                           38.

       At the base of the hills, Mayapore village does nothing to re-
       lieve the awful sense of devastation.  A desolate road runs
       through the village, along which groups of ptiifully poor vil-
       lagers stare at the strangers being brought in.

       Hopeless women lift buckets from a dry well -- finding only sand.
       Skinny miserable dogs skulk between the decrepit village huts,
       eyed by the patient vultures lurling in scraggly trees.

       Indiana notices the wretched peasants staring at Short Round,
       some of them pointing at him, a few haggard women shedding tears
       down their wrinkled faces as the little Chinese boy passes.

       There is no sign of children in the village and Short Round grows
       frightened by the odd attention.  He moves closer to Indy as they
       pass the devastated population.

                                                               CUT TO:

39.    RXT.  MAYAPORE VILLAGE - AFTER SUNSET                          39.

       Black clouds clot across the blood-red sky as darkness falls.
       Indiana, Willie and Short Round sit tensely on a shabby rug.
       Above their heads, there is a thatched roof, but there are no
       walls.

       The dying sunset silhouettes them and the half-dozen elders seat-
       ed in the dirt around them.  A grey-haired man, the village
       CHIEFTAIN, gives quiet commands to the women who scuttle in and
       set wooden plates in front of the three visitors.  No plates are
       places in front of the elders.

                                   WILLIE
                               (quietly to Indy)
                       I hope this means we're going to
                       get some dinner.

       Indiana sees the painted shaman, who sits next to the chieftain,
       watching Willie.  The women bring in a bowl from which they scoop
       tiny portions of grey gruel onto three plates.

       To this the women add a few grains of yellowed rice and a with-
       ered ,molding piece of fruit.  Willie looks aghast at the unappe-
       tizing combination.

                                   WILLIE
                                  (quietly)
                       God, I am starving, but I can't
                       eat this...
                                   INDIANA
                       That's more food than these people
                       eat in a week.
                                  (pointedly) 
                       They're starving, too...

       Willie looks around at the emaciated faces and feels like crawl-
       ing into a hole.

                                   WILLIE
                       I'm sorry, I -- here, please.

       She picks up her plate and gently hands it back to the women.
       The chieftain finally speaks to them --

                                   CHIEFTAIN
                       You will rest here before you go
                       on.

                                   INDIANA
                       We'd appreciate that.  This was an
                       unexpected detour.  We'll have to go
                       to Delhi now and find a flight west.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                                   (smiling)
                       Indy is taking me to America.

       All eyes are on Short Round.  Puzzled by this strange attention,
       Shorty's smile fades nervously.

                                   INDIANA
                       I'm a professor.  I have to re-
                       turn to the university.  Can you
                       give us a guide to take us to Delhi?

       The chieftain indicates a young villager sitting near them.

                                   CHIEFTAIN
                       Sanju will guide you.

                                   INDIANA
                       Thank you.

       The old shaman speaks now for the first time.

                                   SHAMAN
                       On the way to Delhi, you will
                       stop at Pankot.

                                   INDIANA
                                  (puzzled)
                       Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.

                                   SHAMAN
                       You will go to palace there.

                                   INDIANA
                       Hasn't the Pankot palace been de-
                       serted since the Mutiny of 1857?

                                   SHAMAN
                                  (darkly)
                       No. Now there is new Maharajah --
                       and palace is powerful again.

       The shaman looks around at his unfortunate people.

                                   SHAMAN (Cont'd)
                       It is Pankot Palace that kills my
                       village.

                                   INDIANA
                       I don't understand.  What's hap-
                       pened here?

                                   SHAMAN
                       The evil starts in Pankot.  Then
                       like monsoon, it moves darkness
                       over all country.

                                   INDIANA
                       What evil?

                                   SHAMAN
                       They came from Palace and took
                       sivalinga from out village.

       Willie looks over at Indiana --

                                   WILLIE
                       Took what?

                                   INDIANA
                       It's a sacred stone in a shine
                       that's supposed to protect a
                       village.

                                   SHAMAN
                       It is why Krishna brought you here.

                                   INDIANA
                               (politely firm)
                       Nobody brought us here.  Our plane
                       crashed.  We were shot down by --

                                   SHAMAN
                              (interrupting)
                       No.  We pray to Krishna to help us
                       find the stone.  It was Krishna who
                       made you fall from sky -- so you can
                       got to Pankot Palace.  To find siva-
                       linga -- and bring back to us.

       Indy's about to object -- then he looks at the sad chieftain, the
       elders and peasants who are watching him helplessly.  And he sees
       again the dark steady eyes of the old shaman.

                                                               CUT TO:

40.    EXT.  MAYAPORE VILLAGE - NIGHT                                 40.

       Torches falre eerily and dogs howl as the peasants accompany the
       shaman, elders and three visitors out ot the edge of the dark
       village.  Short Round walks beside Indy.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy, they make out plane crash?
                       To get you here?

                                   INDIANA
                       It's just superstition, Shorty.
                       Like a ghost story.

       Short Round looks plenty scared as they all stop walking.  The
       shaman motions and the men with torches circle around a pile of
       rocks to illuminate them.  The shaman makes a gesture of devotion
       to the primitive shrine and Indy speaks to the village chieftain.

                                   CHIEFTAIN
                       Yes.

       Indiana seems skeptical as he kneels to study the shrine.  On top
       of the pile of rocks, there is a carved niche.  The niche is
       empty but an indentation indicates the conical shape of the stone
       that was stolen.

                                   INDIANA
                       Was the stone very smooth?
                                 (he sees the
                                 chieftain nod)
                       It was probably brought here from
                       a sacred river.

                                   SHAMAN
                              (joining Indy and
                               the chieftain)
                       Long ago -- before my father's
                       father.

                                   INDIANA
                       And it had three lines painted
                       across it?
                                  (seeing the
                                   shaman nod)
                       The lines represent the three
                       levels of the universe.  I've seen
                       stones like the one you lost.

       Indy stands slowly.  Willie is beside him looking at the shrine.

                                   WILLIE
                       I don't understand how losing one
                       rock could destroy this village.
                             (whispering to Indy)
                       Is it really powerful?

       Indy gives a doubtful smile.  He turns again to the old shaman.

                                   INDIANA
                       But why would the Maharajah take
                       this sacred stone?

                                   SHAMAN
                       They say we must pray to their
                       evil god.  We say we will not.

       The old shaman looks off and fights the tears in his eyes as he
       starts speaking in Hindi.

                                   INDIANA
                                 (translating)
                       He says that when the sacred stone
                       was taken the village wells dried
                       up first and then the river stopped.

       Indy turns and asks the shaman a question in Hindi.  The shaman
       answers in Hindi.

                                   INDIANA
                                   (translating)
                       He says their crops dies and then
                       the animals died.

       The shaman walks to the edge of the torchlight and looks out into
       the darkness as he continues speaking emotionally in Hindi --

                                   INDIANA
                                   (translating)
                       And then they took their children.

                                   WILLIE
                       Their children?

       She looks at Short Round and finally understands the sorrowful
       faces always watching him.  Indy asks another question in Hindi
       and the shaman continues his story --

                                   INDIANA
                                   (translating)
                       He says one night there was a fire
                       in the fields.  The men went to
                       fight it.  When they came back,
                       they heard the women crying in the
                       darkness.  And the children were
                       gone.

       The shaman walks slowly toward Indiana.

                                   SHAMAN
                       You will find them when you find
                       sivlalinga.

                                   INDIANA
                       I'm sorry, I don't know how I can
                       help you here.

       The shaman and the chieftain stare and Indiana, refusing to accept
       that.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       The English authorities who con-
                       trol this area are the only ones
                       who can help you.

                                   CHIEFTAIN
                       They do not listen.

                                   INDIANA
                       I have friends in Delhi and I will
                       make sure they investigate this...

                                   SHAMAN
                       No, you will got to Pankot...

       The old man speaks again in his own tongue and Indy looks dis-
       turbed.

                                   WILLIE
                       What'd he say now?

                                   INDIANA
                       It was destined that I came here --
                       and the future cannot be changed...

       Indy looks ath the shaman and the torchlight reflected in his
       eyes.

                                                               CUT TO:

41.    EXT.  MAYAPORE - NIGHT                                         41.

       Suddenly we're rushing headlong down a dark dirt path seen from
       the POV of somebody running in terror.  We hear heavy breathing
       -- above we see the scraggly trees blowing against the full moon
       as an eerie wind rises and howls.  We continue crashing through
       the dying fields tward the dark village...

42.    INT.  INDIANA'S HUT - NIGHT                                    42.

       The wind swirls into the hut and Indiana's eyes open.  He lies
       still a moment and then sits up slowly.  He sees Short Round
       sleeping nearby.

       Sensing something strange, Indy gets to his feet.  He steps
       around Short Round and goes to the door of the hut.

43.    EXT.  THE HUT - NIGHT                                          43.

       Indy walks against the rising wind and looks around.  The village
       is asleep and seems deserted.  Then he turns and sees something.

       We follow small bare feet stumbling through the dust...

       Indy sees an emaciated child in rag running out of the darkness.
       Indiana moves forward and the child runs toward him.  Indy grabs
       the little boy as he falls into his arms.

                                                               CUT TO:

44.    INT.  THE SHAMAN'S HUT - NIGHT                                 44.

       A few minutes later, the little boy is lying unconscious on a
       blanket.  Elders crouch around him.  Indy is kneeling and watches
       the shaman wet the boy's forehead with a rag and drip water onto
       his lips.

       The little boy's eyes open and he begins to revive.  Shrot Round
       And Willie watch from a corner as the little boy looks at all the
       faces peering down at him.

       The little boy's arm moves and he reaches out to Indy rather than
       any of the others.  Indy takes his small hand and sees that the
       boy's fingers are cut and bruised -- his fingers open and drop
       something into Indy's hand.

       The little boy tries to whisper.  Indy has to lean close to hear
       as the little boy's lips move again --

                                   LITTLE BOY
                       Sankara...

       A mother rushes into the hut now and kneels and hugs her little
       boy.  His skinny arms go around her as they are reunited.  Indy
       stands slowly and looks at what the little boy gave him --

       It is a small tattered piece of cloth:  an old fragment of a mini-
       ature painting.  Indiana looks at it with an expression of recog-
       nition and apprehension...

                                   INDIANA
                       Sankara...

45.    EXT.  THE VILLAGE - MORNING                                    45.

       The camera follows Indiana -- he's walking fast and determinded-
       ly.  Villagers trot alongside of him, trying to keep up with is
       pace as he questions thm in Hindi.

       Indy approaches two large elephants and sees their guide Sajnu
       trying to politely drag Willie toward one of them.

                                   INDIANA
                       Damn it , Willie, get on -- we've
                       got to move out!

       Willie's head comes up over the back of the elephant as she's
       helped from below -- there is a look of sheer terror on her face.

                                   WILLIE
                       Whoa!  Easy now -- nice elephant...

       Waiting by the second elephant, Short Round sees Indy coming and
       runs up to him --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       I ride with you, Indy?

                                   INDIANA
                       Nope, you got a little surprise
                       over there, Shorty.

       Short Round runs around the big elephant and sees a baby elephant
       being brought out.  He can't believe his luck --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Oh boy!

       Meanwhile Sajnu goads Willie's elephant over.  The villagers look
       grief stricken and many are crying as they watch the three stran-
       gers' departure.

                                   WILLIE
                               (to Short Round)
                       This is the first time anybody
                       ever cried when I left.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       They don't cry about you.  They
                       cry about the elephants leaving.

                                   WILLIE
                       Figures...

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       They got no food to feed them.  So
                       they taking the elephants away to
                       sell them.

       Indy lumbers over on his elephant.

                                   INDIANA
                       All right, let's go.  I want to get
                       to Pankot before tomorrow night.

       She looks at Indiana as he rides past.

                                   WILLIE
                       Pankot?!  I thought we were going
                       to Delhi!  Hey, wait a minute!
                                (looking at
                                 the villagers)
                       Can't somebody take me to Delhi?!
                       I don't want to go to Pankot!

       Sajnu guides her elephant and Willie lurches forward --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                                  (yelling) 
                       Indiana!  Damn it!  Why'd you
                       change your mind?  What did that
                       kid tell you last night?!

       Indy ignores her hollering.  The elephants move off through the
       crowds of pitiful villagers.  Indy sees the elders, chieftain and
       the old shaman who brings his hands up to his forehead as Indy
       rides past.

                                                               CUT TO:

46.    EXT.  THE COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                                    46.

       The elephants move across the desolate countryside toward the
       distant hills.

47.    EXT.  THE TRAIL                                                47.

       Indiana rides the lead elephant.  Sajnu passes on foot guiding
       Willie's elephant.  With the tuxedo jacket wrapped around her
       waist, Willie is dabbing perfume behind her ears.

                                   WILLIE
                             (to her elephant)
                       I think you need this more than
                       me.

       Willie leans forward and puts perfume behind the elephant's ears.
       Grimacing at the animal's smell she simply dumps the rest of the
       perfume on the elephant's back.

       Willie yelps when the elephant's trunk comes back, sniffs the
       foriegn fragrance and suddenly trumpets in disgust.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       What're you complaining about,
                       this is expensive stuff!

                                                               CUT TO:

48.    EXT.  LOWER JUNGLES - DAY                                      48.

       From a cliff, we see the elephants below passing into the lower
       jungles.

       Spotting something on an overhanging tree branck, Short Round
       stands up precariously on the baby elephant's back.  He pulls a
       vine from the tree as they pass under it.  Plopping down onto the
       baby elephant's back, he picks the wild fruit from the vine --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Here you go, lunch time!

       The baby elephant's trunk comes back and takes the fruit.  Shorty
       looks up in the sky.

                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)
                       Indy, look!

       Indiana and Willie look up and see hundreds of enormous winged
       creatures flapping across the afternoon sky.

                                   WILLIE
                       Those are very big bird.

       Sajnu says something and Indiana nods.

                                   INDIANA
                       Those aren't birds -- those are
                       giant bats.

       Willie shudders as she watches the bats.

                                                               CUT TO:

49.    EXT.  THE HILLS - AFTERNOON                                    49.

       An enormous sun silhouettes the three elephants trekking west-
       ward.

                                                               CUT TO:

50.    EXT.  A RIVER - LATER AFTERNOON                                50.

       The three elephants stand sucking up river water with their
       trunks.  Seated on the huge beasts, Willie, Short Round and Indi-
       ana watch the thirsty animals.

                                   WILLIE
                       They must be pretty dumb to drink
                       that awful-looking water.

       In response, Willie's elephant calmly lifts its trunk and sprays
       her in the face.  Short Round and Indy laugh as Willie sits
       soaked and shocked.

                                   INDIANA
                       I think maybe we'll camp here.

                                                               CUT TO:

51.    EXT.  THE RIVER - SUNSET                                       51.

       A plume of water sprays.  The three elephants submerge in a deep,
       wide spot in the river.  Indy wades in the current with his shirt
       off.  He and the guide splash water on the weary animals.

       Short Round laughs and plays with the baby elephant.  Wrapped in
       its trunk, he's swung in the air and lands on the elephant's
       back.  Shorty makes a swan dive back into the water and the baby
       elephant gives him a shower when he surfaces.

52.    EXT.  UPRIVER                                                  52.

       Thirty yards upstream, birds and monkeys chatter in a tree.  In
       the shady river beneath, Willie surfaces cooly and wipes hair
       from her eyes.  She hums contendedly.

       Indiana wanders up the riverbank in his dripping trousers.  He
       notices Willie's wet clothes spread over a tree limb hanging low
       over the water and then he sees Willie paddling around.

                                   INDIANA
                       Hey, Willie -- I think you better
                       get out now.

                                   WILLIE
                       Stark naked?  You wish... If you're
                       trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones,
                       this is a very primitive approach.

                                   INDIANA
                       Me seduce you?  Honey, you're the
                       one who took your clothes off.
                                  (shrugging)
                       I just came over to remind you
                       that you never know what else
                       might be in the water.

                                   WILLIE
                       Somehow I feel safer in here.

       As Indy turns and starts off, Willie reaches up to the tree
       branch above her head and grabs her underwear.  At this moment we
       notice something awful:

       A BOA CONSTRICTOR is moving out along the branch, the enormous
       snake slithering over Willie's clothes.

       Willie watches Indiana walk away as she reaches up for her dress
       -- her hands feel something strange -- not the dress and not the
       tree limb --

       Willie looks up and sees that she's pulling on a snake! She
       SCREAMS as the boa constrictor falls off the t-ee on top of her!

       Indy hears the scream and hears Willie calling to him.  He runs
       back toward the river.  Stopping on the riverbank, he sees Willie
       backing away in the water -- Indiana's already starting to pull
       his boots off --

                                   WILLIE
                       Indy!  Help me!

                                   INDIANA
                       Don't worry, I'm coming in!  What
                       is it?

                                   WILLIE
                       A snake!

       Suddenly Indiana freezes and a strange look corsses his face --

                                   INDIANA
                       A what...?

                                   WILLIE
                       A SNAKE!!

       He finally sees the boa constrictor thrashing in the water close
       to Willie.  He leaves his boots on.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Hurry, help me out of here!
                       What're you waiting for?!

                                   INDIANA
                       Uh, listen -- Willie -- I got a
                       better idea.

                                   WILLIE
                       What?!

                                   INDIANA
                       First of all -- don't panic!

       Willie suddenly screams as the boa constrictor wraps around her
       arm --

                                   WILLIE
                       It's got me !  Indy, help me!

       Indy runs along the riverbank, trying to get closer to her, but
       not about to jump into the river (due to his aversion to snakes
       -- see Episode One:  "Raiders of the Lost Ark").

                                   INDIANA
                       Don't let it pull you deeper!

                                   WILLIE
                       It's pulling me deeper!

                                   INDIANA
                       Don't let it curl around you!

                                   WILLIE
                       It's curling around me!  Damn it,
                       stop talking and do something!

       The snake is wrapping around her body and neck -- her head is
       barely above water --

       On the riverbank, Indy reaches down and grabs a piece of wood.
       But as he watches the repulsive reptile, he starts to sweat and
       his fear and loathing overpower him --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       What's wrong?!  Indy please help
                       me!

       Indy groans and bolsters his courage -- he takes two steps into
       the water -- but the complex is to strong and he can't go any
       further.  He drops the piece of wood...

                                   INDIANA
                       Listen, Willie.  Do exactly what
                       I tell you now.

                                   WILLIE
                       What?!

                                   INDIANA
                       Can you move your arm?

                                   WILLIE
                       Just one arm!

                                   INDIANA
                       Okay, I want you to lift your hand --
                       and pet the snake.

                                   WILLIE
                       PET IT??!!

                                   INDIANA
                       Yes, stroke it right along the
                       maxillary and precaudal verte-
                       brae.

                                   WILLIE
                       THE WHAT?!

                                   INDIANA
                       Pet it on the head!  Go on, pet
                       it!

       In the water, Willie is whimpering as she lifts her hand and
       starts petting the snake  coiling around her pale body.

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to
                       crush me!

                                   INDIANA
                       Keep stroking it!

       Willie keeps rubbing her hand along the snakes head and back and
       it slowly stops thrashing in the water.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       What's happening?

                                   WILLIE
                       It's starting to let go!

                                   INDIANA
                       That's good  -- you're doing fine.

       Grimacing as she stares at the ugly serpent's head, Willie keeps
       stroking it.

                                   WILLIE
                       It's letting fo.  I think it's --
                       I think it's going to sleep!

       Indiana looks relieved.  He sees the snake starting to drift away
       from Willie and she starts paddling back to shore, collecting her
       floating clothes along the way.

       Holding her dripping dress against herself, she walks out of the
       water toward Indy who smiles at her weakly.

                                   INDIANA
                       See -- I got you out...

       She slows and hauls off and punches him in the mouth.  Indy holds
       his jaw as she walks away infuriates.

                                   WILLIE
                       Thanks for nothing!  I hate snakes!

                                   INDIANA
                                  (looking at
                                   the water)
                       I know the feeling...

                                                               CUT TO:

53.    EXT.  THE CAMPSITE - NIGHT                                     53.

       By firelight, we see Sajnu feeding the big elephants while Short
       Round feeds and talks to the baby elephant --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       You come to America with me, and
                       we can get job in the circus --
                       you like that?

       The baby elephant trumpets affirmitively.

       A ways off, Willie stands wrapped in a blanket watching Shorty
       and the elephant as she dries her hair by a campfire.  Now Indy
       comes up and drops an armload of wood for yet another fire.

                                   WILLIE
                       Where'd you find your little body-
                       guard?

                                   INDIANA
                       I met Short Round when he tried
                       to pick my pocket.

       Indiana kneels and arranges the wood.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Shorty's family was killed when
                       they bombed Shanghai.  He was
                       living on the streets.

                                   WILLIE
                                  (smiling)
                       He'll be okay.  He's a good kid.

       Indy strikes a match and lights the new fire.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       All these fires -- you expecting
                       more snakes, Dr. Jones?

       She smiles snidely and continues drying her hair.

                                   INDIANA
                       By the way, how'd you end up in
                       Shanghai?

                                   WILLIE
                       Well, when my nightclub career was
                       run over by the Depression, some
                       pinhead convinced me that "a girl
                       could go places in the Orient..."
                       So, look where I got.

       Indy picks up a blanket and spreads it on the ground.

                                   INDIANA
                       What about the future?

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh, that's easy -- I'm going to
                       latch onto a good-looking, in-
                       credibly rich prince.

       Indy lies down on the blanket.

                                   INDIANA
                       I'd like to find one of those
                       myself.

                                   WILLIE
                           (raising an eyebrow)
                       Oh really?

                                   INDIANA
                       Yeah, but he's got to be dead and
                       buried for a couple of thousand years.
                                  (smiling)
                       Fortune and glory...

                                   WILLIE
                       Is that what you're hoping to find
                       at this palace, Dr. Jones?

                                   INDIANA
                       Maybe...

       Indy reaches into his pocket and removes the old piece of cloth.

                                   WILLIE
                       What's that?

       She walks over to where he's lying down and sits on a boulder.
       He hands her the cloth and she looks at it by the firelight.

                                   INDIANA
                       Something that kid gave me last
                       night.  It's a piece of an old
                       manuscript.

       Willie sees a crude drawing in reds, blue and gold.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       The drawing shows a priest named
                       Sankara who lived centuries ago.

                                   WILLIE
                       What does the writing say?

                                   INDIANA
                       It's Sanskrit.  It tells the story
                       of Sankara climbing Mt. Kalisa
                       where he met the Hindu god Shiva.

                                   WILLIE
                               (examining it)
                       That's Shiva?  What's he giving
                       the Priest?

                                   INDIANA
                       Legend says he told Sankara to go
                       forth and combat evil.  To do that
                       he gave him five sacred stones that
                       had magical powers.

                                   WILLIE
                               (looking at Indy)
                       You mean magical like the rock that
                       was stolen from that village?

       Indy looks at her meaningfully.

                                   INDIANA
                       It could be.

       Willie seems frightened.  She hands him the piece of cloth and
       stands up.

                                   WILLIE
                                   (quietly)
                       Fortune and glory...sweet dreams,
                       Dr. Jones.

       She picks up a blanket and starts off.

                                   INDIANA
                       I think you should sleep closer.
                                (seeing her sus-
                                 picious look)
                       I meant for safety.

                                   WILLIE
                                  (smiling)
                       I'd be safer sleeping with
                       that snake.

       She steps over to a tree by the fire where her clothes are dry-
       ing.  Indy watches her pull her dried clothes from the lower
       branches.

       She reaches up to remove another piece of her clothing -- it's
       stuck to the tree and she looks up and yanks it.  Suddenly the
       piece of clothing moves!

       Two enormous winds open and the hideous face of a GIANT BAT
       screeches and hisses at Willie!  She screams hysterically as the
       bat flaps against her, biting and scratching at her before it fi-
       nally takes off.

       The bat flies off into the darkness and Indy chuckles as he
       watches Willie shanking as she backs slowly toward the fire --

                                   WILLIE
                       Did you see it?!  It was one
                       of those bats!
                                   (staring into
                                    the darkness)
                       God, what else is out there...?!

       She quickly picks up her blanket and lays it out very close to
       Indy.

                                   INDIANA
                       Couldn't keep away, huh?

                                   WILLIE
                       Just try and control yourself.

       Indiana watches her lie down and wrap herself in her blanket.
       then he rolls over and tips his hat down over his eyes to get
       some well-deserved shut-eye.

       In a moment, however, we see something grotesque and snake-like
       slide into frame and move towards Indy -- finally, we realize
       it's an elephant's trunk.  The trunk nudges Indy's shoulder.

                                   INDIANA
                              (without looking)
                       Still scared?  Okay, Willie, you
                       can get closer if you want...

       The elephant's trunk moves closer and nuzzles Indy's neck.

                                   INDIANA
                       Honey, I knew you'd be the first
                       one to give in...

       Now, we see that Short Round is guiding the baby elephant's trunk
       with a prod.  Willie watches, stifling a laugh as the elephant's
       trunk sniffs Indiana's ear --

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       You're going to start something
                       I'm going to have to finish.
                                  (moaning)
                       Okay, doll, you asked for it.

       Indiana rolls over, lifts his hat and hollers!  He nearly jumps
       out of his pants as he stares into the elephant's trunk.  Willie
       and Short Round dissolve into laughter.

                                                               CUT TO:

54.    EXT.  THE JUNGLE - DAY                                         54.

       Tall, vine-covered trees sway in the wind.  Beneath them, the el-
       ephants plough through the dense tropical forest.  The sounds of
       the teeming jungle multiply as Short Round surveys the distant
       hills.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy, look!

                                   INDIANA
                       That's it.  Pankot Palace.

       Willie looks off at the resplendent while Moghul-style palace ri-
       sing in the distance above the jungle.

                                                               CUT TO:

55.    EXT.  A JUNGLE CLEARING - LATER                                55.

       Their Mayapore guide walks toward the camera and suddenly looks
       frightened.  He barks commands and the elephants stop.  Indiana
       jumps down an joins the fearful guide.

       They stare at a small statue of a malevolent goddess with eight
       arms.  Around the goddess's neck, a carved necklace displays
       small human heads -- her eight hands hold other heads by their
       hair.

       Indiana moves closer to the statue as the terrified guide backs
       away.  Indy is fascinated by the ritual objects adorning it:
       leaves, dead birds, rodents and turtles.  Indiana grimaces as he
       lifts a necklace of real pierced human fingers...

                                   WILLIE (O.S.)
                       Why are we stopping here?

       Indiana goes back and joins the scared, jabbering guide who is
       helping Willie down from the elephant.  Short Round jumps down.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       What you look at, Indy?

                                   INDIANA
                       Just a statue.

                                   WILLIE
                       What's the guide talking about?
                       He hasn't said a word the whole
                       trip.

       Indy listens to the agitated guide and then speaks a few words in
       Hindi back to him.  They watch the distressed guide trun the ele-
       phants and start away with them as fast as possible.

                                   WILLIE
                       He's afraid of something.

                                   INDIANA
                       He said he couldn't take us any
                       farther.  He has to go sell the
                       elephants.

                                   WILLIE
                       You mean we have to walk the rest
                       of the way?

       Willie moans and follows Indy.  Short Round watches the elephants
       trudging away.  The little elephant turns and looks back.  Short
       Round quickly wipes a tear from his face.

                                                               CUT TO:

56.    EXT.  A PALACE APPROACH - AFTERNOON                            56.

       Indiana and Short Round hike up a rock-paved road beside a high
       wall.  Exhausted, carrying her high heels, Willie trudges along
       behind them.

                                   WILLIE
                       -- shot at, fallen out of a plane,
                       nearly drowned, squashed by a snake,
                       attacked by a bat -- I smell like
                       an elephant!
                                 (yelling)
                       I tell you I'm not going to make it!

       Indiana finally stops.  He walks back to Willie, suddenly picks
       her us in his arms and starts carrying her the remaining way.
       Willie is surprised and puzzled.

                                   INDIANA
                       Any more complaints?

                                   WILLIE
                              (smiling faintly)
                       Yeah, I wish you'd thought of this
                       sooner...

       She doesn't seem to mind being carried by Indy.  He arrives at
       the entrance to the palace and puts her down -- she stands close
       to him and he gently smoothes the collar of her dress.

                                   INDIANA
                       It doesn't feel like there's been
                       any permanent damage.

       She smiles at him again and then turns around -- and whistles as
       she sees Pankot Palace:  a sprawling, monumental mixture of Mo-
       ghul and Rajput styles, the palace is an extravaganza of Princely
       architecture.

57.    EXT.  A BRIDGE                                                 57.

       The three travelers start across a marble bridge toward the main
       entrance.  Lined along the bridge, palace guards stand with
       lances.

       As the threesome passes, the first Rajput guard snaps noisily to
       attention and Willie jumps.  As Willie continues across the
       bridge, the other guards snap to attention in sequence and she
       grins, enjoying the attention.

58.    INT.  THE OUTER COURTYARD                                      58.

       Short Round and Willie follow Indiana through a dark archway into
       a glittering courtyard.  The palace seems deserted and forebod-
       ing.

                                   INDIANA
                       Hello?...(hello?)...(hello?)

       Indy's voice echoes off the marble facades -- three enormous Raj-
       put guards with curved swords in their sashes appear silently at
       opposite sides of the courtyard.

                                   WILLIE
                               (frightened)
                       Hi...(hi)...(hi)...

       Then, a tall severe-looking Indian in an English suit material-
       izes out of the shadows and comes forward slowly.  CHATTAR LAL
       appraises the intruders suspiciously:

       He sees a whoozy beauty in a weary evening gown;  a dirty Chinese
       kid with a baseball cap; a rugged-looking American carrying a
       bullwhip...

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       I would say you look rather lost.
                                  (disdainfullt)
                       But then I cannot imagine where
                       in the world the three of you
                       would look at home...

                                   INDIANA
                                (smiling evenly)
                       Lost?  No, we're not lost.  We're
                       on our way to Delhi.  This is Miss
                       Scott -- and Mr. Round.  My name's
                       Indiana Jones.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                                  (surprised)
                       Dr. Jones?  The eminent archae-
                       ologist?

                                   WILLIE
                       Hard to believe, isn't it...?

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       I remember first hearing your name
                       when I was studying at Oxford.  I
                       Am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for
                       His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.

       He bows and Willie sort of curtsies.

                                   CHATTAR LAL (Cont'd)
                       Welcome to Pankot Palace.

59.    INT.  PANKOT PALACE - AFTERNOON                                59.

       They walk along the marble halls, past dazzling walls inlaid with
       pieces of mirror and semi-precious stones.  Fountains spray in
       ivory countyards and they gaze in awe at the ornate splendour.

       As Willie walks with Shorty she appraises the chronolgoical
       portraits of the Pankot Prices that line the hall.  Dissipated 
       faces, elegant faces, evil faces -- she reacts to them.

                                   WILLIE
                               (to Short Round)
                       How'd you like to run into him in
                       a dark alley...that one's kind of
                       cute...I could see myself married
                       to a prince like that...

       Ahead of them Chattar Lal  walks with Indy and questions him
       suspiciously --

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       The plane crash and your journey
                       here sound -- most incredible.

                                   WILLIE
                       You should have been there...

                                   INDIANA
                       We'd appreciate it if the Mahara-
                       jah would let us stay tonight.
                       We'll be on out way in the morn-
                       ing.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       I am only his humble servant, but
                       the Maharajah usually listens to
                       my advice.

                                   WILLIE
                       Is that him?

       They've come to the last in the row of Princes portraits.  Wil-
       lie stops and looks up disappointedly at a picture of an aged,
       immensely corpulent Rajput prince.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                                (politely)
                       He's not exactly what we call
                       "a spring chicken".

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       No, no, that is Uhmed Singh, the
                       present Maharajah's late father.

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh -- good.  And maybe the pres-
                       ent Marahajah is a little younger?
                       And thinner?

       Two female servants approach silently and bow.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       They will escort you to your rooms
                       now.  You will be provided with
                       fresh clothes.  Tonight you will
                       be dining with His Highness.

                                   WILLIE
                       Dinner?  And with a prince?!  My
                       luck is changing.  But look at
                       me -- my god, I've to to get
                       ready!

       She hurried off with one of the servants toward her room.  Chat-
       tar Lal smiles cooly at Indiana --

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       Eight o'clock in the Pleasure
                       Pavilion.

                                                               CUT TO:

60.    EXT.  THE PLEASURE PALIVION - NIGHT                            60.

       An extraordinary gold dome rises in the middle of the eleaborate
       gardens.  The Pleasure Pavilion is ablaze with torch lights,
       flickering candles and exotic music.

       Indiana comes out of the palace with Short Round.  Indy has on a
       tweed jacket and a nectie -- his university professor's outfit.
       Short Round has been cleaned up, but still sports his baseball
       cap.

       Willie joins them, looking stunning is a silk Western-styled
       gown.  She's also been loaned some Moghul jewelry which sparkles
       on her neck and arms.

                                   INDIANA
                       You look like a princess.

       Willie's flattered by the first nice thing Indy's said to her.

                                   WILLIE
                       It's sort of like being in heaven.

       They cross the garden toward the pavilion and Willie's eyes are
       like a kid's at Christmas.

61.    INT.  THE PLEASURE PAVILION                                    61.

       As they enter, Indiana gives a half-dressed dancing girl the
       once-over as she spins to the music of drums and "vinhas".

                                   INDIANA
                                  (smiling)
                       I've always had a weakness for
                       folk dancing.

                                   WILLIE
                                  (snidely)
                       She might get away with that act
                       here, but she'd never make it in
                       a real nightclub.

       They walk among the rich court ministers and Indian merchants.
       Chattar Lal approaches with a British cavalry captain in unifrom.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       We are fortunate tonight to have
                       some many unexpected guests.  his
                       is Captain Phillip Blumburtt.

       Blumburtt bows to Willie and Indiana.

                                   CHATTAR LAL (Cont'd)
                       Captain Blumburtt and his troops
                       are here to check up on the
                       "natives".

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                                  (politely)
                       Just a routine inspection tour.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       The British worry so about their
                       Emprie -- it makes us feel like
                       well-cared-for children.

                                   WILLIE
                       Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call
                       the Maharajah's  wife?

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       His Highness has not yet taken a
                       wife.

                                   WILLIE
                                  (happily)
                       No?  Well, I guess he just hasn't
                       met the right woman...

       As Willie chatters on with the Prime Minister, Indiana wanders
       off.  He moves to a wall where bronze statues and strange devo-
       tional objects are displayed.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                                  (joining Indy)
                       Interested in local curios?

                                   INDIANA
                       No.  But I am interested in the
                       occult.  And this is a krtya.

       Indiana picks up a small clay figurine and examines it.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                                   (grimacing)
                       Charming.

                                   INDIANA
                       It's like the voodoo dolls of West
                       Africa.  The kryta represents your
                       enemy -- and gives you complete
                       power over him.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       That God all that mumbo jumbo
                       rubbish is disappearing.

                                   INDIANA
                       You think so?

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       Of course.  Admittedly, it's taken
                       time.  Britian's controlled India
                       for almost two hundred eyars now.

       Indiana smiles at the somewhat pompous bureaucrat.

                                   INDIANA
                       You're hanging on better here
                       than you did in America.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                                  (smiling sourly)
                       This is a different situation, Dr.
                       Jones.  These people are like
                       children.  We have to lead them
                       slowly into the twentieth century.

       Indiana puts the doll down and looks over at Chattar Lal and
       Willie.

                                   INDIANA
                       The Prime Minister doesn't seem
                       that naive.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       No, he's a very shrewd old boy.
                       Power behind the throne and all
                       that.  He actually runs this whole
                       province.

       Indy and the Prime Minister exchange distant looks as Willie
       comes back over to Indiana.  She talks to him conspiratorially --

                                   WILLIE
                       I think this Maharajah is swim-
                       ming in money.  Maybe coming here
                       wasn't such a bad idea.

       Blumburtt finds these Americans quite suspect and seems relieved
       when he hears a drum.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       I believe we're being called to
                       dinner.

                                   WILLIE
                       Finally!

       As the drum beats the assembled guests move toward a long, low
       table surrounded by colorful pillows.  Short Round follows with a
       little monkey he's found perched on his arm.

       As everyone stands around the table, Chattar Lal makes an an-
       nouncement in Hindi and then in English --

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       His Supremem Highness, guardian of
                       Rajput tradition -- the Maharajah
                       of Pankot -- Zalim Singh.

       All eyes are on two solid silver doors which open -- and through
       which now walks the MAHARAJAH ZALIM SINGH.  Everyone is bowing,
       including Indiana and Willie, who looks amazed --

                                   WILLIE
                       That's the Maharajah -- that kid?!

                                   INDIANA
                       Maybe he likes older women.

       Indeed, Zalim Singh is only thirteen.  Outfitted in silver and
       gold brocade, festooned with enormous jewels, the litlle Mahara-
       jah gazes imperiously at the bowing crowd -- and then glares at
       Short Round.

       Indy sees Short Round chewing gum, staring antagonistically at
       the Maharajah.  Indy pushes SHort Round into a bowing position.

       The Maharajah finally sits down on golden pillows.  He nods and
       his guests take their seats.  Indiana sees Willie's dreams of
       queendom have vanished.

                                   INDIANA
                       Cheer up, you lost your prince,
                       but dinner's on the way.

                                   WILLIE
                       I've never been so hungry in my
                       life...

       Servants appear with silver platters of steaming food.  They
       place a platter in front of Willie and she stares at it in amaze-
       ment:

       It's a whole raosted boar, replete with a decorative arrow pierc-
       ing its bloated stomach and tiny broiled baby bores placed around
       it as if they were suckling on their well-cooked mother.

                                   WILLIE
                                 (grimacing)
                       My god, sort of grusome, isn't
                       it...?

       Seeing the meat being served, Indiana looks across the table at
       Blumburtt who seems equally puzzled.  Meanwhile, the little Maha-
       rajah whispers to his Prime Minsiter.  Then Chattar Lal speaks to
       the table --

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       His Highness wants me to welcome
                       his visitors.  Especially the
                       renowned Dr. Jones from America.

       Indy bows slightly toward the Maharajah.

                                   INDIANA
                       We are honored to be here.

       Servants put down another platter.  Willie stares at an enormous
       steaming boa constrictor on the platter.  With a flash of a
       knife, a servant slits the huge snake and exposes a mass of
       squirming, live baby eels inside...

                                   WILLIE
                       Suddenly I'm not so hungry...

       Meanwhile, Indiana is chatting poleitely with the Prime Minister.

                                   INDIANA
                       I had a question, Mr. Prime Mini-
                       ster.  I was examining some of the
                       Maharajah's artifacts.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       A very fine collection of very old
                       pieces, don't you think?

                                   INDIANA
                       Yes, very fine.  But not all of the
                       pieces look old.  Some were carved
                       recently and look like images used
                       by the Thuggees to worship the god-
                       des Kali.

       At the emntion of the Thuggees, the Indians at the table quiet,
       as it a taboo has been broken.  Chattar Lal glares at Indiana.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       Dr. Jones, you know very well that
                       the Thuggee cult has been dead for
                       nearly a century.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       Of course.  The Thuggees were an
                       obscenity that worshipped Kali
                       with human sacrifices.  The Brit-
                       ish Army wiped them out about the
                       time of the Mutiny of 1857.

       Short Round avoids the dinner by feeding it to his little monkey
       as he listens to the scary conversation.

       The talk is bad enough, but Willie finds the food unbelievable!
       A servant leans overher shoulder and places a six-inch long BUG
       on her plate!

       Willie whimpers quietly as she watches the fat merchant next to
       her lift one of the black, shiny baked-beetles -- and crack it in
       two!  The man proceeds to enthusiastically suck the gooey innards
       out.

                                   MERCHANT
                              (looking at Willie)
                       But you're not eating!

                                   WILLIE
                                  (weakly)
                       I uh -- had bugs for lunch.

       Meanwhile, Indiana continues to politely needle Chattar Lal.

                                   INDIANA
                       I suppose stories of the Thuggees
                       die hard.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       There are no stories anymore.

                                   INDIANA
                       Well, I don't know... we came here
                       from a small village and the peas-
                       ants there told us that the Pankot
                       Palace was growing powerful again
                       -- becuase of some ancient evil.

       Indiana smiles and shrugs.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                                  (sneeringly)
                       Their stories are just fear and
                       folklore.

                                   INDIANA
                                   (cooly) 
                       Maybe.. but how do you explain
                       The Thuggee shrine I saw right
                       below the palace?

       Indy catches a glance between the little Maharajah and the prime
       minister, who answers slowly --

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       The local peasants are just as
                       superstitious.  You're very ob-
                       servant, Dr. Jones.  But you're
                       beginning to worry Capt. Blum-
                       burtt.

       Blumburtt's phlegmatic attitude has changed to curiosity.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       I'm not worried, Prime Minister,
                       just interested.

       During their conversation, Willie listens to beetles SNAPPING and
       she watches revolted as the other dinner guests suck the gooey
       insides out of the bugs.

                                   WILLIE
                             (to Short Round)
                       Give me your hat...

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       What for?

                                   WILLIE
                       I'm going to puke in it...

       Meanwhile, Indy continues ingenously with Chattar Lal.

                                   INDIANA
                       You know the villagers also
                       claimed that this palace stole
                       something from them.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       Dr. Jones, it our country a guest
                       does not usually insult his host.

                                   INDIANA
                       Sorry, I thought we were just talking
                       about folklore.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                           (trying to make peace)
                       I'm sure it's nothing.  Just ru-
                       mors.
                                  (but interested)
                       What was it they claimed was
                       stolen?

                                   INDIANA
                       Something magical.  A sacred rock.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                                 (condescendingly)
                       There, you see, Captain.  A rock!

                                   INDIANA
                       When they lost this rock their
                       fields and animals dies.  They
                       also said their children were
                       taken from them.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       I think that's enough  of this
                       nonsense, Dr. Jones...

       Indiana smiles faintly at Chattar Lal's anger.  Across the table,
       Willie looks pale and motions to the waiter.

                                   WILLIE
                       So you have something, you know,
                       simple -- like soup or something?

       The servant goes off and returns with a covered bowl.  He uncov-
       ers it and Willie looks at a soup with a dozen eyeballs floating
       in it.

                                   MERCHANT
                       Looks delicious!

                                   WILLIE
                       I wanna go home...

       Willie whimpers and tears start down her cheeks.

                                   INDIANA
                               (to Chattar Lal)
                       I was dubious muself at first.
                       Then something connected -- the
                       village's rock and the old legend
                       of the Sankara Stones...

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                            (controlling himself)
                       Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable
                       to vicious rumors.  I seem to re-
                       member that in Honduras you were
                       accused of being a grave robber
                       rather than a scientist.

                                   INDIANA
                                 (shrugging)
                       The newspapers exaggerated the
                       incident

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       And didn't the Sultan of Madagas-
                       car threaten to cut your head off
                       if you ever returned to his coun-
                       try?

                                   INDIANA
                       That was a misunderstanding.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                                   (smiling)
                       Exactly what we have here, Dr.
                       Jones.

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       I have heard the terrible stories
                       of the evil Thuggee cult...

       When the little Marahajah speaks it surprises everyone and there
       is silence.

                                   MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)
                       I thought the stories were told
                       to frighten children.  Later, I
                       learned that the Thuggee cult was
                       once real and did unspeakable
                       things.

       The Marahajah looks at Indiana.

                                   MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)
                       I am ashamed of what happened here
                       so many years ago.  We keep these
                       objects -- to remind us that this
                       will never again happen in my
                       kingdom!

                                   INDIANA
                              (after a moment)
                       I'm sorry if I've offended you.

       Now, more trays are whisked in by servants.

                                   MERCHANT
                       Ah, dessert!

       Short Round's monkey suddenly screeches and takes off.  Willie
       closed here eyes in dread - but curiosity gets the best of her
       and she looks -- it's worse than she could imagine:

       Plates full of small, dead monkey heads!  (*Production note: be-
       cause of his extremely sensitive nature, the director has reque-
       ted that these monkey heads be simulated).

       The tops of the monkey's skulls have been cut off and sit loose
       like little covers.  Willie watches in utter dismay as the Maha-
       rajah and his guests remove the skull-tops and start dipping
       spoons into what's inside --

                                   MERCHANT (Cont'd)
                       Chilled monkey brains!

       Willie keels over, crashing backwards in a dead faint!

                                                               CUT TO:

62.    INT.  A PALACE HALL - LATER                                    62.

       Women servants help a woobly-kneed Willie toward her room.

63.    EXT.  THE PELASURE GARDEN - NIGHT                              63.

       Hundreds of lanters illuminate the garden where after dinner
       drinks are served, cigars lighted and hookah pipes puffed on.

       Indiana comes out of the pavilion into the garden with Capt.
       Blumburtt and they talk quietly.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       Rather bizarre menu, woundn't you
                       say?

                                   INDIANA
                       Even if they were trying to scare
                       us away, a devout Hindu would
                       never touch meat.
                                (looking around)
                       Makes you wonder what these people
                       are...

       Now, the little Maharajah comes over with his retinue and he
       reaches for Indy's whip which Short Round is carrying.

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       I have seen this thing.  What is
                       it, Dr. Jones?

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Hey, nobody touches Indy's whip!

       Short Round grabs for it, but Indiana restrains him.

                                   INDIANA
                       We're guests here, Shorty.

       The Maharajah glares are Short Round and five the whip to Indy.

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       You will show me how it works
                       please.

       Indy bows to the little prince and smiles ironically --

                                   INDIANA
                       You wish is my command, your
                       Highness.

       While Short Round watches angrily, Indiana walks across the gar-
       den and unfurls the whip.  Indy sees a servant lighting a candle.

       Suddenly the whip flies and CRACKS like a pistol shot.  The
       candle disappears!  Indiana whirls and CRACKS the whip again,
       snagging a flower out of a dancing girl's hair.

       The Maharajah reacts like any kid -- he shoops happily.

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       That is wonderful!  Please teach
                       me how!

       Short Round sulks as he listens to Indiana instructing the Maha-
       rajah on how to hold the whip.  As the young prince practises the
       grip, Indy notices Chattar Lal slip behind a fountain to talk to
       a dark figure in robes who appears.

       Indiana sees Chattar Lal bow to the dark figure -- and Indy
       catches a glimpse of the stranger's pale face and dark hollow
       eyes.  Then the robled apparition seems to disappear.

       Meanwhile everyone watches respectfully as the Maharajah unfurls
       the whip for his first attempt.  He flings the whip but it flies
       back and snaps  -- biting his own  cheek.

       There's a stunned silence -- then Short Round laughs  at the
       little prince who is holding his wounded cheek.  The incensed Ma-
       rahajah suddenly flashes the whip as Short Round.

       Short Round grabs the end of it and pulls hard -- the whip is
       tugged taut between the two hostile boys.  As they draw near each
       other, Short Round sees something weird:

       The little Maharajah's eyes begin glowing yelloe and he hisses
       softly in a strange voice.  Nobody else sees or hears the bizarre
       transformation...

       Indiana finally intercedes -- he grabs Short Round by the neck.

                                   INDIANA
                       Okay, Short Round, let go of it.

       Short Round lets go and Indy gently takes the whip back from the
       little prince.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       The Turks say that a whip can be
                       an enemy even to its owner.  If
                       you get some rope, it'll be easier
                       to learn with, your Highness.
                       Now, I think we'll say goodnight.

       The Maharajah and Short Round stare hostiley at each other as
       Indy recoils his whip.

                                                               CUT TO:

64.    INT.  A PALACE HALL - NIGHT                                    64.

       Short Round walks beside Indiana down the shadowy hall toward
       their room.  Short Round has Indy's whip curled around his shoul-
       der.  The little fellow yawns and shakes his head.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       That little Maharajah think he
                       big stuff.

                                   INDIANA
                       You don't like him do you?

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Next time I flatten him!  Did you
                       see his eyes?

                                   INDIANA
                       No.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy, they glow like fire and get
                       real crazy!  Then he talk in this
                       real scary voice!

       Indy tousles Short Round's hair.

                                   INDIANA
                       He was afraid of you.  He knows a
                       tough  guy when he sees one.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                                  (not so shure)
                       Yeah, that's what happened...

       They reach their room and Short Round opens the door.

                                   INDIANA
                       I better see how Willie is.

       Short Round shakes his head scornfully as Indy crosses the hall
       and knocks on another door.  After a moment, the door opens and
       Willie is standing there in a tempting nightgown.

                                   INDIANA
                       I brought you something.

       He holds up something wrapped in a piece of silk.

                                   WILLIE
                                (disgusted)
                       Not leftovers?

                                   INDIANA
                       No -- real food.

       Willie opens the bundle suspiciously -- then her hace lights up
       as she examines the breads and fruits inside.

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh, it is real food...it's
                       beautiful.

       She bites happily into a piece of fruit -- its juice runs down
       her chin and Indy wipes it off gently with his hand.  The mouth
       deliberately seductive and Willie is not displeased.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       You're nice.  Listen, I'm taking
                       applications -- how'd you like to
                       be my palace slave?

                                   INDIANA
                                  (smiling)
                       Wearing your jewels to be, prin-
                       cess?

       Indy touches her necklace -- then his hand caresses her neck and
       ear.  She shivers slightly and speaks softly.

                                   WILLIE
                       Yeah -- and nothing else.
                                  (smiling)
                       That shock you?

                                   INDIANA
                              (shaking his head)
                       I'm a scientist.  I like doing
                       research on certain "nocturnal
                       activities" --

       She smiles and puts a grape to his lips.  He opens his mouth
       takes it and chews it.

                                   WILLIE
                       You mean like love rituals...

       He swallows the grape and they move toward each other slowly to
       kiss, revealing the passion that's simmering.

                                   INDIANA
                       And mating customs...

       They kiss again more heatedly.

                                   WILLIE
                       Primitive sexual practices?

                                   INDIANA
                       You're taling to an authority
                       in that area.

       They kiss again hungrily --

                                   WILLIE
                       You're dying to come into my room,
                       aren't you?

                                   INDIANA
                       You want me so bad, why don't you
                       invite me?

                                   WILLIE
                       Too proud to admit you're crazy
                       about me, Dr. Jones?

                                   INDIANA
                       I think you're too used to get-
                       ting you own way, Willie...

       They kiss yet again -- and Indy breaks it off, just to show he's
       still in control.  He backs away toward his room.

                                   WILLIE
                              (watching him)
                       We'll see who gives in first --
                       I'll leave my door open.

                                   INDIANA
                       Don't catch cold.

                                   WILLIE
                       Dr. Jones -- ?

       Indy stops by his door and sees Willie smiling as she holds up
       five fingers --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Five minutes... you'll be back
                       over here in five minutes...

                                   INDIANA
                       You're dreaming, Willie.  You want
                       to make it real, just knock on my
                       door.

       He winks.  She waves.  But neither one will surrender first.
       Willie does into her room, leaving the door ajar.  Indy opens his
       door.

65.    INT.  INDIANA'S SUITE                                          65.

       Indy comes in and closes the door -- leaving it open a crack.  He
       stands and listens, waiting for her to come over.

66.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           66.

       Willie stands likewise by her door, waiting to hear Indy come
       back over.

67.    INT.  INDIANA'S SUITE                                           67.

       Indiana shrugs and walks over to a couch and starts taking off
       his tweed jacket and necktie --

                                   INDIANA
                       Five minutes... fat chance.

68.    INT.  WILLIE SUIT                                              68.

       Willie moves around her lavish suite, turning down lights, creating
       a romantic effect, checking herself in a mirror --

                                   WILLIE
                                (confidently)
                       Five minutes, Dr. Jones...

69.    INT.  INDIANA'S SUITE                                          69.

       Indy undresses in the magnificently decorated room:  wall paint-
       ings show palace scenes and landscapes; life-size figures
       dance and there are full-scale portraits or Rajput princes and
       prancing horses.  But Indy's more concerned with lust than with
       art.

                                   INDIANA
                                 (muttering)
                       ...want me to be her palace slave!

       He picks up his whip and smiles, considering using it on her.
       Then he just grubles and tosses the bullwhip onto the couch.

70.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           70.

       Lying in bed in a seductive pose, Willie waits for Indy to show
       up and she starts to look worried.  She grabs a clock and shakes
       it to see if it's working.  She taps her fingers irritably won-
       dering in her charm has failed...

71.    INT.  INDIANA'S SUITE                                          71.

       We see another clock ticking.  Looking annoyed, Indy tosses a
       boot at it and the clock falls on its face, setting of the
       alarm.

       On the chaise lounge in front of Indy's bed, Short Round moves
       groggily and sees Indy turning off the alarm.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                                  (half asleep)
                       Get to sleep Indy -- I stay up
                       and keep eye on things...

                                   INDIANA
                       Okay, Shorty ... see you in the
                       morning...I'm going to have a
                       little -- word with Willie.

       Indy finally shakes his head and gives in to his animal
       instincts.  He buttons his shirt, puts his boots back on and
       grabs his leather jacket.

       As he puts on his jacket he walks past the life-sized paintings of
       armed gaurds standing in silent vigil.  Suddenly we see something
       frightening behind him:  one of the wall paintings sees to come
       to life!

       A large figure in robes and a turban looms out from the wall and
       lifts a silk cord -- the figure wraps the cord suddenly around
       Indiana's neck!

       The huge assassin stands behind Indy, twisting the cord even
       tighter around his neck.  As Indy attempts to break free he
       sees the assassin's face is a mirror -- and a strange yellow
       light glowing in the killer's eyes.

72.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           72.

       Willie's finally had enough waiting and she gets out of beg petu-
       lantly.

                                   WILLIE
                       He's not coming...I can't be-
                       lieve it...

       She walks across the room and opens the door.  She looks out
       the empty hall -- and her resolve starts to weaken --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Well...
                               (bracing herself)
                       No!  I'm not going over there...

       She comes back into her room and kicks the door closed.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Sleep tight, Dr. Jones!
                               (suddenly melancholy)
                       I could've been your greatest ad-
                       venture...

73.    INT.  INDIANA'S SUITE                                          73.

       Indy shoves the assassin backwards, ramming the big man into the
       wall.  The assassin maintains his deathgrip -- while on the
       chaise, Short Round sleeps through it all!

       Gasping futilely for air, Indy sinks slowly to his knees  - his
       eyes bulge and he stares at the tiny, smiling skulls at the ends
       of the death-cord wrapped around the assassin's fists.

       Indiana sinks lower and then feels something -- desperately he
       grabs a brass pot on the floor by the handle and swings it with
       his last strength, smashing it up into the assassin's head with
       a skull-crushing clang!

       The assassin is stunned and Indiana curls forward pulling him
       into a somersault and sening him flying over his back.  The ass-
       assin crashes on his sping next to the chaise.  Short Round still
       doesn't wake up.

       Indiana rips the cord from around his neck and gasps for breath.
       He sees the assassin pulling a knife.  Indiana dives as the knife
       flies through the air and slams into the wall.

       Indiana grabs his whip, rolls and lands on his feet.  As the ass-
       assin tries to retreat, Indy unleashes his whip -- it CRACKS and
       wraps around the killer's neck.

       The big man struggles, pulling on the whip, trying to release it
       from his throat -- and Indiana holds fast, watching the killer
       gasping for air now as his face turns red.

       Suddenly the assassin does a full-blown backward sommersault
       which rips the whip out of Indy's hand.  The assassin has an in-
       stant to grin victoriously --

       Until he sees that the whip handle is arching toward the ceiling
       where is gets caught on the revolving fan!  The surprised assass-
       in it tugged upwards -- and the whip twists around the ceiling
       fan like fishing-line around a fishing-reel--

       And like a doomed flounder, the assassin is slowly reeled up and
       dragged toward the ceiling, his toes lifting off the floor.
       The assassin screams as he is hanged!  His legs twitch in
       his death throes -- and below him, Short Round finally wakes up.

       Always Indiana's protector, Shorty instictively leaps off the
       couch and draws a small dagger --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Don't worry, Indy!  Where are
                       they?!

       Short Round spins a 360 , then looks up and does a double-take
       seeing the dead assassin twisting slowly around the ceiling fan.
       Indy takes Short Rund by the shoulders and turns him away from
       the grisly sight.

                                   INDIANA
                       It's okay, it's over -- go turn
                       off the fan.

       Short goes over and turns off the fan -- the assassin's body
       drops and Indy recoils his whip.  Suddenly they hear a hideous
       scream -- Willie!

74.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           74.

       In a tight close-up:  Willie screams again.  She's lying in bed
       looking down at something --

       Moving up her shapely leg, a green and black, monstrous-looking
       insect crawls onto her stomach and Willie stops breather.  Immo-
       bilized by fear, Willie watches in silent agony as the hideous
       insect climbs slowly up her breast and slithers toward her neck.

       Across the suite, the doors burst open and Indiana rushes in.
       Shorty is behind him, carrying Indy's whip.  Indiana leaps on a
       stools and slides up to the bed to save WIllie --

       Then he spots the giant insect crawling on her and decides to
       have some fun.

                                   INDIANA
                       This a cheap trick to get me over
                       here?

       Willie speaks with desperate, fearful precision --

                                   WILLIE
                       No -- don't you see -- crawling --

                                   INDIANA
                       What -- the bug?

       Willie is petrified and shaking.

                                   WILLIE
                       Get -- the -- bug -- off!

                                   INDIANA
                       Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an
                       ugly critter like that!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                                   (grinning)
                       Uh uh -- me neither!

       Willie looks at the man-of-action like he's insane.  Then she
       feels the bug crawling onto her cheek --

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh no -- oh no!!

                                   INDIANA
                               (studying the bug)
                       You know, Willie, I'll bet he's
                       mad because they were eating his
                       friends for dinner.

                                   WILLIE
                       Please -- oh please, I'm going to
                       die!  Get it off!

       Indiana shrugs and leans over and casually swats the horrible bug
       off her face.  He and Short Round watch the insect skid across
       the floor -- and suddenly disappear as if by magic!

       Puzzled, they wander toward the wall, leaving Willie behind,
       bathed in sweat, staring at the ceiling --

                                   WILLIE
                       What did I do to deserve this
                       trip?!

       Kneeling by the wall, Short Round examines the baseboard --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       It went under.  Hey, I feel
                       wind, Indy.

       Indiana knocks on the wall and considers the hollow sound.  He
       moves back and looks at the whole wall.  Behind him, Willie moves
       past --

                                   WILLIE
                       I'm packing!  I'm getting out of
                       here right now tonight!

       She dashes behind a screen to start getting dressed.  Meanwhile
       Indy feels the marble walls.  He moves to a niche in which there
       is a small statue of Ganesha, the friendly elephant god.

       Indiana lifts the statue -- and a panel in the wall opens slow-
       ly.  Short Round looks amazed.  Indy watches the light fall
       across the far wall of a tunnel as the door opens slowly.

       Indy peers into the tunnel at an old wall painting.  Spiderly San-
       skrit calligraphy runs under a flanking illustration of a prince
       bowing before a god.

                                   INDIANA
                       *(He reads aloud an inscription
                       in Sanskrit).

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       What does it mean, Indy?

                                   INDIANA
                                 (translating)
                       "Follow in the footsteps of
                       Shiva.  Do not betray his truth."

       Indy takes out the piece of cloth the boy gave him in Mayapore,
       the similarities are striking.  It is also a picture of Shiva
       Sankara.

                                   INDIANA
                       *(He repeats aloud the inscrip-
                       tion also written on the cloth)

       Over behind the screen, Willie's getting into some silk pants with
       an Indian-style brocade bodice top --

                                   WILLIE
                       I don't care if I have to walk to
                       Delhi, I'm -- hey!

       She notices Indy and Short Round bending to enter the dark tunnel
       behind the wall.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Wait a minute!  What're you --
                       where're you going?!

       Indy pokes his head back into the room --

                                   INDIANA
                       Lock your door and don't leave
                       until we get back.

       He disappears behind the wall and Willie looks worried.

75.    INT.  A PALACE TUNNEL - NIGHT                                  75.

       Indy and Short Round enter the secret passage and move forward
       slowly into the inky darkness.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       I don't think we suppose to be in
                       here, Indy...

       They creep slowly down the dark tunnel.  It grows smaller and Indy
       ducks his head.

                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)
                       I step on something.

       Their footsteps crunch on the tunnel floor.

                                   INDIANA
                       You're right, there's something
                       all over the floor...

       Even Short Round has to duck and Indy finally kneels to his
       hands and knees.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       We'll have to crawl.

       As they crawl, their hands and knees continue to crunch on what-
       ever it is littering the ground.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy, the floor -- there is some-
                       thing alive!

       Indiana gets a match out of his pocket.  He snaps it with his
       thumb and the match flares -- a hideous insectarium: a living
       collection of the world's ugliest antropods, hexapods and arch-
       nids.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Holy smoke -- I'm scared, Indy!

       Indiana turns and sees something else --

                                   INDIANA
                       There's a chamber here.  Come on --

       Indy finds an oil lamp on the wall and lights it.  Short Round
       happily scampers into the chamber and Indy follows him.  Suddenly
       the door slides shut -- trapping them inside!

76.    INT.  THE CHAMBER                                              76.

       Indiana lights a match and finds another oil lamp.  He and Short
       Round look for a way to open the door that closed behind them,
       but they have no luck.

                                   INDIANA
                       Damn!

       Then they hear Willie's voice echoing down the short tunnel.

                                   WILLIE (O.S.)
                       Hey -- where are you?!

77.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           77.

       Back in the suite, Willie stands by the entrance to the secret
       passage, peering into the dark tunnel --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Indiana Jones?!  Are you in there?!

78.    INT.  THE CHAMBER                                              78.

       Indy mutters irritably to himself --

                                   INDIANA
                       Yes, we're in here...

       He looks everywhere for something to open the door.  Short
       Round spots a loose brick and moves it --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy, I found a --

       Suddenly they hear a rumble and Indy turns to see the opposite
       wall moving -- the spikes start appearing!  Their lethal points
       protrude from the wall as it starts closing in toward Indy and
       Short Round.

                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)
                       Indy -- !

       Shorty points up and Indiana sees more spikes descending from the
       ceiling!  Indy turns toward the door and shouts --

                                   INDIANA
                       Uh -- Willie?!
                                   (louder)
                       Willie, you better get down here!

79.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           79.

       Willie listens and looks scared --

                                   WILLIE
                                (shouting back)
                       What?!

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       Willie, come here!  Hurry up,
                       we're in trouble!!

                                   SHORT ROUND (O.S.)
                       Willie, help!!

       Willie is frightened, confused and jumping around --

80.    INT.  THE SPIKE CHAMBER                                        80.

       The deadly spikes inch slowly toward them from the wall and ceil-
       ing.  They start pounding on the door and shout --

                                   INDIANA
                       Willie, damn it!  Get down here,
                       NOW

81.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           81.

       Willie finds the courage to finally whimper and step into the
       dark passage --

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh hell -- I bet I get all dirty
                       again!

82.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               82.

       Willie starts down the dark tunnel toward the chamber.

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       WILLIE?!

                                   WILLIE
                       I'm coming, what's the rush?!
                       Ohh!  What's that?!  There's
                       stuff all over the floor!  I
                       can't see a thing!

83.    INT.  THE SPIKE CHAMBER                                        83.

       They hear her coming and Indy watches nervously as the spikes
       draw even closer --

                                   INDIANA
                       Move, Willie!  Faster!

84.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               84.

       Willie crawls and crunches on the littered floor --

                                   WILLIE
                       It's all wet and icky!  Aaahh --
                       things are moving!!

       She sees the low lamp by the door to the chamber.

                                   SHORT ROUND (O.S.)
                       Please, Willie!

       She grabs the lamp and turns it up so it burns brighter.  She
       looks around -- and SCREAMS!!  She sees the sickening, swarming
       mass of glistening insects crawling toward her, attracted by the
       light --

                                   WILLIE
                               (hysterical)
                       There's bugs!  Bugs all over!
                       Help!  Help me!

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       Willie, open the door!  GET US
                       OUT OF HERE!

       Willie pounds on the door --

                                   WILLIE
                       OPEN THE DOOR!  LET ME IN!!

85.    INT.  THE SPIKE ROOM                                           85.

       The spikes close in --

                                   INDIANA
                       GET US OUT!  Willie, shut up and
                       listen!  There's got to be a ful-
                       crum release!  Look around!

                                   WILLIE (O.S.)
                       A what?!

86.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               86.

       Willie whines and frantically searches the wall.  Insects are
       crawling and jumping on her and she kicks at them!

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       A fulcrum release lever!

                                   WILLIE
                       I can't find any lever!  Help me
                       Indy!

87.    INT.  THE SPIKE CHAMBER                                        87.

       Indiana and Short Round are backed against the wall and the
       spikes are a foot away and moving in --

                                   INDIANA
                       Look around, Willie!  There's got to
                       be a liever hidden somewhere!  Come
                       on, you can do it!

88.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               88.

       Insects drop onto Willie from the ceiling and fly at her as she
       flattens against the wall.  Then her elbow hits something -- a
       loose stone.  She claws at it and it falls out of the wall
       leaving a hole.

                                   WILLIE
                       There's a hole!  I found a square
                       hole!

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       That's it -- the release lever --
                       look inside!

                                   WILLIE
                       I am -- it looks horrible!

       The hole is revolting :  covered with squirming insects, it also
       oozes some kind of glistening mucus.

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       Reach inside!

       Willie moves her hand toward the nauseating hole then pulls back.

                                   WILLIE
                       I can't, Indy!  I can't!

89.    INT.  THE SPIKE TUNNEL                                         89.

       Indiana turns his head sideways and sucks in his breath, but the
       deadly spikes are poking into his leater jacket now --

                                   INDIANA
                       The lever!  Willie, do it!  NOW!

90.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               90.

       Willie screams and jams her hand into the gross hole --

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh God, it's soft -- it's moving!

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       Willie!

91.    INT.  THE SPIKE CHAMBER                                        91.

       Short Round is frightened to death and crying --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Willie, help us!  Hurry!

92.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               92.

       She hears Short Round crying and twists her hand in the disgust-
       ing hole.  Suddenly the door springs open!  Willie pulls her hand
       out and stares in horror -- her hand and arm are covered with
       greenish slimey mung!

93.    INT.  THE SPIKE CHAMBER                                        93.

       The spikes suddenly retract, disappearing into the wall and clos-
       ing.  Indy pulls Willie inside the chamber and the door slams
       shut again.  Willie dances around, yelling about the hideous slime
       on her arm.

                                   WILLIE
                       Get is off me -- get it off!

       Indy helps her wipe it off.  Willie falls back against the door.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       You left me out there!  What in
                       the hell were you doing in here?!
                       I want to leave this place right
                       now!!

       She sees the same lever that Short Round pulled earlier and grabs
       for it.  Indiana dives and manages to stop her from activating
       the spikes agian.

                                   INDIANA
                       Not that one!  We had enought of
                       that one, thank you...

       He looks around and spots a small rock protruding from the wall.
       Cautiously, praying htat it won't activate another booby trap,
       Indy pushes the rock.

       A large door opens on the other side of the chamber -- a soft
       wind howls past outside the chamber.

94.    INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          94.

       Indiana, Short Round and Willie exit the spike chamber and head
       down a larger tunnel through which a roaring wind intermittantly
       blows, howling eerily like a note of gloomy music.

       Indiana follows a curve in the tunnel and they see light approaching.
       The wind holws another dramatic note which gales past them as
       they reach the mouth of the tunnel.

       Indiana is joined by Willie and Short Round.  They all stop in
       astonishment at the sight below them:

95.    INT.  THE TEMPLE OF DEATH                                      95.

       As the camera pulls back,  the mouth of the wind tunnel in which
       they are standing becomes just a small hole overlooking the stag-
       gering vastness of the incredible TEMPLE OF DEATH.

       The colossal subterranean temple has been carved out of a solid
       mass of rock.  A vaulting cathedral-like ceiling is supported by
       rows of carved stone columns.

       Balconies overlook the temple floor.  Pillared halls leading to
       dark side chambers.  Moving out of these chambers, hundreds of
       faithful worshippers chant as they enter the temple.

       Mammoth stone statues of elephants, lions and demi-gods (half/man,
       half/animal monstrosities) loom above the swelling crowds or wor-
       shippers.

       As the wind howls out of the tunnel high above the temple, the
       worshippers chant in response to the strange tunnel music.

96.    INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               96.

       The moaning wind rushes past Indiana, Willie and Short Round as
       they watch the mystery cult below bowing toward an enormous altar
       at the far end of the temple.

       This altar is a platform jutting out from the stone wall of the
       cavern.  Separating the worshippers from this altar is a wide
       crevasse out of which wisps of smoke rise occasionally.

97.    INT.  THE ALTAR                                                97.

       On the other side of the crevasse, evil-looking priests
       materialize out of clouds of swirling smoke.  The priests carry
       smoke-billowing urns to a giant stone statue.

       Now, we see the hideous protectress of the temple, the obscenely
       malevolent ombect of the cult's devotion:  the bloodthirsty god-
       dess KALI!

       The red-eyed priests bow at the base of the statue and gaze
       reverently at their KALI MA.  Skulls surround her stone feet
       carved serpents twist up her legs, while around her waist there
       is a guresome belt of human hands.

       Naked to the hips, Kali's hair falls about her four arms.  In her
       hand, she holds a sword, in the second the severed head of a
       giant.With her other hands she encourages her worshipers, who
       are chanting louder and louder!

       Kali's face is loathsome:  her earrings are two corpses.  Her
       evil tongue extends out of her twisted mouth and what looks like
       read blood flows over her long fangs and down her naked breasts.

98.    INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          98.

       Watching from the high opening, Willie looks disgusted.

                                   WILLIE
                       What is it...?

                                   INDIANA
                       It's a Thuggee ceremony.  They're
                       whorshipping Kali, the goddess of
                       Death and Destruction.

99.    INT.  THE TEMPLE OF DEATH                                      99.

       A huge drum sounds three times and the chanting stops.  The
       silence is chilling as another robed figure appears out of the
       some on the altar.

       This is MOLA RAM, the High Priest of the Thugge cult.  Mola
       Ram's red-rimmed eyes glare from the sunken sockets in his
       sinister face.  Here is a man who looks as vile and diabolic
       as the unholy goddess rising behind him.

       Up in the wind tunnel, Indy stares down at the High Priest and
       realizes that is was Mola Ram he saw conferring with Chattar Lal
       in the palace garden.

       As the drum booms three times more, Mola Ram lifts one arm
       up from his emaciated body and suddenly there is a scream!

       All heads turn toward an unfortunate, struggling Indian begin
       dragged out by priests.  The man's face and body are wildly
       painted.  He screams again as he's tied onto a square iron frame
       laying atop a large flat stone.

       Mola Ram steps forward to the stretched-out victim and the Indian
       looks up into the High Priest's grotesque face --

       Suddenly Mola Ram's hand shoots out toward the man's chest -- and
       pierces it!  The High Priests hand sinks into the victim's
       writing body and rips out his living heart!

100.   INT. THE WIND TUNNEL                                           100.

       Willie covers her mouth --

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh my God!  He ripped out his --
                       he killed him!

                                   INDIANA
                       No...the heart's still beating!

101.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                101.

       Indeed, the bloody heart is still beating in Mola Ram's hand!
       He lifts the heart into the air and the worhippers begin the chant.

                                   THE MULTITUDE
                       Jai ma Kali, jai ma Kali!

       Stranger still, the sacrificial victim is still alive -- there is
       no evidence of a gash on his chest, only a reddish mark  The
       priests add chains to the iron frame and carry the victim over
       toward a hoist hanging over the crevasse.

       The man thrashes about helplessly on the iron frame as it is up
       ended and then lowered with the victim hanging face down --

       As the sacrificial victim looks down into the crevasse below --
       he screams -- and we see the molten lava bubbling crimson at the
       bottom of the chasm!

102.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          102.

       Willie closes her eyes but Indy and Short Round watch horrified
       as the iron frame is lowered -- and the bloody heart continues to
       beat in Mola Ram's hand -- and the molten lava burns and flickers
       as the screaming victim is lowered deeper into the crevasse.

103.   INT.  THE TEMPLE                                               103.

       The weird paint on the victim's face starts to smoke and sizzle --
       the man's skin blisters as he's lowered within feet of the
       lava.  His flesh smokes and he screams one last time as his body
       bursts into flame.

       The iron frame sinks and submerges into the boiling fiery lava.

104.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                104.

       Above the crevasse, Mola Ram continues to hold the heart in
       his hand -- the heart is smoking and bursts into flames - and
       disappears!

105.   INT.  THE TEMPLE                                               105.

       The iron frame is raised out of the lava -- the metal glows
       like a branding iron, but there is no trace of the sacrificed
       victim.

106.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          106.

       As the wind howls again, Willie and Short Round look sickened and
       appalled by the ceremony.  Even Indy seems shaken by what they
       are witnessing.

                                   THE MULTITUDE
                       Jai ma Kali,  jai ma Kali!

107.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                107.

       Moal Ram raises both hands and his voice echoes strange incanta-
       tions.  Behind him, three priests carry cloth-wrapped objects to-
       ward the altar.

108.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          108.

       Willie is crying and her voice is shoking as she turns awa from
       the hideous ritual --

                                   WILLIE
                       Let's go!  Let's get out of here!

                                   INDIANA
                       Quiet!

109.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                109.

       The priests reverently unwrap three conical pieces of
       crystallized quartz.  The place the three stones below the sta-
       tue of Kali and slowly the smoke around the altar swirls --

       The smoke is drawn to the three stones and they actually start in-
       haling the piraling smoke.  The smoke disappears into the stones
       and the air clears.  Then the three stones start to glow a
       haunting incandescent white.

110.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          110.

       Short Round looks scared.  Willie is still crying -- Indy waits,
       horrified but fascinated.

                                   INDIANA
                       The village knew their rock was
                       magic -- but they didn't know it
                       was one of the lost Sankara Stones...

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Why they glow like that?

                                   INDIANA
                       Legend says that when the stones
                       are brought together the diamonds
                       inside of them will glow.

       Willie wipes her eyes and becomes more interested --

                                   WILLIE
                       Diamonds...?

111.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                111.

       The Sankara Stones shimmer brightly, and inside the crystallized
       quartz, the enormous sparkling diamonds of legend are now re-
       vealed.

       Mola Ram stands facing Kali with his arms outstretched and
       kneels and bows and then walks off the altar and disappears.

112.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          112.

       Indiana sees the woshippers below start to leave the temple.  He
       looks at Willie and Short Round.

                                   INDIANA
                       Okay -- now listen -- you wait here
                       and keep quiet.  Shorty, keep an
                       eye on her.

       Short Round nods and hands Indy his bullwhip and shoulder bag.
       Willie sees Indiana peering down at the sheer drop below the
       mouth of the wind tunnel.

                                   WILLIE
                       Wait -- what're you doing?

                                   INDIANA
                       I'm going down.

                                   WILLIE
                       Down?  Down there?!  Are you
                       crazy --!

                                   INDIANA
                       I'm not leaving without those
                       stones.

                                   WILLIE
                       You're gonna get killed chasing
                       after your damn fortune and
                       glory!

                                   INDIANA
                                (looking at her)
                       Maybe...someday.
                                 (smiling)
                       Not today.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       I keep my eye peeled, Indy.

       Indiana nods and looks down at the now empty temple.  Then he
       slips down from the mouth of the wind tunnel.

113.   INT.  THE TEMPLE WALL                                          113.

       Indiana skillfully clumbs down an enormous tmeple column -- find-
       ing footholds on stone cobras, carved lions and the stone breasts
       of dancing girls.  Slowly, he makes his way down and swings across
       a balcony.

114.   INT.  THE BALCONY                                              114.

       Indiana walks quietly along the balcony overlooking the temple.
       He stops -- between him and the altar is the crevasse with the
       lava bubbling fire at the bottom.

       Indiana looks across the gulf and sees another column near the
       altar at the top of which stone elephants are perched.  Indy
       curls his whip and suddenly lets it fly --

       The whip cracks and its end wraps tightly around the tusk of one
       of the stone elephants.  From the balcony, Indy tugs the whip
       taut, takes a breath and runs --

115.   INT.  THE CREVASSE                                             115.

       Indiana leaps and swings out on the whip, arching down and up,
       over the chasm of fiery lava in a spectacular curving jump!

116.   INT.  THE LATAR                                                116.

       Indy lands on his feet and turns to release the whip.  Short
       Round waves to Indy that the coast is clear.  Indy snaps the whip
       -- it releases from the elephant tusk and drops.

       Recurling the whip, Indy attaches it to his belt and moves to-
       ward the towering statue of Kali.  The three Sankara stones start
       to glow and Indiana approaches them cautiously.

       Reaching the stones, Indy's face is lighted by them.  He notices
       that one of them (sthe stone from Mayapore village) has strange
       lines painted across it.

       Suspiciously, Indy touches the stone, but it doesn't burn.  He
       lifts it carefully and peers into it.  The enormous diamond
       sparkles inside.  He places the stone in his shoulder bag and
       reaches for the others.

117.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          117.

       Short Round and Willie watch apprehensively as Indiana bags the
       three stones.

118.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                118.

       Indiana backs away and looks up at the horrific statue of Kali.
       It seems to be watching him.  He turns and is about to go when he
       hears something --

       It sounds like a voice and Indy is afraid to turn -- could it be
       Kali?  The he hears other noises echoing and turns slowly.  Real-
       alizing the sounds are coming from behind the altar, Indy moves
       around it toward the back.

119.   INT.  THE WIND TUNNEL                                          119.

       Short Round and Willie are mystified as they see Indiana dissap-
       pear behind the altar.

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh hell, where's he going?

       Short Round looks worried.  Then the wind rushes past them quickly
       and howls its somber musical note.  However, the wind sounds dif-
       ferent this time, its tone quavering slightly.

       Short Round is puzzled and looks around.  He  feeezes when he sees
       two shadowy figures coming down the tunnel toward them -- the
       bodies causing the tone of the wind to shift eerily --

       Willie notices Short Round pulling a dagger from his belt -

                                   WILLIE
                       What're you -- ?

       Suddenly she turns and screams as two huge Thuggee guards rush
       at them!  One grabs at Short Round but the kid slashes the
       guard's hand with his dagger.

       Willie tries to get past the other guard, but he snatches her by
       the arm and pulls her toward him -- from her training at the Col-
       lege of Hard Knocks, Willie successfully knees the big man in the
       balls.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Keep your paws off, letch!

       The man groans and sinks to his knees.  Willie sees that Short
       Round is in trouble.  She runs over, leaps onto the back of the
       other guard and starts ripping his hair out.

       Short Round picks up his fallen dagger.  The big guard lurches
       backwards and smashes Willie into the rocky wall of the tunnel.
       Willie falls to the floor.

       Short Round approaches, holding the man at bay with his dagger.
       Willie turns as the other guard, the one she kneed, crawls toward
       her -- Willie scoops up some dirt and throws it.  The man claws
       at his eyes and Willie jumps up.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Run Willie!

       Willie starts to run and Short Round backs away, keeping the
       guard at a distance with his dagger.  Suddenly the guard cries out
       in Hindi and dives at Short Round.

       Panicking, Shorty tries to run after Willie -- but he's tripped.
       The guard has Short Round by the foot and drags him back.  Willie
       looks around and stops running.  She sees Short Round is caught.

                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)
                       No!  Run!  Go get help!

       Willie hesitates, then runs down the tunnel.  Meanwhile, a mam-
       moth hand clutches Short Round's throat -- the giant guard lifts
       Shorty completely off the ground and the kid looks terrified and
       helpless as he dangles in the air...

120.   INT.  CHAMBER BEHIND ALTAR                                     120.

       Indiana enters the dark chamber behind the altar.  The only il-
       lumination is the back-light streaming around the silhouetted
       statue of Kali.

       Indy slowly crosses a narrow stone bridge and moves toward a cy-
       lindrical shaft of light rising up from what appears to be an
       enormous hole.

       Indy hears voices and the clink of metal against rock as he con-
       tinues forward.  The ground is dark in front of the large hole.
       He edges toward the precipice and the light rising up illuminates
       the look of shock on his face as he peers down into Hell...

121.   INT.  THE THUGGEE MINES                                        121.

       Indy looks into a deep pit around which concentric paths leads off
       into numerous narrow tunnels.  Crawling out of these burrows,
       scrawny children drag sacks of dirt and rock.  Other hollow-eyed
       children pull these sacks to mine cars waiting on rails.

       Straining to lift the rocks into the mine cars, several of the
       children slip and fall.  Bare-chested Thuggee guards shout at the
       enslaves children and kick those who've fallen.

       For these children there would seem to be only one hope -- death
       -- an end to their travail.

       Indiana edges around the hole, looking into the ghastly mine and
       feeling as if he's discovered an inferno of misery as grotesque
       as Dante's.

       Indy shifts the bag of stones on his shoulder.  He hesitates and
       considers his choice:  he has the Sankara Stones and can leave
       with them now...

       But Indy hears the pleading cries of one child and peers down to
       see a burly Thuggee guard beating the pitiful little slave.  Indy
       gets angrier and angrier as he watches.

       He finally steps over the grabs a boulder.  He lifts it and
       flings it down into the mine --

122.   INT.  THE MINE                                                 122.

       We see Indiana above and the boulder hurtling down -- it crashes
       onto the head of the Thuggee guard who hits the ground like a
       sack of cement!

12.    INT.  THE CHAMBER                                              123.

       Indy sees the startled slave children looking up at him in shock.
       He smiles victoriously at the Thuggees below who've run over to
       see what happened.

       Indy's smile seems to fade as his anger turns to surprise as he
       feels something unnerving:

       Dirt is crumbling away from the rim of the hole, a small
       landslide starting beneath his feet.  Suddenly the floor gives
       way and Indy slips!

       The entire rim of the hole shears off and Indy topples with it
       and plunges down into the mine toward the assembled guards who
       scatter -- Indy yells as he falls and it echoes...

                                                               CUT TO:

124.   INT.  A CELL - NIGHT                                           124.

       Indiana's yell continues to echo -- his head jerks suddenly --
       Indy jolts awake as if coming out of a nightmare, awakened by his
       own reverberating shout.

       Indy is lying on the rocky floor of a dark cave/cell.  He lifts
       his hands and discovers that they are chained.  In the murky
       light, he sees Short Round sitting in chains across the cell.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy -- you knocked out when you
                       fall.  You okay?

       Indiana nods groggily.  He sees a young slave worker in rags sit-
       ting near Short Round.  Through the iron bars of the cell, Indy
       sees the children slaving in the mine tunnels.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                              (indicating the kid)
                       This is Nainsukh -- from the vil-
                       lage.  They bring him here to dig
                       in the mines.

                                   INDIANA
                       Why?

                                   NAINSUKH
                       Children are small -- we can work
                       in tunnels.  Now I am too old.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       What they do to you now?

                                   NAINSUKH
                       I pray to Shiva -- let me die.
                       But I do not.  Now -- now the
                       evil of Kali take me.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       How?

                                   NAINSUKH
                       They will make me drink blood of
                       Kali.  Then I fall into black
                       sleep of Kali Ma...

                                   INDIANA
                       What is that?

                                   NAINSUKH
                       I become like them.  I be  alive --
                       nut like in nightmare.  You drink
                       the blood, you not wake up from
                       nightmare of Kali Ma.

       There's a noise and they see two guards and a priest outside the
       cell.  Nainsukh cowers in the darkness at the back of the cell,
       like a trapped animal awaiting the inevitable.

                                                               CUT TO:

125.   INT.  A MINE TUNNEL - NIGHT                                    125.

       Indiana and Short Round are pushed down a tunnel by guards.  They
       are stopped at a door and shoved inside.

126.   INT.  MOLA RAM'S CHAMBER                                       126.

       Indiana and Short Round stumble into the chamber.  It is a terri-
       fying gallery of occult yantras, ritualistic statues and grisly
       icons of the evil Thuggee sect.

       Grotesque statues of Kali's baleful minions line the walls.  In a
       corner, there is another statue of Kali herself, draped with
       flowers, necklaces of real human skills and slithering belts of
       live snakes.

       Fresh blood has been splashed over the statue and at its base are
       the three Sankara Stones recovered from Indiana.  Mola Ram sits
       in a yoga position near the statue of Kali.

       Mola Ram opens his eyes and he sees Indiana and Short Round
       standing in chains before him.

                                   MOLA RAM
                       You were caught trying to steal
                       the Sankara Stones.

                                   INDIANA
                                 (shrugging)
                       Nobody's perfect.  The way I
                       heard it, you stole one of them
                       from a small village.

       Mola Ram stands and gazes transfixed at the stones glowing on the
       altar.

                                   MOLA RAM
                       There were five stones in the
                       beginning.  Over the centuries
                       they were dispersed by wars,
                       sold off by thieves like you...

                                   INDIANA
                       Two are still missing.

                                   MOLA RAM
                       No.  They are here -- somewhere.
                       A century ago when the British
                       raided this temple and butchered
                       my people, a loyal priest his the
                       last two stones down here in the
                       catacombs.

                                   INDIANA
                       That's what you've got these chil-
                       dren -- these slaves digging for?

                                   MOLA RAM
                       They dig for the gems to support
                       our cause.  They also search for
                       the last two stones.  Soon we will
                       have all five Sankara Stones and
                       the Thuggees will be all powerful!

                                   INDIANA
                       Nobody can say you don't have a
                       vivid imagination.

                                   MOLA RAM
                       You do not believe me?  You will,
                       Dr. Jones.  You will become a true
                       believer.

       The door opens and Mola Ram bows slightly as the little Maharajah
       enters.  Indy looks surprised and Short Round tenses.

                                   MOLA RAM (Cont'd)
                       Your Highness will witness the
                       thief's conversion.

       Mola Ram nods and two guards grab Indy.  They drag him struggling
       to a rock and chain him to it.  Short Round scuffles as he's
       pulled aside to watch.

       Remembering the High Priest's earlier open-heart surgery, Indi-
       ana looks worried as Mola Ram approaches him --

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       You will not suffer.  I recently
                       became of age and tasted the blood
                       of Kali.

       Now the young initiate comes forward and Indiana looks startled --
       it's Nainsukh.  He is wearing robes and his eyes are glowing
       strangely.  Nainsukh hands Mola Ram a hollow human skull full of
       blood!

       The guards hold Indiana's head back and force his mouth open.
       Mola Ram tips the skull and blood spills out of its death-
       grinning jaws and flows into Indiana's mouth.  Indy gags --

       Suddenly he spits the blood, spraying Mola Ram and the little
       Maharajah.  Looking at his blood-splattered clothes, the Mahara-
       jah is furious.

                                   MOLA RAM
                       Hold him!

       The little prince's eyes glow angrily and he hisses at Indy --

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       You will learn to obey because
                       you are powerless!

       The little Maharajah pulls a small krtya from his robes -- Indy
       sees that the doll has been crudely fashioned to resemble him.

                                   MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)
                       I control you now!

       The Maharajah turns and sticks the doll into a flaming urn.  In-
       diana suddenly cries out and twists in pain as he is burned!  The
       little prince smiles evilly and puts the doll back into his
       robes.

       Then he goes over to where Indy's whip and bag have been laid.
       He grabs the bullwhip.

                                   MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)
                       You told me that a whip could be
                       an enemy to its owner.  We shall
                       see!  Turn him over!

       As the guards turn Indy face down, they rip off his jacket and
       chain his ahnds to the rock.  The Maharajah uncurls the whip -- he
       notices Short Round smiling snidely --

       Suddenly the Maharajah cracks the whip -- it lashes out and cuts
       into Short Round's shoulder.  Blood appears and Short Round looks
       stunned by the lash and by the fact the Marahajah knows who to
       use the whip.

                                   MAHARAJAH (Cont'd)
                       As Dr. Jones suggested, I have
                       been practicing.

       The little Maharajah whirls and lashes the whip again.  Indiana
       jerks as the bullwhip rips through his shirt and tears open his
       flesh.  The Maharajah lashes again and again -- blood spurts
       across Indy's tattered shirt.

       As the whipping continues- Short Round jumps as if he is also be-
       ing beaten.  His eyes fill with tears as he watches Indy suffer.

       Finally, the little Maharajah lets the whip fall limp.  As the
       Maharajah approaches Indy, Short Round lunges as him angrily but
       the guards restrain him.

       Indiana groans as he's turned over.  Blood trickles from his
       mouth and he stares up hatefully at Mola Ram.

                                   MOLA RAM
                       The British in India will be
                       slaughtered.  Then we will over-
                       run the Moslems and force their
                       "Allah" to bow to Kali.

       Mola Ram is once again given the human skull by a priest and he
       lifts it toward Indy's face --

                                   MOLA RAM (Cont'd)
                       And then the Hebrew God will fall
                       and finally the Christian God will
                       be cast down and forgotten.

       Indy's head is held back and Mola Ram spills the blood -- it
       flows out of the mouth of the skull into Indy's mouth.

                                   MOLA RAM (Cont'd)
                       Soon Kali Ma will rule the world!

       Indy's eyes look horrified as the blood flows from the skull down
       his choking throat -- some of the blood spills and falls to the
       floor --

       We see the very earth trembling as the evil spreads -- a fissure
       appears beneath Indy's feet and a small line of crimson lava
       oozes out and smiles evilly across the floor...

                                                               CUT TO:

127.   INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE - NIGHT                                   127.

       Diaphanous curtains billow silently into the moonlighted room.
       Two exotic birds sit on a golden perch, their eyes clicking
       watchfully.  Suddenly the brids shriek and flap away --

       Willie stumbles through the secret door and falls into the room.
       Insects cover her and she shimpers as she knocks them off.  She
       manages to stagger to her feet and she heads for the door.

128.   INT.  THE PALACE - NIGHT                                       128.

       Willie rushes out of her room and runs through the deserted pal-
       ace looking for help.  She flies down the moonlit corridors, past
       the huge wall paintings.

       She stops by a courtyard and calls out desperately, but there is
       no one around.  She backs away down a hallway and then jumps --
       seeing something in a mirror:  a face looms behind her and she
       screams!

       Willie whirls and sees Chattar Lal, the Prime Minister, approach-
       ing her.

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh my God, you scared me!  Listen,
                       you've got to help.  We found this
                       tunnel --

       Captain Blumburtt comes around a corner and interrupts --

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                                   (to Chattar Lal)
                       Jones isn't in his room.  Miss
                       Scott -- my troops are leaving at
                       dawn if you want us to escort you
                       to Delhi --

                                   WILLIE
                       No -- you can't go!  Something aw-
                       ful's happened.  They've got Short
                       Round and I think Indy's been --

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       What?

                                   WILLIE
                       We found a tennel that leads to a
                       temple below the palace!  Please,
                       come with me, I'll show you!

       The two men exchange dubious looks.  Willie grabs Blumburtt by
       the arm and they start down the hall.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       Miss Scott, you're not making any
                       sense.

                                   WILLIE
                       I'm afraid they'll kill them!  We
                       saw horrible things down there --
                       they had a human sacrifice and they
                       ripped a man's heart out!

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       Who?

                                   WILLIE
                       It's some kind of cult!  And they've
                       got the sacred stones that Indy was
                       searching for.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       I sense the fumes of opium in all
                       this.  Prehaps Miss Scott picked
                       up the habit in Shanghai.

                                   WILLIE
                       What're you talking about -- I'm
                       not a dope fiend!  I saw it!  I'll
                       show you!

129.   INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           129.

       She leads them into her suite.  Willie points to the dark opening
       in the wall.  Blumburtt picks up an oil lamp and holds it toward
       the opening -- suddenly he jumps back as Indiana emerges!

                                   INDIANA
                              (smiling faintly)
                       What're we playing, hid and seek?

       They're all startled.  Willie looks relieved and rushes over to
       Indy and puts her arms around him.

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh, Indy, you got away!  Tell them
                       what happened, they won't believe
                       me --

       He puts his arms around her and feels her trembling from fear and
       anger.  He walks her to the bed and helps her sit down --

                                   INDIANA
                       It's okay.  You're all right now.

                                   WILLIE
                       They think I'm insane.  Tell them
                       I'm not, Indy.  Please -- help me ...

       The awful events have taken their toll and Willie covers her face
       and cries like a scared kid.  Indy gets her to lie down on the
       bed.  He sits beside her and smiles and touches her hair --

                                   INDIANA
                       Hey, I thought you were supposed
                       to be a real tropper.  Willie?

       He wipes the tears from her face and she holds his hand --

                                   WILLIE
                                 (quietly)
                       What?

                                   INDIANA
                       You've got to go to sleep now.

                                   WILLIE
                                  (softly)
                       I want to go home...

                                   INDIANA
                       I don't blame you... this hasn't
                       been what you'd call a fun vaca-
                       tion...

       She smiles a little despite herself and he touches her cheek.
       He eyes are already closing and he stands up.

       A servant is entering the suite to take care of Willie.  She cov-
       sers her with a blanket and start dropping the mosquito netting
       as Indy walks off toward the verandah with Blumburtt and Chattar
       Lal.

130.   EXT.  THE VERANDAH - DAWN                                      130.

       The first light is breaking over the mountain peaks.  Coming out
       onto the verandah, Indy and the other two men see the cavalry
       troops breaking camp below and readying their horses and trucks.

                                   INDIANA
                       I've spent by life crawling around
                       in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't
                       have let somebody like Willie go
                       in there with me.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       Miss Scott panicked?

                                   INDIANA
                       When she saw the insects she passed
                       out cold.  I carried her back to
                       her room.  She was sleeping when I
                       re-entered the tunnel to look
                       around.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       As she slept, she undoubtedly had
                       nightmares.

       Indiana looks at him and nods.

                                   INDIANA
                       Then she must have run out of the
                       room and you found her.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       Did you discover anything in that
                       tunnel, Dr. Jones?

       Indiana stares into the rising sun.

                                   INDIANA
                       Nothing.  Just a dead end.  That
                       tunnel's been deserted for years.

       A sergeant-major shouts up to Blumburtt that the troops are
       ready.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                       Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my re-
                       port will duly note that we
                       found nothing unusual here in
                       Pankot.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       I'm sure that will please the
                       Maharajah, Captain.

                                   CAPT. BLUMBURTT
                                   (to Indiana)
                       As I said before, we'd be happy to
                       escort you to Delhi.

                                   INDIANA
                       Thanks, but I don't think Willie is
                       ready to travel yet.

                                                               CUT TO:

131.   EXT.  THE PALACE ROAD - MORNING                                131.

       Dust swirls as the British cavalry moves off with their Highland
       Pipers at the head playing a military bagpipe tune.  Capt. Blum-
       burtt comes out of the palace and gets into an open car.

       Blumburtt's car moves off behind the cavalry and then the supply
       trucks follow.

132.   INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           132.

       The whine of the bagpipes is eerily muted in the dark room.
       Through the gently swaying mosquito netting, we see Willie asleep
       on the bed.

       Then through her side of the gauzy netting, we see the door
       opening across the room.  Indiana enters quietly and moves toward
       the bed, his eyes fixed on Willie's sleeping body.

       Indy sits down on the bed slowly.  Willie turns in her sleep and
       opens her eyes.  Through the mosquito netting she sees Indy sit-
       ting with his back to her.

                                   WILLIE
                       Indy?  Did you walk to them?

                                   INDIANA
                       Yes.

                                   WILLIE
                       So now they believe me.

                                   INDIANA
                       Yes, they believe you.

       Indiana speaks in a strange monotone.

                                   WILLIE
                       Then they'll send the soldiers
                       down into the temple...

       Willie looks at Indiana's back and continues quietly.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       I was scared to death last night
                       when I thought they were going to
                       kill you.

                                   INDIANA
                       No... they won't kill me.

                                   WILLIE
                                (smiling faintly)
                       You know you've been nothing but
                       trouble since I hooked up with
                       you -- but I have to admit I'd
                       miss you if I lost you...

       Now Indiana starts to turn slowly.

                                   INDIANA
                       You won't lose me, Willie...

       She sees him turn and his face slowly comes toward the mosquito
       netting -- his face pushes into the netting and Willie looks
       stunned as Indy's mouth opens --

       He starts hissing grotesquely, smoke billows out of his mouth and
       the mosquito netting BURNS OPEN to expose his terrifying face
       moving toward Willie --

       She is forzen with fear and unable to utter a sound as Indy's
       malevolent face looms at her -- and then she notices his eyes --
       his eyes glowing a hellish luminscent yellow!

       Willie SCREAMS!!

       She suddenly bolts from the bed and tries to run -- Indiana goes
       into a rage, ripping the mosquito netting from the bed as he fol-
       lows her.

                                   INDIANA
                       No!  I've found it -- you can't --
                       Kali knows!

       Willie tries the door but it's locked.  She sees Indiana moving
       toward her ranting incoherently as he smashes a vase out of his
       way --

                                   INDIANA
                       -- been too many lies -- there's no
                       god's heaven -- just -- the horror!
                       I've seen it -- life preying on
                       life!

       Willie cowers in a corner, horrified by the transformation she
       sees in Indiana.  Shouting and pacing Indy holds his head against
       the pain of his terrible thoughts --

                                   INDIANA
                       -- rivers -- destroying mountains --
                       a comet in space -- exploding!
                                 (holding his head)  
                       Aaahh! -- the screams -- pitiful
                       people -- their pain -- the hate --
                       and greed -- always greed!

       The light throws his shadow over Willie -- a giant shadow float-
       ing back and forth over her as she cries in the corner, unable to
       fight the evil devouring Indiana.

                                   INDIANA
                       -- but I've found -- Kali's touch!
                       Death -- no more lies -- the death
                       I've been searching for!
                                  (shouting)
                       Quit crying!  She can hear you --
                       Kali knows fear -- don't you under-
                       stand -- Kali is freedom!

       Indiana stops pacing and Willie freezes in terror.  Now a bizarre
       yellow light wipes across the room.  Indiana turns and watches
       silently as two Thuggee guards emerge from a secret doorway
       that's opened --

       The shadows of the Thuggee guards loom over Willie and she
       SCREAMS again!

                                                               CUT TO:

133.   INT.  THE TEMPLE OF DEATH - DAY                                133.

       A sea of frightening faces once again intones the horrible sacri-
       ficial chant.  Among the shorshippers, the little Maharajah sits
       on a riased platform.  Like the other believers, he stares across
       the crevasse at the altar of Kali Ma.

       The wailing wind howls out of the high tunnel and the terrifying
       chanting reaches a fever pitch.

134.   INT.  THE TMEPLE ALTAR                                         134.

       And once again the three sacred Sankara Stones glow magically.
       Mola Ram materializes evilly amidst the swirling smoke and he
       begins chanting in Sanskrit.

       Beside the altar, half-clad female acolytes pass in front of the
       robed priests -- with their fingers the women paint two white
       lines across the priests' foreheads.

       An acolyte moves in front of Chattar Lal -- the Prime Minister is
       now dressed in robes.  As the devotional markings are painted on
       his forehead, Chattar Lal translates the High Priest's speech to
       Indiana who stands next to him.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       Mola Ram is telling the faithful
                       of out victory.  He says the
                       British have left the palace,
                       which proves Kali Ma's new power.

                                   INDIANA
                       Yes, I understand.

       Indiana bows his head to receive the mystical markings.  He lis-
       tens to Mola Ram's rantings -- Indy's eyes are ominously vacant
       as he stares up at the hideous statue of Kali.

135.   INT.  MINE TUNNELS - DAY                                       135.

       Beneath the temple, down in the bowels of the mountain, the piti-
       ful children dig at the earth with their fingers.  A FAT GUARD
       slouches down the tunnel, flogging malingerers with a aleather
       strap.

       Short Round sweats next to the others, clawing at the rocks,
       doomed to work with them now in their search for the last wo
       Sankara Stones.

       The leather strap suddenly flays Short Round's back and he barely
       manages not to scream out in pain.  The fat guard passes -- Short
       Round and the other kids pull a large rock which suddenly comes
       loose out of the wall -- !

       They fall back and see they've exposed a vein of molten lava!
       Hearing their shouts, the fat guard returns -- yelling at their
       stupidity, he whips them and shoves them aside brutally.

       Short Round see the fat guard's eyes glowing fiercely in anger.
       Suddenly the fissure shoots out steam and spews some molten lava
       over the guard's legs.

       The guard screams and falls to the ground, thrashing about, try-
       ing to kick the searing lava off his smoking flesh.

       As the other kids cower, Short Round's humane instincts cause him
       to jump forward to help the guard who moments earlier was beating
       him --

       Short Round tosses dirt on the guard's legs and grabs a gunny
       sack and starts rubbing the lava off.  Shorty notices something
       strange:

       The guard's eyes, which were glowing yellow before, are now dim-
       ming and returning to normal.  The moaning guard looks at Shorty
       thankfully and then looks around as if waking from a nightmare --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                              (to another slave kid)
                       His eyes -- they go out.

       Other guards appear and lift the guard -- suddenly he starts
       struggling against the guards not wanting to return to the night-
       mare of Kali --

                                   FAT GUARD
                            (as he's dragged away)
                       No!  NO!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       The pain -- the pain makes him wake up!
                                  (thinking quickly)
                       Indy!  I can make Indy wake up!

       But the other guards push and beat the children back to work.
       Short Round is shoved against a wall and groans -- he reaches over
       and grabs a large rock, lifting it defiantly --

       But rather than heaving it at the guard, Short Round smashes the
       rock down on the leg chains binding him to the other children.
       Shorty beats at the chain with the rock, determined to escape.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy!

136.   INT.  THE TEMPLE OF DEATH                                      136.

       The wind moans and joins Mola Ram's voice echoing maniacally over
       the multitude gathered in the enormous temple.  On his throne,
       the little Maharajah listens transfixed.

137.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                137.

       Chattar Lal watches Indiana staring hypnotically at the High
       Priest as he speaks --

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       You understand what he tells us?

                                   INDIANA
                       Kali Ma protects us now and for-
                       ever, and we must pledge our
                       devotion by worshipping her with
                       an offering of flesh and blood!

       Suddenly htere is a heart-rending scream of terror and the
       priests draf forward the next sacrificial victim --

       Indiana's glowing eyes watch emotionlessly as Willie is brought
       out. Dressed in a Rajput maiden's outfit, Willie has been jewel-
       ed and draped with flowers -- a strange contrast as she struggles
       desperately.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                       Your friend has seen and she has
                       heard -- now she will not talk.

       As Willie is dragged past she sees Indy and calls to him --

                                   WILLIE
                       Indy!  Help me!  Indy?!

       Willie is shocked seeing that Indiana remains impassive and un-
       caring as she's dragged to her death.

                                   CHATTAR LAL
                                   (to Indy)
                       This will prove your devotion to
                       Kali.

       Indiana looks away from Willie's terrified face and stares up
       adoringly at the monstrous statue of his goddess Kali.

138.   INT.  THE MINE                                                 138.

       In the dark tunnel, a rock smashes down onto a chain -- and
       breaks it!  Short Round is exhausted.  He looks around furtively
       and sees a guard approaching.
       
       Short Round takes a chance -- he dives and rolls across the
       tunnel.  He ducks behind a mine car full of rocks being pushed
       out by two chained children.

       The guard lumbers past unsuspectingly as Short Round makes his
       escape using the moving mine car as cover.

139.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                139.

       Up in the temple, Willie continues to struggle as her legs are
       strapped to the iron sacrifical frame.  Chattar Lal grabs her
       hand and ties it down.  Willie's free hand reaches out imploring-
       ly toward Indiana --

                                   WILLIE
                                (hoarsely)
                       Please, God, don't let them do
                       this to me -- help me, Indy!

       He reaches out slowly and Willie grabs his hand tightly.  Indy
       looks into her eyes and then stares at her hand -- and slowly
       lifts it and starts tying it to the iron frame.

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       No -- no!

       Willie cries is disbelief as Indiana calmly betrays her.

140.   INT.  THE MINES BELOW                                          140.

       Short Round races up a tunnel and then flattens himself behind a
       corner.  He peers anxiously into a large carven and sees two
       guards walking away.

       When the coast is clear, Short Round darts across the cavern to a
       long wooden ladder tilted up against a wall.  Short Round looks
       up the high ladder and sees a kid with a sack of rocks descending
       from a burrow-hole half-way up the wall.

       The exhausted kid nearly collapses at the bottom -- then jumps
       seeing Short Round.  Shorty motions for him to keep quiet.
       Amaxed, the kid watches Short Round scramble up the ladder.
       Shorty continues until he is high above the floor.

       Dirty faces stare out of the high burrow as Short Round stops
       climbing.  The kids are astonished as Short Round suddenly grunts
       and kicks the ladder away from the wall!

       The high ladder falls in an arc and what seem like sure suicide
       slowly resembles a mini-Indiana Junes stunt as Short Round swings
       to the other side of the falling ladder --

       Short Round holds on for dear life as the ladder crashes against
       the opposite cavern wall -- giving Short Round access to the
       roof-hole that leads up to the temple!

       Short Round scurries up the ladder and pulls himself up into the
       chamber behind the altar.  He looks at the light flaring around
       the statue of Kali --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy -- !

141.   INT.  THE TEMPLE OF DEATH                                      141.

       Chains clank and gears grind as the sacrificial frame is raised
       over the crevasse.  Stretched out on it, Willie looks horrified
       as she hangs suspended face down above the boiling lava!

       The frame and victim descend slowly into the crevasse and the
       crowd around the little Maharajah changs louder.

142.   INT.  THE REAR CHAMBER                                         142.

       Short Round dashes across the dark chamber behind the altar.  He
       peers out and sees Willie disappearing into the crewasse!  He
       sees Indiana watching impassively --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       No -- Indy -- wake up!

       Then Shorty sees a flaming torch hanging on a wall bracket and he
       has an idea.

143.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                143.

       Short Round suddenly darts out onto the altar and Mola Ram sees
       him and yells.  Several priests grab for Shorty.  He eludes the
       first priest, smashes the second in the stomach with his head,
       and runs like a little quarterback toward the fiery torch --

       Short Round snatches the torch from the wall and charges toward
       Indiana.  Seeing him coming, Indy's eyes start glowing yellow and
       when Short Round runs up to him, Indiana suddenly swings and
       backhands the little guy brutally across the face!

       The torch flies out of Shorty's hand as he's knocked against at
       wall by Indy's vicious blow -- Short Round wipes a little blood
       from his chin and stares at his hero in wounded disbelief.

       Chattar Lal watches approvingly -- a priest moves toward Shorty.
       Chattar Lal looks back toward the crevasse --

       Willie hangs on the lowering frame, heat waves rising up now to
       scald her skin and she chokes as the sulphuric air burns her
       lungs!

       Meanwhile Short Round is crawling backwards across the floor with
       a look of terror on his face -- Indiana stalks him, hissing,
       snarling, his eyes lgowing --

       Short Round springs to his feet and tries to run -- Indy grabs
       him and pulls him -- Shorty's hand grabs for another wall torch
       and just manages to yank it free!

       Indiana spins Short Round and clutches his throat.  As Indy
       strangles him, Short Round struggles and finally jams the torch
       into Indy's side.  The fiery torch burns Indy, smoking as it
       sears his flesh, and he yells in pain.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Wake up!  It's just a nightmare,
                       Indy!  Wake up, please Indy!

       Indiana writhes in pain and Short Round sees the evil yellow glow
       in Indy's eyes getting dimmer and finally going out.  Now it
       seems like theold Indiana staring at him --

                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)
                       Indy, you back?

       Suddenly a priest grabs Short Round and pulls him off Indiana.

                                   INDIANA
                       No!  Give him to me!

       Short Round is firghtened as Indy grabs him from the priest.
       Indy lifts Short Round into the air --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       No, Indy, no!

       He sets Short Round down on the brink of the crevasse an inch
       from doom.  Shorty looks down at the lava and is terrified.
       Indiana finally flahses him a quick smile and winks!

       Then Indiana whirls and punches the priest in the face!  Short
       Round cheers, realizing that Indiana is back.

                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)
                       We got to help Willie!

       Indiana springs into action, stopping another priest with a quick
       punch in the stomach.  Then he rushes over to the crankwheel and
       pulley platform.  Indy jumps onto it, yanking one priest off who
       spills onto the floor.

       A second priest, who works the controls lowering the sacrificial
       frame, sees Indy and releases the crankwheel --

       Down in the crevasse, Willie screams as the iron frame suddenly
       plummets toward the fulminating lava!

       On the platform, the priest lunges at Indiana -- Indy uses the
       man's own momentum to throw him over his head.  Indy then dives
       for the crankwheel and manages to stop it --

       Down in the crevasse, the fram jolts to a stop only yards above
       the spumes of fiery lava.  The heat is so intense now that Wil-
       lie's clothes start smoking and she passes out...
       On the platform above, Indiana cranks furiously, raising the sa-
       crificial frame.

144.   INT.  THE TEMPLE                                               144.

       The chanting stops at the Kali worshippers notice the battle on
       the altar.  The little Maharajah looks concerned and leaves,
       shoving through the crowd behind his bodyguards.

145.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                145.

       Mola Ram shouts at his priests and another one of them runs to-
       ward Indy on the platform.  Short Round dives and tackles the
       priest.

       Chattar Lal finally leaps onto the crankwheel platform and Indy
       sees him pull a dagger.  He slashes at Indiana and Indy has to
       let go of the crankwheel -- the gears scream and the chains
       screech!

       Below in the crevasse, the iron frame plunges again toward the
       crimson lava!

       On the platform, Indy hears the frame lowering and looks pan-
       icked.  Chattar Lal slahses again with the dagger -- keeping Indy
       away from the cogwheel mechanism --

       Indy suddenly kicks the dagger from Chattar Lal's hand slugs him
       in the stomach and dives toward the cogwheel mechanism.  He grabs
       a iron rod and throws it into the gears --

       the gears mangle the iron rod but finally grind to a stop.  Indi-
       ana grabs the crankwheel and starts winding it up furiously.

       Meanwhile, Short Round jumps onto the platform with Indy and
       grabs a long wrench.  He starts swinging the wrench, keeping the
       last priests off the platfrom.

       The sacrificial frame finally rises up into view and Indiana
       grabs it and swings it over onto the platform.  He looks at Wil-
       lie anxiously as he releases her bindings --

       Willie moans and moves her head.  Indy pulls her off the frame
       and she starts coughing.  Gasping for breath, Willie ervives as
       fresh air flows into her lungs.

       Finally Willie opens her eyes and she sees Indiana.  Then she
       notices something else and manages to cry out hoarsely --

                                   WILLIE
                       Look out -- !

       Chattar Lal grabs a pistol from an unconscious guard and Indiana
       whirls to see him pointing it -- Indy kicks the gun from his hand
       and suddenly Chattar Lal starts shouting in a terrifying voice --

       Chattar Lal's eyes glow as he lunges suicidally at Indiana, at-
       tempting to take Indy with him as he dives from the platform!

       Crashing into Indy, Chattar Lal knocks both of them back onto the
       sacrificial frame which swings out over the crevasse --

       Indy manages to dive off the frame just in time.  He grabs hold
       of the platform as the crankwheel screams and the frame falls!

       Looking up from the depths of the crevasse, we see the frame with
       Chattar Lal on it plummeting downward into the sulphurous smoke!
       The frame finally crashes, splashing into the molten lava.

       Chattar Lal's body explodes inot flame friefly -- his flesh is
       broiled off in an instant -- we glimpse a skeleton momentarily --
       and then all is consumed and obliterated by the blazing lava.

      scramble over to Short Round who jumps off the platform and they
       follow him across the altar.

       Indy sees Mola Ram quickly collecting the sacred Sankara Stones.
       Indiana rushes over and spins Mola Ram around --

       He slugs the High Priest in the face and Mola Ram keels over
       backwards against the statue of Kali.  Short Round helps stuff
       the Sankara Stones into Indiana's shoulder bag.

146.   INT.  THE REAR CHAMBER                                         146.

       Short Round, Willie and Indiana rush across the chamber behind
       the altar.  They run over to the ladder and start climbing down
       into the mines.

147.   INT.  THE MINES

       Willie follows Short Round.  Indiana jumps down last and pulls
       the ladder away, letting it crash to the floor so they won't be
       followed.

       They draw the attention of the slave children working in the tun-
       nels around the cavern.  But it's the sight of the approaching
       guard that worries Indy --

                                   INDIANA
                       Come on, quick!

       They duck into one of the tunnels.  As they hide, Indy watches
       the guard passing.

                                   WILLIE
                       What're we going to do?

       Indiana looks around at the silent, frightened children who've
       stopped working in the tunnel and his anger darkens --

                                   INDIANA
                       We're going to get them out
                       of here -- !

       Then he looks at the bag holding the Sankara Stones and grows
       still more determined --

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       And then we're going to get these
                       out of here -- !
                                  (seething)
                       And somehow I'm going to see this
                       place destroyed.

148.   INT.  THE CAVERN - MOMENTS LATER                               148.

       A gaurd passing hears a voice and stops --

                                   INDIANA (O.S.)
                       Ah, sir?  Excuse me --

       The guard turns and looks amazed to see Indy smiling at him from
       the mouth of the tunnel.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Listen, I'm from the union and I'd
                       like to talk about the working
                       conditions here.  Could you step
                       inside a minute?

       Indy smiles again and disappears into the tunnel.  In astonished
       rage, the guard draws his sword and goes after Indy into the tun-
       nel -- there's a pause and then we hear the guard yell!

149.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               149.

       Willie flattens against the wall as Indiana catapaults the big
       guard past her back into the mine where he's set upon bu a horde
       of rebellious slave children.

       The kids swarm over the guard like jackalas and we see Short Round
       pull a key from the struggling guard's robe.

                                                               CUT TO:

150.   MONTAGE - THE MINES                                            150.

       A key is twisted and the chains are pulled from kids' legs...

       Elsewhere, more chains are unlocked and rattle free.  Liberated
       kids spill out of the tunnels...

       A guard is tripped and attacked by a horde of ex-slaves...

       In another location, kids wrap captured guards in layers of
       chains...

       High up on a ledge, a fleeing gaurd skids to a stop when he sees
       kids charging at him.  He sees more kids rushing from behind him.
       The guard scrams as he dives off the ledge...

                                                        (END MONTAGE)

151.   INT.  BEHIND THE ALTAR - DAY                                   151.

       Freed children scramble up numerous ladders to escape the mines
       below.  They follow the mass of children moving toward the front
       altar.

152.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                152.

       On the altar, under the statue of Kali, Willie and Short Round
       are helping Indy and some of the bigger children rip down a
       long wooden panel decorated with hideous Kali figures.

       The childrens' escape is blocked by the chasm separating the
       altar from the deserted sorshippers' area of the temple.  The
       swelling crowds of children push and teeter dangerously on the
       edge of the fire pit.

       Indiana and the others carry the wooden panel through the crowd
       toward the chasm.  They stand it up and when Indy gives thw word
       they drop it --

       The panel crashes across the chasm forming a plank across which
       the children now begin running to safety.

153.   INT.  BEHIND THE ALTAR                                         153.

     The last of the children scramble up the ladders and run toward
       the front of the altar.

154.   INT.  THE ALTAR                                                154.

       The childrens' bare feet stomp across the wooden plank -- below
       them the lava of the fire pit bubbles and shows outbursts of
       flame.

       Indy stares at the plank and sees that it's starting to smoke
       from the intese heat rising up.

       On the far side of the plank, the children safely across scatter
       through the deserted temple toward freedom.

       Willie and Short Round help the last kids out onto the plank --
       Indy sees one child's foot break though the smoldering wood --
       the kid in front pulls the child to safety.

       Willie and Short Round start to go out onto the plank but Indy
       shouts at them --

                                   INDIANA
                       No, wait!

       He runs over and pulls them aside -- he steps out onto the plank
       and takes a few steps to test it -- suddenly the plank bursts
       into flame in the middle.

       Indy takes one more step -- and then the plank breaks!  Indy
       dives back to the ledge of the altar and Willie and Short Round
       grab him and pull him up and the wooden plank plummets into the
       fiery chasm.

                                   WILLIE

       Indiana, Willie and Short Round run through the deserted mine
       tunnels.  They hear a rumbling noise and Indy leads them down a
       side tunnel.  They stop and peer into a quarry.

156.   INT.  THE QUARRY CAVERN                                        156.

       A large cavern is the depository for the mine cars rolling in
       with loads of rock.  Emaciated children (still unaware of the re-
       volt and the other childrens' escape) break their backs shoving
       the heavily-loaded mine cars.

       Thuggee guards supervise the deadening work, while others oper-
       ate the pulley-and-hoist system used to drag  the cars up the
       sloped dump ramp.

       Behind this operation, a thunderous waterfall cascades into a
       huge cistern.  From there, chutes deply the rushing water to
       power the large conveyor belt below it.

       As the cars rise up the ramp, they tip and spill rocks onto the
       conveyor belt which carries them toward an awesome stone cylinder
       that rolls relentlessly , crushing the rocks into sand.

       From the side tunnel, Indiana watches the noisy operation.

                                   INDIANA
                       Those empty cars have got to go
                       out of the mines.

       Willie and Short Round watch the children push the empty mine
       cars.  The cars gain momentum and roll away down two dark tun-
       nels.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Come on, let's see if we can
                       catch a ride...

       Tey duck out of the tunnel and run for cover behind a slag heap.
       Loaded mine cars roaring down from the mines hurtle past them and
       crash to a stop against the cars in front.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Okay, Shorty -- go!

       He pushes Short Round who darts out after a mine car roars past
       and dodges across the tracks before the next one descends.  Indy
       pushes Willie  into  position and holds her ready --

                                   WILLIE
                       I can't!

                                   INDIANA
                       Go!

       After another car crashes past, Indy shoves her.  Willie runs out
       -- her shoe gets stuck and she freezes in the tracks!  Willie
       sees a rock-filled car blasting down out of a tunnel directly
       toward her!

       Indiana dives, knocking Willie safely to the ground on the other
       side of the tracks -- the heavy car hurtles past and crashes into
       the cars in front.

       Indy pulls Willie behind a massive wooden post holding up the
       dump ramp and they hide from a passing gaurd.

                                   INDIANA
                       We've got to get across to the
                       empty cars.  Wait here until I
                       signal you.

       They watch him run and hurdle a pile of lumber, bound up three
       steps and duck behind a tool shack on the platform.  Indy reaches
       out and grabs one of the passing slave children.

       They see Indy put his hand over the kid's mouth and whisper to
       him.  He releases the kid who sneaks away, alerting the other
       children who start making their escapes into side tunnels.

       Now Indy motions to Short Rounds and Willie to follow.  As they
       start to move out they freeze dead in their tracks and Indy
       motions again angrily --

                                   INDIANA
                       Come on!

       Willie and Short Round see a guard coming up the steps on the
       other side of the platform.  As the man rises he gets taller and
       taller -- until they see it's a Thuggee giant coming up behind
       Indiana.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Come one, what's wrong?

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Behind you!

       Indiana turns and looks into the bare chest of the seven-foot
       tall guard.  Indy has to look up to see the man's mean-looking
       face.

                                   INDIANA
                       I see the problem...

       Indiana suddenly punches the giant in the stomach -- the giant
       does not flinch, he just belches rudely.

       Indiana growls and winds up to take a killer swing -- he steps
       back, cocks his arm -- and suddenly turns and runs away.

       No dummy, Indy dashes over and picks up a piece of wood.  The
       giant starts toward him.  Indy drops the wood and looks around
       for a much larger piece of wood.

       As the giant stalks toward him, Indiana raises the large piece of
       lumber -- Indy suddenly groans, drops the wood and clutches his
       stomach.  Willie and Short Round looks startled --

                                   WILLIE
                       What happened?

       Short Round shakes his head.  They see Indy recover from the
       spasm as the giant rushes him.  Indy jumps aside, landing on a
       loaded mine car that is passing by.

       The car is being dragged up the dump ramp and the giant jumps out
       onto it after Indiana.  Indy quickly grabs a rock and, as the
       giant rushes him, Indy smashes the rock against the big man's
       skull!

       Unfortunately, it's the rock that shatters and not the skull.
       Indy dives to the other end of the mine car and lifts a large
       boulder.

       Suddenly Indy drops the boulder and grabs him arm, feeling a
       shooting pain again.  Then he yells as he feels yet another stab-
       bing pain in his left leg.

                                   WILLIE
                       What's wrong with him?

       Shorty is convused and worried -- and then he sees something!  He
       looks up and there on a rock-cut balcony over the cavern is the
       little Maharajah!

       The little prince clutches the clay krtya doll that represents
       Indy.  He jabs it in the leg with a long sapphire-tipped turban
       pin.

       On the mine car, Indy yells and grabs his right leg, which
       collapses beneath him.  Short Round takes off.  He dashes under
       the platform toward a bucket-chain carrying spent water back up
       to the cistern.

       Short Round leaps over the pool of water and grabs onto a bucket.
       He rises up on this make-shift elevator toward the rock balcony
       and the malicious little Maharajah.

       Meanwhile, Indy is on the brink of unconsciousness as the giant's
       massive hands throttle his neck.  Indy's head hangs over the end
       of the mine car and suddenly his eyes widen --

       The car with Indy and the giant reaches the peak of the dump ramp
       and its upended -- spilling both of them and a shower of rocks
       down the conveyor belt!

       Down below, Willie dodges wooden pillars and weaves around
       quarry equipment, trying to follow Indy's battle with the giant.
       She trips and swears angrily --

       Willie pushes and empty mine car out of her way -- an empty mine
       car!  She runs back and starts shoving the mine car along the
       rails toward the conveyor belt.

                                   WILLIE
                       I got one!  Indy, I got one!

       Near the waterfall, Short Round ascends on the rising bucket
       chain.  Up on the balcony, the little Maharajah chuckles evilly as
       he watches Indiana on the conveyor belt --

       The Maharajah lifts the clay doll and viciously jabs the pin in
       the back of it!

       On te conveyor, Indiana gets to his feet and then yells as a
       stabbing pain lacerates his back!  He falls and writhed helpless-
       ly as the giant staggers up the rocky conveyor belt toward him.

       Willie shoves the mine car forward.  She sees Indy's desperate
       situation as he's pulled along the conveyor toward the rock
       crusher!

                                   WILLIE
                       Indy, look out!

       She looks up and sees Short Round leap from the bucket-chain onto
       the balcony.  The little Maharajah's eyes glow fiendishly as he
       lifts the clay doll -- and jabs the pin into the doll's face.

       On the conveyor belt, Indy yells agonizingly and clutches his
       stabbed face!  Behind him, rocks explode as they're crushed and
       pulverized by the mammoth roller.

       In front of Indy, the Thuggee giant grabs a pick-axe as the con-
       veyor slides past a tool bin.  The giant approaches Indy with it.

       Short Round dashes across the balcny and tackles the Maharajah.
       They fall and fight like mortal enemies.  Short Round sees the
       little Maharajah's eyes glowing as he punches him in the face.

       Only a few feet away from the rock-smashing roller, Indy is still
       on his back on the conveyor belt, thrashing in pain, feeling the
       Maharajah's pin piercing his face.  The giant raises the pick-axe
       above his head and it about to split Indiana in two!

       On the balcony, the Maharajah drops the doll and Short Round
       dives for it -- he grabs the clay doll and pulls out the pin!

       On the conveyor belt, Indiana is suddenly released from the
       and looks up to see the giant swinging the pick-axe.  Indy rolls
       aside at the last minute!

       The pick-axe cleaves into the conveyor belt and the giant lurches
       forward -- Indy gives him a helpful kick, sending the giant
       flying toward the rock-crusher as Indy jumps off the conveyor
       belt!

       Seeing the huge roller looming in front of him, the giant crawls
       desperately against the movement of the conveyor belt -- but he
       gets snagged!

       The sash around his waist gets caught under the rolling cursher
       and he's dragged back under it feet first.  The Thuggee giant
       screams hideously as his body is rolled over and squashed by the
       enormous stone wheel!

       On the balcony, Short Round is jabbing the pin into the squirming
       little Maharajah.  The little pricne's eyes still glow yellow as
       he hollers --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       How you like bing pin cushion,
                       Mr. Rajah-ha-ha?

       The little prince rolls on the ground and tries to fight off
       Short Round who keeps jabbing him -- suddenly the Maharajah
       swings and the pin is accidentally rammed clear through his hand!

       Shorty sees the pin sticking through both sides of the kid's
       hand.  The Maharajah stares at his pierced hand, gasping in
       astonishment.

       Short Round notices the yellow glow dying out of the Maharajah's
       eyes -- just as Indy's eyes cleared after he was released from
       Kali's trance.

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       Please -- pull it out!

       Short Round yanks the pin out of the little prince's hand.  The
       Maharajah looks like he's jsut awakened from a bag dream.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       It was the black sleep of Kali...

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       They made me do evil things...
                       may lord Krishna forgive me.

       Meanwhile, Indy runs along the catwalk above the conveyor belt.
       He jumps and grabs onto a cross-bard -- he kicks out with his feet
       and knocks a quarry guard off the catwalk.

       The guard flies through the air and topples into the sand pit
       where he thrashes around blindly under the sand falling from the
       crusher.

       Across the cavern, Willie shoves the rolling mine car toward the
       balcony.

                                   WILLIE
                       Get down here, Shorty!  I got us
                       a ride!

       Willie shirls as another quarry guard rushes toward her.  She
       yanks the iron brake-handle off the mine car and holds it threat-
       eningly like a baseball bat --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       Come on, let's see hoe hand your
                       head is!

       Up on the rock balcony, Short Round lowers himself over the edge.
       The little Maharajah grabs his arm --

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       Please -- listen -- to go out
                       you must take the left tunnel.

       Shorty looks at him and he knows he's telling the truth.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Thanks pal.

                                   MAHARAJAH
                       I'm going to try to find the
                       English soldiers.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Good luck.

       Short Round slips over the edge and slides down a wet stalactite
       to the floor of the cavern.

       There he finds Willie swinging the brake-handle and smashing the
       guard in the gut.  The man doubles in pain -- Willie kicks his
       putt and he splashes into the pool of water.

                                   WILLIE
                       I don't appreciate being cooked
                       like a french fry!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Willie, come on!

       Willie starts pushing the empty mine car with Short Round.

                                   SHORT ROUND (Cont'd)
                       You do pretty good for a girl!

       Across the quarry, Mola Ram and six temple guards run out onto a
       high platform next to the waterfall.  Mola Ram sees Willie and
       Short Round pushing the mine cat.

       Mola Ram shouts to his men -- two of them pull pistols and open
       fire!

       Bullets ricochet off the mine car and Short Round shoves Willie
       to the far side of the car where they both take cover.

       Meanwhile, up on a catwalk, a guard slices a sword through the
       air and Indiana ducks!  The sword slashes into a wooden railing
       and the guard tries frantically to pull it out --

       Indiana slams kis knee up into the guard's stomach and then
       smashes his fist down on his neck -- the man collapses.  Indy
       hears more gunfire.

       Indiana rushes along the catwalk toward the platform above.  He
       edges against the wall below the platform, staying out of sight
       as he unfurls his whip.

       One of Mola Ram's guards fires again from the high platform and
       Indiana lashes the whip -- the whip wraps around the gunman's
       arm and Indy yanks on it --

       The gunman topples through the air and crashes down onto the cat-
       walk.  Indy grabs the gun.  He kicks the guard off the catwalk
       and the man falls into the waterfall pool.

       As the other guards fire down at him, Indiana dodges along the
       catwalk and fires back at them.  A bullet explodes near Mola Ram
       and he ducks back --

       Meanwhile, Short Round and Willie have the mine car rolling and
       they jump into it --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy!  Hurry!

       Indiana spots the rolling mine car racing across the quarry.  Indy
       takes off and runs along the catwalk -- bullets explode around
       him, splintering wood.  Indy reaches the end of the catwalk --

       Suddenly he dives into the air and catches hold of a block and
       tacke!  Indy skids along the pulley system, sliding down a cable
       toward the mine car in which Short Round and Willie are riding.

       Bullets whiz past as Indiana sails in the air above the speeding
       mine car - when they are in sync, Indy lets go and drops into the
       mine car next to Willie and Short Round!

       Mola Ram rushes forward and watches the speeding mine car rolling
       down the track toward the tunnels --

                                   MOLA RAM
                       They've stolen the Sankara
                       Stones -- they must be stopped!

       In the speeding  mine car, Indy sees the tracks separating in two
       directions -- one back into the quarry, the other toward two tun-
       nels that lead out of the mines.

       Indiana lifts a shovel from the floor of the car and swings it
       just in time -- he hits a switch which CLANGS as they speed by
       and the car is shunted tipsy-turvy onto the track toward the two
       tunnels.

       Willie hangs on as the car tears down the track toward the tunnel
       on the right -- and Short Round looks worried --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       No, Indy, it's left tunnel.

       But it's too late and they all hold on as the mine car shoots
       donw into the darkness of the echoing tunnel.

157.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               157.

       The wind rushes past Indiana as the car descends into the tunnel
       and picks up speed.  Willie hangs on with Short Round -- the mine
       car roars around a curve and flies fater along the rails.

158.   INT.  THE QUARRY                                               158.

       Back in the quarry, Mola Ram supervises the guards as they shove
       empty cars toward the tunnel.  Carrying long Khyber rifles, they
       jump aboard the cars.  The first one rolls into the dark tunnel
       and the second car speeds after it.

159.   INT.  THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE                                      159.

       The two Thuggee cars shoot past, descending into the darkness in
       pursuit of the infidels who stole the Sankara Stones.

160.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               160.

       The mine car hurtles past.  Indy sits in front, pulling back on
       the brake-lever to control their speed and keep them from careen-
       ing off the tracks.

       Expecting trouble, Short Round peers over the back end of the
       car.  Willie ducks low, watching the heavy beams flashing danger-
       ously close above their heads.

       Then Willie's eyes go wide and she groans in terror like a girl
       on a roller coaster as the mine car suddenly plunges downward,
       taking their stomachs with it.

       A gunshot rings out and Short Round sees the first Thuggee car
       appear around a curve behind them.  Mola Ram's gunmen start
       blasting.  Bullets ricochet off the mine car and Indy yells back
       to Short Round.

                                   INDIANA
                       Come here and take the brake!

       Short ROund scurries forward and grabs the brake from Indy.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       Slow on the curves or we'll fly
                       off the tracks!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Read you loud and clear, Indy!

       Short Round grins as he holds the brake -- Willie realized that
       this is Shorty's idea of a good time!

161.   INT.  THE CAVERN                                               161.

       Up in the quarry, gunmen push a third car toward the tunnel, but
       Mola Ram stops them.  He shouts and they turn and look instead
       toward the waterfall and huge cistern....

162.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               162.

       Indiana is crouched in the back of the zooming mine bar blasting
       away with the pistol he captured in the quarry.

       A gunman in the car behind returns his fire, the explosions
       lighting up the tunnle walls.

       Indy aims and fires again -- the gunman is hit and knocked back
       in the car.  Another guard with a Khyber rifle moves up to the
       front and starts firing.

       Meanwhile, as the car goes into a hard turn, Short Round rides
       the brake -- beneath the car we see the brake-pad scraping on the
       metal wheel.

       The tunnel gets lower and Indy has to duck under each beam flying
       over and can only pop up to fire between the low beams.

       The rifleman in the car behind is relading.  Then he lifts his
       rifle -- Indy pops up simultaneously and shoots!

       The gunman is hit, his rifle flies up and his head smashes
       against the beam hurtling above!  Screaming horribly, the gunman
       is knocked from the speeding car like a broken doll.

163.   INT.  THE CAVERN                                               163.

       Up in the quarry, Mola Ram's men swing sledge hammers, bashing
       away at the rock supports under the huge water-filled cistern.

164.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               164.

       Indiana runs out of bullets.  He sees the car behind getting
       closer.  He tosses the pistol and hits a Thuggee in the head.
       Another Thuggee retrieves Indy's pistol and starts reloading it.

       Suddenly Indy is being shot at by his own gun and he yells to
       Short Round
                                   INDIANA
                       Let up on the brake!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       What?!

       Indy shoves past Willie and takes the brake level from Shorty.

                                   INDIANA
                       Let her go!  Our only chance is
                       outrunning them!

                                   WILLIE
                       What above the curves?!

       Short Round looks scared as Indy released the brake and the car
       hurtles toward a curve.  They grab the sides of the car as it tips
       precariously.  Behind them, the curve throws the gunmen from side
       to side in the car following.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy, look out!

       A sharper curve looms ahead and Indy shoves the brake completely
       off!

                                   WILLIE
                       What're you doing?!  We're going
                       too fast!!

       Willie closes her eyes as they rocket toward the curve.  In the
       car behind, the Thugge guard at the brake also shoves the brake
       off -- and looks extremely worried.

       Indy's car hits the curve and the centrifugal force lifts the in-
       side wheels off the rails!

                                   INDIANA
                       Get over on the other side!

       Willie and Short Round jumps over to his side as the car whips
       around the curve!  Indy looks back and sees the car pursuing them
       is also taking the curve at full speed --

       Suddenly the Thuggee car swereves dangerously, the weight shifts
       too much to the outside -- and the car derails!

       The car bounces off the tracks and flies through the air into a
       siding where is CRASHES against a stone wall in an EXPLOSION of
       rock and metal!

       Pieces of debris pommel the drive of the second Thuggee car and
       he quickly grabs for the brake to slow down and avoid the same
       fate!

       In the lead car, Indy smiles smugly as Willie opens her eyes.

                                   INDIANA
                       One down, one to go!

165.   INT.  THE CAVERN ABOVE                                         165.

       Mola Ram's guards continue to bash away with sledge hammers at
       the rock supports under the mammoth cistern.  One of the supports
       starts to crumble --

       From above, we see the cistern list to one side and water laps
       dangerously over the edge as the huge tank creaks and sawsy.

166.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               166.

       Indiana and Short Round heft a railroad tie out of th bottom of
       the car and Willie watches them lift it onto the back --

       As gunfire continues to explode from the car behind them, Indiana
       and Short ROund shove the railroad tie off the back of the car --

       The wooden railroad tie falls and bounces back across the tracks.
       The gunmen in the car behind spit it and yell in panic --

       Indy and Willie watch the car behind crash into the railroad tie
       -- but the tie just skids, catches and bounces up and out of the
       way like a huge tumbling matchstick!

                                   WILLIE
                       Anymore ideas...?

                                   INDIANA
                       Yeah -- this time you're gonna
                       help!

167.   INT.  THE CAVERN                                               167.

       The sledgehammers continue -- until two of the rock supports give
       way!  There are shouts as the guards run for cover.

       Mola Ram stands on a platform watching the huge cistern slowly
       keel over -- the noise is incredible as the colossal tank crashes
       to the ground!

       Suddenly a half-million gallons of water explode across the cav-
       cern and surge in a tidal wave toward the tunnels!

168.   INT.  THE TUNNEL                                               168.

       The walls of the tunnel flash past and curves appear suddenly out
       of the darkness as the hair-raising chase continues --

       Short Round and Willie struggle to help Indy lift a large boulder
       from the bottom of the speeding mine car.

       The cars descend again into a stretch of much lower tunnel where
       the beams flash past inches above them.  Indy judges the beams --

                                   INDIANA
                       Okay  -- one -- two -- NOW!

       All three of them groan as they raise the boulder and shove it
       off the back of the car -- ducking instantly to avoid being de-
       capitated by the next beam!

       Looking back, they see the gunmen pop up between the beams -- and
       they see the looks of terror on the gunmen's faces as they see
       the boulder in front of them!

       The Thuggee car hits the boulder and upends!  The guards scream
       horribly as the car tumbles end over end, slamming against the
       tunnel walls, getting ripped to shreds so that finally only
       pieces of metal, wheels and debris fly like a meteorite shower
       down the tunnel!

       Willie whoops for joy and hugs Indy who smiles modestly --

                                   INDIANA
                       Okay, Shorty, hit the brakes!

       Short Round dives for the front of the car and ahppily pulls the
       brake lever -- it doesn't work!  Short Round yanks on it harder
       -- the brake level suddenly breaks off!

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Indy!!

       Indy sees Short Round holding up the broken brake lever!  Indy
       crawls quickly toward Shorty while Willie holds on for dear life!

       Completely out of control, the car hurtles down a decline into a
       section where the tunnel if larger again --

       Indiana bends over the front of the car and looks underneath.  He
       sees the brake tension hanging loose from the brake-pad.  Indiana
       pulls himself back up and looks at Willie and Short Round.

                                   INDIANA
                       Grab onto me -- I'm going to try
                       and slow us down from underneath!

       Willie looks terrified but helps Short Round grab onto Indy's arm
       and the back of his jacket.  He skips over the front of the car
       and swings a leg underneath --

       Indy is inches above the rails and the rocky ground blurring be-
       neath the car as he tries to kick at the brake-pad.  His feet
       fall and he bumps along, dragged dangerously for a moment --

       Indy manages to find a foothold on the undercarriage of the car.
       As they hold onto him, Indy kicks again and his foot hits the
       brake-pad.  He shoves it and slowly the pad closes against the
       spinning wheel...

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh no!

       Willie and Short Round look up and see that the tunnel is ending
       ahead and the track dead-ends into a stone wall!

                                   INDIANA
                       What's wrong?

       He looks around -- and sees the car rocketing directly toward the
       stone wall!

       Indy's foot starts kicking in high-gear underneath the car -- he
       slams at the brake-pad with all his strength -- the pad screeches
       against the spinning wheeel and starts sparking!

       The car seems to slow as it shoots toward the end of the tunnel.
       Indy groans and pushes hard against the smoking brake-pad.

       The car slows more and more until it runs down the last few yards
       to the dead-end and rolls gently to a stop, just nudgeing Indy's
       back against the wall....

                                   INDIANA
                       Ouch...

       Willie looks faint as Indiana gets to his feet and Shorty jumps
       out of the car.  They help Willie out and she stands shakily --

                                   WILLIE
                       I'm okay -- I'm fine -- I love to
                       flirt with death...

       Indiana sees that the tunnel ahead continues without any more
       tracks.  Then they hear something --

       A strange rumbling sound echoing down the tunnel from behind
       them.  The walls seem to reverberate.  Looking worried, they
       start walking away down the tunnel.

       They walk faster as the noise behind them becomes louder and they
       keep glancing over their shoulders --

                                   WILLIE
                       What's that?...Indy?!

       Indiana isn't sure and he pulls Willie by the arm and all three of
       them start jogging.

       The rumbling behind them sounds increasingly ominous and finally
       they start running full tilt.  They rush down the tunnel and the
       awful noise becomes defening!  Willie looks around again and
       slows suddenly --

       Willie stops dead in her tracks -- paralyzed -- awestruck --
       DOOMED!

       Willie sees a monster wall of water (released from the quarry) as
       it thunders around a curver -- a mammoth tidal wave crashing spec-
       tacularly against the opposite tunnel wall!

       A veritable "tsunami" caroming off the tunnel wall and spewing
       furiously forward like a hydrous Juggernaut!

                                   WILLIE
                                 (frozen in
                                  her tracks)
                       Oh... shit...

       Indiana and Short Round notice that Willie's sloed and they stop
       running -- they also see the cataclysm of water crashing down the
       tunnel toward them.

       Indy runs back and grabs Willie.  All three of them take off,
       running faster than they've ever run in their lives!

       The tidal wave smashes forward, booming behind them and Indiana
       realizes quickly that they're going to lose this race.  Suddenly
       he sees a small side-tunnel in a bend ahead --

                                   INDIANA
                       There!  Dive!

       They lunge toward the hole and Short Round dives in it first.
       Indiana shoves Willie into the hole and jumps in after her just
       as the colossal tidal wave explodes  past!

169.   INT.  THE CHUTE                                                169.

       The small tunnel drops precipitously and they slide down, shower-
       ed by the small side-current of water that's broken off from the
       main force.

170.   INT.  A LARGE TUNNEL                                           170.

       They rolls and tumble out of the small chute into a larger tunnel.
       The roar of the tidal wave sounds distant and receding as they
       catch their breath.

                                   INDIANA
                       Lucky I found a short cut.  Look,
                       there's a light at the end of the
                       tunnel...

       Suddenly an EXPLOSION!  They turn and see the thundering tidal
       wave crashing around a curve and cascading down the tunnel behind
       them again!

                                   WILLIE
                       Some short cut!

       They all holler in unison and start running like bats out of hell
       toward the daylight.  The towering wall of water surges relent-
       lessley after them --

       The tidal wave looms up to annihilate them as they race to the
       mouth of the tunnel -- and Willie SCREAMS!  Indy grabs her and
       all three of the flail their arms to keep from losing their bal-
       ance!

171.   EXT.  THE TUNNEL EXIT - DAY                                    171.

       The tunnel exits midway up a cliff and the three totter precari-
       ously on the brink looking down at a 300 foot sheer drop to
       a gorge below!

       Indiana swings Willie onto a narrow ledge on one side and pushes
       Short Round after her -- he jumps himself to the other side just
       as the tidal wave crashes past them!

       The water bursts out of the tunnel -- the gusher spews forth from
       the cliffside into the air as if Hoover Dam just broke lose!

       Short Round and Willie balance on the narrow ledge on one side of
       the geyser -- Indy is perches on the ledge on the other side of
       the incredible eruption of water.

       Willie gets vertigo looking down into the gorge where the water
       crashes at the bottom.  There crocodiles are disturbed and
       slither angrily.

       Indy looks up and sees a rope bridge swinging about twenty feet
       above Willie and Short Round.  Indy shouts across the blasting
       water --

                                   INDIANA
                       Willie -- the bridge!  Climb up
                       to the bridge!

       Willie looks frightened.

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Nothing to it -- follow me!

       He edges along the narrow ledge toward the bridge and Willie
       follows him.  Once under the bridge, they start climbing up the
       rocks to it.

       Meanwhile, Indiana is scaling the cliff face to get over the
       water geyser to the other side.  He grabs at scrub brush and
       finds a few perilous footholds as he makes his way to the bridge.

172.   EXT.  THE ROPE BRIDGE                                          172.

       Willie and Short Round pull themselves up at the end of the
       bridge.  Behind them a dark tunnel runs back into the mines.
       What's in front of them is hardly more reassuring --

       The rope bridge across the gorge is a century old and defintely
       wasn't built by army engineers.  Laying across the two bottom
       rope-spans, worm-eaten and moldy boards offer risky footings.

       Vertical side ropes connect the bottom rope-spans to the two up-
       per ropes that constitute the dangerous hand-railings.

       Short Round steps tentatively out onto the bridge.  It holds him
       and he turns and smiles at Willie --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Easy like pie!  Kid's stuff!

       Suddenly the board under him breaks! Willie grabs Short Round
       before he falls into the abyss!  Looking pale and less cocky,
       Short Round starts out again and Willie follows his carefully.

       They continue stepping across the bridge cautiously, a feat made
       more difficult by the bridge's constant swaying and the hear-
       stopping up and down movement.

       Behind them, Indy finally pulls himself up from under the bridge.
       He stands up and sees Willie and Short Round halfway across
       already.  Then he hears something and turns quickly -- he takes
       his whip out and ducks to the side of the tunnel as two Thuggee
       guards rush out.

       Indy cracks the whip, catching the first guard around the neck --
       the guard spills forward and trips the second guard.  The first
       man tries to stand but Indiana kicks him in the head.

       The second guard gets to his feet and seings his sword -- Indy
       ducks, slams him in the stomach and dives for the first guard's
       sword.  He grabs it and rolls aside quickly as the second gaurd
       attempts to slice him in two!

       Indy gets to his feet and immediately finds himself about to en-
       gage in a sword duel with the enraged Thuggee guard.  Indy looks
       at the unfamiliar sword, hefts it, and tries to quickly decide
       the best way to use it --

       Suddenly the guard shouts and charges.  Indy decides shouting
       must be the "de rigueur" technique and shouts back loudly -- the
       two swords CLANG and spark as the duel erupts.

       Indy flails and feints and the Thuggee guard lunges and slashes.
       Indy finally gains the upper hand and dispatches the Thuggee
       guard who slumps defeated into the dirt.

       Keeping the sword, Indy starts out onto the bridge, walking as
       quickly as possible across the rickety span.  He hears shouting
       ahead and looks worried then temple guards appear at the far end
       of the bridge.

       The guards suprise Willie and Shorty as they finally get across
       the bridge.  Struggling   futilely with the guards, Willie shouts
       at Indiana --

                                   WILLIE
                       Indy -- looks out behind you!

       Indy sees more Thuggee guards rushing out of the tunnel behind
       him.  He turns and sees two of the tmeple guards who captured
       Willie and Short Round coming across the bridge in front of him.

       Indy stands helpless in the middle of the swaying bridge with
       guards approaching from both sides, and nothing but heaven above
       and the rocky gorge hundreds of feet below!

       A wind comes up and the High Priest, Mola Ram, appears on the far
       end of the bridge.  He stands with the guards who hold Willie and
       Short Round.

       The wind whips around Indy and he staggers unsteadily on the
       swaying bridge as he watches Mola Ram --

                                   INDIANA
                       Let my friends go!

       Mola Ram shouts in Hindi and the guards start to move toward Indy
       from both sides of the bridge.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       That's far enough!

                                   MOLA RAM
                       You are in no position to give
                       orders, Dr. Jones.

       Indiana indicates the bag over his shoulder --

                                   INDIANA
                       You want the stones, let them go
                       and call off your guards!

       Mola Ram motions and the guards move farther out on both sides of
       the bridge -- suddenly Indiana swings the sword and it cuts into
       one of the bottom rope-spans!

       The rope is half-severed and frays slowly under the tension!

                                   MOLA RAM
                       Impressive, Dr. Jones. But I
                       don't believe you would kill
                       yourself!

       Mola Ram motions again the his guards (looking more nervous now)
       step farther out onto the bridge, mvoing closer to Indy from both
       sides.

       Indy swings the sword again, cutting into the other rope-span!
       It, too, is now partially severed and frays slowly.  The bridge
       jolts and Indy and the guards sway precariously!

       Suddenly Mola Ram shoves Short Round out onto the bridge.  The
       High Priest draws a dagger and pushes Willie onto the swaying
       span, holding the knife behind them both.

                                   MOLA RAM (Cont'd)
                       Your friends will die with you!

       In different times this would be called a Mexican stand-off
       Indiana looks at the guards in front and behind him.  He sees
       Willie and Short Round out on the bridge now with Mola Ram at
       their backs.

                                   INDIANA
                       Then I guess we're all going to
                       take a big dive!

       Indy and Short Round's eyes meet -- and the kid realizes that his
       hero isn't kidding.  Willie looks at Shout Round anxiously -- she
       notices that Shorty is surreptitiously wrapping his foot around a
       rope support.

       Petrified, Willie also secretly wraps her foot around a rope and
       does likewise with her arm --

                                   MOLA RAM
                       Give me the stones!

                                   INDIANA
                       Mola Ram -- you're about to meet
                       Kali -- in Hell!

       Indiana swings the sword with all his might -- it whooshes
       through the air and slashes clear through the top and bottom
       ropes --!

       Immediately Mola Ram's guards start to flee in panic -- too late!
       Indiana swings the sword again and the two ropes on the other
       side are severed --

       The rope bridge is sheared in two!  It breaks in the middle and
       both halves fall apart!  The guards scream horribly in the air as
       they plunge down into the rocky gorge!

       Willie and Short Round cling to their established footholds and
       fall with the bridge toward the wall of the gorge.  Mola Ram
       spills forward, clutching desperately at the ropes and slats --

       Below them, Indiana has latched onto a rope and swings with the
       bridge as it hits the gorge wall and hangs vertically now, dang-
       ling from its moorings at the top.

       There's an instant of suspended animation as all who remain alive
       realize they are alive.  Short Round and Willie cling near the
       top of the now vertical bridge.

       Below them, Mola Ram clutches onto one of the main ropes while
       directly above him the last of his guards holds on for dear life.

       Short Round and Willie struggle upwards, clutching ropes and
       stepping on slats.  Finally, Short Round heaves himself up onto
       solid ground and turns to help Willie up.

       Meanwhile, dangling below on the bridge, Indy reaches up and
       grabs Mola Ram's leg.  The High Priest kicks and tries to break
       Indy's grip.  He kicks again and smashes Indy in the face.

       Indy won't let go.  Suddenly the High Priest reaches up and grabs
       his own Thuggee guard and yanks his down by the front of his
       shirt --

       Mola Ram shoves the luckless guard down onto Indy, trying to
       dislodge him by sacrificing the screaming Thuggee.  Indy manages
       to hang on.  The Thuggee is less fortunate and falls screaming to
       his death.

       Then Mola Ram looks across the gorge and yells.  Indy sees a dozen
       of the last Thuggee guards streaming out of the tunnel -- only
       to be stranded on the far side of the now bridgeless gorge.

       Indy starts climbing up after Mola Ram again.  He grabs at the
       back of Mola Ram's robe and pull him down.  Slipping, Mola Ram
       turns and it's Indy's chance to punch Mola Ram in the face.

       Mola Ram's eyes are glowing yellow and he's shouting incoherent-
       ly.  He grabs the strap of Indy's shoulder bag and stamps on In-
       dy's hand -- Indy falls!

       Indiana slips downward, scrambling to catch hols of something --
       meanwhile, Mola Ram now has the bag with the Sankara Stones.

       Indy finally stops his downward slide and dangles dangerously
       near the bottom of the bridge.

       Across the gorge, the Thuggee guards run up a path to a small
       gove of trees growing on a plateau above the gorge.  The guards
       have bows and arrows and take firing positions --

       At the top of the bridge, Mola Ram keeps climbing until rocks
       start poundinghim from above -- Willie and Short Round pely him
       with rocks which he tries to block with his arm.

       Indiana starts to climb again, using all his strength.  He
       reaches for a wooden slat -- suddenly a flaming arrow smashes
       into the wood!

       Indy turns in amazement and sees more flaming arrows rocketing
       across the chasm directy for him!

       Across the gorge, by the grove of trees, a Thuggee priest yells
       orders to the archers who continue to launch the flaming arrows.

       Indiana crawls up as the bridge starts to burn from the continu-
       ing bursts of fiery arrows.  At the top, Mola Ram reaches up des-
       perately for a hand old -- Willie smashes his hand with a rock!

       The High Priest yells in pain and slips down to where Indy slugs
       him again in the face!  They struggle as the fire burns up from
       beneath them.

       On the cliff above the fallen bridge, Willie watches the fire
       rising toward Indy and Mola Ram as they fight.  Short Round turns
       and sees something --

                                   SHORT ROUND
                       Willie, look!

       They see horses galloping through a narrow pass -- the British
       cavalry is returning.  Captain Blumburtt and the first troops draw
       up their forses and dismount quickly.

       A fussilade of flaming arrows force the British to take cover --
       they quickly start firing back at the Thuggees with rifles.

       As the battle above the gorge continues, Indy and Mola Ram fight
       below on the dangling bridge --

       Indiana sees the High Priest's eyes begin glowing and he hisses
       insanely.  Mola Ram's hand thrusts out toward Indiana's chest and
       Indy yells in pain --

       Indy looks down and writhes terrified as he sees Mola Ram's hand
       starting to enter his chest (as it entered the victim's chest
       during the temple sacrifice)!

       Mola Ram's finger are inching into Indy's body --  Indy clutches
       at Mola Ram's piercing hand, trying to keep the deadly fingers
       away from his heart.

       Slowly, Indy is able to push Mola Ram's hand away and his fingers
       withdraw from Indy's chest.  Indiana suddenly slugs the High
       Priest in the face and grabs for the bag of Sankara Stones --

                                   MOLA RAM
                       No, the stones are mine!

                                   INDIANA
                       You're betrayed Shiva. *(He re-
                       peats in Sanskrit Sankara's warn-
                       ing)

       As Indy pronounces the magical words, the bag begins glowing and
       starts to burn Mola Ram as he clutches it -- the stones begin to
       spill out of the bag and the High Priest grabs from them.

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       *(He repeats Sankara's warning
                        in Sanskrit)

       The blazing stones sear Mola Ram's flesh and he screams in pain.
       The light suddenly dies in his eyes and for one instant he looks
       at Indy as if awakened from a nightmare --

       Mola Ram loses his balance and Indy grabs for the stones.  He
       manages to clutch only one of them as Mola Ram screams and falls!

       Indy sees the stone in his hand suddenly cool.  He watches Mola
       Ram plummeting downward into the chasm and finally crashing into
       the jagged rocks at the bottom.

       The irritated crocodiles are disturbed once more -- but soon wel-
       come the meal that just dropped in.  Jaws flash and teeth rip at
       the High Priest's likeless corpse.

       And Indy's bag with the Sankara Stones sinks into the murkly cur-
       rent and disappears down the river ...

173.   EXT.  THE CLIFF                                                173.

       Indiana crawls up the burning bridge and Willie and Short Round
       reach for him at the top.  They pull him up onto the cliff and
       they all look around exhausted --

       Across the gorge, more British troops emerge from the mine tun-
       nels to subdue the remaining Thuggee guards on that side.

       Finally the little Maharajah comes out of the dark mine tunnel.
       He sees Short Round across the gorge -- and bows to thank him for
       his help.  On the other side, Short Round waves his cap, saluting
       him back.

       Willie stands at the edge of the gorge looking down into the riv-
       er far below.

                                   WILLIE
                       I guess Mola Ram got what he
                       wanted.

                                   INDIANA
                       Not quite.

       She sees Indy reach into his pocket.  He pulls something out
       slowly -- as she watches he reveals a crystal stone --

                                   INDIANA (Cont'd)
                       The last Sankara Stone.

       Short Round watches Willie take it carefully from Indiana.  She
       gazes at it and looks delighted --

                                   WILLIE
                       And the diamond hidden inside...

       Willie holds the stone up to the sun and it sparkles and flashes

                                                               CUT TO

174.   EXT.  THE MAYAPORE HILLS - DAY                                 174.

       The sun flares and silhouettes three figures coming over a
       hilltop.  Behinf them we see more smaller silhouettes appearing
       over the rise.

       Indiana, Willie and Short Round walk back down the dirt road into
       Mayapore -- followed by a multitude of children returning to
       their homeland.

       Willie looks at the changed landscape and seems astonished:  the
       barren countryside has been reborn.  They see streams flowing
       beneath green trees, flowers blooming and peasants harvesting
       golden grain in the fields.

175.   EXT.  MAYAPORE VILLAGE                                         175.

       Indiana, Willie and Short Round lead the children down the
       village road.   Ahead they see villagers rebuilding their primi-
       tive dwellings.

       Now they hear shouts of joy from the peasants.  The children
       returning home start running to meet their parents who are rush-
       ing out to greet them.

       There is laughter and tears as families are reunited.  Indiana
       sees the old shaman approaching with the chieftain and the
       village elders.

       The shaman touches his fingers to his forehead and bows.  The
       three travelers return his greeting and the shaman is quite moved
       as he speaks to Indiana --

                                   SHAMAN
                       We know you are coming back --
                                (indicating the
                                 countryside)
                       -- when life returns to our village.

                                   WILLIE
                       It's a real miracle.

                                   SHAMAN
                       Now you see the magic of the
                       "rock" you bring back.

       The old shaman smiles wisely at Indiana.  Indy takes the stone
       out of his bag and unwraps it.

                                   INDIANA
                       Yes, I've seen its power

       Willie watches the shaman take it reverently and bow to them.
       The shaman joins the elders and they walk to the village's small
       sacred mound.  Indy and Willie stay back.  They see him kneel and
       replace the stone in its niche.

                                   INDIANA
                       The last Sankara Stone.

                                   WILLIE
                       And they don't even know what
                       it really is.

                                   INDIANA
                                (smiling at her)
                       Well, you didn't get your prince,
                       and there goes your diamond.

                                   WILLIE
                       You didn't do so well yourself.
                       Finding that stone could've got-
                       ten you all the fortune and
                       glory you were talking about.

                                   INDIANA
                       It's still a long way to Delhi.
                       Who knows what might happen.

       She looks at him like he's crazy.

                                   WILLIE
                       Oh no, I'm finding a native guide
                       who knows the way.  No more de- 
                       tours for me, thank you Dr. Jones.

       She turns and starts walking away continuing to complain --

                                   WILLIE (Cont'd)
                       If you think I'm going to Delhi
                       or anyplace else with you, after
                       all the trouble you've gotten me
                       into...

       Suddenly the bullwhip CRACKS and wraps around her waist.  Star-
       tled Willie looks angry as Indiana reels her in, pulling her to-
       ward him and into his arms.  But when he finally kisses her, she
       doesn't seem to mind at all...

       Short Round shakes his head, but looks sort of pleased.  When he
       turns away, his face lights up!

       Short Round runs toward the sunset, toward the three elephants
       being brought back to the village.  The baby elephant starts
       walking faster, as if he recognizes Short Round running out to
       meet him...




                                   THE END
