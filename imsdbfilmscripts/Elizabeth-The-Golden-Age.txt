    Painted images of the Elizabethan age -

                         CAPTION

              A world divided by religious
              hatred.

              The new Protestant faith is
              spreading.

    Bodies burned on a pyre - men writhing under torture - a
    momentary half-recognisable face, gaunt and staring -
    FATHER ROBERT RESTON.

                        CAPTION
              The most powerful ruler in
              Christendom, Philip of Spain, has
              sworn to return all Europe to the
              Catholic faith.

    Images of rival monarchs Philip and Elizabeth in court
    paintings: stiff, formal, imperious.

                          CAPTION
              Only England stands in his way: a
              weak impoverished nation ruled by
              a woman.

    Finally images of God in judgement, as if speaking to his
    chosen servant.

                          CAPTION
              Philip prepares to obey the will
2             of his God.


    INT. PRIVATE CHAPEL, ESCORIAL PALACE, SPAIN - DAY             2

    Bn ascetic-looking man dressed in black kneels in a small
    plain chapel, in virtual darkness. PHILIP II, King of Spain
    bows his head low, abasing himself before his God.

    S/I CAPTION:

               scorial Palace, Spain, 1585.

    Now, slowly, he raises his head. His eyes open, and we see
    there the glow of a new certainty. God has spoken to him.

                         PHILIP
              (I hear. I obey. My Lord and my
1
              God.)

    Philip walks rapidly down a long corridor that opens out
    into a broader hallway, moving from the darkness of the
    chapel into ever brighter light and more visible glory. On
    his face the far shining gaze of a man who now knows his
    mission. Silent servants press themselves to the walls as
    he goes by. Through the hallway to a grand salon. COURTIERS
    fall silent and bow as he passes. So into the grandest
    salon of all, where his magnificent court is gathered;
    among them his 12-year-old daughter, the INFANTA. As he
    enters, all kneel.

    His eyes scan his ministers and courtiers, all kneeling,
    heads bowed before him. His gaze falls on one who wears the
    plain black robes of a Jesuit priest: Robert Reston, the
    face we glimpsed in the opening montage. He speaks to all.

                        PHILIP
              (God has made his will known to
              me. The time for our great
              enterprise has come.)

    The Jesuit looks up and his eyes too show a powerful but
    disciplined satisfaction. He murmurs softly to himself.

                        RESTON
              At last.

    Cathedral bells ring out. The cheers of a crowd are heard
    through the open windows.

    The king passes out onto the salon's first-floor balcony.

    Hot sunlight. Philip stands gazing across the plaza at the
    great cathedral on the far side, as the bells ring out and
    the CROWD in the plaza below wave their hats and cheer. The
    Infanta is by his side. His MINISTERS cluster behind him.
    Lining the crowd on either side of the plaza stand columns
    of ARMED SOLDIERS: a formidable reminder of the king's
    power.

    Philip does nothing, but his presence intoxicates the
    crowd. As their cries swell, wave upon wave, the king's
    eyes glow and he breathes in deeply, feeding on his
    people's adoration.

    A ripple of light on the water. A blur of approaching
    colour.

The ROYAL BARGE is gliding towards us, slowly taking shape:
its hull gaily painted, its canopy adorned with colourful
fabrics, its banks of oars rising and falling, casting
bright shards of shining water in the sunlight.
P
 eople passing on the river bank point and wave, smiling,
cheering. They see the Queen now. They call out.

Two young men walking arm-in-arm stare more intently than
any; but they do not cheer or wave. There's something
chilling in the way they track the distant figure of the
Queen.

They are BABINGTON and SAVAGE.

Over this an insistent voice:

                    HOWARD (V.O.)
          Why do you go among the people,
          majesty? I tell you plainly, you
          will be murdered! Every Catholic
          in England is a potential
          assassin!

    An agitated group is gathered in this room where the
    business of state is transacted. We catch glimpses of the
    Queen in their midst, preparing to leave, as her ministers
    try to persuade her of the seriousness of the situation:
    SIR CHRISTOPHER HATTON, 30s, an ambitious courtier; LORD
    HOWARD, 50s, a weathered old campaigner; and standing back
    from the rest, watching from the side lines, SIR FRANCIS
    WALSINGHAM, the Queen's veteran friend and adviser.     
           
                        HATTON
              Be warned by the atrocities in
              France! God-fearing Christians                                                                       
              murdered by Papist cut-throats
              inflamed by hatred of the truth!                         

                                                                       
                        HOWARD
              We know the Catholics take their                         
              orders from Spain. The Spanish                           
              speak openly of Mary Stuart as                           
                                                                       
              Queen of England in waiting.

                        ELIZABETH
                  (sharply)
              Mary Stuart is a Queen cast out
              by her own ungrateful nation.
                            
                        HATTON
              With respect, majesty - a

              Protestant supporters don't

              Mary Stuart is my cousin. She is                         
              our guest. And she is under our

              But while she lives, majesty, she                        
              is a beacon that draws our

              England. The poison must be cut

              not punish my people for their
              beliefs. Only for their deeds.
                am assured that the people of

          We shall have to look out a
          husband for you soon, Bess.

                    BESS
          Not too soon, my lady.

                    WALSINGHAM

          I'll want the marriage if I want
          the man.

     INT. ST PAUL'S CATHEDRAL - DAY

     The royal party enters the Cathedral. Elizabeth and
     Walsingham advance into the wide empty nave, followed by
     the Queen's ladies and the guards. Bess is now back in her
     place among the ladies.

               Ship builders are being recruited
               in Spanish ports at double wages.
               The sea wall at Dover is
               cracking. There's no money to
               rebuild our defences. I don't
               need advisers to tell me my
               business.

                         WALSINGHAM
               They care for your safety,
               majesty. The threats to your
               person are real.

                         ELIZABETH
               And they know very well that if I
               fall, they all come tumbling down
               after me.

     She goes on to the steps at the foot of the altar, and
     kneels to pray. As she kneels she holds out one hand behind
     her, not looking round. Bess steps forward, and taking her
     hand, kneels and prays with her.

               Let's pray, Bess. May we have
               wisdom not to fear shadows in the
               night, and courage when the day
               of danger truly dawns.

     Raleigh is standing on the prow of a war-ship as it cuts           
     through the water toward the white cliffs of Dover. The

               Lines round my mouth. Where did
               they come from?

      The royal bed, immense and ornate. Elizabeth lies here
      small, awake, and alone.

      Foresters at work felling great trees, working
      rhythmically, in pairs. From all round echoes the same
      sound, of axe on timber.

                          PHILIP (V.O.)
                `Elizabeth! You are leading the
                souls of your people to Hell!
                Turn back! Marry me, and save
                England!'I spoke to her just as I
                speak to you now.

       ow we see the royal carriage riding through mature forest,
      accompanied by a mounted entourage.

      IN THE CARRIAGE - The king, Philip II, the Infanta and
      Father Robert Reston.

                          PHILIP
                But she did not listen. She made
                me a speech about the virtues of
                virginity. Me! Virginity! She has
                brought this on herself.
      P
       hilip surveys the scene through the carriage window with a
      shudder.

                          PHILIP
                Every tree that falls hurts me. I
                lose a part of myself. I am
                cursed with sensitivity. I feel
                too much.

      We don't yet know what the felling of the trees portends.
      But Reston does. To him, it's a glorious sight.

                          RESTON
                Your majesty has a merciful soul.

                                         May 1 Blue Draft - p.11

                          PHILIP
                I sacrifice my country's forests
                to save the souls of a lost
                nation. That is true mercy.
                England is lost to darkness,
                Father. I bring light.

      WIDE NOW - We see the carriage and the royal party crest a
      hill, and there is revealed an awesome sight: the forest
      has been felled as far as the eye can see. Great piles of
      cut timber dot the ravaged landscape. Everywhere men are at
      work lopping branches from felled trees. Wagon teams haul
      immense trunks away. Fires burn stacks of lopped branches,
      and the smoke rises up into the empty sky.
      I
       N THE CARRIAGE - On Reston's face as he stares at the
      fires. He speaks half to himself, out of the depths of his
      own fanatical certainty.

                          RESTON
                The light of purifying fire.

      He turns and fixes the king with his intent gaze.

                           RESTON
                My time has come, majesty.
                    (Beat)
                Send me home.

      A small yapping Skye terrier is barking at a LAUNDRESS, who
      is handing over a letter, folded small, to a sharp-faced
      middle-aged French lady's maid, ANNETTE. The laundress
      curtseys and leaves.

      The terrier scampers ahead of Annette to its mistress, MARY
      STUART, who sits embroidering a pink satin petticoat. She
      is a handsome but bitter woman in her mid-thirties. Round
      her stands her small retinue of three ladies and a
      chaplain.

                          MARY
                This is so pretty I'm inclined to
                send it as a present to my dear
                cousin Elizabeth.                                         
      She holds up the delicate work to show her ladies.

                    MARY (CONT'D)                              
          It is an intimate garment, of                        
          course. But even Elizabeth must                      
          have the occasional intimate                         
          moment.                                              
Annette reaches her mistress and kneels before her, holding
out the letter.

                      ANNETTE
          My Queen.

Mary lays down her needlework and takes the letter from her
and reads it for herself.

                    MARY
          Our friends write to give us
          hope.

                    ANNETTE
              (low)
          Soon England's true believers
          will rise up against the bastard
          usurper Elizabeth, and slit her
          throat, and throw her down to
          hell.

                    MARY
          That's enough, Annette.
              (But she loves it.)
          Slit her throat? Please.

                    ANNETTE
          And when the bastard usurper is
          dead, my lady will be queen.

The chaplain gives a sharp cough of warning.

The Warden of Chartley Hall, SIR AMYAS PAULET, enters the
room. He is soberly dressed, but has charming manners, and

him at once with a teasing smile.

          Here's my noble jailer, come to                      
          smack my hand.                                       
She holds out one hand to be smacked. The other hand holds
the letter out of sight.                                       
                    MARY

          No, no, my lady. Unless beauty is                    
          counted a sin.

She holds the intimate garment against her body. Paulet     
seems to be too fascinated by it to notice he is being

     A pistol is being loaded: a fiddly process involving a            
     powder horn, wadding, and an iron ball the size of a              
     hazelnut.                                                         
                         ARMOURER (O.O.V.)
               So what's it for, my young                              
               friend? Not for shooting rabbits,                       
               I'm guessing.                                           
                         SAVAGE                                        
               We live in dangerous times.

               We do indeed.

     Savage moves close as if to study the loading process. We
     see the two of them talking from outside the window.

               The conspiracy gains strength.

     The Armourer nods. He hands the pistol to Savage. Savage          
     takes it and leaves.                                              
     Immediately after, a man enters and walks up behind the now       
     seated Armourer. The Armourer turns round.                        
                         RESTON                                        
               I ask for your forgiveness.                             
     Moving with speed, he seizes the Armourer's head, twists it       
     to one side, and snaps his neck.                                  
     Reston walks quietly out of the store.

     A crowd of eager SPECTATORS and WOULD-BE COURTIERS has
     gathered, held back by a line of guards, all hoping to
     attract the attention of the Queen when she appears. This
     is the route from the Presence Chamber to the Chapel Royal.

                                 May 1 Blue Draft - p.15
Every Sunday the Queen processes here, and crowds gather to
see her. Two of Walsingham's men, AGENTS 1 and 2, mingle in
the crowd: faces we'll see again.

Tom Babington stands unobtrusively at the back of the
crowd. He carries a bag which may or may not contain a gun.
A
  bustle of activity, a ripple of anticipation - `She's
coming!' - and the palace doors open.

BABINGTON'S POV: the crowd, the wall of BODYGUARDS, the
cluster of COURTIERS and LADIES, and in their midst,
Elizabeth, almost completely masked as she passes by.
Alongside the Queen, among her maids-of-honour, is Bess
Throckmorton; behind her, Walsingham.

The people cheer, call out to the Queen, reach to touch
her, fall to their knees.

                    CROWD
          God bless your majesty - God love
          you! - See her sweet face!

                                                                
Others in the crowd are shouting more militant sentiments.

                    CROWD                                       
                                                                
          Hang the Papists! - Look out for
          traitors, Elizabeth! Mary Stuart                      
          is the whore of Rome!                                 
Babington moves forward, easing his way to the front of the
crowd. Nearby there stands another young man who is
watching, not cheering: RAMSAY.

A WOMAN WTH A BABY pushes her way almost to the Queen,          
                                                                
holding her baby before her.

                    WOMAN WITH BABY                             
                                                                
          Your blessing, majesty. My little
          one, your blessing.                                   
BABINGTON'S POV- The Queen stopping to bless the little         
baby, smiling, putting out her hand to touch the baby's         
head. The mother bobs a curtsey. The Queen moves on, with       
her entourage.                                                  
A sudden scuffle in the crowd. Babington turns to look.

A CLOAK SWEEPS THROUGH FRAME - dropping down to the ground -
revealing as it passes the handsome smiling face of
Raleigh, directly in R
                     the path of the Queen.

                     ALEIGH
          A puddle in the way, majesty.

Elizabeth signs to the guards to stay calm. She stares at
Raleigh, then she looks down at the cloak. No sign of any
puddles. Bess Throckmorton watches, suppressing a smile.

                                          May 1 Blue Draft - p.16

      Elizabeth looks back up, meets Raleigh's eyes with a cool
      appraising gaze. Then she walks on over the cloak, shaking
      her head.

                          ELIZABETH                                        
                A puddle...                                                
      The guards take up their positions once more. Bess throws
      Raleigh a quick smile as she follows the royal party. His
      answering shrug says: I tried. He picks up the cloak, and
      stands gazing after the Queen.

       lizabeth goes into the chapel, and the doors close behind
      her.

                          ROYAL SERVANT
                The Queen is at her prayers!

                me that.

                Oh, I do. The Queen spoke to you.
                One word - but she spoke.

      The Great Hall is crowded with competing factions. A group
      of Spaniards, led by their Ambassador, DON GUERAU DE SPES,
      stand watching everyone else with haughty disdain.

An architect waits to present details of a building
project. Petitioners wait vainly, in the hope of catching
the Queen's eye. Howard and Hatton are in attendance.

     Bess Throckmorton is late. She comes running through the
     crowd of lesser petitioners who wait in the hope of gaining
     access to the Queen. She passes Calley, the two native
     Americans, and a group of sailors holding large hampers.
     Raleigh is trying to persuade the doorkeeper to let him          
     past.                                                            
                         DOORKEEPER
               You'll have to see the Lord                            
               Chamberlain, sir.                                      
     He indicates a portly man surrounded by petitioners, beyond

               How am I to see him if you won't
               let me through?

     The doorkeeper stands aside for Bess. She recognises             
     Raleigh, and throws him a smile before rushing past.             
                         RALEIGH

               I had less trouble than this
               boarding a Spanish ship!                               
               Everything is easier when you can

     Bess curtseys before Elizabeth; who shakes her head at her.

Elizabeth takes Bess's arm and turns with her to the
portraits.

              (to Bess)
          Where is he, then?

Bess understands. She bobs and hurries to the door.

                    ELIZABETH
              (to Walsingham)
          How much longer do you think I
          can play this game?

court servants carrying hampers.

One of the Spaniards recognises him and murmurs to the
Ambassador; who speaks angrily to the Queen.

                    DON GUERAU
          Majesty, this man is a notorious
          pirate.

                    ELIZABETH
          Indeed?

Don Guerau points to the hampers.

          The honour to be in the presence
          of my Queen, whose radiant beauty
          is the boast and glory of the
          English people.

          I'm just returned from the New
          World, majesty. I have claimed
          the fertile coast in your name,
          and called it Virginia, in honour
          of our Virgin Queen.

Elizabeth raises her eyebrows.

                    ELIZABETH
          Virginia? And if I marry? Will
          you change the name to Conjugia?

          the New World with your royal
          warrant, to found a colony under
          the laws and protections of

          Who are they?

                    RALEIGH
          Americans, majesty. They long to                     
          be your newest subjects.

He beckons Calley to lead Wanchese and Manteo forward.

                    ELIZABETH
          Have they no ruler of their own?

                    RALEIGH
          None to match England's Queen.

Elizabeth gazes at the natives. She holds out her hand.
Unaware that he's meant to kiss the Queen's hand, Manteo,
takes it and shakes it. A gasp from the watching courtiers.
But Elizabeth accepts the courtesy.

                    ELIZABETH
          These gentlemen are welcome. See
          that they're treated well.

Calley hurries them away before worse happens.

                    RALEIGH
          I also come bearing gifts for
          your majesty, from the New World.

He beckons to the servants to bring the baskets. Don Guerau
steps forward.

                    DON GUERAU
          The fruits of piracy, majesty.
          The true property of the realm of
          Spain.

Members of the court share suppressed smiles.

              (amused)
          Mud and leaves?

 aleigh throws open the first basket. Don Guerau peers
inside suspiciously. It does indeed seem to be filled with
mud.

Raleigh takes out a potato beneath the Ambassador's nose.

                    RALEIGH
          Patata, majesty. You eat it. Very
          nourishing.

He beckons forward the second basket, which is full of
leaves. Again Don Guerau tracks his every move. He takes
out a tobacco leaf. R

                     ALEIGH
          Tobacco. You breathe its smoke.
          Very stimulating.

Now Don Guerau realises he's being laughed at on all sides.
He draws himself up with angry pride, wrinkling his nose.

                    DON GUERAU
          Forgive me, majesty, I find the
          air has become stale. I am
          sensitive to the smell of open
          sewers.

A glare at Raleigh, a bow for the Queen, and Don Guerau
leads his Spaniards out.

                    ELIZABETH
              (to Raleigh)
          Continue.

With a broad smile, Raleigh gestures forward the third
basket. This one really is full of gold. He takes out a
gold coin and presents it to Elizabeth.

                    RALEIGH
          Gold. You spend it. Very
          satisfying.

Elizabeth examines the fat gold coin, with its image of
Philip of Spain. She tries not to smile.

                    RALEIGH
          Courtesy of a Spanish ship, that
          found itself unable to complete
          its journey.

Elizabeth drops the gold coin back into the basket.

               Philip of Spain is no friend of
               England, majesty. The more gold I
               take from him, the safer you will
               be.

                         ELIZABETH
               Well, well. A political pirate. A
               logic-chopping pirate.

                         RALEIGH
               And your majesty's most loyal
               subject.

     She gives him a long look.

                           ELIZABETH
               But not my best dressed.
               W    (Beat)
                 elcome home, Mr Raleigh.

     She turns her attention back to Hatton and the portraits.
     Raleigh bows and withdraws, followed by his men. Walsingham
     follows.

     Raleigh comes out into the hallway with Calley by his side.

     He moves on.

     Raleigh's eyes fall on Don Guerau, the Spanish Ambassador,
     passing near with his fellow Spaniards and a few English           
     courtiers and ministers, including Hatton. Don Guerau              
     stares at him.                                                     
     The doors to the privy chamber open and the Queen's ladies
     come swishing out in a tight chattering group, Bess beside
     her friend MARGARET.

               She liked him. I could tell.

                         BESS
               Well, wouldn't you?

     They see Raleigh now, and the chatter ceases. The ladies
     come to a stop and curtsey. Raleigh gives a bow, his eyes
     singling out Bess.

                         RALEIGH
               I'm glad to have the opportunity
               to thank you. Without your help,
               I'd still be in outer darkness.

                         BESS
               I did very little, sir. You'd
               already caught the Queen's eye.

                         RALEIGH
               Then I thank you for the very
               little.

     The ladies go on their way and the laughing chatter
     resumes, with many a backward glance at the handsome
     Raleigh. No one pays attention to a figure in the shadows,
     another of Walsingham's men, AGENT 3.

     EXT. WOOD - DUSK

     Young Savage stands alone among trees, shivering, white-
     faced, half-mumbling, half-singing an endless prayer. He
     holds a pistol with which he means to kill himself. But he
     can't do it.         S
                          AVAGE
                   (singing)
               Salve regina, mater
               misericordiae, vita dulcedo et
               spes nostra salve...

     In a clearing nearby three men sit round a fire. They are
     young Catholic fanatics - Babington, Ramsay, and FRANCIS
     THROCKMORTON. A fourth man stands before them, his back to
     us, watching Savage. At first we don't see who he is.

                                 May 1 Blue Draft - p.25

                    RESTON (O.O.V.)
          His weakness endangers us all. He
          can't go on with us. And we can't
          leave him behind.

Now the man turns and looks intently at Babington, and we      
see he is Robert Reston; no longer in the clothes of a
priest.

                    RESTON
          Who will help him?

Babington rises. Reston nods his approval. Babington goes      
off through the trees. Reston and the others follow a
little behind.

                    SAVAGE
              (
               singing)
          Ad te clamamus, exsulaes filii
          Evae. Ad te suspiramus gementes
          et flentes in hac lacrimarum
          valle -

He sings on as Babington approaches him, seeming no longer
to know what's happening. Babington takes the pistol from
his hand.

                    BABINGTON
          Make your peace with God.

Savage stares, and suddenly realises what Babington means
to do. Terror overwhelms him.

                    SAVAGE
          No, Tom! Don't kill me! I don't
          want to die!

Now he's blubbering with fear. Babington is shaken by this,
and can't shoot.

Reston begins to pray aloud.

                    RESTON
          Si ambulam in medio umbrae
          mortis, non timebo mala -

The others join in with the words of the well-known psalm.     
Babington too joins in, now weeping.

                    RESTON AND OTHERS
          Quoniam tu mecum es, Domine.
          Virga tua et baculus tuus, ipsa
          me consolata sunt -
B
 ANG! Savage falls dead.

     INT. WALSINGHAM'S HOUSE - EVENING
24                                                                 24    
     Walsingham enters his private home, and gives his hat and
     cloak to his servant.

                         SERVANT
               Visitor waiting, sir.

     Walsingham frowns. He climbs the stairs to the door of his
     study. There, pacing nervously, is his younger brother
     WILLIAM, a middle-aged student. Walsingham's scowl
     disappears. He opens his arms wide.                                 
                          WALSINGHAM                                     
                                                                         
               William!

                         WILLIAM                                         
                                                                         
               Hello, Francis.

     They embrace. Then Walsingham pushes him back to take a             
     good look at him.                                                   
                         WALSINGHAM
               You look terrible. Don't they
               feed you in Paris? How are your
               studies? Learned the secrets of
               the universe yet?

                          WILLIAM
               Not yet.

                         WALSINGHAM
               These are dangerous times to be
               questioning the ways of God. You
               must take care of yourself.

                         WILLIAM
               My needs are simple.

                         WALSINGHAM
               You'll dine with us? You'll lodge
               with us?

      is daughter MARY appears at the top of the next flight.

                          MARY WALSINGHAM
               William!

     She comes tumbling down and into his arms. She's an eager
     innocent 20-year-old, much loved by her father.

                         WILLIAM
               Look at you! All grown up.

     URSULA, Walsingham's wife, appears as Mary leads William up
     the stairs.

               William. This is a pleasure.

                         WILLIAM
               I've been away too long, ma'am.

                         MARY WALSINGHAM
               You come with me, William.

     William is by the fire, listening to Mary playing the
     virginal and singing. Walsingham and Ursula are by the
     dinner table.

                         URSULA
               Have you spoken to the Queen?

                         WALSINGHAM
               I speak to her daily.

                         URSULA
               You know what I mean. You've done
               enough. No man could do more.

                         WALSINGHAM
               I can't leave court yet. The
               Queen needs me.

                         URSULA
               So you're to die in harness like
               a pack horse, are you? And for
               what?

               These are difficult times-                              
                         URSULA                                        
               It's always difficult times.                            
     Mary joins them, her arm in William's. Walsingham seizes
     the opportunity to change the subject.

                         WALSINGHAM

          WILLIAM                                 
I doubt it, brother. Compromise                   
is out of fashion. On both sides                  
they say there can only be one                    
truth, and one God.

What do they say in Paris of the                  
Pope's call for holy war?                         
          WILLIAM                                 
Many welcome it.

I don't understand why we must
all hate each other.

          WILLIAM
Truth will always hate falsehood,
ma'am.

          MARY
Why do we have to talk about war?
Tell us your nice news, William.
Are you married yet?

          WILLIAM
    (smiling)
Not yet.

          MARY
Then we must find you a nice
sensible English wife.

          WILLIAM
No, no. I won't be staying long.
I must go back to my studies.

          WALSINGHAM
Not too soon, I hope. Every man
deserves a rest.

          URSULA
Listen to him! When did you last
rest, I'd like to know?

He won't listen to me. Not a
thought for his health. You tell
him, he's your brother. He'll die
at his desk, out of sheer
selfishness.

     Walsingham shares a rueful smile with William that says,
     `Women, eh?'. They take their seats for dinner.

     INT. GREAT HALL, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY
 7                                                                27
     Elizabeth sits sumptuously gowned and jewelled at an               
     ornately-dressed dining table, surrounded by her ladies,           
     Bess among them; Walsingham discreetly in the background.
     They're listening to a young Austrian make a formal speech
     of love. The AUSTRIAN AMBASSADOR stands to one side,
     mouthing the words to prompt him.

     The ARCHDUKE CHARLES is still a boy: sixteen years old,
     slight, pale, trembling with shyness. He struggles through
     his rehearsed speech.

                         ARCHDUKE CHARLES
                                                                        
               Your majesty's beauty is dazzling
               to my eyes. Your learning is                             
               famed throughout Europe. I see                           
               before me perfection in human                            
                                                                        
               form. Oh, Elizabeth! How blessed
               am I to stand in your fabled                             
               presence, warmed by your                                 
                                                                        
               greatness as by the rays of the
               sun. Oh Elizabeth! To speak your                         
               name is to hear celestial music.                         
                                                                        
               May that sweet sound guide me
               through my life to come -                                
               Elizabeth! Elizabeth! I have                             
                                                                        
               travelled here, to this
               illustrious court, in the hope                           
               that our two great nations might                         
                                                                        
               be joined in love. But now that I
               am bathed in the radiance of your                        
               glory, I am overwhelmed. I am                            
                                                                        
               conquered. I die. Only your love,
               great Elizabeth, can restore me
               to life.
     C
      ourtiers exchange smiles at his efforts. The Spaniards
     sneer openly. But Elizabeth takes the charade with due
     gravity.

                          LIZABETH
               Your highness does me great
               honour. Shall we eat our dinner?                         
               It should prove almost as
               restorative as my love.

     Raleigh enters the Great Hall, trailed by Calley, as the
     dinner gets under way. They join the much larger group who         
     simply stand and watch. Royal meals are in part a spectacle
     for the court. A JESTER moves from group to group, playing
     pranks on the guests.

                           Green Revision May 25 - p.29A

Raleigh is now dressed in court fashion, and looks very
well; as the glances of several court ladies show. He
catches Bess's eye and they share a smile.

                    COURT LADY
          So tell me, Mr Raleigh, in your
          sea battles - how do you sink an
          enemy ship? You shoot holes in
          its sides, I suppose.

                    RALEIGH
          No, ma'am. A sunk ship is of no
          value. The object is to capture
          and command.

                    COURT LADY
          And how do you do that?

                    RALEIGH
          Surprise. Speed. Irresistible
          violence.

Calley, listening, rolls his eyes.

Elizabeth, at the table with the Archduke by her side,
glances towards Raleigh, and sees him flirting with the
court ladies. Then back to the young Archduke, who has
hardly touched his food.

                    ELIZABETH
          I think you're not as accustomed
          as I am to eating in public. I
          have a secret.
               lowering her voice)
          I pretend there's a pane of glass
          - eine Glasscheibe - between me
          and them.
S
 he moves one hand before her face, indicating an imaginary
pane of glass. As she looks, she sees Bess staring at
someone - follows her gaze - and is amused to find that the
object of her attention is also Raleigh.

                    ELIZABETH
          They can see me, but they can't
          hear me, or touch me. You should
          try it.

She beckons to Bess.

                       ELIZABETH
          Bess.

Bess comes forward.

                    ELIZABETH
              (low)
          He interests me. Talk to him.

                    BESS
          Him, my lady?

                       ELIZABETH
          Him.

Bess turns and looks across towards Raleigh, as he flirts
with the court ladies.

Elizabeth turns back to her guest.

          His highness is tired after his
          journey.

The young Archduke, frozen with shyness, sits staring
before him, trembling as he frames a proper reply.

                    ARCHDUKE CHARLES
          No man can be tired in the
          presence of so lovely a Queen.
E
 lizabeth speaks so only he can hear, in German.

                     ELIZABETH
          (You play the game very well, my
          young friend. But don't you                       
                                                            
          sometimes feel an overwhelming
          desire to say what you're really                  
          thinking?)                                        
The Archduke's eyes open very wide. He glances at
Elizabeth, and sees on her face a conspiratorial smile.

                    ARCHDUKE CHARLES
          (I daren't even think what I'm                    
          really thinking.)                                 
                    ELIZABETH
          (You're thinking, perhaps, that                   
                                                            
          you would far rather be home.)

                    ARCHDUKE CHARLES
          (You're very wise, madame.)

He's grateful to her, and his shy face shows it.

Raleigh is still being entertained by the court ladies.     
                    COURT LADY                              
          I adore the natives you brought
          back with you. I don't suppose                    
          you could get one for me? They're                 
          not dangerous, are they?                          
                    RALEIGH                                 
          That depends what you propose to                  
          do with them.                                     
                    COURT LADY                              
          I'd dress him up in mulberry-                     
          coloured silk and have him walk                   
           behind me, carrying my cloak.

Bess has now approached Raleigh.

                    BESS
          The pirate is not too bored by
          the vanities of the court, I
          hope.

                    RALEIGH
          A simple sailor, dazzled by the
          bright lights.

Bess draws him away from the court ladies.

                    BESS
          If you can bring yourself to
          leave the dazzle of the bright
          lights for a moment -

                                 May 1 Blue Draft - p.32

                    RALEIGH
          D
           rawn away by the brightest light
          of all.

                    BESS
          That can only mean the Queen.

                    RALEIGH
          I don't presume to raise my eyes
          so high.


They both look at the Queen. She's watching Raleigh. He     
bows.

                    BESS
          It seems you've presumed after
          all.

                    RALEIGH
          It seems you're determined to
          think the worst of me.

                    BESS
          Tell me what it is you really
          want.

                    RALEIGH
          What every man wants. Money.
          Fame. Love.

                    BESS
          In that order?

                    RALEIGH
          Each leads to the next. The money
          will buy and equip ships for a
          return voyage to the New World.
          The success of my infant colony
          there will make me famous. The
          fame will bring me love.

                    BESS
          It seems rather a long way round.

                    RALEIGH
          There are benefits along the way.
          It is something, after all, to
          take a blank on the map and build
          there a shining city.

                    BESS
          Which you will no doubt name
          after yourself.

                                    May 1 Blue Draft - p.33

                    RALEIGH
              (smiling)
          No doubt. B

                     ESS
          Well, then. I am answered.

                    RALEIGH
          May I ask a question in return?

                       BESS
          Of course.

                    RALEIGH
          How am I to win the Queen's
          favour?

                    BESS
          Why should I tell you that, sir?

                    RALEIGH
          I've little enough to offer, I
          know. But whatever I have to give
          - ask, and it's yours.

Bess thinks for a moment.

                    BESS
          My advice to you is, say what you
          mean to say as plainly as
          possible. All men flatter the
          Queen in the hope of advancement.
          Pay her the compliment of truth.

She gives him her hand. He kisses it.

                    RALEIGH
          I don't even know your name.

                    BESS
          Elizabeth Throckmorton.

                    RALEIGH
          A second Elizabeth.

                    BESS
          Everyone calls me Bess.
S
 he goes back to the Queen, as Elizabeth is rising to
leave. She speaks to the company.

                    ELIZABETH
          His highness the Archduke informs
          me that my charms overwhelm him.
          He will retire to his private
          quarters to rest.

                                                                       




                                                                       




                               34

     This causes much amusement. Don Guerau sneers openly. The
     Archduke rises. All rise. The Archduke bows solemnly to the
     Queen, and leaves with his entourage. Elizabeth beckons to
     Walsingham, and speaks low to him.

                         ELIZABETH
               He's a sweet boy. I don't want
               him hurt by your schemes.

     Bess is reading to Elizabeth. Elizabeth watching her, her
     mind elsewhere.

                         ELIZABETH
               I suspect him of being a
               professional charmer. Am I right?

                         BESS
               He is certainly charming, my
               lady.

                         ELIZABETH
               There are duller professions. And
               what is it he hopes to gain by
               his charms?

                         BESS
               He hopes for glory in his New
               World. He dreams of building a
               shining city.

                          ELIZABETH                                    
                                                                       
               Which I'm to pay for, no doubt.
                   (Beat)                                              
               You like him, don't you?                                
                         BESS                                          
               It's refreshing to meet a man who                       
               looks to a world beyond the                             
               court.                                                  
                         ELIZABETH
               So it is. We shall let him come                         
               again.

     Mary Stuart holds her pet dog in her arms, listening to
     Annette, who kneels before her.

                                   May 1 Blue Draft - p. 35

                    MARY
          Dismissed? On whose orders?

She looks up at the laundress, who stands red-eyed and
snuffling, with a guard by her side.

                    MARY
          Do stop snivelling.

                    ANNETTE
          The Warden, my lady.

                    MARY
          The Warden? My Warden?

As she speaks, Sir Amyas Paulet enters. Mary's voice
becomes seductive.

                                                               
                    MARY
          What have you done now, you bad                      
          man? Sent away my laundress? How                     
          am I to have clean clothes? Or do                    
                                                               
          you want me to go about naked?

Paulet smiles at the notion of Mary naked.                     
                    PAULET
          That was not my motive, ma'am.                       
                                                               
          Much though -
              (Thinking better of it)                          
          Your laundress was found to be                       
                                                               
          carrying letters in her washing.
          Not her job, I think.

          Am I to have no privacy?                             
                    PAULET                                     
          No.                                                  
Beneath the charm, steel.

          The Queen orders these measures

          What if I wish to write a love                       
          letter? Is Elizabeth to be sent a                    
          copy? Is she so starved of lovers                    
          that she must feed on mine?

          The Queen grieved when your                          
          husband died, ma'am. As she                          
          grieved when your second husband                     
                                                               
          died. And the third. If there is
          a possibility of a fourth -

          Tormentor! Is that Elizabeth's                       
          order too? That you torment and                      
          mock me?                                             
She turns to go, but stops before leaving the room: bitter,    
haughty, not deigning to look back.

          They say she's a beautiful woman.                    
                                                               
          Is she so very beautiful?

          Why is that, sir? Can it be that                     
                                                               
          no man will have her?

Mary changes mood again, thinking it more politic to keep
the Warden under her spell. She waves Annette and the
laundress away.

                    MARY
          My friend, forgive me. You are my
          friend, are you not?                                 
                    PAULET
          I am your servant, ma'am, and
          your admirer.

                    MARY
          I shall send no more letters. I
          shall stay here quietly, in my
          prison. With you.

      The same crowd of petitioners wait in vain for access to           
      the Queen. The same door keeper. Raleigh enters, and this          
      time the door keeper bows, and ushers him through the open         
      doors.                                                             
      Over this we hear Raleigh's voice telling of his                   
      adventures:

                It begins with a journey. You

      Elizabeth listens attentively, her eyes looking far away

      Walsingham is talking to Elizabeth about matters of state.         
      We are on her face, and we can see that she hears nothing          
                                                                         
      of what he tells her. Her mind is all on Raleigh's voice.

                You live with fear, in the grip                          
                of fear - fear of storms, fear of                        
                sickness on board, fear of the                           
                immensity. What if you never                             
                escape? How can you escape?                              
                There's nowhere to go. So you                            
                must drive your fear down, deep                          
                into your belly, and study your                          
                charts, and watch your compass,                          
                and pray for a fair wind - and                           
                hope.

      Now Elizabeth is with Raleigh again, listening as he goes          
      on speaking to her, now directly.

               Pure naked fragile hope, when all                       
               your senses scream at you, Lost!

               staring west, the rising sun on                         
               your back, the setting sun in                           
               your eyes, hoping, hoping -                             
     Sir Christopher Hatton enters.

                         HATTON
               Majesty, the Archduke and the                           
               court are waiting.                                      
                         ELIZABETH

               Let them wait!
                   (to Raleigh)
               Go on, Mr Raleigh. You were
               hoping.

     Hatton bows and leaves, frowning.

                         RALEIGH
               At first it's no more than a haze
               on the horizon, the ghost of a
               haze, the pure line corrupted.
               But clouds do that, and storms.
               So you watch, you watch.

     INT. QUEEN'S PRIVATE QUARTERS, WHITEHALL PALACE - NIGHT

     Elizabeth dances with Raleigh. As they dance, his voice
     continues over; and Elizabeth seems to be listening to him.

                         RALEIGH (V.O.)
               Then it's a smudge, a shadow on
               the far water. For a day, for
               another day, the stain slowly
               spreads along the horizon, and
               takes form - until on the third
               day you let yourself believe. You
               dare to whisper the word - land!

     The music ends, and the dance finishes.

     Elizabeth is seated now - it's later in time. Raleigh is
     speaking intently to her, and she is captivated.                  
                         RALEIGH
               Land. Life. Resurrection. The
               true adventure. Coming out of the
               vast unknown, out of the
               immensity, into safe harbour at
               last. That - that - is the New
               World.

     A short silence. Elizabeth is absorbing what he has told
     her.

                         ELIZABETH (V.O.)
               The Queen does not have a private                        
               life.

     Elizabeth is on the throne. The Archduke Charles and his
     entourage face her. The court fills the room. Elizabeth
     makes her formal response to the young Archduke.

                         ELIZABETH
               The Queen lives for her people.
               You will therefore forgive me,
               sir, if after much thought and
               prayer I decline your offer of
               marriage.

     The Archduke, barely able to conceal his relief, turns to
     the Austrian ambassador.

                         ARCHDUKE CHARLES
               (Can I go home now?)

     Elizabeth inclines her head, trying not to smile.

                         ELIZABETH
               (Go home, my friend. Don't be in
               a hurry to grow old. Youth is so
               very precious.)

     Elizabeth rises and takes the Archduke's arm as they start
     to leave the chamber. Bess, in her wake, finds an                  
     opportunity to speak softly to Raleigh.

                         BESS
               Well? Are you satisfied with the                         
               Queen's favour?

                         RALEIGH
               She listened as if she understood
               me.

                            ESS
               Then I shall expect some
               gratitude. R

                          ALEIGH
               What do you want?

     Their eyes meet, both aware of the current of mutual
     attraction.

                I expect I'll think of something.

      Bess hurries after the Queen. The Austrian entourage is
      just leaving as the Queen turns.

                          ELIZABETH
                Mr. Raleigh.

      Elizabeth and Raleigh walk together around the perimeter
      hallway, dwarfed by vast murals.

                          ELIZABETH
                I like your immensities. Your
                ocean is an image of eternity, I
                think. Such great spaces make us
                small. Do we discover the New
                World, Mr Raleigh, or does the
                New World discover us?

                          RALEIGH
                You speak like a true explorer.

                          ELIZABETH
                I like you, Mr Raleigh.

                          RALEIGH
                And I like you.

      She stops and turns to meet Raleigh's eyes. She's not used
      to such direct replies. Bess is watching them.

                          ELIZABETH
                You know, of course, that when I
                like a man, I reward him.

                           ALEIGH
                I have heard that.

                          ELIZABETH
                And what have you to say about
                it?       R
                           ALEIGH
                Reward my mission, majesty, not
                me.

                          ELIZABETH
                Is the mission not the man?                             
                          RALEIGH
                Leave me free to like you in
                return. That can be my reward.

                              41-43

                          ELIZABETH
                Go on.                                                  
                          RALEIGH
                I think it must be hard for so
                great a Queen to know the simple
                pleasure of being liked for
                herself.

      Elizabeth stares. This is a little too close to the truth.

                          ELIZABETH
                Now you become dull.

      EXT. WINDSOR GREAT PARK - DAY

      Horses racing, hoofs pounding over the grass, manes flying -
      Two riders hurtle between the trees, down a woodland ride,
      neck and neck-

      Elizabeth and Raleigh are racing against each other, faces
      glowing, laughing, abandoned to the breakneck speed of the
      moment.

      Raleigh is winning now, first by a head, then by a length.
      At the end of the ride he slows his horse to a walk.

                          RALEIGH
                Mine!

      Elizabeth shakes her head, unable to speak.

                          ELIZABETH
                    (out of breath)
                You have - the stronger horse.

                Y         RALEIGH
                 ours carries the lighter load.

                The Queen does not give way to                          
                others.                                                 
      Raleigh stops his horse. Elizabeth rides on up to him and         
      then past him. Raleigh secretly spurs his horse. The horse        
      springs forward, ahead of her.

                     in the horse)                                      
                Forgive me, majesty. My horse                           
                doesn't know his place yet                              
      Elizabeth looks at him, amused, intrigued.

                    ELIZABETH                                
          Have you ever known your place,                    
          Mr. Raleigh?                                       
She urges her horse forward, forcing Raleigh to catch up.    
                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)                       
          I'm surprised you're not married                   
          yet.                                               
                    RALEIGH                                  
          I'm a sailor, majesty.                             
                    ELIZABETH                                
          And can sailors not be lovers?                     
                    RALEIGH                                  
              (with a smile)                                 
                                                             
          Must lovers be husbands?

                    ELIZABETH                                
          Ah, I see. You like love better
                                                             
          than marriage. That I understand.

                    RALEIGH                                  
                                                             
          Your majesty is not eager to be
          married?                                           

                                                             
                    ELIZABETH
          When I marry, I marry for my                       
          country.                                           
                                                             
              (looking at Raleigh)
          When I love, I love for myself.                    
              (pause)                                        
                                                             
          You have had many loves, I think.

                    RALEIGH                                  
              (with a smile)
          Some...                                            
                    ELIZABETH                                
          You've yet to meet your equal?                     
Raleigh hesitates. She understands him.                      
                    RALEIGH                                  
          I would want someone who knows me                  
          as I am.                                           
Now it is Elizabeth who hesitates. He understands her as     
well.                                                        
                    ELIZABETH
          You want a friend, not just an
          equal. You want someone to share                   
          your joy when you're happy.

                         ELIZABETH(cont'd)
               Someone to cry with when you're                          
               sad. Someone to talk to when                             
               there's nothing to say. Someone                          
               to find by your side when you                            
               wake in the night. Someone who                           
               remembers what you once were,                            
               when you've grown old.                                   
     She turns to him with a smile.                                     
                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
               Ah yes. I know all about it.                             
               There. I'm rested now.                                   
     She turns her horse around in the direction from which they        
     came. Raleigh follows.                                             
                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)                             
               We can be something to each                              
                                                                        
               other, I hope, Mr. Raleigh.

     She spurs her horse, and suddenly she's racing away, back          
     across the park to the distant band of mounted courtiers           
                                                                        
     and Queen's ladies, including Bess. Raleigh spurs his horse
     to follow, also fast, but this time careful to keep a              
     distance behind.                                                   
     As they near the courtiers, Raleigh splits off. Bess
     watches as Elizabeth turns and looks after him as he rides

     away.

     Bess creeps out of her bedroom, pulling on a cloak.

     Bess makes her way down the dark palace corridor, stepping
     over sleeping courtiers as she goes. Margaret watches her
     from the shadows.

     Cloaked and hooded, Bess passes quietly down an alley,
     stepping over more sleeping forms. London's homeless.

     She finds a door, checks a note she holds, glances round to
     be sure no one sees her, knocks and enters.


     INT LONDON HOUSE - NIGHT

     A man closes the door behind his visitor. Bess shakes off          
     her hood. It's George Throckmorton, one of the                     
     conspirators. They embrace.

          George! What's wrong? Is your                       
          father alright?                                     
                    THROCKMORTON                              
          He's old. He won't live long now.                   
          Thank you for coming, dear Bess.                    
                    BESS
          I was worried. You must send me                     
          no more letters. You know what                      
          would happen if I was caught.                       
                    THROCKMORTON
          I need your help.                                   
                    BESS                                      
          Do you need more money?                             
                    THROCKMORTON                              
          My father is a tired old man. We                    
          don't want to hide like this                        
                                                              
          anymore. We both want to get back
          to court.                                           
                    BESS
          You are known Papists.                              

                                                              
                    THROCKMORTON
          The Queen loves you. Speak to                       
          her.                                                
                    BESS                                      
          I cannot betray the Queen.

                    THROCKMORTON
          You are not betraying her. My                       
                                                              
          father and I will embrace the new
          faith.                                              
Bess is suspicious and starts to leave.                       
                    BESS
          Don't put me in danger like this.                   
                    THROCKMORTON                              
          Cousin Bess, we've known each
          other all our lives. I would do                     
          nothing to harm you.                                
                       BESS
          I'm sorry.

          If they catch us, they will kill                    
          us. Our lives are in your hands.

     A group of the Queen's ladies make their way down the
     hallway, Bess among them. The others are gossiping in low
     whispers as they go. Bess is silent with anxiety.

     Then she looks ahead, and her face fills with fear.
     Walsingham is coming down the hallway towards them. The
     ladies curtsey. He nods, and throws a glance at Bess. The
     ladies move on.

     Bess looks back. Walsingham is also looking back, and seems
     to be watching her.

     Bess hurries ahead of the others through the Privy Chamber
     to the Queen's private quarters.

     INT. QUEEN'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY

      ess passes ladies organising the Queen's wardrobe. She
     finds the Queen laughing with Raleigh - not alone, but
     unusually informal.

                          LIZABETH
               Don't tease me, Mr Raleigh.
               There's nothing I'd like to do
               more.

                         RALEIGH
               So why don't you?

                         ELIZABETH
               Alright, then. I will.

     He blinks: caught by surprise.

                         ELIZABETH
               See! You lie! You don't want me                           
               on your ship at all.
                   (turning towards Bess)                                
               You're a liar!

                          ELIZABETH
                Would you like to go to sea,
                Bess?

                           BESS                                            
                Majesty?                                                   
                          RALEIGH
                I'm afraid that's not possible.
                Women bring bad luck on board
                ship.

                          ELIZABETH
                Oh, do they?

                          RALEIGH
                Lock up a hundred men in a space
                smaller than this room, for
                months at a time - Men have
                needs. A beautiful woman like you
                would drive us all mad.

                          ELIZABETH
                    (amused)
                Men have needs?

       nce again Elizabeth meets Raleigh's eyes. Then she breaks
      away, feeling the contact is dangerous.

                          ELIZABETH
                Then let them stay on land and
                see to their needs.
                    (to Bess)
                Mr Raleigh is eager to sail away
                to his infant colony, Bess. We
                must persuade him to stay a
                little longer, mustn't we?

      Raleigh is leaving. Walsingham has been waiting for him. He          
      falls into step beside him.

                Mr Raleigh. A word of advice. The                          
                Queen chooses to show you favour.                          
                You naturally wish to take                                 
                advantage of that.

                Don't ask for too much.                                    
                          RALEIGH                                          
                You think all I want is money.

               You think I'm a cynical                                  
               adventurer, with little breeding                         
               and less education. You're wrong.                        
               I'm a cynical adventurer with                            
               little breeding and an excellent                         
               education.

               I begin to see why the Queen                             
               likes you.

     A soft knock on the door. Francis Throckmorton goes to the
     window and looks out.

     THROCKMORTON'S POV - In the street outside, a woman with
     her head covered.

     He unbolts the door. T

                           HROCKMORTON
               Bess?

     Two men burst in and seize him. They are Agents 4 and 5.
     Beyond, the woman - not Bess - is hurrying away.

     Throckmorton struggles. A single sharp blow, and he folds
     to the ground.

        Multiple images of Elizabeth, naked. Strange misty
        refracted glimpses of her face, her body.

        A bath of steaming hot water has been placed in the Queen's
        private quarters, and screened by mirrors. The Queen is in
        the bath, being washed by her ladies.
        B
         ess Throckmorton has the job of holding the Queen's hair
        out of the water as she's washed. She strokes the soft
        tresses as she holds them, unaware that Elizabeth can see
        her in the mirror.

        Then she looks up and catches Elizabeth's eyes, and stops
        in confusion.

                            ELIZABETH
                  No, don't stop. I like it.

        Bess returns to her gentle caresses, and Elizabeth to her
        thoughts.

                            ELIZABETH
                  Is it true, Bess? That I've never
                  known the simple pleasure of
                  being liked for myself?

                            BESS
                  I hope you believe that I like                          
                  you for yourself, my lady.                              
                            ELIZABETH
                  Is anybody ever liked just for
                  themselves? Are you? I doubt it.
                  Men like you because you're
                  pretty. And because you have the
                  ear of the Queen.

                         BESS
               No doubt, my lady.

                         ELIZABETH
               Him too. He likes you because he
               wants my favour. You do realise
               that?

                         BESS
               Yes, my lady.

                         ELIZABETH
               And the other thing too, of
               course. But all men want that.
               Male desire confers no
     B         distinction.

      ess strokes Elizabeth's hair in silence. Then she sees
     Elizabeth gazing at her in the mirror.

                          LIZABETH
               I envy you, Bess. You're free to
               have - what I can't have. You're
               my adventurer. Don't be afraid.
               It's all over so soon.

     INT. TORTURE ROOM - DAY

     A man who looks like a shop assistant sits grabbing a quick
     lunch. He's the TORTURER. Nearby on a blood-stained bench
     lies a huddled half-naked figure, trembling uncontrollably.
     It's Francis Throckmorton. He's neither manacled nor
     guarded. His body is so broken it's not necessary.

     Walsingham enters. The torturer jumps to his feet.
     Walsingham goes to Throckmorton. He gazes at him, shaking
     his head. He's getting too old for this dirty business.

                         WALSINGHAM
               Still nothing to tell me, Mr
               Throckmorton?

     Throckmorton struggles to lift his head.
                          T
                          HROCKMORTON
               My soul will go free soon.

                         WALSINGHAM
               I know about the Enterprise. I
               need names. But if you won't help
               me, perhaps your father will.

     He signs to the torturer. The torturer goes into an
     adjoining cell.

                              orchid revisions 28 June - p. 51

                          WALSINGHAM
                He's been questioned, as you
                have. I do have to know, you see.

      The torturer and a guard enter, dragging between them the
      broken but living body of OLD THROCKMORTON.

                          THROCKMORTON
                No!

      Old Throckmorton looks up, eyes blank with suffering.

                          THROCKMORTON
                Enough! You want a name, I'll
                give you a name.

                          WALSINGHAM
                Well?

      Walsingham comes close to hear. Throckmorton chokes out
      something we don't hear, but the torturer hears, and his
      eyes open wide.

      Elizabeth passes down a hallway at a brisk pace, Hatton by           
      her side, her ladies hurrying behind her.

      Elizabeth enters her private quarters, now moving with
      regal dignity once more, but the flush on her cheeks gives
      her away. Her ladies follow.

      There stands Raleigh, waiting for her.

                          ELIZABETH
                Mr Raleigh. I've kept you
                waiting.

      Walsingham enters.

                             WALSINGHAM

      Elizabeth turns on him with a frown of irritation.

                          ELIZABETH
                Yes, Walsingham?

                          WALSINGHAM
                The traitor has talked, majesty.
                The traitor Throckmorton.

                       orchid revisions 28 June - p. 52A

A flash of fear in Bess's eyes.

                    ELIZABETH
              (to Raleigh)
          Forgive me, sir. As you see, my
          time is not my own.

Elizabeth moves away so that Walsingham can talk to her in
confidence. She listens to his murmured words, and anger
shows on her face.

     The torturer, now off duty, is standing in the open doorway
     to empty his bladder. He's unlacing his britches, when he
     hears footsteps approaching behind.

     The torturer begins to piss, with evident pleasure.

                         TORTURER
               You'll never guess what I heard -

     A knife at his throat. A quick slash.

     The killer, Agent 3, waits one more moment, to be sure the
     job is done. The torturer slumps, still standing, against
     the wall.

     Agent 3 slips away.

     On the flag stones, blood trickles down to mingle with the
     urine.

     Now there are guards everywhere. The whole palace is on
     heightened alert.

      lizabeth sweeps out of the Privy Chamber into the Great
     Hall, accompanied by the Spanish Ambassador on one side and
     Walsingham on the other. Her entourage scuttles behind.

               set free, and placed on the
               English throne.

                    ELIZABETH(cont'd)
          I am to be assassinated. Does any
          of this sound familiar?

                    DON GUERAU
          I know nothing of any invasion
          plans.

                    ELIZABETH
          I refer to this plan as the
          Enterprise of England. It should
          more accurately be called `la
          Empresa di Inglaterra', because
          it's a Spanish plan. The plan of
          your king, my one-time brother-in-
          law, Philip II, to attack my
          country.

The Ambassador decides the best form of defence is attack.
                     D
                     ON GUERAU
          Attack? It is my country that is
          under attack! Your so-called
          pirates attack our merchant ships
          daily! Do you think we don't know
          where their orders come from? The
          whole world knows that pirates
          sail up the Thames all the way to
          the royal bed!

                    ELIZABETH
              (exploding)
          You will leave my presence, sir!
          Go back to Spain! Tell Philip
          that I don't fear him, or his
          priests, or his armies. Tell him
          if he wants to shake his little
          fist at us, we're ready to give
          him such a bite he'll wish he'd
          kept his hands in his pockets.

Don Guerau sees no point in further pretence. He speaks
with pride and contempt.

                    DON GUERAU
          You see a leaf fall, and you
          think you know which way the wind
          blows. But a wind is coming,
          madam, that will sweep away your
          pride.
H
 e bows and turns to go. Elizabeth's words blaze after him.

                    ELIZABETH
          I too can command the wind, sir.
          I have a hurricane in me that
          will strip Spain bare, if you
          dare to try me!

                             May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 55

     Shivering with rage she turns round, and there's Raleigh.
     Her fury overflows onto him.

                         ELIZABETH
               What are you staring at? Lower
               your eyes! I am the Queen!

     She sweeps past him without a further glance.

     ON RALEIGH - Watching Elizabeth go. A shake of his head.
     Enough.

     Immense stacks of cut timber as far as the eye can see.
     Skeletons of new ships, big ships, rising in the great
     yard. Hundreds of ship-builders at work.
     T
      his is what the forests were felled for: a brand-new fleet
     is being built.

     Tiny figures in the wide scene: the royal party appears.
     Philip has come to see progress for himself. As he and his
     entourage tour the construction site, one of his ministers
     briefs him on the latest developments in England.

                         SPANISH MINISTER
               (It can't be denied that we've
               lost the advantage of surprise. A
               large part of our plans has come
               into their hands.)

                         PHILIP
               (The Jesuit is still at liberty?)

                         SPANISH MINISTER
               (We understand so, majesty.)

                         PHILIP
               (He knows his business. We've
               lost nothing.)

     The workmen kneel to Philip as he passes.

                         PHILIP
               (Tell the carpenters to go on
               working. No one is to stop for
               me. The fleet must be ready to
               sail in a month.)

                         SPANISH MINISTER
               (Impossible, majesty!)

                         PHILIP
               (If this is God's work, God will
               make it possible.)

       LOSE ON pen and paper - a letter being written in haste.

      Raleigh at a ship's table littered with charts. He's
      writing a letter to the Queen.

      The Tyger is in dock. Raleigh emerges from his cabin to              
      find Bess waiting for him.

     Raleigh is taken aback by Bess's sudden anger.                     
                         BESS
               The Queen shouts at you once, and                        
               you sulk like a child. I thought                         
               you more of a man than that. And                         
               I thought you a better friend to                         
               the Queen. Her every move is                             
               watched by a hundred eyes.                               
               Assassins plot to kill her.                              
               Enemies prepare to overwhelm her                         
               country. And you say she's                               
               playing games?                                           
     Raleigh is watching her as she speaks, and he's impressed.
                                                                        
     Anger suits her.

               Very well. What is my Queen's
               command?

               Go to her, sir. As her friend.

     INT. QUEEN'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY

     Elizabeth is pacing, disturbed, Raleigh's letter open in
     her hand.

     The doors open. Raleigh enters. Elizabeth waits for the
     servants to close the doors behind him. Holds up the
     letter.

                         ELIZABETH
               You ask permission to go.

                                                                        
                         RALEIGH
               Yes, majesty.                                            
                         ELIZABETH                                      
               You plan to return to the New                            
               World. To your colony. For two,                          
               or three, or four years.                                 
                         RALEIGH                                        
               If your majesty grants me your                           
               royal warrant.                                           
                         ELIZABETH                                      
               That is a long time.

               There's nothing left for me to do                        
               here. At sea I know what I'm to                          
               do, I know the risks, I know the                         
               rewards. Here -

A shrug. What can he do?                                       
                    ELIZABETH
          But you're quite wrong. You are
          needed here. I have decided to
          appoint you Captain of my
          personal guard.

                    RALEIGH
          Captain of your - !

                    ELIZABETH
          Kneel.

He kneels. She taps him on the shoulder with one hand.

                    ELIZABETH
          Rise, Sir Walter Raleigh.

He rises, but keeps his eyes on the ground.                    
                     ELIZABETH
                                                               
          Well? You may express your
          gratitude.                                           

                                                               
                    RALEIGH
          This is too great an honour.                         

                                                               
                    ELIZABETH
          If it's such an honour, why are                      
          you staring at your boots?                           
                    RALEIGH                                    
          You know why.                                        
He raises his eyes, but he still doesn't look at her.          
                    ELIZABETH
          Now you stare at the wall. Am I
          so old and hideous that you can't
          even look me in the face?

He turns now, and looks her in the face.                       
                    RALEIGH
          Why do you talk like a fool when
          you're anything but a fool?

This stops her in her tracks. For a moment she can't trust
herself to speak. Then:

                    ELIZABETH
          My friend, forgive me. I'm a vain
          and foolish woman. At court it's
          all a game. I like to be admired.
          I require it. I grow accustomed
          to it. But it's all - nothing.

               end. I would follow you there if
               I could, believe me.                                    
     Raleigh looks long into her eyes. If anything, he admires         
     and loves her all the more now.

               The storm clouds are gathering,                         
               my friend. Please don't leave me

     CLOSE ON Throckmorton as the noose is tightened round his
     neck. His face is ravaged by the tortures he's endured, but
     he holds his head high, ready for death. Round him an
     unseen crowd bays for blood.

                         CROWD (O.S.)
               Hang! Hang! Hang!

                         RESTON (V.O.)
               Lord have mercy on the soul of

               for your eternal truth...

     A candle-lit cellar, where Reston and the conspirators pray
     for the condemned man, heads bowed.

      abington bursts in.

               Why don't we strike? What's he
               dying for? Is this part of your
               plan?

     Reston puts his hands on Babington's shoulders and gently         
     but irresistibly forces him down to pray with them.               
                         RESTON
               Lord, be with us as the end
               approaches.

      Throckmorton drops. His body flails. His neck breaks. A
      roar of bloodlust from the crowd.

      Bess is on her knees before the simple altar, her head            
                                                                        
      bowed in prayer.

      Raleigh enters through the rear doors. He stands in               
                                                                        
      silence, watching her as she prays. He hears her sigh.

      He takes a step towards her. She hears, startled. Turns and
      sees him.                                                         
                          BESS                                          
                Oh! It's you!

                I'm sorry. I didn't mean to                                                                                                   
                disturb you.

                          BESS                                                                        
                My prayer's done.

      She rises to her feet.   
                                         
                          RALEIGH                                       
                Something has distressed you.  
                         
                          BESS                                          
                And I thought I prayed in                               
                silence.               
                                 
                          RALEIGH                                       
                So you did.        
                                     
      She turns away, unable to look him in the eyes.   
                
                          BESS                                          
                A man was hanged today. A Papist.                       
                I knew him well. He was my                              
                cousin. He died because I gave                          
                information. I gave information                         
                to prove my loyalty. Because I                          
                was afraid.

                         RALEIGH                                         
               That's necessity. That's the                              
               world we live in.                                         
                         BESS                                            
               He told me he wanted to change.                           
               Become part of the new England. I                         
               was afraid that he was lying to                           
               me. But what if - what if it was                          
               true?                                                     
     He sees the horror in her eyes, at the thought that she has         
     sent an innocent man to his death. Tears rise to her eyes.          
                         BESS                                            
                                                                         
               What if I was his last hope? What
               if I was the one person he                                
               thought he could trust?                                   
                         RALEIGH                                         
               If you knew him well, you will                            
               have sensed the truth.                                    
                         BESS                                            
               I thought so.                                             
                         RALEIGH                                         
               He was hoping to use you. You did                         
                                                                         
               what you had to do.

     She can no longer hold back the tears.                              
                         RALEIGH                                         
               There, now.                                               
     He wipes away a tear from her cheek. In desperate need of           
     comfort, she throws herself into his arms. He holds her             
                                                                         
     close as she sobs.

                         RALEIGH                                         
               We're all mortal, Bess. We do                             
               what we can.                                              
     He strokes her cheek. She meets his eyes, filled with               
     gratitude. She takes the hand that touches her face and             
     moves it to her lips. She kisses it, still holding his              
     eyes. He draws her back into his arms, and they kiss.               
     Suddenly they're kissing eagerly, greedily, their long pent-        
     up passion released at last.

     A brewer's wagon, pulled by two dray horses and carrying
     beer barrels, crosses the ancient bridge over the moat and
     pulls up by the gates.

     The brewer, a big ugly man called BURTON, looks down at the
     GUARDS. Beside him, taking care not to draw attention to
     himself, sits Ramsay.

                         BURTON

     Burton, standing outside, rolls the barrels through a trap
     door and down a chute into the cellar, where they are
     caught by the CELLARMAN, and stacked. Another GUARD stands

     The cellarman takes it, then closes the trap door. The
     guard watches as the cellarman empties the beer barrels
     into open vats; leaving the bungs on one side. The barrels
     are then thrown on a fire.

      nnette, Mary Stuart's maid, walks calmly up to the GUARD

     Mary Stuart comes to meet her. Annette removes the crumpled

     the letter to a lamp, and devours it with eager eyes.

     EXT. RIVER/DEE'S HOUSE - DUSK

     The moon seen through a sextant.

     A strange figure stands on the flat roof of a riverside
     house, studying the night sky. He's tall, with a long
     pointed beard and a skullcap: the famous magus DR JOHN DEE.

     A hiss and splash from the night river. He turns to look.
     Out of the mists and shadows comes the lights of an
     approaching barge.

     ON THE ROYAL BARGE - Elizabeth and Walsingham, wrapped
     against night chill, being rowed up river. Over this, lines
     led from the next scene:

     evidence of his wide-ranging curiosity.

The magus sits at a table before an astrological chart,
while Elizabeth and Walsingham look on.

                    DEE
          The alignment of the planets is                   
          most unusual this year. Mars is                   
          due to take the ascendant three                   
          days after the anniversary of                     
          your birth - your majesty was                     
          born on September 7th - and I see                 
          that twelve days before the                       
          anniversary of your birth -                       
He transfers his attention to a different, astronomical
chart.

                    DEE
          - there will be a full moon - the                 
          moon which -

He moves back to the astrological chart.

                    DEE
          - governs the fortunes of all
          princes of the female gender.

                    ELIZABETH
          Princes of the female gender.

                    DEE
          I mean to say, a prince who is
          also a woman.

                    ELIZABETH
          Yes, Dr Dee. I am following you.
          So what does it all mean?
                    D
                     EE
          It means the rise of a great
          empire, majesty. And it means
          convulsions, also. The fall of an
          empire.

Elizabeth listens, a faraway look in her eyes. She knows
nothing of the planets, but she feels it deep within
herself: her moment of destiny is near.

                    ELIZABETH
          Which empire is to rise, and
          which is to fall?

                    DEE
          That I can't say. Astrology is,
          as yet, more an art than a
          science.

                        May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 65

Walsingham has been idly examining the scientific
instruments. He speaks now as if his question is casual.

                    WALSINGHAM
          Nothing more, Dr Dee? No more
          specific calamities that we can
          guard against?

                    ELIZABETH
          He means, Will I be assassinated?

                    WALSINGHAM
          Queens are mortal.

Dr Dee smiles as he gently contradicts him.

                    DEE
          Elizabeth is mortal. The Queen
          will never die.

                     ELIZABETH
          You see, Francis? This is a
          mystery.
              (to Dee)
          He has no patience with
          mysteries. W

                     ALSINGHAM
          What I don't know, I can't use.

                    DEE
          And yet mysteries have power.
          Have you not learned that?

                    ELIZABETH
          Francis. Leave us for a moment.

Walsingham leaves. Elizabeth turns to Dr Dee. Now for a
short private moment the Queen becomes a woman.

                    ELIZABETH
          And the private life of this
          prince of the female gender, Dr
          Dee? What do the stars foretell
          there? Or is this too a mystery?

                    DEE
          These are matters of state,
          majesty.

                    ELIZABETH
          Do the stars not foretell matters
          of state?

                    DEE
          For such a prediction, I must
          look in a different chart.

                             May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 66

     He means her face. He murmurs to himself as he studies her
     features, reading her character.

                         DEE
               Wonderful... Out of such
               suffering, to have forged such
               strength... You will need all
               your strength in days to come...
               And love... So much love...

     But as he looks, he finds something more that disturbs him.        
                         DEE
               But you doubt yourself, my                               
               child... I've not seen fear in                           
                                                                        
               your face before.

                         ELIZABETH                                      
                                                                        
               Have I reason to fear?

                         DEE                                            
               Something has weakened you...                            
                                                                        
               There is danger, yes... Your
               strength lies in your spirit.                            
               Nothing else matters. There are                          
                                                                        
               hard days coming. You must trust
               the power of your spirit.                                

                                                                        
     Elizabeth is shaken by these words. Dee turns to look out
     once more at the night sky.                                        

                                                                        
                         DEE

               than the shadows of ghosts.

     Elizabeth stands before a long mirror, alone in her
     dressing chamber, illuminated by lamp light.

      and lets it fall to the floor, leaving her naked.

      She gazes at her own naked body in the mirror.

       eston sits at the table, writing by candle light. Burton
      the brewer enters. Reston leaps to his feet, very tense.

                You have it?

      Burton hands him the letter. Reston opens it and reads it
      at speed. Then he hands it to a man we don't see.

                          RESTON
                What do you think? There must be                           
                                                                           
                clear and valid authority.

      He gazes at the unseen man, waiting on his verdict.

                          WILLIAM (O.O.V.)
                No. It won't do.                                           
      Reston nods agreement. He returns to the table and dashes
      off a letter, muttering as he does so.

                          RESTON
                We wait on a direct order.

      Bess lies restlessly asleep. Suddenly she gives a start and
      wakes. She stifles a scream with her hands. On the far side
      of the room, sitting watching her in silence, is
      Walsingham.

                          BESS
                Please! I'm innocent! I've always
                been a loyal servant of the
                Queen. I'd never betray the
                Queen, never -

                          WALSINGHAM
                But you have, my dear. And you
                do. We both know that.

     Bess knows he means her affair with Raleigh. Now she's too
     terrified to speak.

     Walsingham rises.

                            WALSINGHAM
                  Keep me informed, and all will be
                  well. I don't like surprises.

                            DANCING MASTER
                  Jump!

     The dancing master is instructing Bess in the dance called
     La Volta, watched by the Queen, her ladies and courtiers. A
     trio of musicians plays a jaunty tune.

                             ANCING MASTER
                      (to Bess)
                  When I push like this, my lady,
                  give a jump into the air.

                            ELIZABETH
                  Let him throw you round, Bess.
                  You can trust him.

     The dancing master spins Bess round and lifts her up into
     the air. Her feet fly out as she spins. It's a bold, even
     risqué dance, and the onlookers laugh to see it.

                            DANCING MASTER
                  And round - and round - and round
                  - and down!

     He lowers Bess to the ground. She loves it. As the spinning
     begins again, Raleigh enters.

                             LIZABETH

     Raleigh watches Bess dance.

                  You like your ladies to jump at

          No, no. You're the Queen. You are

                    ELIZABETH
          To tell you the truth, Mr
          Raleigh, there are times when I'm
          tired of being always in control.

                      RALEIGH
          Nonsense.

                      ELIZABETH
          What?

          You don't mean a word of it. You
          eat and drink control.

The exercise ends. All clap.

          Bess, you must try a dance with
          Mr Raleigh. He's eager to show us
          his skill.

                    RALEIGH
          No skill at all, majesty. I don't
          know the steps.

                    ELIZABETH
          Oh, it's very simple.

 he goes to Bess to demonstrate, holding her by the waist.

                    ELIZABETH
          You stand like this, with your
          hands firmly clasped here - and
          when she jumps, on the eighth
          step, you swing her round - once,
          twice, three times - and you're
          back to the beginning. What could
          be simpler?

                    DANCING MASTER
          Your majesty knows the dance
          better than I.

                    ELIZABETH
          So come, Mr Raleigh. Take your
          position. I am to be obeyed.

                    RALEIGH

     Raleigh takes his place with Bess.

                          ELIZABETH
               Hold her tight. I don't want her
               dropped.
                   (
                     to the musicians)
               Play!

     The dance begins again. Bess jumps, and Raleigh swings her
     round and round, finding the knack after an awkward start.
     Elizabeth watches, smiling, nodding to the beat. She can
     see the faces of the dancers; and so long as she controls
     the intimacy between them, she's excited by it.

     Walsingham enters and stands by her side, watching.

                         ELIZABETH
                   (low)
               Leave her alone, Walsingham. I
               want both of them left alone.

     Mary's latest letter is now in Reston's hand. Babington and
     Ramsay sit staring at Reston. This time the Jesuit is
     pleased. He reads the letter aloud to the unseen man.

               you to set the gentlemen to
               work.'

                         RESTON(cont'd)
                   (with quiet steely                                   
                    satisfaction)                                       
               I think we have it.

     He hands the letter over. For the first time we see who it
     is: William, now revealed as one of the conspirators.
     William reads the letter for himself.

                         WILLIAM
                   (nodding agreement)

               England ablaze.                                          
     Reston takes out pistols, and hands one to Ramsay, one to          
     Babington.           R

     Walsingham is at work at his desk. A knock on the door.
     Walsingham does not look up from his papers.

     William enters, wrapped in a cloak, one hand concealed.

                         WILLIAM
               It's me. William.

                         WALSINGHAM
                   (still not looking up)
               Where have you been? We haven't
               seen you for days.

                         WILLIAM
               I met up with some old friends.

                         WALSINGHAM
               From Paris, no doubt.

                            WILLIAM
               Yes.

                         WALSINGHAM
               And now you've come back.

     He looks up at last.

                         WALSINGHAM
               Do you know, I can still remember
               the day you were born?

     He smiles, but there's sadness in his eyes.

                                May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 72

                         WALSINGHAM
               I was eleven years old. And you,
               this helpless bundle. I looked at
               you in your crib, with your
               little wrinkled face, and I loved
               you from the first. I vowed then
               to look after you. I watched you                          
               grow up with your head in the                             
               clouds, always a dreamer. I                               
               couldn't follow you there. And                            
               now I've failed you, haven't I?                           
               Forgive me if I haven't loved you
               enough.

     Clink. Something falls from William's hand to the floor.
     His face has gone grey.

                         WALSINGHAM
               Did you really think I didn't
               know?

     On the floor - a dagger.

     William opens his mouth to answer, but no sound comes out.
     Walsingham raps twice on his desk. The door opens, and
     Agents 4 and 5 enter.

                         WALSINGHAM
               Was it for money? At least tell
               me you got a good price.
     W
      illiam shakes his head.

                         WALSINGHAM
               What then? What would you murder
               your own brother for?

                         WILLIAM
                   (whisper)
               Eternal life.

     Walsingham stares at him. A great sadness building.

                         WALSINGHAM
               Eternal life. The bribe no man
               can refuse.

     CLOSE ON Elizabeth, surrounded by courtiers and bodyguards,
     as she processes from the Presence Chamber to the Chapel
     Royal. As before, the way is lined with eager supplicants.

                                May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 73

     CLOSE ON Babington and Ramsay, forcing their way through
     the crowd to the front line.

     Elizabeth disappears from view into the Chapel.

                         ROYAL SERVANT
               The Queen is at her prayers!
     T
      he chapel doors begin to close.

                            BABINGTON
               Now!

     Ramsay hurls himself forward, shouting -

                         RAMSAY
               God for Mary! England's true
               Queen!

     The guards run to seize him, opening up a momentary space -

     Babington sprints through it for the closing chapel doors -

75                                                                 75
     Babington bursts into the chapel, sees a line of ladies
     kneeling, masking the figure in front of the altar - he
     pulls out a pistol -

                            BABINGTON
               Elizabeth!

     Elizabeth turns and rises to confront the assassin's gun.
     Babington stares at her, hypnotised by her fearlessness.
     Then he pulls the trigger.

     Bang!

     Elizabeth still stares at him. She's unhurt.

     Babington lets out a cry of anguish, and crumples to the
     ground. Elizabeth stares on into space, frozen by the
     moment, magnificent.


     INT. MARY STUART'S QUARTERS, CHARTLEY HALL - DAY

     Mary paces impatiently in her room, trailed by her little
     dog. She hears the sound of bells. Joy floods her features.

     Pounding feet. She turns to see Sir Amyas Paulet hurrying
     towards her, through a gate in the wall.

                         MARY
               You bring news?

                             May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 74

                    PAULET
          The Queen has been attacked -

                      MARY
          Yes?

                    PAULET
          The assassin seized -

                      MARY
          Yes?

                    PAULET
          The Queen unharmed -

                      MARY
          Unharmed?

                    PAULET
          And you, ma'am, are under arrest.

He has led up to this deliberately, and now stands smiling
at her utter confusion. The man who looked like a fool has
been playing his own game all along.

                    MARY
          Me? What has any of this to do
          with me?

Paulet makes a sign. Burton the brewer comes through the
gate: Walsingham's man after all.
                     P
                     AULET
          That's the trouble with intrigue,
          isn't it? With so many secrets,
          you can never quite tell who's on
          who's side, until the game ends.

He takes the hollow bung out of one pocket and admires it.

                    PAULET
          My own invention. Theatrical, but
          effective. My master has every
          letter you've written.

                    MARY
          Your master?

                    PAULET
          Walsingham.

Now she knows it's over. She begins to weep.

                    MARY
          Traitors. I'm surrounded by
          traitors. Who am I to trust?                           

                             May 1 Blue Draft 28 June - p. 75

     She picks up her little dog, weeping bitterly.

                         MARY
               Only my little one...

     Walsingham has a lamp in his hand. He moves slowly along a
     passage, bowed down by a sense of failure.

     He directs the light of his lamp through cell bars onto a
     face. The Jesuit. Reston looks back, unafraid.

                         WALSINGHAM
               Ready to die, I see, Jesuit.

                         RESTON
               I have done what I was sent to
               do.

                         WALSINGHAM
               Why was the gun not loaded?

     Reston doesn't answer. Walsingham gazes at him a moment
     longer. Then he moves the lamp along. There, shackled and
     white-faced, sit Babington and Ramsay. Walsingham studies
     their faces.

     Walsingham carries his lamp down the passage and shines it
     into the next cell. Here lies a man in chains, huddled on
     the floor. He looks up as the light falls on him. William.

     Walsingham looks down on the pitiful sight.
                          W
                          ALSINGHAM
               What was the Jesuit sent to do?

                         WILLIAM
               To kill the Queen. You know it.
               You know everything.

                         WALSINGHAM
               Not quite everything.

                         WILLIAM
               I've told you all I know. Go
               ahead and kill me. Take what's
               left of me. I don't care any
               more. All my life you've had
               everything and I've had nothing.
               So finish it. There's a better
               world waiting for me. We'll all
               be judged in the end, brother.
               Even you.

     Walsingham gazes down on this pitiful show of pride.

                                  orchid revision 28 June -p. 76

                         WALSINGHAM
               You're no martyr. You weren't
               even much of a murderer. Go back
               to France. Back to your dreams.                           
               Never let me hear of you again.

     Walsingham turns away. As he goes we see what he won't show
     William: that the hurt of the betrayal is almost more than
     he can bear.

     He goes back up the passage. As he passes Reston, the
     Jesuit calls out softly.

                         RESTON
               Send me home.

     Elizabeth sits deep in thought, Bess by her side. Shadows
     all round.

                         ELIZABETH
               They say she's taller than me.
               Her hair is chestnut in colour.                         
               Her eyes are hazel. They say                            
               she's beautiful. But people lie.                        
               They say I am beautiful.                                
     A dismissive shrug. Clearly she does not think herself            
     beautiful.                                                        
                         BESS                                          
               She plotted to kill you.                                
                         ELIZABETH                                     
               Yes, it's true. I've read her                           
               letters. I too was a prisoner                           
                                                                       
               once. I've feared for my life.
               I've done terrible things - just                        
               to live.

               protests her innocence, and that
               is a lie. Why will she not admit                        
               she has wronged me?                                     
                         BESS                                          
               She'll go on lying til you cut                          
                                                                       
               out her traitor's heart.

     Elizabeth stares at her in surprise.

                         MARY
               Who are you to sit in judgement                        
               on me? By what authority do you                        
               condemn a Queen? God alone has                         
               made me what I am. He is my only                       
               judge. Raise your law above God's                      
               law, and what law remains? In                          
               your vanity and ignorance you set                      
               loose the monster of misrule. You                      
               know neither who you are nor what                      
               you do. But I know who I am. I                         
               die as I have lived - trusting in                      
               the mercy of my God - a Queen.

     Elizabeth raging at Walsingham.

                         ELIZABETH
               Must die? Mary Stuart must die?                        
               Where is it written? Who dares to                      
                                                                      
               give orders to the Queen?

                          ALSINGHAM
               Majesty, this is no time for
               mercy -

                         ELIZABETH
               Don't preach at me, old man. Look
               at you! You can hardly stand. Go
               home to your wife. Go home to
               your bed.

                         WALSINGHAM
               The law must have its way.

                                  orchid revisions 28 june - p.78

                         ELIZABETH
               The law is for common men, not
               for princes.

     Walsingham sees there's no point in persisting. He bows and          
     withdraws.

     Raleigh comes hurrying towards the Queen's quarters. Bess
     sees him approaching and comes out to meet him. They speak
     low, not wanting the ever-present guards to hear them.

                         BESS
               Thank God you've come. I've never
               seen her so distressed. She's
               been alone in her rooms since
               morning. She'll see no one.

                         RALEIGH
               Has she asked for me?

                         BESS
               No. But she needs you. I know she
               does.

     Raleigh takes Bess's B
                          hand in his, discreetly.

                            ESS
               Go to her.

     Elizabeth sits alone, deep in thought.

     Raleigh enters, and comes before her. She doesn't look
     round, but she knows it's him.

                            RALEIGH
               My Queen.

                            ELIZABETH
               My friend.

     Still she doesn't turn to him.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)                              
               Did Bess bid you come? Have you                           
                                                                         
               too come to tell me I must murder
               a Queen?                                                  
                         RALEIGH
               No. You don't need me to instruct
               you in your duty.

                                                                         
                         ELIZABETH
               My duty? Was it my father's duty                          
               to murder my mother? I would be                           
                                                                         
               loath to die so bloody a death.

                         RALEIGH
               Since when were you so afraid?

     Now she looks at him.

                         ELIZABETH
               Yes, I am afraid. I am always
               afraid.

     Raleigh looks back at her in silence for a long moment.
     Then -

                         RALEIGH
               You fear your soul will be
               touched. Royalty is close to
               immortality. Kill a Queen - and
               queens are mortal.

                         ELIZABETH
               You understand me well.

                         RALEIGH
               We mortals have many weaknesses.
               We feel too much. Hurt too much.
               And all too soon, we die. But we
               do have the chance of love.

     Elizabeth closes her eyes.

                         ELIZABETH
               Do we? Do we really?

     She nods, her eyes still closed.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
               I owe England my life. Don't ask                       
               for my soul.

               Your face tells me. It's decided.

                         PAULET
               Tomorrow morning. At eight.

     Annette, her maid, bursts into wailing sobs. Mary herself
     goes very still. She's starting to carry out her final
     strategy.

                         MARY
               Please don't cry.

     The great timbered hall of the castle has been specially
     prepared for the execution. A stage has been constructed in
     the centre, and around the stage are chairs upon which
     DIGNITARIES and MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT are already sitting.

     The block dominates the stage. Beside it, the hooded
     EXECUTIONER with his axe. The DEAN OF PETERBOROUGH in his
     clerical robes.
     T
      here are more chairs in the body of the hall, occupied by
     members of the public. They are all waiting for the
     performance to begin.

     Mary enters.

      he people crane their necks to see her. She doesn't
     disappoint. She is wearing a black velvet gown, her
     luxurious auburn hair tied in a bunch. Her LADIES,
     following her in procession, show signs of weeping and
     distress, but Mary herself glides to the platform with a
     regal bearing.

      n her face there is a look that is almost ecstatic.

               I forgive you with all my heart,
               for now, I hope, you will make an
               end of all my troubles.

     She stands, smiling still, and holds out her arms to let
     her ladies disrobe her.

      ow deeply distressed, Elizabeth suddenly bursts out of the
     Privy Chamber into the great Presence Chamber, tears
     welling into her eyes. Bess close behind her.

     She hardly notices the people around her, until she sees
     Raleigh.

                         ELIZABETH
               I want it stopped!

     INT. GREAT HALL, FOTHERINGAY CASTLE - DAY

     Mary's black dress falls to the ground, revealing
     underneath a petticoat of dark red silk - the colour of
     martyrdom. There is a collective gasp from the spectators.

     Elizabeth is hysterical, shouting in Raleigh's restraining
     arms.

                         ELIZABETH
               No! It must be stopped!

     She stretches out her arms as a signal. The axe comes down.

     Elizabeth cries out, as if the axe has fallen on her neck.
     Then she sinks sobbing to the ground, supported by both
     Raleigh and Bess; and for a moment, the three are united in
     a single embrace.

     ON THE FACES of the awed spectators. We see, FOREGROUND,
     the scarlet-clad torso of the executed Mary. A gasp of
     horror from the spectators. The dead woman's skirts are
     moving.

     Out from under her skirts creeps her little dog. The dog
     looks round, not understanding, and whimpers softly.

     Annette takes the dog into her arms.

     out the one Spanish word: `War! War! War!'.

     the Infanta by the hand. He comes to a stop before his
     assembled ministers. His eyes shine.

               How have you failed me? What am I
               to forgive you for?

                         WALSINGHAM
               Philip of Spain is a God-fearing
               man. He cannot make war without
               just cause. He sent the Jesuit to
               kill a Queen. But not you.

                         ELIZABETH
               Not me!

                         WALSINGHAM
               The Jesuit's mission was to draw
               Mary Stuart into the murder plot.
               He knew I was reading her every
               letter. He waited until she wrote
               the words that sealed her guilt.

     Now Elizabeth gets it.

                         ELIZABETH
                   (slowly)
               And I ordered her execution. I
               murdered God's anointed Queen.
               And now God's most dutiful son
               makes holy war to punish me.

                         WALSINGHAM
               Forgive me, majesty. Let me go.

                                                                        
     Elizabeth hardly hears him any more. She realises the end
     game is upon her.                                                  
                         ELIZABETH
               Yes... Go...                                             

                                                                        
     Walsingham leaves. Elizabeth never even looks at him. She's
     looking into the distance, preparing herself for what must         
     now come.                                                          

     INT. LISBON CATHEDRAL - DAY

     The great Standard of the Armada, bearing the image of the
     Virgin, is carried into the cathedral.

     Philip follows, leading a column of Spain's noblest
     GRANDEES and PRINCES of the church.

     The ARCHBISHOP sprinkles holy water onto the Standard, and
     makes the sign of the Cross over it.

                         ARCHBISHOP
               Exurge, domine et vindica causam
               tuam. Amen.

     Philip kneels to kiss the blessed Standard - which is then
     thrust aloft again, into the vast spaces of the Cathedral.

     And at once there is a great outpouring of emotion, the
     congregation applauding, many weeping at the sight.

     INT. QUEEN'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - NIGHT

     Elizabeth is alone, pacing slowly, reading a book - the
     Consolation of Philosophy, by Boethius. She reads, pauses,
     looks into the far distance; then reads and walks again.

                         ELIZABETH (V.O.)
               `Think you that there is any
               certainty in the affairs of
               mankind, when you know that one
               swift hour can destroy the
               greatest among us?'

     She turns, and there is Raleigh. She holds up her book.

                           ELIZABETH
               Boethius.

                         RALEIGH
               The Consolation of Philosophy.

                         ELIZABETH
               Thank you for coming at this late
               hour.

     She closes her book and puts it away.

                         ELIZABETH
               We're at war. Who knows when
               we'll meet again. If we'll meet
               again.

                         RALEIGH
               May the Lord God preserve
               England's Queen.

                         ELIZABETH
               The same God in whose name Philip
               wages his holy war. Philip is a
               righteous man, and righteous men
               love to destroy. They burn whole
               worlds to make them pure, and
               leave behind - ashes.

                         RALEIGH
               He'll not burn England.

                         ELIZABETH
               He may. His Armada is invincible,
               they say. If London falls, I                             
               fall. If England is lost, I am                           
               lost.                                                    

                         may 1 blue draft 28 June - p. 85

                     RALEIGH
          Never!

                    ELIZABETH
          Never? It's night. My thoughts
          turn dark. Don't you ever think
          that one day, perhaps one day
          soon, you too will die?

                    RALEIGH
          The closer I come to death, the
          more I want to live. The hungrier
          I am for life.

His defiant energy breaks Elizabeth's morbid mood.
                     E
                     LIZABETH
          You're right. We must live while
          we can.

                    RALEIGH
          Why be afraid of tomorrow?
          Today's all we have, and all we
          know.

                    ELIZABETH
          Today. Tonight.

                     RALEIGH
          Now.

They hold each other's eyes.

                     ELIZABETH
          I wish -

But she can't say it.

                    RALEIGH
          I've never known a woman like
          you.

                    ELIZABETH
          In some other time, in some other
          world, could you have loved me?

                    RALEIGH
          I know only one world. In this
          world, I have loved you.

Elizabeth smiles a small smile.

                    ELIZABETH
          Then there's... something you                      
          could do for me - something I've
          not known for a very long time -
          if you felt so inclined -

                              may 1 blue draft 28 June - p. 86

      Raleigh intuits what she wants. He comes closer as she
      speaks.              E
                           LIZABETH
                Something not to be spoken of
                afterwards - to be forgotten -
                but just for now -

      She lifts her head to his. She meets his eyes.

                          ELIZABETH
                A kiss?

      He takes her in his arms, and they kiss. One kiss to hold
      all that might have been, all that they both know can never
      be.

      When at last they part she turns away from him, head bowed,
      eyes still closed, holding on to the sweet moment.

      CLOSE IMAGES as the Armada standard is carried in
      procession to the flagship, and hoisted into position on
      the ship's towering prow. Cannons fire a booming salute.

      As the standard billows in the breeze, beyond it we see the
      forest of masts that make up the great Armada.

      INT. ANTECHAMBER, WHITEHALL PALACE - DAY

      The palace is galvanised by the invasion threat. Armed men
      go by at the double, passing servants hauling out trolleys
      bearing valuables, as the court prepares for the worst.

                                                                         
      Raleigh and Howard stride fast across the Guard Chamber,
      the first of the sequence of great rooms. They are deep in         
      war talk.                                                          
      Bess appears ahead, and beckons him to a secluded corner.
                           R
                           ALEIGH
                Bess, I've been ordered to my
                ship -

      Bess stops his mouth with one finger.

                          BESS
                I'll be quick. I have something
                to tell you. But I ask for
                nothing. Is that understood? Your
                life is your own. Nothing will
                change.

                    RALEIGH
          What is this, Bess?

Two court officials hurry by. Bess lowers her voice.

                    BESS
          I'm -

Her hand touches her waist.

                    RALEIGH
          You're pregnant?

                    BESS
          No one knows. My plans are made.
          I shall ask the Queen for
          permission to leave court. I
          shall live quietly in the country
          with - with my child. The Queen
          must know nothing.

Raleigh stares at her, stunned. More people are passing.
This is no place for R
                     displays of strong feeling.

                     ALEIGH
          Where will you go?

                    BESS
          To my mother's house.

                    RALEIGH
                                                               
          You can't go!

                    BESS
          I'm a ward of the Queen. I can't
          court a man without her
          permission. I can't marry without
          her permission. As for having a
          child -

Another official passes by.

                    RALEIGH
          When were you planning to leave?                     
                    BESS
          As soon as I'm allowed.

Raleigh finds himself caught in an impossible situation.
His internal struggle shows itself in the twists and jerks
of his body.

                    RALEIGH
          Am I not to see you again? What's
          to become of the child? Bess -

                          BESS
                Hush! We've no choice. You know
                it as well as I do.

                           RALEIGH
                All I know is nothing's as it
                should be.

                          BESS
                Please listen. You once said to
                me, `Whatever I have to give, ask
                and it's yours.' Do you remember?

                          RALEIGH
                Of course I remember.

                          BESS
                I ask that you forget me. Go to
                your ship. Do your duty. Forget
                me.
      R
       aleigh gazes at her, deeply moved.

                          RALEIGH
                Oh, Bess...

      The Queen's ladies come hurrying by. Margaret calls to Bess
      as they go.

                          MARGARET
                Bess! We're summoned.

                            ESS
                I'm coming.
                    (to Raleigh)
                Goodbye.

      She runs after the ladies.

      Raleigh walks slowly after them down the hall. On his face
      a new look forms. He knows now what he's going to do.

      Her servants hurry in, and open the window.

      Elizabeth goes to the open window and breathes in deeply.
      She looks up at the moon.

                This Spanish Armada is at sea
                carrying an army of ten thousand
                men.

                thousand, majesty.

                If the Spanish fleet reaches
                Calais in strength, the combined
                armies will be beyond our power
                to resist.

                Therefore, the Spanish fleet must                         
                not reach Calais.

                           HOWARD
                Majesty, this vast Armada will                            
                surely smash through our naval                            
                defences. We must be prepared for                         
                the worst.

       lizabeth walks briskly through the great public rooms back
      to her quarters, with Walsingham by her side and her

                How did you know about the
                numbers of the Dutch barges,
                majesty? I don't recall supplying
                you with that information.

                          ELIZABETH
                You may observe, Walsingham, that
                I don't see my way with only one
                eye. Nor do I hop along on only
                one leg. Why then would I rely on
                only one source of information?

      She sweeps into her quarters. Her ladies, waiting there,
      jump up in haste. She scans them.

                           LIZABETH
                Where's Bess?

      Her eyes coem to rest on Margaret. She sees that Margaret            
      knows something.

      We are on the very tip of England.

      A watch-tower has been built, and next to it a large beacon
      of wood. A YOUNG MAN is minding the watch.

      He stares out to sea, catching sight of something. Over the
      rim of the world has appeared the long line of the Spanish
      fleet, like a floating wall, black and menacing.
      H
       e runs down the steps from the tower. He lights a bundle
      of sticks and thrusts them again and again into the beacon.

      The beacon catches fire. As the flames rise into the sky,
      so a second beacon erupts into flame on the next headland.
      And then a third on the next, a fourth on the next, a
      fifth, disappearing around the coastline.

      Doors burst open and Elizabeth comes storming out, barely            
      containing a powerful rage.

      Bess comes running from the far end.

                    BESS
          Here, my lady!

                    ELIZABETH                                  
          Tell me! Is it true? Are you                         
          married? Are you with child? Are                     
          you WITH CHILD?                                      
Bess stands before her with her head bowed.                    
                    BESS                                       
          Yes, my lady.                                        
Elizabeth falls on her with uncontrolled rage, striking out    
at her, beating her about the head, shrieking out the words    
                                                               
that so inflame and wound her. Bess takes the blows in
silence.

          You traitress! You dare to have                      
          secrets from me! I am your Queen!                    
          You ask my permission before you
          rut - before you marry - before
          you breed! My bitches wear my
          collars! Do you hear me? How dare
          you be with child!

Walsingham comes hobbling up.

                    WALSINGHAM
          Majesty, please! Dignity - mercy -

But Elizabeth is too far gone. She turns on him, eyes
blazing.

                    ELIZABETH
          This is no time for mercy! That's
          what you said to me. I don't
          forget. But you showed mercy,
          Walsingham! Go to your traitor
          brother, and leave me to my
          business!
W
 alsingham turns white. Elizabeth is back berating Bess.

                    ELIZABETH
          Is it his child? Tell me! Say it!
          Is the child his? Tell me! Say
          it! Is it his?

Bess responds to the Queen's hysteria with dignity.

                    BESS
          Yes, my lady. It is - my
          husband's child.

Her gaze reaches beyond the Queen. Elizabeth turns.

       Raleigh has come up to them unnoticed. He has seen and
       heard all. He speaks to Elizabeth quietly, sadly.

                 This is not the Queen I love and
                 serve.

       Elizabeth stares at him. He meets her eyes. His gaze is so
       unflinching that slowly the madness drains out of her. When
       she speaks next, she is her proud self again.

                           ELIZABETH
                 This gentleman has seduced a lady                        
                 under my care. This lady has                             
                 married without my consent. These
                 are offences punishable by law.

       releasing the tension that has swelled to bursting point
       within her.

                           ELIZABETH
                 The fall of an empire, you told
                 me. Did you mean the English
                 empire? Because by God, England
                 will not fall while I am Queen!

                 I will not be a toy of the fates!
                 Have I not faced an assassin's
                 bullet and lived?

       She turns to Dr Dee and sees his quizzical gaze on her, and
       she lets her rage pass.

                 Just tell me there's no
                 certainty. The shadows of ghosts,
                 you said. Any outcome is
                 possible. Give me hope.

                           DEE
                 The forces that shape the world
                 are greater than all of us,
                 majesty. How can I promise you
                 that they'll conspire in your
                 favour, even though you are the
                 Queen? But this much I know. When
                 the storm breaks, each man acts
                 in accordance with his own
                 nature. Some are dumb with
                 terror. Some flee. Some hide. And
                 some spread their wings like
                 eagles and soar on the wind.

       Elizabeth understands. She draws herself up, finding now
       the self-belief she needs for the battle to come.

                           ELIZABETH
                 You're a wise man, Dr Dee.

                           DEE

      INTO FRAME sweeps a SPANISH ENSIGN, streaming from a mast.

      now that they seem to have been planted already on
      England's white cliffs.

                The bells are to ring in every
                church in the land.

      Hatton bows to show he has received the order.                     
                           ELIZABETH
                Labourers are to leave the fields
                and take up arms. The harvest
                must wait.

      Hatton bows and leaves. Elizabeth continues up the nave,            
      now followed only by Walsingham. She turns to him with              
      another order.                                                      
                          ELIZABETH
                Release all prisoners. England is
                their country too.

      She moves forward again. Walsingham follows, waiting,               
      knowing there's more. Elizabeth turns to him one last time.         
                          ELIZABETH
                Release Raleigh. He is
                forgiven... As I too pray to be
                forgiven...

      Walsingham leaves. Elizabeth goes forward to stand before           
      the altar alone.                                                    
                          ELIZABETH
                Leave me. All of you.

      The remainder of her entourage bow and withdraw. Elizabeth
      goes on down the nave to the altar, and there, at the foot
      of the steps, sinks to her knees. She does not bow her
      head.

      ON ELIZABETH - Alone in the great space, staring at her God
      P

      Lord Howard bent over a mass of charts with his commanders
      round him: HAWKINS, DRAKE, FROBISHER and Raleigh. The boom
      of Spanish cannon shakes the air. Flashes of fire light the
      faces of the English officers.

                          DRAKE                                         
                We must attack! What choice do we
                have?

                We're decisively outgunned,
                Drake. We are losing too many                           
                                                                        
                ships. We must defend the coast.

                    (studying the chart of

                There has to be a way of getting

      A low distant beat as we TRACK THROUGH the English camp.
      The soldiers are a citizen army, no hardened professionals.
      We pass a troop busy sharpening their pikes; an older

      rubbing down a horse.

      Now they hear the distant beat approaching. One by one they
      look up, surprised, uncertain.

      Now they hear it loud and clear: the beat of an army on the

       From inside a cave looking out to sea, a scene of
       devastation. Dead Spanish sailors have been washed up
       amongst planks, barrels and a torn Spanish ensign.

       A long scream of pain -

       CLOSE ON BESS - Screaming in pain. A final spasm passes
       through her. She sinks back.

       The cry of a new-born child. She hears, and her exhausted
       face lights up with a radiant smile.

       Walsingham lies in bed, his eyes closed. His wife Ursula
       and daughter Mary in the background. He's dying.
       E
        lizabeth has come to him. She looks down on him with deep
       concern.

                           ELIZABETH
                 Francis. My old friend.

       An anonymous man - Agent 3 - walks down a shabby Paris
       street. Stops before a small anonymous house. Knocks.


       INT. PARIS HOUSE - DAY
159                                                                159
       The anonymous man is let into the house by a figure we
       don't yet see. He looks round the room. A fire burning in
       the grate. English books on the table. A half-eaten meal.

                           AGENT 3
                 I come from your brother.

       Now we see who he speaks to: William.

                                      May 1 Blue Draft - p.106

                          WILLIAM
                What does he want?

                          AGENT 3
                He asks your forgiveness.

                          WILLIAM
                My forgiveness?

      On William: he stares. Then he understands. Fear brings
      sudden tears to his eyes.

      A gasp. Walsingham's man has plunged a knife into his
      heart.

      Walsingham speaks to his Queen with difficulty.

                          WALSINGHAM
                I have served your majesty - in
                all things...

                          ELIZABETH
                I know it, old friend. Don't
                leave me now.

      Walsingham's eyes open. A weak smile.

                          WALSINGHAM
                Y
                 ou don't need me any more.
                Permission - to go -

      Elizabeth looks tenderly down on him, shaking her head.

                          ELIZABETH
                You always did do as you pleased,
                whether I wanted it or not. I've
                no doubt you'll do as you please
                now.

      He lets his eyes close. She stoops down and kisses his
      cheek.


      INT. RALEIGH'S HOUSE - DAY
161                                                              161
      We see Raleigh from behind. He's holding something, and
      dancing slowly about, and crooning a low song, in the
      oddest way.

      Beyond him, half-glimpsed, an inner room, where Bess is
      resting on a bed.

                       R




                             107

Now in his solitary dance Raleigh turns, and we see he's
holding a new-born BABY BOY. He kisses the baby's little
bald head, and sings his wordless song.

Footsteps outside. The door opens, and a royal servant
enters, followed by other servants and guards.

                     OYAL SERVANT
          Her majesty the Queen!

Elizabeth enters, in formal style. She stands and takes in
the scene - Raleigh holding his baby son - the room beyond -
Bess rises at once and comes through to make her curtsey to     
the Queen. Elizabeth seems not to see her.                      
A regal wave at the servants and guards. They withdraw.

Elizabeth stalks round the room. No reason to suppose her
displeasure has passed.

                    ELIZABETH
          When was the birth?

                    RALEIGH
          F
           our nights ago.

                    ELIZABETH
          The mother is well?

                       RALEIGH
          Thank God.

Now Elizabeth turns to Bess, and their eyes meet. The Queen     
puts out her hand and touches Bess lightly on one cheek. A      
                                                                
silent forgiveness.

                    ELIZABETH
          And the child?

                    RALEIGH
          My son is well.

Now for the first time she looks at the baby.

                    ELIZABETH
          Your Elizabeth has a child. You                       
          must be proud.

                       RALEIGH
          Yes.

Elizabeth moves away, unable to bear seeing the baby.

                       E




                       E




                       R




                             108

                       ELIZABETH
             And fulfilled?                                    
                       RALEIGH                                 
             As any man can be.                                
Elizabeth looks at him in silence for a long moment.           
                       ELIZABETH
             And do you still dream of your
             shining city, your New World?                     
                        ALEIGH
             More than ever.                                   
She turns to go. But before she reaches the door, she
stops.

                        LIZABETH
             I'd like to give your son my
             blessing.

                       RALEIGH
             I would be honoured.

Elizabeth takes the baby in her arms. She holds him
carefully. She finds herself more moved than she had
expected. She bends her head over him, and turns her back
on Raleigh.

Raleigh watches and waits. And waits.

ON ELIZABETH: her cheek pressed to the baby's head. Her
eyes closed.

                        LIZABETH (V.O.)
             I am called the Virgin Queen. And
                                                               
             yet I have many children... You
             are all my children. There is no                  
             jewel, be it never so rich a                      
             prize, which I put before this                    
             jewel: I mean, your love. I want                  
             no more wars. England is enough                   
             for me. I want no lordship over                   
             your souls. Only a free people                    
             can love.                                         
                 (Beat)                                        
             And in your love - is my life.                    
END TITLES
