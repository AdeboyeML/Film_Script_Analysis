          INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON a pair of hands from VARIOUS ANGLES...
          The SOUNDS of the fighting grow LOUDER. Punches, kicks, elbows...
          The hands tense into fists. They're strong hands. Fighter's hands.

          ZOOM OUT TO REVEAL Julian (mid-thirties) staring at his hands.

          Even though he's kept in shape, he hasn't fought for a long time.
          The SOUND of the boxing match gets LOUDER STILL as Julian continues
          staring at his hands - it's almost as if he's meditating. Suddenly
          he breaths in.

          Behind him sits a young kid dressed in Thai boxing clothes - this
          is Liang, barely sixteen. He looks nervous, occasionally glancing
          at Julian's reflection through the huge mirror that hangs on the
          far wall.

          Julian continues to stare at his hands and closes them into a
          tight fist.

          INT. CORRIDORS - NIGHT

          The SOUNDS of the boxing match reach FEVER PITCH as we TRACK WITH
          Julian and Liang making their way towards the ring.

          INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT

          Two Young Thai Boxers beat the crap out of each other.
          The crowd is wild with excitement, people placing bets on which
          way the fight will turn.

          One of the Thai Boxers goes down and money immediately starts
          changing hands...

          The ring is cleared and Liang jumps in as Julian pushes his way
          though the crowd, nodding at people as he passes. They know him
          here.

          Again bets are placed....

          PICK OUT a face in the crowd. Billy. Julian's older brother (late
          thirties).

          Julian sits down next to Billy who's delighted to see him, throwing
          his arm around him, pulling him in close.

                          BILLY
           ... I love violence!

          Billy offers Julian a hit from his bottle of Mehkong whiskey.
          Julian refuses. He's more interested in the fight.

          BACK TO THE RING where the fight has just started. Liang is
          immediately on the ropes.

          Julian watches, concerned.

          Billy takes a phone call but he can't hear. He nods to Julian
          and takes it outside.

          BACK TO THE FIGHT where Liang pulls an amazing move. Turns the
          tables. Takes the bigger man down with a series of jabs, swings
          and backfists.

          As Julian applauds Liang's success, Billy slinks off out of the
          auditorium.

          Liang wins the fight with a knock out... The crowd go wild with
          adulation...

          Julian watches, transfixed...

          Liang is lit up by a beatific white light... As he stands triumphant
          in the middle of the ring, the crowd start to gather round him...
          Julian continues to stare at what's taking place before him...

          ... Which is almost like a religious ceremony... The audience
          bow down before Liang as he stares out into the light... A look
          of calm washing over his face... A sense of stillness and peace...
          Enlightenment through victory and violence...

          Liang is sitting on a bench, his constantly-smiling Mother beside
          him, as Julian peels off fifty Bhat notes.
          We get the sense that Julian's proud of him, that Liang is something
          of a protege of his and that Liang is incredibly pleased to have
          gained his approval.

                          JULIAN
           Two fifty, three hundred...

          Liang takes the money. Julian pulls off two more notes. A bonus.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           You did well out there. You've got
           something, Liang. Potential, yeah?

          Liang nods.

          Billy comes down a back ally and knocks on a door. After a moment
          the door opens.

          The Doorman recognises him and lets him enter.

          WE TRACK with Billy as he makes his way through the small
          subterranean nightclub.
          A Thai man - known as The Lizard - sits by a table with a few
          locals gambling...
          He spots Billy and follows him with his eyes as he continues to
          gamble.
          Billy moves across to a small private corner...
          ... where he meets various men and women, all smoking
          Methamphetamine. Billy joins in but an argument quickly starts
          up between him and another Thai Man.
          The music's too loud to hear what they're arguing about but it
          suddenly gets out of control... Billy starts viciously hitting
          the Thai Man and quickly the room EXPLODES in a frenzy of violence.

          INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

          A fan does what it can to cool Julian down as he counts out money
          at his desk. Sitting opposite him, feet on the table, is Gordon,
          Julian's lieutenant and the closest thing to a friend he's got...
          Julian's phone rings. He interrupts his counting. Picks up and
          listens...

                          JULIAN

           (ON THE PHONE)
           Hold on, hold on. What did he say?
          Beat as Julian listens. He glances over at Gordon who looks up,
          concerned.

           (ON THE PHONE)

          The Lizard sits outside the nightclub, somehow managing to smoke
          a cigarette at the same time as he stems the flow of blood from
          his nose with a handkerchief.
          Julian and Gordon arrive.

                          JULIAN
           He still in there?

                          THE LIZARD
           ... No.
          Beat... Julian glances at Gordon.

                          JULIAN
           You told him I was coming...

                          THE LIZARD
           Wouldn't listen...
          Julian stares at him...

                          JULIAN
           Well maybe you didn't try hard enough.
          The Lizard takes the handkerchief away from his nose. Shows the
          bloodstain to Julian.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           When was the last time you slept?
          The Lizard smiles but stares at Julian with hatred in his eyes.

                          THE LIZARD
           Just cause I ain't slept for three days,
           don't mean I don't know right from
           wrong... and your brother has become
           a real problem...
          Again Julian stares at him - clenching his fist. The Lizard notices
          this but gazes up into Julian's face blankly.

           THE LIZARD (CONT'D)
           You're not going to cause another
           ruckus in my club now - are you?
          A long pause as Julian considers it.

                          JULIAN
           No.

                          THE LIZARD
           Good - 'cause Billy ripped me off and
           then he broke my face...
          Julian turns to Gordon.

                          GORDON
           Like I always said. One day he's going
           to meet the devil.
          Beat.

                          JULIAN
           You know where he is now?
          The Lizard stares at Julian.

                          THE LIZARD
           Bangkok has millions of people my
           friend. You and your brother, you're
           lost to my world...
          The Lizard gets up - puts out his cigarette and looks at Julian...

           THE LIZARD (CONT'D)
           So what you going to do? You wanna come
           in? Very good amphetamine in here...
          Julian looks over to Gordon. Sees he's keen.

                          JULIAN
           You go. I'm gonna look around. See if
           I can find him.

                          GORDON
           Sure--?

                          JULIAN
           Go on.
          He turns back to The Lizard.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Which way'd he go?
          The Lizard nods his head towards the busy street. Julian turns
          and heads off... Gordon steps up to the entrance to the club.
          The Lizard sticks out an arm, blocking his way.

                          THE LIZARD
           His brother didn't pay.

                          GORDON
           So? That's his problem.

                          THE LIZARD
           Now it's your problem.

                          GORDON
           I'm with you mate. Billy's fucked--

                          THE LIZARD
           You don't pay his debt - you don't enter.
          Gordon thinks for beat. Takes out his money...

                          GORDON
           How much...?
          ...and The Lizard smiles for the first time.

          INT. MA LONG'S BROTHEL - NIGHT

          Julian is talking to Ma Long, fifties, the mother figure to a
          group of girls who stand in the background.

                          JULIAN
           You seen Billy?

                          MA LONG
           Not this evening.
          A particularly pretty prostitute catches Juilan's eye. He stares
          at her, stone faced.

                          JULIAN
           Well if he comes in, tell him I'm looking
           for him, yeah?

                          MA LONG
           He's not coming in. I tell him to stay
           away. He hurt one of my girls Julian.
           Not good...
          Julian considers. Pulls out his wad of notes again. Hands a few
          to Ma Long.

                          JULIAN
           Yeah, well... if you see him, tell him
           I'm looking for him...
          Ma Long nods as she takes the money.
          Julian is about to leave. He looks at the pretty prostitute again.
          Stares at her for a moment. Then walks out.

          PICK OUT one particularly young-looking girl. Just fifteen.

          and they bow as he joins them - like he's a God. One of the group,
          Kim Han Ho, gestures towards the door of Room 610 where TWO COPS
          stand guard. Chang gives a nod and the door is opened.

          he moves into the light in CLOSE UP. His face is a mask.
          The bed is drenched in blood. The fifteen year old prostitute
          lies naked on her back. She's dead, her body having been savagely
          beaten in some sort of brutal sex game gone wrong.
          Billy is slumped in the corner in his underpants, his eyes glazed,
          staring at MTV, a bottle of Mehkong whiskey in his hand, a crack
          pipe on the floor.

          A long moment between them as Choi Yan Lee fails to understand

          we hear the cries of Billy being beaten to death.
          ANGLE ON: Daeng who's starting to look scared. Phaiban puts a
          reassuring hand on his shoulder.
          As the beating reaches its climax, with Choi Yan Lee screaming
          out Thai obscenities, we hear the sickening sound of Billy's neck
          snapping. And then a regular thud as blow after blow rain down
          on his body.

          No answer. Finally Julian gets up and wraps a towel around his
          body and slowly opens the door.
          Gordon stands in the hallway - behind him two Thai men from Julian's
          crew.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           What happened?

                          GORDON
           They found his body in a hotel room...
          Julian doesn't know what to say... Neither does Gordon.

           Look, get dressed and I'll see you
           downstairs.
          Julian nods and closes the door. He stands still - glances out
          the window - seeing the sun setting and the night coming in. He
          glances at the pretty girl still sleeping on the bed.
          He goes into the bathroom where Mai is dressed and putting on
          make up.

                          MAI
           What happened?
          Julian looks at her.

                          JULIAN
           Someone killed Billy...
          The camera ZOOMS IN on Mai.

          A Mortuary Attendant pulls a sheet back to reveal -
          Billy. His body completely mutilated.
          Julian stares at his brother's corpse intensely, not betraying
          any emotion.
          He turns to Gordon who's standing behind him.

                          GORDON
           What do we do?

                          JULIAN

          Julian stares up at the night sky, his mobile phone gripped tightly
          in his hand. He puts the phone down.
          He looks out across the city again then back to the phone.
          It's like he's scared.
          He picks it up quickly and dials. A moment as it rings then it's
          answered.

          The CAMERA tracks as we follow a pair of high heeled shoes belonging
          to an elegant woman in her fifties, who looks like she's in her
          forties and could actually pass for late thirties. She strides
          towards reception, a Porter struggling to keep up with her. This
          is Jenna Hopkins. Head of a notorious London Crime Family. Mother
          of both Julian and Billy. Newly appointed Lady Macbeth of Bangkok.
          She hands her passport over to the Concierge.

                          JENNA
           I'd like to check in now please.
          The Concierge checks the computer.

           I'm afraid the room won't be ready until
           four o'clock.

           I'd like to speak to your manager.
          Beat.

                          CONCIERGE
           Yes of course...
          The Concierge retreats. Jenna lights a cigarette.

                          MANAGER
           Good afternoon madam, what seems to be
           the problem?

                          JENNA
           Listen to me... I've just travelled six
           thousand miles to see the corpse of my
           first born son and I haven't slept for
           thirty hours and he says I can't go to
           my room.
          The Manager just stares at her but is clearly taken back by her
          force...

                          MANAGER
           I'm sorry madam...

                          MANAGER
           ... it simply isn't possible.
          Jenna pulls out a massive bundle of notes. Peels off a couple
          of hundred dollar bills.

                          JENNA
           ...Fuck off you cunt, just hand me the
           fucking key...
          She lays the money on the desk. The manager looks around...

                          MANAGER
           Well I might be able to arrange
           something...
          The Manager turns to the Concierge.

                          JENNA
           Don't leave the money there. Some
           cunt'll nick it. Put it in your pocket.
          The Manager hesitates.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Put it in your pocket.

          The Manager takes the money. Pockets it. Places the key on the
          desk.

          The struggling Porter opens the door and lets Jenna in. She walks
          into the suite and gives it the once over.
          Satisfactory.
          The Porter places her bags on the side and hangs up some of her
          clothes, desperate to try and get out in one piece... As soon
          as he's finished he bows and starts to shuffle out of the room.

                          JENNA
           Hey... Open this.
          Jenna points to the Duty Free bag then starts running a bath,
          beginning to undress.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           I need a drink.
          The Porter is stunned.

           Well don't just stand there...
          The Porter fumbles, taking the gin out of the Duty Free bag, spilling
          the tonic in his nervousness as he makes her cocktail.
          Jenna returns in a dressing gown, takes the drink off him and
          takes a huge slug.
          The Porter is terrified, stunned. Rooted to the spot.
          Jenna sits on the bed and stares out of the window. Just as the
          Porter thinks it's safe to try edging out of the room again, she
          starts talking to him...

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           I loved him so much you know... Billy...
          Beat. The Porter doesn't know what the fuck she's talking about.

           Everyone loves their children don't
           they? Well, not everyone, but...
          She looks over at him. The Porter smiles at her.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Do you want to see a picture?
          The Porter nods, uncertain. Jenna gets up, goes over to her purse.
          Opens it up. A picture of Billy.
          She hands it to the Porter - who takes it and just looks at it,
          not knowing what to do...
          Jenna starts to cry. For a long time. Finally...

                          PORTER
           Madam. I have to return to my station.
          Jenna snaps out of it in an instant.

                          JENNA
           What, yeah, thanks.
          She pulls a fifty dollar bill out of her purse. She hands the
          money to the Porter who leaves as quickly as he dares.

          The CAMERA tracks from behind as Julian walks - looking at the
          doors as he passes them and finally stopping in front of one:
          He knocks but there is no answer. Realizing the door isn't locked,

          to him. His features are obscured...
          Julian slowly begins to walk towards him, but before he can reach
          out, the figure turns to face him...
          It's Chang. But there is blood smeared all over his face...
          Julian stares at him in horror. Slowly he looks down at his hands
          only to discover that they're dripping in blood...

          Julian making his way towards her. She gets up and they embrace.
          She holds on to him. A little too long.
          Finally she pulls away. She looks at him for a long time.

          On the other side of the road is Choi Yan Lee's Kiosk, big enough
          to double as his home, currently manned by his long suffering
          wife Kim Yan Lee. She serves a chilled coconut to a man. As he
          turns round we reveal... he's a particularly murderous looking
          member of Julian's crew - Ko Sam.

          looking at a tray of battery powered robots that some Street Kid's
          selling.
          They're all counting down the minutes. Biding their time. Waiting
          for Choi Yan Lee to turn up.
          Finally the sound of the Tuck-tuck approaching...
          Ko Sam drinks his coconut down in one - slurping as he hits the
          bottom. Letting the empty shell fall to the floor.
          Charlie Ling stands up. Feels the gun under his jacket.
          The Tuck-tuck pulls up and Choi Yan Lee's Daughters help him into

          about it, the last of the three daughters is pushed into the kiosk,
          followed by Ko Sam, Charlie Ling, Gordon and Julian.
          Choi Yan Lee snivels in the corner, waving his bandaged arm in
          the air.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           You can't kill me. I'm a cripple.

           KIM YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           Who are you? What do you think you're
           doing? Get out or we'll call the police.
          Ko Sam shakes his head at her. Not a good idea. Julian turns to
          Charlie Ling.

                          JULIAN
           Ask him if he's Choi Yan Lee.
          At the mention of his name the colour drains from Choi Yan Lee's
          face. His eyes lock with Julian's.

                          CHARLIE LING

                          (IN THAI)
           Is your name Choi Yan Lee?
          Choi Yan Lee nods his head.

                          JULIAN
           Ask him why he killed my brother.

                          CHARLIE LING

                          (IN THAI)
           You killed his brother. Big mistake fat
           man. Why'd you do it?
          Beat. Choi Yan Lee knows he's been caught...

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           He murdered my daughter.

                          CHARLIE LING
           He says he killed his daughter.
          Julian considers him for a moment. Slowly he pulls out a gun...
          Aims it at Choi Yan Lee's face...

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           Oh God. Please don't kill me. Please.
           I'll give you anything. Anything you
           want. My daughters. My shop. Please.
           I've paid for what I did. Look at me.
          In his desperation Choi Yan Lee suddenly lurches forward,
          brandishing his wounded arm at Julian. He pulls the bandages off,
          exposing the bloody stump.

           CHOI YAN LEE (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           I've paid for what I did. Don't you see?
          Julian turns to Charlie Ling.

                          JULIAN
           What's he saying?
          Beat.

                          CHARLIE LING
           He says... He says he's paid for what
           he's done. That he's been punished
           already.
          Choi Yan Lee nods his head enthusiastically.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           He told me to do it. Then he took my
           hand. Look.
          Again he thrusts his stump at Julian who glances at him.

                          JULIAN
           Who did that to him?
          Choi Yan Lee looks at the various faces that surround him - then
          stares directly at Julian.

                          (IN THAI)
           The Angel of Vengeance...
          Charlie Ling looks at him surprised... yet there's a sense that
          deep down he knows what he's talking about...

                          CHARLIE LING

                          (IN THAI)
           It's a lie - he doesn't exist...

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           I'm telling the truth. It was the Angel
           of Vengeance.

                          JULIAN
           What's he saying?

                          CHARLIE LING
           He's lying...

                          JULIAN
           Tell me.

                          CHARLIE LING
           It's a story old women tell their grand
           children... 'The Angel of Vengeance'
           is supposed to come down from the
           heavens and judge the living...
           restore karma to the world..
          Gordon laughs... but Julian listens with great interest...

                          JULIAN
           How does he do that?

                          CHARLIE LING
           Leads people to their destiny...
           That's the myth anyway.
          Ko Sam smiles. Julian doesn't. Finally:

                          JULIAN
           Ask him who cut his hand off.
          Charlie Ling's reluctant to question him further. Julian insists.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Do it.

                          CHARLIE LING

                          (IN THAI)
           Who turned you into a cripple - and no
           bullshit this time.
          Choi Yan Lee continues babbling hysterically...

           CHOI YAN LEE

           (IN THAI, QUIETLY)
           I'm telling you the truth... The Angel
           of Vengeance is real... He made me do
           it... You've got to believe me... I've
           already been judged.

                          CHARLIE LING
           He says it was The Angel of Vengeance...
          Choi Yan Lee starts to giggle uncontrollably.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           The Angel of Vengeance. Yes. You don't
           find the Angel of Vengeance. No. He
           finds you.

                          JULIAN
           What's he saying?

                          CHARLIE LING

                          (IN THAI)
           Pull yourself together fat man. If you
           don't talk sense I'll cut off your cock
           and shove it down your throat.

           CHOI YAN LEE

                          (IN THAI)
           I'm telling you the truth. He'll find
           you.
          Choi Yan Lee retreats to the corner of the room.

                          JULIAN
           What did he say?
          Charlie Ling considers Choi Yan Lee. Realizes he's not going to
          get a better answer out of him...

                          CHARLIE LING
           He said you don't find The Angel of
           Vengeance. He finds you...
          Julian considers this for a long time. He realises he's not pointing
          his gun anymore. Puts it away.

                          GORDON
           Are we going to kill him or what?
          The room suddenly feels stuffy. The atmosphere oppressive.
          Julian's got to get out...

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           What are you doing?
          But Julian's already stumbling out of the kiosk...

                          JULIAN
           Nothing... We're not going to do
           anything... Just leave him. Leave them
           all.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. KIOSK - DAY

          Julian stumbles out of the kiosk and breaths in lungfulls of air.
          Disoriented, he careers into a stall selling various religious
          artefacts, sending candles, incense and statues of Buddha
          flying...
          He falls to the ground. When he gets to his feet everything around
          him seems intense and incredibly vibrant... The dogs fighting
          on the street, the Buddha that lies in pieces on the ground, the
          children that stand watching him, his crew as they come out of
          the kiosk, hiding their guns...
          Julian takes a long moment to get his bearings... Finally he stands
          up, but as he does he feels different... As if the axis of his
          world has shifted...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. THAI BOXING CLUB - NIGHT

          The CAMERA TRACKS from the side as we see Jenna walk through the
          boxing gym. All around her people are fighting and sparring.
          She spots Julian and Gordon through the large windows of the office.
          They see her and stand up.
          We LINGER OUTSIDE in the training area as Jenna goes through THE

          DOOR...

                          CUT TO:

          INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT

          Boxers train in the background. Jenna, Julian and Gordon sit in
          silence. Finally:

                          JENNA
           Did you kill him?
          Beat. A shared look between Gordon and Julian.

                          JULIAN
           It's a little bit more complicated than
           that Mum.

                          JENNA
           Complicated? He killed my son...
           What's so fucking complicated about
           that?

                          JULIAN
           Mum, calm down...

                          JENNA
           Don't tell me to calm down. I want him
           dead.
          Beat... Julian does not know how to explain the situation. Jenna
          stares at him.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           We don't forgive. Only God does.

                          JULIAN
           I know, you always say that - but this
           is different...

                          JENNA
           How?
          Silence. Julian doesn't know how to answer. Jenna watches him
          carefully...

                          JULIAN
           Maybe... Maybe Billy had it coming...

                          JENNA
           What are you talking about?

                          JULIAN
           ...because of what he did.
          Jenna thinks it over for a moment.

                          JENNA
           I don't care.

                          JULIAN
           Why?

                          JENNA
           Just don't - some Thai cunt murdered
           your brother and we're not going to let
           him get away with it.

                          JULIAN
           What if... What if it was The Angel of
           Vengeance?
          Jenna stares at her son like he's finally lost the plot.

                          JENNA
           The Angel of fucking what...?

                          JULIAN
           ...it - or he - restores karma and order
           in the world.

                          JENNA
           'Restores' things? Who said anything
           about 'restoring' things?
          Beat.

                          JULIAN
           He loves all humans...

                          JENNA
           I don't know what kind of spiritual
           journey you're on, but you will kill

                          HIM--

                          JULIAN
           I'm not, I'm just...
          Julian can't get the words out. He gets up.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           ... I've got to go.
          ...and Julian leaves - letting the door to the office stay open.
          We pick up the sounds of the fighters training outside as we slowly
          ZOOM IN on Jenna. She turns to Gordon.

                          JENNA
           How's business?

                          GORDON
           It's alright, yeah. Well, what with
           Billy not being around, it's tricky to
           be honest...

                          JENNA
           What d'you mean?

                          GORDON
           Well, we're supposed to be moving five
           keys out the end of this week. But
           Billy's not here, is he?

                          JENNA
           I'm here. Julian's here.
          Gordon shrugs. Jenna clocks it.

           What's gotten into him...? Is he high
           or something?

                          GORDON
           I don't know. Earlier today - we had
           the guy... The guy that killed Billy.
           Had a gun against his face. But then
           - nothing...

                          JENNA
           Nothing?

                          GORDON
           Julian let him go. Now there's all this
           stuff about angels... I don't know what
           the fuck's wrong with him.

                          JENNA
           Not like you...
          Gordon smiles at her uncertainly.

                          GORDON
           I know how to do what needs to be done.
           That's all.
          She stares at him, long enough to make him uncomfortable.

                          JENNA
           So tell me... What did he mean when he
           said it was complicated?

                          GORDON
           There's this other guy... Might have
           been involved...

                          JENNA
           So we kill them both.

                          GORDON
           We don't know who the other guy is yet...

                          JENNA
           Okay. Well how about we start with the
           guy we do know?

          A girl sings 'Another Woman's Man' by Dolly Parton.
          Julian's sitting alone at a table, nursing a drink.
          Mai enters, looking much more sophisticated than when we saw her
          in the hotel. She sits next to Julian and gives him a kiss on
          the cheek.

                          MAI
           Sorry I'm late.

                          JULIAN
           Nothing.
          Mai looks around the bar... It's half empty - some girls and men
          spread out.
          The waitress comes over and Mai orders a drink. They sit in silence,
          listening to the song...

           See anyone you want us to take home

          A pause, Mai slightly taken about.

           Why d'you want me to meet her?

                          JULIAN
           To show her... To show that I've got
           something here...

                          MAI
           What, like we're a couple?
          Julian stares at her for a long time. Can't quite say it out loud,
          but the answer's yes.

          EXT. CHOI YAN LEE'S SHACK - NIGHT

          Choi Yan Lee oversees his daughter's serving hot food to customers.
          FOCUS ON Liang, the young kick boxer, watching him from across
          the street. Liang pulls out a knife which glints in the light
          of the street lamps. He heads over to the shack.
          Liang asks Choi Yan Lee a question. Choi Yan Lee leans over to
          hear him better. Liang GRABS hold of his hair and PULLS him over
          the counter, SLITTING his throat with the knife.
          Choi Yan Lee's wife and daughters look on as blood floods from
          his neck, over the sweets and snacks on sale and down to the ground
          below.
          Life slips away from Choi Yan Lee in a matter of seconds. Liang
          holds onto him until he's dead and then lets go of his head and
          runs off into the night.

          Gordon pulls out several hundred dollars.

                          GORDON
           Never come back - you understand me?
          Liang nods.

           Good...
          Liang takes the money. A proper pay out.

           You're a fighter, kid. No doubt about

                          LIANG'S SISTER
           Last night. He went out.

                          LIANG'S SISTER
           She doesn't know. They spoke in
           English.
          Liang's Mother pulls out a mobile phone. Passes it to Julian.

                          JULIAN
           This his phone?
          Liang's Sister nods. Julian scrolls through the numbers. All have
          Thai names against them - except one. Julian considers the number,
          then redials.
          A beat. Then the SOUND of a phone ringing in the same room.
          Gordon looks round. Realises he's busted. Takes his phone out.
          Kills it.
          Julian stares at him. Before he gets a chance to say anything,
          there is a knock on the door.

          Julian thinks it over...

          INT. BOXING CLUB - DAY

          Julian clocks the cops who are waiting for him. He walks over,
          strangely on edge. As he gets closer he sees Chang - standing
          on the other side of the room by the boxing ring, his back to
          him, watching the sparring fighters... Julian stares at him...
          Turns back to the cops...

                          JULIAN
           Good morning officers. How can I help
           you?
          Slowly Chang turns to face him. Julian stares at him as if he's
          in a trance...

           We're investigating the murder of Choi
           Yan Lee.
          Julian recovers. Turns to Kim and shrugs.

                          JULIAN
           Never heard of him.

                          KIM
           His arm was cut off. Here.
          Julian manages to cover his reaction.

                          JULIAN
           I run a boxing club. Not much call for
           one armed men.
          A beat. Mexican stand off.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           What's this got to do with me?

                          KIM
           He was the father of the girl that was
           found dead with your brother.

                          JULIAN
           Then I guess you boys have got a lot
           of work to do - so have I, so if you'll
           excuse me...

                          KIM
           That's why we're here Mr Hopkins. If
           you could just answer our questions.

                          JULIAN
           Sure, sorry. What do you want to know?
          Julian looks over to Chang who continues staring at the boxers.
          The way the ring is lit he's almost silhouetted.

                          KIM
           Where were you last night?

                          JULIAN
           With my mum...
          Some of the boxers come over to Chang. They know him. They're
          reverential. With the effect of the lighting, it seems to Julian
          like they're bowing down before a God.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           You want to speak to her?

                          KIM
           That wont be necessary at the moment.

                          JULIAN
           Am I suspect?
          Chang turns round to face Julian. His presence is magnetic. Julian
          stares back at him, realizing that this must be the Angel of
          Vengeance... Chang walks over to them. Studies Julian for a long
          moment and then turns to Kim.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           This is not the man.
          And as soon as he's said it, he turns on his heel and leaves.
          The cops back off and away.
          ZOOM IN on Julian. Deflated and strangely disappointed... He turns
          to Gordon who's standing behind him.

                          JULIAN
           I want you to find out who that guy is.
           Okay?

                          GORDON
           Sure. No problem.

          sing on stage. Julian enters, sees Chang but can only see the
          back of his face. He walks over to the bar, orders a drink.
          Julian starts to watch Nadee. When he turns back to the bar he
          sees Chang reflected in the optics - somehow standing right next
          to him, staring at him. Julian turns to face him.

                          JENNA
           So, where did you two meet?

                          JULIAN
           I saw her walking down the street.
          Jenna raises an eyebrow...

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           And I thought - this is the most
           beautiful girl I've ever seen - so I
           just walked up to her and started
           talking.

                          JENNA
           I hear that happens a lot in this part
           of the world... Tell me, what's your
           line of work, Mai?

                          MAI
           I work in the service industry.

                          JENNA
           I bet you do. But tell me Mai, before
           you started serving my son, how many
           cocks were you serving? Was it over a
           thousand?
          Mai stares at Jenna in disbelief.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           I know girls like you. Just because you
           might be pulling the wool over my son's
           eyes don't think it's going to work with
           me.

                          JULIAN
           Mum, stop it, for fuck's sake.

                          JENNA
           I'm sorry Julian, but I won't stand by
           and let a dirty little hooker take
           advantage of my son in the vain hope
           that her womb isn't so diseased that
           she can trick him into impregnating her
           and putting another cocksucking child
           on to this earth.

                          JULIAN
           Leave her alone Mum. You've got her
           wrong. She's a good girl.

                          JENNA
           What do you know about what's good?
          Beat. Julian says nothing.

                          MAI
           He's good to me...

                          JENNA
           Well that's nice isn't it, I'm really
           happy for you--

                          JULIAN
           Mum!
          A pause.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           The cops came by my club today.
          Beat. She stares at him.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           They're investigating a murder. The
           guy that killed Billy turned up dead
           this morning.
          Jenna looks bored. Lights a cigarette.

                          JENNA
           Oh really, shame that, still, live by
           the sword, die by the sword...

                          JULIAN
           I know it was you, Mum.

                          JENNA
           I did what had to be done.

                          JULIAN
           He was there. He was with them.

                          JENNA
           Who?

                          JULIAN
           The Angel of Vengeance.

                          JENNA
           D'you kill him?

                          JULIAN
           No.

                          JENNA
           Cause he as good as killed Billy. What
           I want to know is, what are you going
           to do about it?

                          JULIAN
           I'm not going to kill him...

                          JENNA
           Yes you are. You're going to do it for
           me and you're going to do it for your
           brother.

                          JULIAN
           This isn't about Billy. This is about
           me. All my life I've been running...

                          JENNA
           That's right you cunt, cause you always
           run away whenever there's a problem...
           just like you're running away from
           killing this fucking Angel of whatever

                          -

                          JULIAN
           - his name is Chang-

                          JENNA
           Chang?!
          Mai stands up.

                          MAI
           I should be going now.

                          JENNA
           Sit down you cunt.

                          JULIAN
           Mum, don't talk to her like that.
          Mai sits down.

                          JENNA
           So what am I left with?
          Julian stares at her.

                          JULIAN
           Me.
          Jenna calms down. She looks at their reflections in the mirror
          behind the bar. We ZOOM in on the mirror, their faces refracted
          by the glass.

                          JENNA
           You're right. We're family. We stick
           together. But Billy was family too.

                          JULIAN
           Billy was a fuck up... He deserved
           everything he got. You know it and I
           know it.

                          JENNA
           That's it. I'm not listening to this.
           I don't ever want to hear you mention
           his name again... Do you hear me?

                          JULIAN
           Yeah we were brothers, but we were never
           close... And he was only in Bangkok
           cause you couldn't control him. So you
           sent him to me--

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           -- So you sent him to me and what could
           I do?

                          JENNA
           You could have protected him.

                          JULIAN
           I did what I could. And that's more than
           you ever did.

                          JENNA
           I would've done anything for him. Okay,
           he wasn't born with as many advantages
           as you were. He struggled with things.
           But I always stood by him.

                          JULIAN
           And what did that get him? I'll tell
           you what, a one way ticket to this
           fucking place, just like me.

                          JENNA
           Don't you dare blame me for what
           happened back then.

                          JULIAN
           I'm only here 'cause of you. If you
           didn't exist, I wouldn't be here.
          Beat.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           I could've been someone, Mum. I was on
           my way...
          Jenna stares at him - this is a conversation she does not like
          having...

                          JENNA
           You would've been a great fighter...
           You could've gone pro.

                          JULIAN
           Don't you think I know that? And look
           at me now. I'm a front for a drugs
           smuggling.
          He turns to Mai.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           It's true... The whole thing's a front.
           Every day I see kids coming in with great
           potential. And every day I see kilos
           of heroin going out. And it's all
           because of you, Ma. You and the money
           and the drugs.
          Jenna silently seethes, waiting for Julian to shut the fuck up.
          He quietens down...

                          JENNA
           At least you're not behind bars and
           that's more important to me.
          Julian turns to her - he has been waiting all his life to say
          this.

                          JULIAN
           That's right Mum. That's what's more
           important to you. But what about me?
           Sometimes I think you only got me out
           of there so the cops couldn't trace it
           back to you...
          Jenna stares at him. Her face a mask.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           ...that's right Mum. Think about it.
           With me gone you were safe. And it turned
           out to be good for business as well.
           All very convenient.
          Silence between them. Jenna lights another cigarette - her hands
          now shaking.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Is that what happened with Billy? Did
           Billy become a problem like I did?
           Wouldn't surprise me, he was a big
           fucking problem when he was here...
           Still, at least you didn't have him
           killed.
          Jenna slaps him hard on the face. Julian recovers. Looks up at
          her. Very intense.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           I'm not going to kill him for you, Mum.
           Doesn't matter what you say. And do you
           want to know why?

                          JENNA
           Surprise me.

                          JULIAN
           'Cause I'm going to fight him. In the
           ring. Me versus him.

                          JENNA
           Well that seems sensible... And what
           do you hope that's going to achieve?

                          JULIAN
           I don't expect you to understand. Cause
           you don't understand anything that
           isn't about you.

                          JENNA
           And when you lose, what's going to
           happen then?

                          JULIAN
           I don't know... But maybe this time I'll
           win. Like you say, only God forgives.
           Maybe this time he'll forgive me...
          Jenna turns to Mai.

                          JENNA
           Do you understand what he's talking
           about? 'Cause I haven't got a fucking
           a clue.

                          JULIAN
           You never did, Mum.
          A pause. Julian's touched a nerve. Jenna recovers.

                          JENNA
           I hope you find what you're looking for.
           'Cause if you don't, it's going to find
           you and I'm not always going to be there
           to look after you.
          Jenna composes herself. Suddenly brightens. A different person.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Nice to meet you Mai. Hope to see you
           again soon.
          Jenna shakes her hand. Mai's too shocked to resist. And then,
          as if nothing had happened, Jenna leaves.
          Julian covers his face with his napkin.

                          MAI
           Are you alright?
          He's not. He's crying. But he doesn't want anyone to see.

                          JULIAN
           I'm fine.
          Beat.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           I'll be fine. In a minute.
          Julian wipes his face clean. Pulls himself together.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           Sorry about that.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL - NIGHT

          Jenna gets out of her cab and walks toward reception, a look of
          steely determination in her eyes.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL - NIGHT

          The Concierge and the Manager see Jenna coming towards them and
          brace themselves...
          However, to their relief, she diverts to the palm court area where
          Gordon is waiting for her.

                          GORDON
           Nice evening?

                          JENNA
           Lovely, yeah. Just catching up, you
           know.
          Jenna sits down. Lights a cigarette.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           You're a piece of work, aren't you?
          Gordon blushes. Jenna blows out her match.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           No fucking hanging about with you, is
           there?

                          GORDON
           Well, I don't know about that. Just been
           out here a while... Know how to get
           things done.

                          JENNA
           I bet you do.

                          GORDON
           But things are going to shit. Since
           Billy died, Julian's all over the
           place...

                          JENNA
           We'll have to something about that the,
           wont we? But, first things first, what
           about Chang?

                          GORDON
           Who?

                          JENNA
           My son's guardian angel.

                          GORDON
           He's just a retired cop...

                          JENNA
           Good, then he won't be to hard to kill,
           will he?

                          GORDON
           It's not that simple... Is there
           somewhere we can go that's a little more
           private?
          Beat. She raises her eyebrows.

                          JENNA
           What did you have in mind?
          Gordon blushes. Moves closer, conspiratorial...

                          GORDON
           You can't just going round killing cops
           here anymore. It's not that easy.

                          JENNA
           I didn't say it was easy. But then,
           you're a resourceful man, aren't you?

                          GORDON
           I looked into it. Chang's a hard man
           to get to. None of the Thais'll go near
           him...

                          JENNA
           Well then you're going to have to find
           someone who's not a fucking Thai then,
           aren't you?

                          GORDON
           There might be a way... But Julian can't
           find out...
          Jenna looks at Gordon - smiles and crosses her legs.

                          JENNA
           Don't you worry about that. There are
           certain things that a mother and son
           shouldn't - and don't - discuss...
          Gordon thinks he does but isn't a hundred per cent sure.

          A mixed clientele. High class. Asian and European. But there's
          an edge to the atmosphere. The music's that bit too loud, that
          bit too aggressive. And the people inside don't look like they're
          having a good time. It seems evil. Sleazy.

          charismatic Russian in his forties who is surrounded by Thai girls
          and fellow Russians including his distinctive looking bodyguard,

          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Chang has just finished a meal with the Cops including Kim, Daeng
          and Phaiban. Chang is just settling the bill when the Three Gunmen
          walk in. He looks up just as they OPEN FIRE.
          An insane storm of led rains down on the room, shattering all
          the mirrors on the back wall, taking out Two Waitresses and covering
          the room with broken glass.
          Chang hits the floor and starts to drag himself towards some cover.
          Chang's men are completely pinned down. Phaiban's been hit and
          his white shirt has turned dark red with blood.
          Chang keeps edging towards where his jacket's hanging on a chair.
          In it, his pistol.
          The Gunmen keep firing. As soon as a clip is finished, they pull
          it out and put a fresh one in and keep shooting.
          A stray bullet hits the waiter who knocks over the chair Chang's
          jacket's on. It falls to the ground. With it, his pistol. He grabs
          it and returns fire, letting off four rounds.
          He takes Gunman One. Head shot, right between the eyes. Gunman
          Two sees this and sprays at Chang -
          - but Chang manages to dive to cover. He rolls and fires again,
          shooting Gunman Two in the chest three times.
          Chang's out of ammo and needs to reload. Gunman Three's weapon
          jams. He drops his weapon and runs.
          Before he's finished reloading his pistol, Chang's after him.
          He sees Phaiban. Dead. Daeng trying to stem the flow of blood
          from his chest.
          Chang keeps running, determined not to lose his man.

          The driver of the crappy van smokes nervously in the driving seat
          as he waits. As soon as he sees Gunman Three, panic-stricken,
          running in fear, he puts the van in gear, revs the engine and
          starts to pull away.
          Gunman Three runs after him, crying out for him to slow down.
          The Driver slows. Gunman Three struggles to jump into the open
          doors.
          Chang bursts out of the restaurant. Stops dead. Aims and fires
          off two rounds.
          Blood spatters across the inside of the windscreen. The Driver
          falls forward, dead.
          The back door of the van slams shut. Gunman Three thinks he's
          made it. He's wrong. The van isn't going anywhere.
          Chang approaches the back door of the van, ready to fire.

          Chang pulls out Li Po's distinctive mobile phone.
          Dimitri, currently flanking Yuri, turns white.
          Chang calls a number. A beat. Then a phone starts ringing in
          Dimitri's jacket pocket (with a really cheesy ringtone). Dimitri
          winces. Chang shakes his head.
          Yuri pulls a gun. Kim shoots him dead. Chang moves his gun across
          to Dimitri. Holds his mobile phone up to his ear.
          Dimitri answers. Chang speaks through the phone.

          Chang starts to circle him. Dimitri's terrified. Doesn't know
          what the fuck he's on about. Suddenly he's grabbed from behind
          by Phaiban.
          Chang smashes a beer bottle and walks up behind Dimitri...

          He pushes the broken bottle into Dimitri's eyes. Gauges them out.
          Dimitri screams hysterically - calling out for his mother in
          Russian...

          Phaibun grabs Dimitri's head from behind. Chang presses down on
          his stomach with his knee and opens his mouth - grabs hold of
          his tongue and with a blade slowly cuts it off.

          Two figures kneel on either side of the ring. Julian and Chang.
          Both wearing Mongkol. Totally still.
          The ceremonial music begins...
          Slowly Julian and Chang start to perform Ram Muay, the ancient,
          traditional dance which the rules of the game say must be carried
          out before a fight takes place.
          It is both strange and spiritual: Julian and Chang move their
          arms rhythmically, in time to the music, their hands describing
          shapes and outlining fighting positions.
          As the dance develops, so their positions become more combative;
          now crouching, now standing, hinting at the kicks and punches
          that they're about to perform... but all carried out with an almost
          beatific precision that is at odds with the violence that is about
          to follow...

          The Music Ends. A moment of stillness, and then slowly we bring

          The crowd is packed. In one corner: Julian. Charlie Ling beside
          him along with Ko Sam. He looks focussed. Confident.
          In the other corner: Chang. Kim next to him along with a couple
          of his crew. He looks incredibly calm.
          The first bell sounds. Five second warning...
          Chang looks over into the crowd. Kanita with Nadee. Kanita offers
          him a 'thumbs up'. Chang smiles. Returns it.
          Julian looks over. Sees Mai take a seat. She holds his gaze.
          The second bell sounds. The first of five rounds. Julian and Chang
          walk up to the centre of the ring. The Referee stands between
          them. Brings them together. A quick look down to the Three Judges.
          Then a look between the two fighters.
          Julian eyes Chang. Steely determination in his eyes. Chang looks
          back at him without emotion.

                          (IN THAI)
           Fight.
          Julian and Chang circle each other. Julian moves in to attack
          first. He throws a straight left first to Chang's face and steps
          his left foot forward at the same time. Chang bends his right
          leg, dodging the attack. He then pounces on the upper part of
          Julian's arm with his right hand and catches his wrist with his
          left hand. He tries to turn Julian's front wrist up, but Julian's
          too strong. This is a surprise for Chang. He breaks and steps
          back.
          Julian moves in to attack again, raising both elbows to make an
          attack on Chang's head. Chang steps forward and pulls an uppercut,
          connecting hard with Julian's chin. Julian moves back, dazed.
          Takes a moment to get his bearings back. That hurt.
          Chang doesn't take the opportunity to attack. He hangs back.
          Waiting for Julian to come at him again. This pisses Julian off.
          He moves forward and throws an offensive kick with his right foot.
          Chang moves back to dodge the attack and swivels to try and strike
          with a counter attack. He moves too slow. The right footed attack
          was a feint. Julian slams his right foot down on the floor and
          uses it to swivel, unleashing a kick with his left which connects
          with Chang's jaw and sends him flying back.
          Julian uses his forward motion to propel him onwards. He bounds
          over to the disoriented Chang and hits him with a series of jabs
          and punches to his upper body and face.
          Chang's almost on the ropes. Julian comes in hard with kicks to
          the shins with his right foot. Chang bends his body to pass under
          Julian's right foot. Julian misses the target. Chang manages to
          place his right foot on Julian's left knee-joint which makes him
          fall down.
          Julian's in a vulnerable position, but Chang doesn't move to make
          the killer blow. He steps back to let him recover. Again this
          enrages Julian.
          He gets up and moves forward towards Chang. He comes in with a
          high right kick. Again Chang manages to dodge the attack and returns
          with a right foot to the back of Julian's left knee. Julian swivels,
          punches air, and gets a trio of punches in his gut. His guard's
          down. But again no killer punch.

                          JULIAN
           Come on.
          Chang retreats. Shrugs at Julian. You come on.
          Julian moves towards him, but before he gets a chance to take
          out his frustrations, the bell goes. End of round one.
          Julian stalks back to his corner. He turns to look at Chang, a
          look of intense anger and frustration.

          INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT

          Julian moves towards the middle where Chang is already waiting.
          Julian waits for Chang this time. Chang is reluctant to attack.
          A waiting game... Who will strike first... Chang wins. Julian
          moves to kick Chang in the ribs, keeping both his hands down as
          he moves in. Chang predicts this and prepares to throw his own
          kick as it comes in. Chang steps back, but again Julian swivels,
          using his right foot instead to pivot and unleashes a killer strike
          with his left foot. Chang goes flying backwards.
          PICK OUT the look of concern etched on the faces of Nadee and
          Kanita.
          Chang recovers but Julian moves in fast with a series of punches
          and elbows. Chang's on the ropes now and getting badly beaten.
          He clings on to Julian to limit the damage.

           Break.
          The two fighters step back from each other. Chang's face is damaged.
          Juilan's about to get stuck into him again when the bell sounds.
          End of the second round.
          Round three: Julian slamming punches into Chang. Nadee comforting
          Kanita. Telling her it'll be okay. Chang responding with kicks
          and elbows. Defensive blocks and counter attacks. Mai willing
          Julian on. Jenna watching with Gordon...
          End of round: Julian feeling more confident. Again his eyes scan
          the crowd. This time he sees what he's looking for: Jenna.
          Chang eyeballs Julian from the other corner. Sees him staring
          into the crowd. Looks over. Tries to see what he's looking at
          but can't make it out.
          POV from Chang as he sees Jenna make her way toward Julian. When
          she gets to him we see her saying something to Julian about the
          fight - urging him to hit harder...
          Jenna then walks back to Gordon...
          On Chang. Deep in thought. He gets up early. Walks around the
          ring. Looking into the crowd.
          Jenna sees him. Stares at him. Suddenly nervous.
          Everything slows down as Chang clocks her again. The colours of
          the room change from blue to yellow to red. He's seen her and
          she knows she's been seen. And he knows. And she knows that he
          knows...
          The bell goes off. Back to reality. Chang turns round. Too late.
          He gets a massive blow to his head. He goes down hard.
          The Referee starts counting.
          Nadee and Kanita watch on, fearful.
          Jenna holds her breath. Hopeful that he might be down and out.
          Kim watches on, concerned.

          After a long, terrible pause... Chang gets up. He looks over into
          the crowd. Makes eye contact with his wife. It's okay.
          She shakes her head. She can't bear it. Tears running down her
          face.
          Back on his feet, Chang suddenly drops his guard. Julian hesitates,
          confused. Chang leans in close to him. Winks.

          Chang raises his arms again. Ready to fight. Julian gets ready
          to attack but something's changed. The fire's gone out of him.
          He looks over to his mother, to Mai, Chang's words echoing in
          his mind.
          It's not his fault.
          Then Chang comes in with a flurry of punches. Left, right, left,
          right. Julian just takes them...
          Chang pauses in the onslaught. Julian stays motionless in the
          middle of the ring.
          Chang runs at him, flings his right foot, swivels, pulling out
          a roundhouse left kick -
          - which makes contact with Julian's draw.
          SLOW MOTION as Julian's head takes the impact.
          He's out cold before he hits the floor.

          Jenna makes her hand into a pistol. Pretends to fire it into her

                          JENNA
           I watched him lose. And he deserved to.
           You were the better fighter. My only
           sadness is that Billy got caught up in
           what he's doing out here. And paid for
           it with his life.
          Kim and the rest of the crew take this in.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           I'll never testify against my own flesh
           and blood, Officer Chang. But he's a
           killer.
          Chang senses something. Starts to become agitated.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           ... It pains me to say it, but my own
           son is a killer. He killed a cop back
           in England ten years ago. He's been on
           the run ever since. I say son... But
           he hasn't been a son to me.
          Chang stares at the door to the bedroom. Feels the presence of
          someone the other side of the door.

                          JENNA (CONT'D)
           Not for a long time. Not since he killed
           that cop back home... That was ten years
           ago. He's been running ever since. And
           he'll never stop until he's caught.
           Until you catch him.
          Chang starts to push the door open...
          Behind him Jenna stands up.
          Before Chang fully opens the door, his mobile phone rings. It
          sounds INCREDIBLY loud. He takes it out and looks at the display
          with a feeling of dread.
          He answers...

          on her bed. She stares at Julian, Charlie Ling's dead body at

          Buddha's smiling back at him...

          incredibly vibrant... A group of school children, all of whom

          Julian stares at the door as if it was heaven's gate... He loads
          the shotgun with two fresh cartridges.

           Only God forgives. And now mother -

          backs away into the room.

           Easy...
          Julian says nothing. Edges into the room. The gun still pointed
          at Gordon's head.

          Reaching the car, Gordon stands by the driver's door as Julian
          heads for the passenger's side.
          Gordon pauses before unlocking the door. Looks over to Julian,
          talking across the roof of the car.

                          GORDON
           We're good mates aren't we?
          Beat. Julian's instantly suspicious...

          Gordon levels a pistol at Julian's head.

                          JULIAN
           What did she say? What did she promise

           Don't make this harder--
          GUNSHOT. A bullet RIPS through Julian's shoulder. He falls back
          on the car behind him setting off a chorus of car alarms.
          Gordon starts to walk round to deliver the killer blow.

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           You've become a liability. You can see
           that, can't you?
          Julian looks at the wound. It's deep but he's not totally
          incapacitated. He pulls the shotgun out from under his shirt.
          It clatters to the floor.

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           And now she wants me to take over. She
           wants me to be the favoured son. What
           am I supposed to say?
          Julian sinks to his knees, leaning over to pick up the shotgun.
          He's got seconds...

                          GORDON (CONT'D)
           I didn't want it to end like this. First
           I fuck your mother. Then I--
          Gordon turns the corner - but Julian's in position. Two shots
          in quick succession. Both barrels fired at Gordon's chest.
          The force of the explosion FLINGS Gordon's body against the far
          wall of the car park. Dead instantly.
          Julian pulls himself up and stands there, the smoking shotgun
          acting as a makeshift crutch. He gazes at Gordon's steaming corpse,

          from the loss of blood. He looks like a ghost.
          He sees two cops chatting on a street corner. They don't see him,
          they're not even looking for him, but they remind him. Chang.
          It's just a matter of time...
          Julian keeps walking. Wipes sweat from his face. Looking for a

          Then suddenly it comes to him. A single idea. A possible way of

                          JULIAN
           I've got to get out of Bangkok. Didn't
           want to leave...
          He winces.

                          JULIAN (CONT'D)
           ... without saying goodbye.

                          MAI
           Who did this to you?
          A pause.

                          JULIAN
           My mother... She made me what I am. And
           now I've got nothing. And they're after
           me.
          Mai stares at him.

                          MAI
           Come with me...
          Julian looks at her.

           ...to Cambodia - we can hide there...
           You'll be safe there.
          Mai and Julian smile at each other. It's sweet. Innocent.

                          JULIAN
           I got about twelve grand at the club...
           Should be enough to get us there. Set
           ourselves up. Disappear...

           Now?

                          JULIAN
           Right now.
          Mai looks around - they're alone.

          Julian watches as Mai comes into the Restaurant from the kitchen
          and walks over to the bar area...
          Making sure no one's watching, Mai starts to pull money out of
          the til...
          Julian looks over at the shop front next to him... A Travel Agency.
          Pictures of holidays and beaches. Paradise. It all seems in his
          grasp.
          Mai comes up to him...

                          MAI

          Julian gets out of the taxi.

           Stay here. If I'm not out in five
           minutes... Go.
          Mai nods.

                          MAI
           Five minutes.
          Julian nods and slams the door shut. Mai watches Juilan disappear
          into the building.

          We PICK UP Julian as he hurries through towards his office.

          Back where we first met him...
          Julian flings open the door to his safe and starts pulling wads
          of money into a canvas hold all.
          He's about to leave when he notices someone standing in the shadows
          behind him.
          Slowly, out of the darkness, a series of figures appear like
          vampires... Chang and the Cops. Impossible to say how long they've
          been standing there...
          Chang and Julian stare at each other...

                          CHANG
           Let's go.
          We TRACK IN to a CLOSE SHOT on Julian. It's almost as if this
          moment was inevitable.

          Daeng is driving. Kim sits next to him. Daeng looks into the rearview
          mirror to see--
          Julian and Mai sitting next to Chang. Mai looks scared... Julian
          more accepting of his fate...

          EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

          Chang leads Juilan across the field. The Cops follow a few steps
          behind with Mai.
          Suddenly, and completely unexpectedly, Chang punches Julian in
          the gut... Julian falls to the floor and Chang starts to viciously
          attack him, punching and kicking him.
          Finally Julian, unable to defend himself, is lying on the ground,
          immobile.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Get up.
          Julian rolls over. Eyes Chang. Slowly he starts to get up onto
          his knees. They continue, Chang forcing Julian to crawl as they
          make their way further into the field.
          Then Chang stops...

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Get up. Now.
          Julian struggles to get up to his feet, but before he does, Chang
          kicks him hard in the chest, sending him back down to the floor.

                          JULIAN
           I'm sorry...

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Do you have anything to say?

                          JULIAN
           Don't hurt her.
          He kicks him in the stomach.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)

                          JULIAN
           I'm sorry...
          Chang kicks him again - like you would kick a dog... Juilan groans.
          Chang squats down next to him.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)

                          JULIAN
           I don't know... I'm sorry.
          Chang gets up and walks on. He stops and turns round.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           Come on.
          Julian stumbles to his feet. The party continue. We see that one
          of the crew is carrying an axe.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD / HIGH POINT - DAWN

          A couple of wild dogs watch as our group reach a high point.
          Chang looks down at Julian who is lying on the ground. The crew
          stand in the background with Mai.
          Chang sits next to Julian.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           When you were born - what's the first
           thing you remember seeing?
          A beat as Julian struggles to understand Chang's question... Chang
          stares at him.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)

          Beat.

                          JULIAN
           Dark... Darkness.
          Chang looks at him in a strange way - like this answer has some
          meaning for him.

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)
           And do you ever see light?
          Julian shakes he's head.

                          JULIAN
           No... Never.
          Chang considers this answer for a long moment. He gets up and
          returns to Mai - stares at her....

                          CHANG

                          (IN THAI)

           order and karma. I love all living
           things...
          Mai just stares at him - too frightened to move.

                          (IN THAI)
           ...I want you to walk away from here
           now... Do you understand?
          Mai nods.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Good.
          Chang smiles at her.

                          CHANG (CONT'D)

                          (IN THAI)
           Go with God.
          Mai turns and leaves. Chang watches her disappear into the field.
          Chang takes the axe off Phaiban and turns back to Julian.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. FIELD / HIGH POINT - DAWN

          Chang leans down next to Julian and whispers something into
          Julian's ear - so softly that we cannot hear it. Whatever it says
          it instantly has an effect on Julian. He visibly relaxes.
          He doesn't make a sound as he's held down. A plastic strap is
          tied around his arm as a tourniquet. His arm is pulled out.
          Chang swings the axe and chops off first his left hand and then
          his right.
          Julian grits his teeth throughout. Doesn't scream.
          Chang picks up the severed hands and throws them to the wild dogs.
          The dogs tear into the meat, fighting over their prize.
