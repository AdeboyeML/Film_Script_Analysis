          EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

          SUPER: April 27, 1973
          All is quiet outside this suburban school on a sunny
          Friday afternoon. Cars idle in the driveway awaiting
          the three o'clock onslaught of liberated children.
          Two faded yellow buses stand ready.

          The lull is shattered by the CLANGING of the final BELL.
          A swarm of children pours out the door and down the
          broad front steps, scattering across the lawn toward
          the cars and the buses.

          Moving slowly through the crowd, ROBIN and ALEX HAMMOND,
          nine-year-old identical twins, appear at the doorway..
          Attractive, dark-haired children, they seem more sub-
          dued than the others. As they walk quietly down the
          stairs, Robin lags behind, staring at a boy teasing a
          girl nearby. He is NICK MCBRIDE, eleven years old,
          two grades ahead of Robin and the most popular boy in
          school. The pretty girl laughing at his antics is KIM
          HAMMOND, also eleven, Robin's older sister.

          He strides away. Robin's eyes remain on Nick and Kim.
          Nick says something to Kurt. She shakes her head and
          pains toward Robin. Robin quickly turns away as they
          look at her.. When she glances back, Ki_m is walking
          towards her and Nick is bicycling away.

          Robin watches her go, then moves off alone, breaking
          into a skip and playing imaginary hopscotch.
          As she turns off the main road into a side street,
          Robin passes a construction site. The empty skeleton
          of a half-finished apartment building looms up above
          the dark shade trees. Hearing VOICES, Robin stops to
          investigate.

          Alex?
          The VOICES continue. Robin moves closer, peering
          through the tall bushes surrounding the lot. She
          sees Nick playing in.the framework with three of his
          classmates. Robin recognizes JUDE CUNNINGHAM, and
          KELLY LYNCH as Kim's two best friends. The fourth
          child, WENDY RICHARDS, is a dark-haired girl, domin-
          eering and loud. As Robin watches, Wendy jumps
          up onto the floor of the building.

          As Nick turns his back, hiding his eyes against an ex-
          posed beam, the children scatter through the structure.
          Robin watches with mounting excitement as Nick finishes
          counting, and whirls around.

                         NICK
          The killer is coming for you!
          He moves into the building, chanting "Kill, kill.," in a
          low monotone. As he disappears from view, Robin cau-
          tiously edges out of the bushes and moves up to the
          building.

          Robin hears Jude's SQUEAL of LAUGHTER. Nick has caught
          her. Immediately Jude's VOICE TAKES UP the "kill"
          chant in unison with Nick.

          INT. APARTMENT BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY 2

          Robin climbs up onto the floor and peers into the dark,
          gloomy structure. Suddenly, she hears a SHRIEK. Ter-
          rified, she backs against a wall. LAUGHTER FOLLOWS im-
          mediately and Robin hears Kelly's VOICE TAKING UP the
          chant. As the three "killers" move through the vast
          structure searching for Wendy, "KILL, KILT" ECHOES off
          the walls and hardwood floors.
          Robin cautiously steps out of the doorway into the im-
          mense unfinished lobby. Ominous shadows slash across
          the floor as the excited girl listens to the relentless
          CHANTING of the children.
          Robin pushes on a makeshift wooden door. It slips off
          its temporary hinges, crashing down to the floor. The
          NOISE is like a rifle shot; suddenly, there is ABSOLUTE
          SILENCE in the structure.
          Petrified, Robin crouches behind a wall, waiting. The
          CHANTING quickly RESUMES and she breathes a long sigh
          of relief.
          Robin moves through a dark corridor, hugging the walls.
          Flushed with excitement, she imagines herself a "killer"
          searching for Wendy. As she moves past an empty room,
          she hears a SOFT GIGGLE. Robin stops and listens care-
          fully. Once again she hears the GIGGLE, LOUDER this
          time, coming from nearby.
          Stepping to a doorway, she leans around the corner and
          peers inside. In the darkness she can see nothing.
          Gathering her courage, she quietly slips into the room.
          The room appears empty but a closet door is slightly
          ajar. As Robin approaches, she hears a FAINT GASP from
          behind her. Whirling around, she sees Wendy crouched
          behind a cardboard box in the corner.

          Before Robin can react, she hears a THUD from above.
          Looking up, she sees Nick's head appear through an
          opening in the ceiling. Seeing Robin, then Wendy
          standing in the corner, he howls in triumph.

          the room. Trapped, Wendy looks frantically for an es-
          cape but finds nothing. Turning around suddenly, she
          grins at Robin, a cruel, hard expression on her face.

          Picking up the chant, Wendy begins to advance on Robin.
          Terrified, Robin turns and rushes out of the room,
          bowling over Nick in the doorway. Delighted that the
          game is continuing with a new victim, he follows Wendy
          in pursuit of Robin.
          Robin flees down the long, dark corridor, "KILL, KILL
          ECHOING in her wake. As she rounds a corner, Jude ap-
          pears, looming up in front of her. Robin screams and
          sprints in the opposite direction. Kelly leaps out of
          a doorway and grabs for her, but Robin, swinging out
          blindly, escapes the "killer."

          INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY 3

          Darting into the large room, Robin collapses against a
          wall, gasping for breath. As her eyes adjusts to the
          darkness, she spies a rickety ladder extending through
          a hole in the floor to the basement below. Stacked up-
          right near the opening are several sheets of window
          glass. Before Robin can make a move towards the lad-
          der, she hears a horrible SCREECH and Wendy appears in
          the doorway, a vicious look on her face.

                         WENDY

          Wendy advances. Terrified, Robin begins to back away.

          and starts down into the basement, careful not to knock
          over the sheets of glass stacked near the opening.
          Peering into the pitch-black basement, Robin hesitates.
          But as Wendy and her fellow "killers" close in on her,
          Robin continues down the ladder. Wendy rushes up and
          grabs the ladder.

          Wendy grins and shakes the ladder. The chanting is
          deafening. Robin hugs the wooden slats. Wendy shakes
          even harder. Robin screams. Nick moves around Wendy
          to get a better look. He accidentally bumps the glass
          stacked next to the opening. The sudden movement is
          just enough to dislodge a razor-sharp pane of glass and
          send it hurtling down directly at Robin.
          The girl's last scream catches in her throat as the
          glass slices through her neck. She is instantly
          decapitated.
          Horrified, Wendy watches the glass and the body crash
          to the concrete basement floor. Kelly screams. Jude
          sobs loudly. Nick can only stare in shock. Finally,

          We slowly TILT UP TO the tortured features of RAYMOND
          HAMMOND, Robin's father. A handsome, dark-haired man
          in his late thirties, he teaches history at George
          Winston High School.
          Wracked with grief, he stands near the opening in the
          floor and watches as two Paramedics bring up the body
          of his daughter from the dark basement.
          A young Policeman standing nearby raises the white
          sheet covering Robin's remains. Hammond steps up
          and gazes at his daughter's decapitated body. A
          look of absolute horror and revulsion freezes
          on his face; what he sees he will never forget.
          Paralyzed, Hammond barely hears the CAR PULLING UP
          in front of the construction site. He turns and
          looks out the window.

          VIVIAN HANMOND, Robin's mother, appears pale and
          haggard as she steps out of the car. Kim and Alex
          slowly climb out of the back, With the Police Officer
          escorting her, Vivian and her children move toward

          snaps her purse shut. Hammond says nothing.
          Just as the elevator doors slide open, the Cleaning Wo-

          in fright.

          McBride steps out into the hallway. Nick grabs his

          Alex is alone in the large room. ROCK MUSIC BOOMS out
          of two huge SPEAKERS suspended from the ceiling. Alex
          sits behind a console, flipping switches and turning
          dials, electronically distorting the music.
          A wall TELEPHONE RINGS.. Caught up in his own manufac-

          RINGS, he reluctantly leaves the console and answers
          the phone.

          He listens, expressionless, then hangs up. He flips
          a switch on the console and the MUSIC STOPS. He sits
          there a moment, thinking. Then he turns out the lights
          and exits.

          Kim walks down the long deserted corridor. She hears
          FOOTSTEPS. She turns. No one. Shaking her head, she
          continues walking.
          The FOOTSTEPS return, louder. Kim begins to hurry.
          She rounds a corner and slips against the wall, waiting.
          Silence. With a deep breath, she moves on to her
          locker.
          Kim quickly twists the dial on the combination lock and
          yanks open the door. Grabbing several books she slams
          the door shut.
          A mop HANDLE CRASHES into the locker, missing her head
          by inches. The SHARP REPORT echoes down the corridor.
          Terrified, Kim jumps back, spins around. Sykes is
          standing there.

          hardwood floor. She stops, waits to recover her breath.
          The room glows tgith a crystalline light sparkling off
          the silver decorations put up for the Prom. Stretched
          across the bleachers is a banner reading: "DISCO

          MADNESS."
          Gazing around, Kim feels the excitement of anticipation.
          Imagining herself in Nick's arms, she begins to dance,
          whirling through the gym to the music in her head.
          Suddenly, someone is clapping, slowly.

          He spins around. Another bank of lights flares at
          him. He staggers downstage. The curtains begin to
          swing open. Startled, he jumps away from them. His
          foot lands on a package of photo-flood bulbs.. There's
          a LOUD POP. Then a VOICE.

          Hammond, shaken, looks across to the far wing. There's
          an elevated platform where the electronic control panel
          is located. Alex peers down.

          52 INT. CLASSROOM (LAB) - DAY 52

          First period biology class features MONTY WELLER, a
          tall, thin Englishman in his late thirties. This stuf-
          fy, dour science teacher drones on about the joys of ex-
          ploring frog vertebrae while most of his class naps,
          daydreams or passes notes.
          Seated in the back near the door, Jude is furtively
          opening a handwritten note. She quickly reads it.
          Stifling a giggle, she looks up to see Kim and Vicki
          across the aisle, eagerly awaiting her reply. Jude
          tears out part of a page from her biology book and
          scrawls her answer. Folding the note, she taps the boy
          next to her and motions for him to pass it on.
          Vicki grabs the note from the boy. Quickly scanning
          it, she nods, impressed. Kim reads it and mouths the
          word "Wow" to Jude who blushes happily.
          Glancing out into the hallway, Jude notices Slick walk-
          ing past. Seeing her in class, he stops and waves.
          Jude frantically tries to motion him away. Their backs
          to the door, Kim and Vicki watch with curiosity as Jude
          gestures in their direction. Seeing her friends
          watching her, Jude smiles and tries to ignore Slick.
          Not to be denied, he exaggeratedly mimes Weller, nose
          to his textbook, lecturing on, oblivious to his class.
          Jude laughs in spite of herself. Kim and Vicki turn
          around.
          Glancing out the door, the two girls stare in disbelief
          at the small weird curly-haired boy doing a perfect im-
          itation of the eminently boring Weller. Their surprise
          turns to hilarity as they realize this boy must be
          Jude's prom date. Kim holds up the note, raising her
          eyebrows as she gestures toward Slick. Jude nods. Kim
          and Vicki can barely contain their laughter. They do
          not notice Mr. Weller eyeing them suspiciously as he
          rattles on about frog intestines. Slick mouths the
          words, "See you at lunch.., in the van." Jude nods and
          smiles.
          With a final bow and a wave, he exits.
          Kim suddenly looks up to find a red-faced Mr. Weller
          looming above her.

                         WELLER

          Wide-eyed, Kim desperately tries to crush the note in
          her hand.

          A hand is flipping through the pages of the Winston
          High yearbook, the back pages where the individual
          photographs of graduating students are placed. The
          hand stops, moves across an open page to a smiling head
          shot of Nick McBride.
          The hand rips the picture from the page, sets it down
          on a plain wooden desk alongside three other pictures
          -with similar torn edges. The other pictures are of

          Hammond is talking on the telephone. He appears agi-
          tated, running his fingers through his hair and tugging
          at the knot in his loosened tie.

          The door opens and Adele Cooper's head peers around the
          corner. Seeing Hammond talking on the phone, she nods
          toward the outer office. Hammond gestures for her to
          wait. She persists until he angrily takes the receiver
          from his ear and covers the mouthpiece.

          65 EXT. CEMETERY - HAMMOND PLOT - DAY 65

          There's a small marble headstone inset with the carved
          face of an angel and the inscription "Robin Anne Hammond
          1964 - 1973 Too Soon Taken From Us."
          Kneeling beside the grave is Vivian Hammond. She's ar-
          ranging a large bouquet of mixed flowers, fussing with
          them, trying for some kind of impossible perfection.

          looks at them both. Her eyes hold a terrible rage, a
          terrible sadness. Hammond carefully guides her away.
          Kim has a flower of her own, a white rose, which she
          drops on her sister's grave. She turns, meets Alex's

          66 EXT. TENNIS COURTS DAY

          During the afternoon phys. ed. class, the girls play
          tennis: Kim with Kelly and Vicki with Jude. Sykes
          lingers nearby, watching the girls. Their instructor
          is Miss HENRI-ANNE BENTON, a stocky woman in her late
          thirties with teased, lacquered hair. A product of
          genteel Southern womanhood, Henri-Anne stalks the
          courts in her baggy Bermuda shorts, constantly blowing
          a silver whistle hanging from her neck.
          A very stoned, giggling Jude runs Vicki ragged, hitting
          balls over the fence, straight up in the air and occa-
          sionally even back over her head. Each time a ball
          flies over the fence, Vicki runs to retrieve it to the
          delight of Sykes.
          At one point, Vicki bends over to pick up a ball under
          Sykes' appreciative gaze. The shrill WHISTLE inter-
          rupts her as Henri-Anne rushes over.

          Kim and Kelly look at each other, laugh, turn their
          faces back to the steaming water. Neither one hears
          the SOUND across the room, a HARSH RHYTHMIC HEAVY

          BREATHING.
          Kelly bends her head away from the water, clears her
          eyes., She squints out through the steam at the big
          wall mirror across the room. She sees something. She
          steps back into Kim, her eyes wide with fear.

                         KIM
          Watch it...
          Kelly covers her breasts with her arms, presses against
          the wall, terrified.
          Suddenly there's an EXPLOSION of SOUND. Kim screams,
          jumps back, stares. There's a jagged hole in the cen-
          ter of the mirror, huge cracks radiating from it,
          spidering across its surface.
          For a moment no one moves. Splinters of GLASS TRICKLE
          down to the floor. There's no other sound. Kim grabs
          for her towel, steps out of the shower, looks. There's
          no one. She heads for the locker room door. Kelly
          runs after her.

          Kim rushes into the room, Kelly right behind her.
          There's no one. Kelly is quivering. She clutches at
          Kim's arm. Kim looks at her.

                         KIM
          What did you see?
          Kelly just shakes her head.

          Kim heads for the exit door across the room. Kelly
          stays with her.

          Kim opens the outside door, peers down the walkway to
          the tennis courts, playing fields. There's no sign of
          anyone. She closes the door.

          What the girls see is the mirror. Something has

          it.

          Kim turns a corner, heading for class, and almost runs
          into Sykes, cleaning the floor. Sykes turns. For a
          moment their eyes lock. Then Kim hurries away, almost
          running. Sykes stares after her.

          Several students are putting last-minute touches on the
          decor as Kim comes in. Huge speakers are being hoisted
          on pulleys to hang from the ceiling. A vast, raised
          platform covers much of the gym floor, its plexiglass
          surface designed to be illuminated from below. Perched
          on a ladder, Weller is hanging shimmering silver strips

          through her purse.

          It was on my dressing table, I set

          She's looking around Kim's room as if she expects to
          see it.

          95 INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT 95

          Hammond stands in front of a hall mirror, straightening
          his bow tie. He seems agitated, nervous. He turns as
          Vivian starts down the stairs. He looks surprised at
          her outfit. There's a certain similarity between it
          and his own formal suit.

                         HAMIM0ND
          My God, we're going to look like
          twins.
          Vivian stops dead, looks at him. Hammond forces a
          smile.

          I told you I'd bought it.

                         HAMMOND
          Of course you did.
          He opens the door for her. She pauses to check herself
          in the mirror.

          He puts an arm around her, kisses her gently on the
          cheek. She just stares at herself in the mirror.

          Hammond takes Vivian's arm as they step outside, walk
          toward the car in the driveway.

          97 INT. PARKED CAR - POV 97

          Someone is watching Hammond and Vivian from a car
          parked across and just down the street. A shadow moves
          in the foreground, in the front seat of the car.

          Hammond guides his wife to their family car, opens the
          passenger door for her_ He looks past her, down the

          Alex's dark eyes stare back unseeing at his family.
          His resemblance to his dead twin sister is uncanny.
          His hair falls onto his forehead in bangs, as Robin's
          had done seven years before. His makeup has been slop-
          pily applied. The rouged cheeks and the smudged red
          lips amplify the grotesque impersonation.
          Kim strokes her brother's hair. Hammond presses his
          hysterical wife to him. The onlookers slowly close in.
          We SLOWLY DISSOLVE FROM Alex's face TO a photograph of
          the Hammond family taken seven years earlier. We MOVE
          IN CLOSE ON the twins. Alex and Robin are smiling.
