          EXT. FERRY LANDING - NEW ENGLAND SHORE - DAY
          The sparkling waters. The chirping spring day. We are on an isolated
          stretch of country shore , and a quiet, sheltered island is visible
          distantly across the Sound. There is asense of anticipation,
          excitement. VOICES can be heard. THE CAMERA is the POV of a VIDEO
          CAMERA, and a group of college kids wait just o.s. On-screen, however,
          for the moment, a proper, sweet-faced young COED faces the camera and
          -- reluctantly, under the urging of her friend behind the video lens -
          - sets the scene.

          Preppy, the perfect image of the lazy spoiled, indulged, and reckless

          A late model Detroit sedan slows at the intersection, turning off the
          highway to take the junction in the direction Rob is going. A road
          sign indicates: "BAR HARBOR MOUNT DESERT" in another direction.
                         
          Rob hefts his gear, hurrying to flag the sedan.

          Clara comes clopping down the steps. Muffy turns, the mannequin's arm
          still in her hand. Old workclothes and a head kerchief take the place
          of Muffy's normally impeccable prep Seven Sisters outfit (including
          the regulation penny loafers) in all this dust. Early 20's, pretty in
          an off-beat sort of way, Muffy is every inch a blue-blood.

          (continuing with her work)
          Nope, you're a peach, Clara. But this one's mine. I told my father I'd
          do it, and I will. My way. I don't want him to have any excuses.

          Bye, Clara. See you Monday.
                         
          Soon there's the upstairs SOUND of the kitchen door closing behind
          Clara.
          Muffy finally props the mannequin, clearing away the remaining
          clutter. She goes to open a basement window for ventilation. It is a
          ground-level transom, hinged at the top. Through it Clara is visible
          departing the grounds.
                         
          Then Muffy hears a DRIPPING. She turns, hesitating, and follows the
          sounds.
                         
          INT. UTILITY ROOM
                         
          Part of the basement, an old washroom and more, with tub, slop sink
          and large incinerator. Muffy enters, pulling the chain on the bare,
          overhead bulb. It illuminates the room, and the tub underneath --
          slightly rusty at the drain, but otherwise spotless -- and the slowly
          dripping faucet.

          neo-punk neck curl and button-down shirt. He shoulders his lightweight
          videopak again, taping it. Arch and Skip watch with him from the end
          of the pier. But Kit and Nikki, waiting nearer the office, are
          distracted by the SOUND of an arriving car.

          gets out quickly, dragging a hefty suitcase out of the back seat. She
          is an unfamiliar face to Kit and Nikki --a shy, earnest, small-town

          Then, very faintly at first, WE HEAR something -- it sounds like
          crying. As it grows gradually louder we realize that it is crying -- a
          baby crying.
                         
          Nan appears suddenly in the bathroom doorway. A towel is wrapped
          around her. She listens.
                         
          The crying is louder now, but muffled -- a baby crying for its mother.
          It seems to come from a large mahogany wardrobe on the other side of
          the room.
                         
          Nan tenses, slowly approaohing, then flinging open the wardrobe door.

          A small cassette recorder plays. The tape runs out. The baby's cries
          stop.
          Nan rips out the cassette, and sinks back onto the bed, burying her
          head in her hands.
                         
          INT. ROB and KIT'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Rob and Kit are standing together staring INTO CAMERA. REVERSE to see
          the object of their attention. Hanging on the wall in front of them is
          a large oil portrait with the eyes out out. Something is moving behind
          the canvas Â­watching them.
                         
          Rob steps forward and lifts the painting off the wall. Behind it is an
          inset bookcase. Sitting on one of the shelves, at the proper height to
          have lined up with the holes in the portrait, is a child's Felix-the-
          cat nursery clock. The eyes of the plastic cat move back and forth,
          like a pendulum marking seconds.
                         
          INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Rob sets the painting on the floor outside their bedroom door, leaning
          it up against the wall.
                         
          CAMERA DOLLIES IN for a CLOSE UP of the portrait. It looks much
          creepier with the now vacant eye sockets.
                         
          INT. ROB AND KIT'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          They are undressing on opposite sides of the bed. The silence between
          them is thick enough to be cut with a knife. Kit sits down slowly on
          the edge of the bed and quietly slips under the covers. Rob gets in on
          his side.
                         
          They sit in silence for a moment, making no move to join each other in
          the middle of the bed.
                         
                         KIT

                         KIT
          You still angry with me? About dinner?
                         
                         ROB
          No. I'm sorry. I'm not angry with you. I'm just angry.
                         
          He leans over, turns off the bedside lamp... and the light in the
          bathroom comes on. Beat.
                         
          He gets out of bed and crosses to the bathroom, reaches in
          and turns off the light...
          ...and the overhead light comes on. Kit starts to laugh and quickly
          covers her mouth. Rob walks to the door, turns off the overhead
          light...
                         
          ...and the bedside lamp comes on again. Kit laughs harder, but still
          tries to stifle it.
                         
          Rob shoots her a look, then goes and sits on the edge of the bed. He
          reaches to turn off the bedside lamp again, then thinks better of it
          and starts to unscrew the bulb instead.
                         
                         ROB

          Ouch! Jesus!
                         
          Kit can't stop herself any longer. She laughs out loud. Rob
          perseveres, finally unscrewing the bulb enough to plunge the room into
          darkness.
                         
          Silence.
                         
                         ROB
          Very funny.
                         
          Kit breaks up laughing again. To her it is funny. And soon Rob is
          laughing too. He swings his legs up under the covers beside her.
                         
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Muffy turns off the last of the lights downstairs, leaving the porch
          light on for Skip.

          Goodnight, Arch.
                         
          Gently but firmly, she extricates herself, closing the bedroom door
          behind her.
                         ARCH
                         
          Undaunted, he scuttles down the hall to Rob and Kit's closed door to
          listen in. He frowns, the slides farther down to Nikki's room, knocks
          once softly, and enters.
                         
                         HIS POV
                         
          Nikki is already occupied, however, with Chaz. She catches Arch's
          stare, signalling him to get the hell out.

          Arch valorously steps back, closing the door and returning to try Nan.
                         
          The light underneath her door flicks off, however. The door is also
          locked.
                         
          Arch curses, returning to his large but empty room. He slams the door
          for everybody's benefit.

          INT. ARCH'S ROOM - NIGHT
          Arch is pacing the bedroom, horny and alone. He gets an idea, goes and
          rummages through Chaz' stuff and comes up with a video cassette of a
          porno movie.
                         
          Carrying -the cassette he crosses to the door and turns the handle.
          The doorknob comes off in his hand.
                         
          He throws it down in disgust, goes and sits in a chair and broods. The
          chair collapses beneath him.
                         
          EXT. BACK PATH - NIGHT
                         
          Skip makes his way boldly, carelessly, drunkenly along. Overgrown
          weeds and tall spring grass choke the path, shadowing his way. He
          takes one last drink, killing the bottle, and hurls it out into the
          night.
                         
          After a long pause there is the distant sound O.S. of the bottle
          landing in water with a splash.
                         
          EXT. OLD , BOATHOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Skip emerges from the overgrowth. The abandoned old structure and its
          dock squat ahead at water's edge. Beneath the boathouse, floating in
          the water, is a grungy old skiff covered by a tarp.
          Skip turns away from the dock, and flicks his lighter among the weeds,
          finding marijuana growing there. He CACKLES with triumph.
                         
          Something MOVES nearby. He doesn't pay attention, taking out his knife
          to cull the dried leaves. He cups them in his hand against the wind,
          douses his lighter, and hurries out onto the dock to the boathouse
          entrance to prepare his joint.
                         
          INT. BOATHOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          as Skip enters. It is pitch black in here, and aside from the gentle
          lapping sounds of water against the pilings down below O.S., all is
          still.
                         
          Skip flips a lightswitch in the darkness and nothing happens. He edges
          slowly along a wall away from the door. Then he becomes aware of
          another living presence in the boathouse. It is a slow breathing
          sound--completely inhuman.
                         
                         SKIP
          Hello?
                         
          There is no answer, but the breathing continues. Then a sharp rapping
          sound very near, like a foot striking the wood flooring.
                         
                         SKIP
          Who's there?
                         
          Pause. No answer. We hear in the darkness the sound of his switchblade
          clicking open. And then he waits, straining his ears to hear.
                         
          Finally, Skip reaches into his pocket, puils out his lighter
          and flicks it on.
                         
          Something snags him from behind.
                         
          Skip gasps, helpless, as a thick rope controlled by powerful, shadowed
          hands tightens around his neck.
                         
          His knife, dried leaves and lighter cascade to the floor.

          Rob wakes, hearing the CRY from Muff's room. Kit, naked against him,
          wakes too. They hear the muffled cry again. It is not from lovemaking.
          Rob throws off the covers.

          naked from the waist up and believing herself unwatched, leans out and
          stretches, breathing in the sweet morning air.

          Her hair, normally carefully groomed, is unkempt, wild and stringy
          about her pale face. Talk about unguarded moments. Her present

          He takes the flashlight from her and reveals two more: a Barbie and a
          Ken lying next to each other with no clothes on, both of them
          splattered with bright red nail polish.

          outside the window the Constable's flare hanging in the night sky.

          Kit backs into the hallway. Downstairs O.S. she can hear Rob moving
          about, calling for Harvey, but up here all is quiet and threatening.
                         
          She hurries silently down to Chaz' room, opens the door and steps

          in blood.
                         
          Kit reaches for the doorknob. It comes off in her hand.

          back in, to get it to work.
                         
          There's a NOISE outside the window. She turns aghast. Suddenly the

          Rounding the corner to the shadowy back stairs, Rob suddenly bumps
          into something, someone there. He screams aloud, dropping his
          flashlight.
                         
          It is Harvey. His body dangles from the rafters high above the top of
          the rear stairs, a thick rope around his neck.
                         
          Now Rob has become unnerved, and it is Kit's turn to take the lead.

          The flarelight wanes. Constable Potter looks up anxiously. Soon he
          will be waiting in darkness . (Unlike the previous night's scene, now
          there are no outdoor lights on here.)

          Rob and Kit burst out of the dining room as if the house were on fire.
          Kit stops to pull the doors shut behind them.

          Within moments they have crossed the back yard and disappeared into
          the brush leading down to the water.
                         
          EXT. PATHWAYS - NIGHT
                         
          The night is a landscape of terror. As Rob and Kit race through the
          darkness, the forest seems to fold in on top of them, completely
          enclosing them within itself.

          They arrive at the water's edge and slow down abruptly. Though they
          can see Potter's boat rocking gently in the water, moored to the dock,
          they cannot make out any sign of the Constable.

          Rob unlashes the mooring, grabbing hold of the line to pull the boat
          in. It won't budge, the line snagged in the water where it dips in.
          Rob tugs harder, freeing something to the surface.

          under its tethered weights.
          An animal cries out behind them. Rob wastes no more time, pulling the
          rope and the boat quickly toward them. They jump in.
                         
          There is a flashlight in the toolbox. Rob grabs it, shining it onto
          the controls. But there's no key in the ignition, and no other way to
          start it.

          INT. ENTRY HALL - SAME
                         
          ...and to the front door as Kit's screams O.S. fade to silence. Muffy
          yanks on the door handle, but the door will not open. She pulls again
          and again desperately, but it won't budge,
          She turns and runs out of the entry hall. Just as she CLEARS FRAME,
          the front door swings silently open...
                         
          INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME
                         
          Muffy is racing past the back stairs toward the kitchen when A HAND
          reaches out from the pantry and hooks her around the face.
                         
          She is pulled backward, screaming, through the swinging door into the
          darkened pantry.

          It is Skip!
                         
          He pulls her head back, exposing her throat. He raises a knife to it,
          still stained with Kit's blood.
                         
                         SKIP

          Skip! No! ! !
                         
          He makes a move to slit her throat, when Muffy kicks open
          the swinging door and sees...
                         
                         HER POV
                         
          ...standing on the other side, smiling, in various states of fake
          blood and mess... Rob, Kit, Nikki, Chaz and Nan. Muffy's eyes pop out.
          Skip's hands relax. And the others burst out laughing.

          A SIGN being lifted into the air. It reads:

          customers to the door.
