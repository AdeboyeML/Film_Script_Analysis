          across from the EES execs. An easel behind Hertz shows a

          same suit, the same sombrero, but shorter and swarthier.

          feigns total innocence.
                         
          George is now even shorter. Still another actor. His
          clothes are baggy, and the sombrero is starting to slide down

          making a face.

          geezers beside him raise their arms stiffly, as if they were
          being pulled by strands of fishing line, which they are.

          young autograph hound toting a stack of scrapbooks and
          memorabilia.

          Ernie nods and yanks the bag away from under Stuey. They run
          away down the corridor. Stuey chases them, holding up an 8
          by 10 photo.

          IN THE HALLWAY
                         
          It's a dead end. Rick and Ernie are trapped. Ernie gives
          Rick a sheepish look. Stuey stands at the entrance of the
          hallway. He holds up a Time magazine.

          A SEXY STEWARDESS pours champagne for Rick and Ernie. The
          anarchist sits nearby with the bomb on his lap. Rick winks
          suggestively at the stewardess. She walks off, obviously not
          interested. Rick raises his glass to Ernie, oozing sleazy
          confidence.

          The plane hits turbulence, and Rick's drink flies up out of
          his glass--he catches it as it comes down. Another
          STEWARDESS helps the Anarchist put his bomb in the overhead
          compartment. Ernie ogles her. She sneers at him. We hear
          the CAPTAIN'S voice on the loudspeaker.

          Ernie nods. They're distracted by the sound of chanting.
          They squint into the distance, where they see a group of

          cubicle. He's sitting on his cot, distractedly whittling a

          the stage, runs up to Kevin and hugs him. Kevin is shocked,
          of course. Overcome by the moment, Rick regresses to his old

          Worm muscles Rick out of the way and sits at the console.
          Using a pen held in his mouth, he flicks a series of switches
          and punches a fast series of computer keys.
                         
          The light on top of the Tasty Freekz machine starts to
          revolve, and after a couple of seconds, a stream of GOOEY
          LIGHT BROWN GLOP oozes out of the spigot.

          The Worm rushes over to the container of glop below the
          spigot, and without hesitation, plunges his face into it!
          Rick, Julie, and Ernie gasp in horror!
                         
          The WORM lifts his glop-smeared face out of the bowl, and
          smacks his lips in delight.

           Butterscotch pudding. I just

          Stuey checks to make sure nobody's watching him. They're
          not. He removes the spring from a pocket pen and picks the
          lock. Stuey searches the floor, and spots the Pepsi cup.
          He'll have to crawl through several pairs of legs to reach
          it.

          Stuey has to duck the fast approaching legs. Bill steps over
          him, not even noticing he's there.
                         
          Bill takes Elijah's "Freak World" graphic off an easel, and
          replaces it with his own. Finding no place to deposit
          Elijah's, he simply drops it on the floor. Elijah looks a

          Stuey heads towards the Pepsi cup. He brushes against the
          back of Hertz's legs. Hertz looks over at Elijah beside him,
          who smiles politely. Hertz smiles back, invitingly. Maybe
          there's a few things we don't know about him.

          he's crawling under the table towards the door. He brushes
          up against the back of Elijah's legs.
                         
          Elijah looks over to Hertz, who gives him that smile again.

          Stuey stands up on his seat and waves the cup, totally
          blocking the biker's view. He telepathically replies.

          its feet and snarls down at the biker. The biker pulls a
          switchblade and jams it into Stuey monster's leg--the blade
          crumples on his armor-like hide. Stuey grins and SLAM! He
          drives the biker into the ground like a railroad spike. He
          leaps onto the stage and stalks Elijah.

          Rick and Julie turn and see Stuey, still a ten foot tall

           Right, Coog. I learned somethin'

           equals. That the human spirit

           appearance, and thus it is immune
           to the petty degradations men may
           devise. I believe it was Moliere

          again. Ernie hands the gun to Stuey, who shoots them dead.
          Well, dead-ish. Seconds later, after some more waving, they
          attack again. This time Nosey and the Bearded Lady stab them
          to death, sort of. A little more waving, before Elijus and
          Elly Lee make another pathetic attempt. They can barely
          stand. Cowboy clubs one with a mic stand. Worm head-butts
          the other. A few seconds later, Elijus's bloodied hand
          gropes its way over the top of the studio couch. Stuey has
          to prop him up while members of the audience are invited down
          to punch him in the chops. Ernie stands off to the side,
