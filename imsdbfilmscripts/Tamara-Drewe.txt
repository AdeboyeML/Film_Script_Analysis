           Andy Cobb, early thirties, is digging an English garden in
           the hot sun. He is lean, naked to the waist. It's hard to
           tell which century he inhabits. Only when he stops to drink
           from a plastic bottle do we realise he is of our time.

           TESS (V.O.)
           And love slipped the bonds of
           restraint...
           At a table under a willow tree sits Tess - early fifties,
           funky specs - at a laptop. She pauses in her typing, staring
           at Andy.

           TESS (V.O.)(CONT'D)
           His touch was like a cosmic `yes'.
           Underneath a converted barn, cross-legged on a bench in a
           bikini top, sits Eustacia. She is hunched over a note pad,
           writing at tremendous speed, oblivious to all but her work.

           EUSTACIA (V.O.)
           `Fuck you,' screamed Kelly, `Fuck

           spit flew.'

          1A INT. DAY. GLEN'S ROOM. 1A

           Sitting at a barn window is American academic Glen McCreavy ;
           a physically awkward man, more at home with his intellect
           than his body. He is surrounded by foolscap, post-it notes,
           books and markers - dominated by a poster of a dour Victorian
           - Thomas Hardy. He is writing. 

           GLEN (V.O.) 
           This complex contemporary matrix is 
           what Hardy meant by `the ache of 
           modernism.' 
           He regards it. 

                          GLEN
           Crap.
           He deletes it. He looks at his blank screen, breathing
           deeply. The only words left say `Chapter Six'.

           NICHOLAS (V.O.)
           Inchcombe had seen it all before.
           He'd seasoned it: the metallic
           smell of blood and gunshot;
           forensics hunched like vultures.
           The dreadful mundanity of murder,

           He approached Patel, who was
           stricken. She was one for whom a
           corpse was still an obscenity.

           A playground on the edge of an idyllic English village. Jody
           Long - fourteen, skinny, restless - is lying at the bottom of
           the slide gazing at the clouds. Casey Shaw, her shy, placid
           best friend, is sitting on a toddler toy, reading aloud from
           a magazine.

           A woman in an upmarket apron is taking a tray of scones and
           biscuits out of the aga. It's Beth Hardiment. Once pretty,
           she's now mumsy and countrified.
           She examines her baking, satisfied with its perfection.
           Mary, the help, is doing the washing-up.

           The blight on this rural paradise is a vandalised bus shelter
           near the only T-junction in the village. A twee shop, hanging
           baskets and Grade II listed buildings make up the view. It's
           shatteringly dull.
           Casey and Jody walk up towards the bus shelter. Their boredom

          11A EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN. OUTSIDE THE PUB. 11A

           The driver brakes, swerves and comes to a halt. Tamara Drewe
           gets out. She's twenty eight, startlingly beautiful. She
           looks around shocked, for the culprit.
           The immaculate, picturesque street is deserted. Tamara takes
           it in, with an expression of such distaste that it might as
           well be a landfill site.

                          TAMARA
           What a dump.
           As she drives away, we see Nadia sitting outside the pub in
           her urban heels, anxiously smoking a cigarette.

           Tamara drives up to an old farmhouse. She gets out of the car
           and stands at the gate. Air of neglect; dark windows. Tamara
           looks at the place as if it stirs memories. She doesn't move.

           At the back of the house Tamara walks through an overgrown,
           neglected garden. She peers through the back door into the
           kitchen. A thin layer of dust on the surfaces; a sense of
           recent abandonment.
           Suddenly a pigeon flies out from the porch eaves - just over
           her head. Tamara startles. It completely spooks her. She
           backs away. She doesn't know what to do.

           Beth, tears stinging, picks a plant out of the tub by the

           Nicholas shrugs. To Glen's horror, he starts to cry.

                          NICHOLAS
           I'm sorry.
           Then Beth is sobbing too. They are in each other's arms,
           holding each other.

           I don't know why I'm like this. I
           couldn't do without you.
           Glen looks away from the clinch, horribly embarrassed. He
           opens the toilet window, puts the soap dish straight. Looks
           again - still hugging, sobbing, kissing - puts his hand on
           the flush - too awful to reveal himself - takes it off again.
           Straightens his hair, examines his teeth, sweating.
           He looks again. At last the emotion is abating. Nicholas
           releases Beth. She wipes her eyes.

           Me too.
           Beth goes. Nicholas is watching her; his expression strange.
           He walks away. At last Glen emerges, incredulous at Nicholas'
           lies.

           Casey is still carrying this image as she serves a tray of
           nibbles on the patio. She stands among the writers, watching 
           a fly get caught in one of the vol-au-vents.

           People talk about the muscularity in 
           prose. I want a similar muscularity 
           in my verse. I don't want a poetry 
           that's flabby or obese - that's why I 
           adhere to the tightest rhyme schemes: 
           Diggory picks the vol-au-vent up and without looking, puts it 
           in his mouth. Casey moves over to Nicholas and Glen.

           I've been pretty distracted. Most
           recently by those delicious cookie
           things that Beth brought round this

          Nicholas walks away leaving Glen smarting. The female writers
          surround Nicholas. He tops them up, full of charm. Under his
          breath, Glen impersonates:

          Tamara Drewe is climbing the stile at the bottom of the

           back and hits Andy. His nose streams blood.

           Tamara is in her shorts and boots, chucking empty bottles and
           old saucepans into the skip, like an Amazon.

           Nicholas is at the hedge, looking down the valley towards

           Nicholas is still staring at Tamara, who is jumping on the
           stuff in the skip. Glen is strolling up the hill from the
           pub. He follows Nicholas' gaze.

           Tamara, hot and dirty, runs up the stairs with her roll of
           bin liners. She opens the door to her mother's bedroom.
           She is completely unprepared for it. A neat, womanly room
           covered in photographs of Tamara as a child, teen and young
           woman. On the dressing table is a lipstick; the lid lying
           next to it as if it has just been used. Tamara picks it up.
           She sits, suddenly exhausted. For the first time, she looks
           lost.

           Beth is tending to Ingrid - making sure she's not scared by
           the noise. Ingrid looks as if she couldn't give a damn. Over
           by the barn she sees Glen, unaware that he's being watched,
           breaking out of a mournful walk to groove to the music. She
           smiles.
           At the other end of the farm, Nicholas is staring over the
           hedge with tissue paper ear-plugs. He pretends his arm is a
           rifle, like a little boy. He aims at the cows. He fires.

                         

          61 EXT. DAY. A ROCK FESTIVAL - THE MAIN STAGE. 61

           Swipe are playing; bit like The Libertines in their prime.
           There is one girl in the band, bass guitarist Fran Redford.
           The drummer, Ben Sergeant, is also vocals. The lead singer,
           Steve Culley, is mixed-race; confident and charismatic.
           He is getting very up-close and personal with Fran. Ben is
           getting more and more furious.
           In the wings, we see Tamara talking to a publicist, trying to
           make herself heard above the roar of the music. She is
           pointing at Steve and Fran. The publicist nods.
           Suddenly Ben leaps up and takes hold of Steve, pulling him
           away from Fran. There is a scuffle, Fran trying to separate
           the boys. Ben takes a microphone.

                          BEN
           Sorry people. I resign. Swipe is no
           more. Steve Culley is a cunt.
           Ben storms off the stage. The audience are in uproar.

           You fucking baby.
           Ben falls. He virtually lands on Tamara. They both hit the
           ground. Steve storms off - Fran following, calling his name.
           Ben is dazed. He looks up at Tamara.

           Tamara's car sweeps past with the roof down. It is closely
           followed by a bright yellow Porsche. Ben is driving and his

           He jumps out. Boss follows. Tamara is walking towards the
           door. The distant festival is still audible. Tamara backs
           towards the door, with Ben inches away.

                          BEN
           That's Boss.

           No, I want something else.
           Tamara grins. Jody and Casey arrive at the brow of the hill,
           breathless. They see Ben pin Tamara against the door.

           Just as Ben's about to kiss her, Tamara coolly opens the door
           and draws him into the house.

           She goes in to kiss him. But Ben grabs a pair of chopsticks
           from a utensils jar. He starts to play around Tamara, hitting
           the surfaces, the shelves and everything on them; a brilliant
           rhythm. He gets closer and closer. Tamara is utterly
           mesmerised. Ben stops. He still doesn't kiss her.

           Yeah. Falls in mystical love. Hardy
           was like that in his life, too. Even

                          (IGNORING GLEN)
           My books don't say anything
           profound. I can't pretend to be an
           intellectual - not like Glen here,
           illuminating our ignorance with his
           critical glow - but I do love prose.
           And I think I can turn a reasonable
           story.
          Glen peers into the kitchen. Beth is serving desserts.

                          GLEN
           Excuse me.
          He goes to help her, leaving the ladies around Nicholas like
          cups around a teapot.

           Let me help.

           They need dusting with this.

           I went to my room and I wrote for
           three hours. The time just
           vanished.

                          BETH
           That's great, that's brilliant.

                          GLEN
           I feel like a man who's just passed
           a gargantuan stool.

           Super. Sprig of mint on the top.
          Glen returns to the dining room with two desserts. He listens
          to Nicholas as he serves them.

           The real secret of being a writer
           is learning how to lie.
          A frisson of shock goes round the lady writers.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           Because that's what storytellers
           are. Thieves and liars...

           big and fatherly and comforting.
           Tamara feels a sense of relief, of not being alone. Her arms

           vulnerable even, as if he's left his lordly persona at the

           You write a lot about adultery. Is
           that from personal experience?
           Tamara turns round. Nicholas' colour drains. Beth is with
           Glen, close by - glaring at him. He tries to make a joke.

           humiliated. He decides not.

           In saying it, Tamara realises it's true. She walks away.
           Nicholas bends almost double in pain, letting out a great
           moan from the soul. A fan has been waiting at a respectful
           distance. He approaches.
           Nicholas numbly takes his book. Instead of signing, he tears
           it to pieces. He hands the tatters back to the fan.
