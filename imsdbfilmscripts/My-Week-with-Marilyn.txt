           Over a DARK SCREEN we see the caption:
           "This is a fairy story, an episode out of time and space,
           which nevertheless was real" - Colin Clark.
           Then, FADE UP ON:
           Newsreel footage of SIR LAURENCE OLIVIER AND VIVIEN LEIGH
           arriving back at Tilbury Docks to be greeted by an excited
           crowd of fans. As they progress down the gangplank and stop
           to sign autographs we HEAR an excited commentary OVER:

           "Returning to England are
           Britain's acting royalty Sir
           Laurence Olivier and Lady
           Olivier, better known as stunning
           Gone With The Wind star Vivien
           Leigh. Sir Laurence has added a
           new string to his bow with the
           announcement that he is to direct
           and star in a screen version of
           Terence Rattigan's stage play The
           Sleeping Prince with none other
           than Hollywood siren Marilyn
           Monroe. When the world's greatest
           actor romances the most famous
           woman alive, we can be sure that
           sparks will fly. Now, now Lady
           Olivier, don't worry - any

           It is 1956. Saltwood Castle, the family home of the Clark
           family, looms over the landscape, framed by the setting
           sun. It is majestic, an Englishman's dream of a home,
           complete with turrets and even a moat. There is a feeling
           of timeless beauty and stability about the scene, something
           profoundly English.
           We are a very long way from Hollywood.

           COLIN CLARK, 23, hurries across the lawn carrying a bag, he
           is casually dressed, boyish and handsome. He heads towards a
           beautiful, ramshackle building and through the ancient oak
           doors.

          3B INT. SALTWOOD CASTLE. LIBRARY. DAY. 3B

           As COLIN enters, he sees SIR KENNETH CLARK, standing in front
           of a painting on an easel by the Italian Baroque painter,
           Annibale Carracci. He has two STUDENTS with him, a man and a
           woman in their early 20s, and is in mid-description of the
           painting.

                          KENNETH
           ... and this is one of Carracci's
           earlier works and one is able to
           see the emergence of his now famous
           Baroque style, which is clearly
           rooted in the tradition of high
           renaissance and antiquity...
           COLIN pauses briefly and hurries towards them. Throughout the
           scene there is a sense of his urgency and desire to go. The
           whole thing should be played at breakneck pace. KENNETH beams
           affectionately.

                          KENNETH
           Colin! Come in. Have you met James
           and Anna? Two very brilliant
           pupils.
           He has the avuncular air of a benign academic, affable and a
           little eccentric. COLIN smiles hurriedly at the students, no
           time to waste.

                          COLIN
           I'm leaving for London now, Pa.

                          KENNETH
           Ah, yes. Well, bon chance, dear
           boy...
           He puts a friendly arm around COLIN's shoulder and starts to
           walk him back to the door.

                          KENNETH
           I can always get you a research
           position at the V&A when you've
           grown up a bit and got this film
           idea out of your system...
           COLIN's smiles but before he can reply JANE CLARK whirls into
           the room, a ball of energy, talking nineteen to the dozen.

                          JANE
           Kenneth, you might have told Cook
           we were another two for dinner.
           What is everyone supposed to eat?
           Cabbage soup? Oh, Colin, darling,
           there you are...

           She looks wonderful in a good quality but elderly dress,
           eccentrically combined with gardening attire, her mind on a
           dozen things at once.

                          COLIN
           I'm off now, Mama.

                          JANE
           Off?

                          COLIN
           My job interview, remember..?
           But she is already continuing her journey. COLIN smiles
           hurriedly at KENNETH, who gives him an affectionate wave as
           COLIN dashes after his mother. She leaves the Library.

           JANE strides across the lawn with COLIN rushing to catch up.

                          JANE
           Can't you stay for dinner? There's
           nothing to eat but I'm sure the
           conversation will be charming.

                          COLIN
           I don't want to be late in the
           morning.
           As COLIN hurries after JANE he is nearly run down by an
           elderly GARDENER with a lawn mower, and has to take lightning
           evasive action. JANE doesn't notice.

                          JANE
           I'm sure they won't mind. You'll be
           a famous film director in no time.
           I know your father's put in a word.

                          COLIN
           I wish he hadn't done that. I can
           manage on my own.
           She stops so abruptly he nearly slams into her. JANE looks
           around the garden with a frown.

                          JANE
           I have to watch Jenkins like a
           hawk. One more of his murderous
           prunings and we'll lose the tea
           roses for ever.
           And she's off again, with COLIN still following. He can't
           help smiling at the madness of it all.

           The sun is setting, casting a golden glow over the castle.
           COLIN and JANE emerge from the front door, COLIN pauses in
           the driveway and dumps his bag in the back of his old but
           racy MG Sports car. Only now does JANE really turn her
           attention fully to him for the first time.

                          JANE
           Now go and have a lovely time,
           darling. We're always here when
           you're ready to talk your future.
           COLIN wants to protest but before he can get the words out
           JANE sees a YOUNG GARDENER walking at the side of the house
           with a wheel barrow. Her face lights up.

                          JANE
           Mullins! Be an angel - find Cook
           and ask her how many pork chops we
           need for tonight. Then bring the
           car round. I must get to the
           village before the shop shuts...
           She dashes away after the GARDENER, turning back as an
           afterthought to blow a kiss at COLIN as she goes.
           COLIN smiles, then pauses for a moment to look at the house.
           We can sense both his affection for it but more pressingly
           his need to get away.
           He gets in, puts the car in gear and the Bristol pulls out of
           the drive and across the moat. In the last rays of the sun,
           the countryside looks magical, but Colin only has eyes for
           the road ahead.

           A sharp contrast with the hazy beauty of the countryside.
           It is early morning in the heart of London's West End. The
           streets hum with activity as OFFICE WORKERS in hats and
           raincoats stream from the tube stations.
           COLIN pushes his way through the early morning crowds in
           Piccadilly. This is his patch; he is very much at home
           here, negotiating the busy streets with ease. As he passes
           by the upmarket Burlington Arcade a TAILOR pauses in
           measuring a suit for a client to give him a familiar wave.
           COLIN waves back.

           Checking his watch he runs the last few yards then stops
           outside the imposing facade of 144 Piccadilly. A plaque
           outside the door announces: LAURENCE OLIVIER PRODUCTIONS.
           Colin fingers his carefully knotted tie to make sure
           everything is correctly in place, then goes to the door and
           rings the bell.

           The reception area is luxurious - deep pile carpets and
           plush sofas. VANESSA, the beautiful secretary, sits behind
           her imposing desk, gazing doubtfully at COLIN.

           hear a man answer in an office down the hall, his voice
           carrying irritably.

           She stresses the proper name in disapproval of Colin's
           familiarity.

           HUGH PERCEVAL (40s) is Laurence Olivier's production
           executive. He is tall and gloomy, with black-rimmed
           spectacles and thinning dark hair. He looks at COLIN grimly
           as he stuffs his pipe with tobacco.

           Well, what do you want?

           A new morning. COLIN perches restlessly on the sofa.
           Despite his modest triumph he is back where he started. The
           seconds pass in dull silence. He is beginning to think his
           campaign will fail. But then, in a heartbeat, everything
           changes.
           He looks up in surprise as the door bursts open and SIR
           LAURENCE OLIVIER strides in with his wife VIVIEN LEIGH on
           his arm.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 10.

                         
          At the age of 49 SIR LAURENCE OLIVIER is at the peak of his
          fame. He is handsome and charismatic, and VIVIEN is
          scarcely less extraordinary. The Gone With The Wind star
          remains classically lovely, flirtatious and captivating.
          Individually they are charismatic enough, but together they
          are electrifying, seeming to charge the air around them
          with the power of their personalities, galvanising anyone
          who comes into contact with them.
          VANESSA leaps to her feet and PERCEVAL hurries to greet
          them as COLIN stands up uncertainly. OLIVIER is all amiable
          bluster and bonhomie.

                          OLIVIER
           Do you know, Hughie, it is simply
           impossible to get Marilyn Monroe on
           the telephone? The darling girl
           spends the entire day asleep. But
           great beauty has its way...
          He laughs, but then notices VIVIEN's less than enthusiastic
          response. Seeking refuge in some distraction he notices
          COLIN hovering by the sofa.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           Hello, boy... remind me?
          He smiles vaguely and glances at VIVIEN for help.

                          VIVIEN
           You remember Colin, darling. You
           met him at the Clarks' party.

           You said there might be a job on

          OLIVIER has no recollection of this and fumbles in his
          pockets to cover his confusion, bringing out a packet of
          cigarettes and offering them to COLIN with breezy charm.

                          OLIVIER
           Have a cigarette. Keep the pack.
          He turns quickly to PERCEVAL.

          He puts an arm around PERCEVAL's shoulders and they
          disappear together into Perceval's office.
          VIVIEN lingers behind, smiling radiantly at COLIN who looks
          dumbly at the packet of cigarettes in his hand. He now sees
          they are called "Oliviers". VIVIEN wrinkles her nose in
          amusement.

           They named them after Larry. The

           have his own brand and they pay
           him an absolute fortune. (Pause)

           I suppose he's all right.
          VIVIEN's eyes sparkle. OLIVIER emerges from the office with a
          handful of script pages and VIVIEN looks at him slyly,
          getting her own back for his tactless over-praise of
          Marilyn's charms as she strokes COLIN's cheek.

           Olivier glances over with a faint look of exasperation.
           VIVIEN winks at COLIN and takes her husband's arm.

           something for Colin. You
           absolutely promised.
           OLIVIER looks hunted. There is no way out. He glances back
           at PERCEVAL as he comes in.

           COLIN knocks and walks into Perceval's office, carrying a
           tray with tea and a plate of biscuits. The blinds are closed
           and a 16mm projector is running; silent images play on a fold-
           up screen in the corner of the room.
           Framed in the light of the projector are PERCEVAL and the
           film's lighting cameraman JACK CARDIFF. They take no notice
           of Colin.
           He looks up at the screen. The two men are watching make-up,

           The film shows Marilyn looking sweet and pretty, chatting
           silently to someone just off camera, mugging playfully in
           costume, larking about with her hair - and then, when she
           wants to, turning on her full film star wattage and looking
           wonderful, every inch the beautiful icon.
           It is an intimate glimpse of her at work. Colin watches,

           pugnacious figure in his mid-forties. He waits impatiently
           outside Olivier's office, a stack of newspapers under his

           He winds down his window and simply throws the whole lot
           out into the lane. The pages billow out in a great cloud
           behind the speeding car, landing in the pretty hedgerows
           and on neat front lawns.

           me for much longer. Not even you.
           He goes to protest but she stills him with a finger to his
           lips, her smile quickly restored.

          44 EXT. DOG AND DUCK PUB. DAY. 44

           The Dog and Duck is a rundown pub in an out of the way lane
           near the studios. It is a rough, local place utterly devoid
           of glamour or comfort. COLIN stands outside, staring at it
           grimly, his bag in his hand.

           A few hard-core LOCALS stand nursing their pints at the bar.
           One is idly throwing darts. The wallpaper is faded yellow
           with cigarette smoke, stale sandwiches curl in a display
           case. COLIN looks around, his heart sinking. BARRY, the
           landlord looks him up and down, disparagingly.

                          COLIN
           Colin Clark. I booked a room.
           BARRY takes a dusty ledger from beneath the bar, spins it
           around for COLIN to sign.

                          BARRY
           What brings you up this way?

          COLIN can't help looking a little pleased with himself.

                          COLIN
           I'm here working on a film.
          The LOCALS look up from their pints, unimpressed.

                          BARRY
           What film's that?

                          COLIN
           It's called `The Sleeping Prince'.
          The darts player, ANDY, doesn't turn. His aim remains
          steady.

                          ANDY
           Sounds lousy.

                          BARRY

           you, Andy?
          ANDY doesn't look away from his game.

                          ANDY
           Can't be bothered.
          COLIN tries to impress.

                          COLIN
           Marilyn Monroe's in it. I'll be
           working with her.

                          BARRY
           Oh, will you now?
          The regulars grin unkindly into their pints. ANDY doesn't
          look away from his game, as he offers laconically:

                          ANDY
           The Queen and Prince Philip popped
           in for a pint earlier. Pity, you
           just missed them.
          There are supportive snorts of derision from the LOCALS.
          COLIN takes it on the chin. BARRY hands him a key.

                          BARRY
           The room's three quid a week, first
           week in advance. You're in number
           two.
          COLIN takes the key and his bag, just as BARRY adds, with
          perfect deadpan timing:

                          BARRY (CONT'D)
           You'll be sharing with Grace Kelly.
          The LOCALS laugh into their beer. COLIN smiles gamely.

           COLIN stands aghast. He is staying in a grim little room
           above the noisy saloon bar. The wallpaper is peeling, the
           furniture is ancient and the whole place reeks of damp.
           Dirty net curtains flutter in the window. He puts his bag
           on the bed and sits down. The mattress sags pitifully. He
           looks down and finds a stained and yellowing chamber pot
           under the bed. He slides it back with a look of revulsion.

           The principal cast of The Sleeping Prince, as it was still
           known at the time, assemble on the sound stage amongst the
           half-finished set. They chat and smoke, their scripts in
           their hands. OLIVIER stands in their midst, very much first
           amongst equals. One chair sits conspicuously unoccupied.
           DAME SYBIL THORNDIKE (74), severe-looking but kindly, very
           much the grand dame of the gathering, smiles cheerfully.
           RICHARD WATTIS leans over to her with a cheerful grin.

           COLIN stands by the door. OLIVIER looks at his watch and
           shoots him a questioning glance.

           COLIN hurries along the corridor and stops outside
           Marilyn's dressing room. He knocks on it politely.

                          COLIN
           Miss Monroe?
           The door opens sharply and a small, bohemian looking woman
           in her 50s stands staring at him. This is PAULA STRASBERG.

                          COLIN (CONT'D)

           compliments. He's ready for the

           He glances beyond PAULA to where MARILYN sits by the
           mirror, her reflection framed in the lights. She wears
           little or no make-up. PAULA looks at him sharply.

           But Marilyn is not ready. She's
           preparing.
           MARILYN glances up at COLIN in the mirror and smiles with
           unexpected simplicity.

                          MARILYN
           Excuse the horrible face.
           She finds her dark glasses on the dresser and puts them on.

           sneaks a glance at her. She has a vulnerable, lost
           expression. COLIN can't help staring at her until he
           notices PAULA looking at him and quickly glances away.

           is so excited to meet you...

           SYBIL THORNDIKE looks sweetly at MARILYN from across the
           table and indicates the empty one at her side.

           How lovely you are. Here, I kept a
           place for you.
           PAULA bursts forward, steering Marilyn away instead to an
           empty seat on the other side of the rectangle of tables. She
           looks at RICHARD WATTIS, the actor occupying the seat next to
           the empty one.

           She likes me by her side.

           behind her dark glasses. He smiles with considerable charm as
           he makes his opening speech of welcome.

           Welcome dear Marilyn, to our
           little fraternity. (Pause, looks
           around) We may seem a little

           first, but I hope that in time
           you may come to find your method
           in our madness.
           Pleased with his over-contrived rhetorical flourish, he
           gives Paula a pointed look. She glowers back, obscurely
           sensing that she has been insulted in some way. MARILYN
           also looks up in confusion at Olivier's well intentioned
           but clumsy joke.
           Oblivious to her reaction, he opens his script with a
           sentimental flourish.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           So. My very noble and approv'd

           He is momentarily close to tears. WATTIS rolls his eyes
           discreetly, earning a grin from the actor PAUL HARDWICK.
           There is a rustle of pages and a few coughs, a mood of
           eager nervousness in the air as they all prepare for the

           First light over Pinewood Studios. Although it is August it
           is chilly so early in the morning. COLIN stands by the gate
           wearing only his thin summer jacket. He blows on his hands
           to keep warm. A black car appears. The window winds down
           and DAME SYBIL THORNDIKE pops her head out.

           under the pressure of enthusiastic love-making.
           The phone rings. MILTON nods to COLIN to pick it up. COLIN
           is glad of the distraction. We hear ORTON's irate tones on

           She's kept Dame Sybil Thorndike
           waiting in full costume for two

           The door finally opens and MARILYN emerges, with PAULA on
           one side and MILTON on the other. In her figure-hugging
           shimmering white sheath of a dress she is ravishingly
           beautiful. Her hair is like a halo of light around her
           head. No one can take their eyes off her. Slowly, all work
           on the set stops. MARILYN walks to the set, acutely aware
           of the scrutiny of the crew.
           She smiles nervously, then suddenly hesitates, feeling the
           weight of everyone's attention. Anxiety flits across her
           face.
           She whispers something to PAULA and bolts back towards her

           MARILYN and PAULA are heading for the dressing room.
           MARILYN looks tired and disconnected. COLIN is just behind
           them on another errand. He can't help overhearing Paula's
           insistent, honeyed tones as she responds to Marilyn's
           uncertainty.

           You were divine.

           prayed for a great actress I
           could help and guide.
           She stops abruptly and gets down on her knees in the
           corridor in front of Marilyn. COLIN stops awkwardly, his
           path blocked.

                          PAULA (CONT'D)
           Like this. I prayed to God on my

           COLIN glances at her, seeing his chance to help.

           You really were very good, Miss

           The mood in the Club is cosmopolitan, lively but elegant.
           Rows of small tables are arranged around the stage, a few
           young couples are dancing to a jazz trio playing an
           exuberant, upbeat number. The music comes to an end and
           the couples return to their tables, COLIN and LUCY among
           them. There is champagne on the table, COLIN pours them
           both a glass.

           You're not the average third, are
           you? Most of them would be happy

           I'm not living off my parents, if

          herself. A moment later the door opens and Lucy's father, MR.
          ARMSTRONG comes in, wearing his dressing gown over pyjamas.
          He glances at COLIN with a suspicious smile as he looks at

           the uniform semi-detached houses all around him. He is
           uncomfortable here, so far from the glamorous world of his
           parents or Pinewood studios. He has a strong sense that he
           and Lucy are from very different worlds, and walks to his car

           Marilyn has to prepare properly.
           She has to find in herself all
           that lies under the surface.
           Acting isn't just a case of
           putting on a costume or some
           ludicrous false nose.
           OLIVIER gives her a freezing look then takes Marilyn's
           hand, leading her forward like a child.

           This poor girl hasn't had your
           years of experience. She is in a
           strange country, acting a strange
           part. Now, are you helping or
           bullying?
           OLIVIER looks aghast at being so roundly rebuked. COLIN
           looks on, startled.

           OLIVIER, MILTON, PERCEVAL, ORTON and the editor JACK HARRIS
           watch rushes. COLIN lurks about unnoticed at the back. They
           watch one of OLIVIER's speeches (from the " The Coconut
           Girl" sequence we saw filming in Scenes 61 and 62). He is
           dry and clipped, every take precise and professional. It is
           an effective but theatrical performance.
           MARILYN sneaks in with ARTHUR MILLER. They sit in the back
           row watching her performance from the same scene. She
           fluffs take after take, gets her words wrong and pauses,
           looking dazed. COLIN notices her clutching MILLER's hand
           tightly. But finally a good take comes up. She is charming
           and natural and her performance suddenly makes OLIVIER's
           look stiff and clumsy. MILLER smiles in relief and
           reassurance.

                          MILLER
           That one's pretty damn good. You
           knocked it out of the park.
           MARILYN glows at his praise.

                          MILTON
           When Marilyn gets it right you
           just don't want to look at anyone
           else.
           OLIVIER frowns. For all his greatness as an actor he will
           never be a film star like the maddeningly instinctive
           Marilyn. And the injustice of it is like a stab through his
           heart.
           At the back COLIN only has eyes for the screen. He watches
           MARILYN's image, enthralled. Until now he has taken Marilyn
           entirely at Olivier's valuation, but as he watches her on
           screen he begins to see things differently.

           MILLER's hand tightly, looking tense and vulnerable as one
           disastrous take follows another.

           rushes. Besides, she's an

           COLIN bursts into the dressing room without knocking.
           Clothes are strewn carelessly all over the floor. There are
           pill bottles, full and empty, on every surface, along with
           empty bottles of champagne and bunches of flowers. COLIN
           rummages around on the table, moving piles of scripts and
           books. No luck. He walks casually through the half-open
           door into the inner chamber.
           And stops dead in his tracks.
           MARILYN stands by a chair, a towel wrapped around her head.
           She is completely naked.
           She looks at him in astonishment.
           He stares back, equally astounded.
           He sees her script, heavily covered in handwritten notes,
           lying on the table next to an open bottle of champagne and
           a bottle of pills.

          MARILYN gives him a radiant smile and within seconds is

          feverish excitement grows out of nothing as people come
          running to look, pushing and shoving to see.
          MARILYN is quickly hemmed in by the heaving mob. To begin
          with she enjoys it, smiling and posing happily for the
          cameras that appear out of nowhere. But as the crowd press
          towards something in the mood of the gathering changes; it
          becomes wild and over-excited mood as people scream
          Marilyn's name and shove bits of paper to sign in her face.
          A WOMAN is pushed to the ground and MARILYN is forced back
          against the shop window. COLIN sees a flicker of panic on
          her face.

          they can to keep the excited fans at bay.
          They manage to force a path to the car, drag the door open
          and bundle MARILYN and MILLER into the back. MARILYN is
          pinned against the door and COLIN has to put his arm around
          her shoulders as he helps her in. He hurls himself into the

          watches her as she feels the crew's irritable collective
          gaze. Flustered, she flutters her hands in a calming
          gesture, then goes to the side of the set to lean on a bar
          put there for her to rest on (her costume is too tight to
          allow her to sit down). PAULA accompanies her. MARILYN

           wearing a bathrobe, her face in shadow. Pill bottles are

           MARILYN is finally back on the set, filming a solo dance
           routine. Released from the need to remember any words she
           takes refuge in the physical activity, undulating sexily in
           her tight white dress in a performance which is gawky,
           mildly silly and charming all at the same time.
           The dance is deliberately a little amateurish. Elsie Marina
           isn't meant to be any sort of superstar. But she radiates
           joy and innocence and sheer happiness in the dance, and
           MARILYN captures all this perfectly. Within the scene the
           actor JEREMY SPENSER, playing Nicky, watches from the
           doorway.
           Everyone watches silently from behind the camera. No one
           can look away, least of all COLIN. It feels like one purely
           joyful moment in the agony the film has become, and Marilyn
           is radiant. Even OLIVIER has a reluctant half-smile on his
           face as he watches.

           insecurities with one magical
           stroke. That I could make her a

           notes I made. They were nothing.
           Just a few ideas.

           totally preoccupied with her, so much so that when VIVIEN
           comes up behind him he turns guiltily as though caught out.
           VIVIEN stares at him. All her exuberance has vanished and
           she looks suddenly tired and older. It as though the facade

           didn't think the little tart
           could resist the great Laurence
           Olivier.

          seething in her expression.

           COLIN finds a woodbine in his other pocket and gives it to
           OLIVIER, who lights it with a shaking hand. He inhales
           deeply.

           casually but beautifully dressed in silk trousers and a
           pale cream shirt. COLIN looks guiltily at the brandy.

           She walks to the sideboard, standing only a few inches away
           from him. He can't take his eyes from hers. He drops his
           gaze, only to find himself staring at her breasts. He looks
           up again sharply but not before she notices. She takes the
           decanter from his hand.

          He stops, breathless, knowing he has gone to far. She
          stares at him, wide-eyed with surprise. Horribly self-
          conscious he takes a too large swig of his brandy, reddens
          and coughs. She laughs.

           turns crimson with the effort of trying to suppress his own
           laughter but MARILYN isn't helping. She teasingly makes
           shapes in the air of just how large the packages might be.
           He covers the phone, agonised, before they both collapse in
           irrepressible laughter. COLIN finally pulls himself

           He hangs up quickly. They both laugh helplessly. MARILYN
           smiles.

                          MARILYN
           Let's walk in the garden. See if
           we can find any more reporters in
           the bushes.
           She giggles. COLIN's heart contracts as she casually takes
           his arm.

           There is a golden glow on the horizon as the sun sinks.
           MARILYN, a cardigan around her shoulders, walks along the
           path. COLIN is at her side, acutely aware of her physical
           closeness.

                          MARILYN
           I didn't know it was so pretty
           out here.

                          COLIN
           You should get out more. See the
           sights.

                          MARILYN
           I am the sights.
           She giggles again, her mood lighter.

           Look at us. We're just like
           Elsie and the young King. What
           would Sir Laurence say if he
           could see us now?

                          COLIN
           I don't think he'd mind.

           MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 76.

                         
           MARILYN grows reflective. She takes COLIN's arm in a
           friendly way as they walk.

                          MARILYN
           I wanted to be an artist. To
           grow as an actor. I was so proud
           to be working with the great
           Olivier. (Pause) Now he thinks
           I'm the enemy.
           She looks at him innocently. COLIN hesitates.

                          COLIN
           He doesn't understand your kind
           of actor. He's hated the method
           ever since Vivien worked with
           Elia Kazan. It's all too new and
           strange. You're the future, and
           it frightens him.

                          MARILYN
           Every time I walk into the studio
           I feel this sense of doom come
           over me. He looks at me like
           he's smelling a pile of rotten
           fish. And the crew hate me.
           Paula is the only person I can
           trust. (Pause) Except for you
           now, maybe.
           She looks at him, her eyes huge. COLIN feels his senses
           swim as he stares into them...
           ... and then ROGER suddenly appears on the steps.

                          ROGER
           Phone call for you, Miss Monroe.
           It's Mr. Miller.
           MARILYN goes back up the path towards the house, glancing
           back briefly at Colin.

                          MARILYN
           Goodbye, Colin. Thanks for
           telling me the truth.
           COLIN stares after her. It is a second before he realises
           that ROGER is gazing at him sternly.

                          ROGER
           You'll be leaving now, I expect.

           I didn't spend the night with
           her. We just had a chat.

                          MILTON
           I heard them chuckling.
          OLIVIER offers COLIN a lewdly suggestive grin.

                          OLIVIER
           Perhaps if Colin is very
           diplomatic Marilyn is more likely
           to behave herself.

                          COLIN
           She just wants a chum, that's
           all.

                          MILTON
           A chum? Jesus Christ, what is
           this, Goodbye Mr. Chips? Grow up,
           kid.
          He barges out of the room, slamming the door behind him.
          OLIVIER checks the effect of his Grand Duke in the mirror
          and sighs abruptly.

                          OLIVIER
           I thought working with Marilyn
           would make me feel young again.
           But I look dead in the rushes.
           Dead behind the eyes.
          He gazes at himself thoughtfully.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           Perhaps I'm angry with her
           because in my heart I know my own
           career is in a terrible rut. I
           wanted to renew myself through
           her but all I see reflected in
           that magnificent face is my own
           inadequacy.
          He leans back.

                          OLIVIER (CONT'D)
           You know, I admire Marilyn. I
           really do. Despite her behaviour.
           She has taken everything
           Hollywood can throw at her and
           triumphed.
          COLIN waits, uncertain why OLIVIER is confiding in him.

           Gossip is always fast to travel but on a film it goes at
           the speed of light. As COLIN arrives on the set he is
           greeted with wolf whistles and jeers by RICHARD WATTIS,
           PAUL HARDWICK and the crew.

                          SOUNDMAN

           It is all good-natured stuff but COLIN feels strangely
           protective, not so much on his own behalf as Marilyn's.

           There are hoots of laughter. COLIN retreats to a corner
           only to find RICHARD WATTIS pursuing him.

           A brief hiatus in filming. COLIN looks on uneasily as

           attended to by LUCY.

           It has just dawned on COLIN that he has missed his date
           with LUCY. Before he can react he is jerked violently
           behind the scenery and pushed up against the wall by an
           angry MILTON.

           jealous...
           ORTON turns around frowning furiously at the voices behind
           the set. MILTON pushes COLIN off the set ahead of him.

           COLIN is put out. Up to now he has never fully confronted
           the possibility of Marilyn wanting him, but he doesn't like
           the idea being dismissed so lightly.
           Lucy sees it and her eyes widen in surprise and hurt.
           Before she can respond MARILYN herself coming towards them
           in her gown, her hair up in towel, surrounded by PAULA and
           her MAKE-UP people. She offers him a dazzling smile.

           in hard. He shrugs casually.

           are sudden tears in her eyes, which she wipes away angrily.

           collapses on it gratefully. The noise of the rowdy pub floats
           up through the floorboards. He covers his ears with his hands

          COLIN looks at him, bemused. He gets in quickly. MILTON
          frowns but shrugs and walks off with a wave.

           Before COLIN can respond he sees the curious MILTON running
           back, having spotted MARILYN in the back.

                          MILTON
           What the hell?
           He peers into the back window. MARILYN screams and buries
           herself back under the blanket. COLIN scrambles to get over
           into the back seat while ROGER stamps on the accelerator and
           the car roars off.

           make room for him.

           She threads her arm through his. He gazes down at their hands
           meshed together.
           ROGER's disapproval registers in the faintest flicker of his
           eyes.
           In the background the defeated and frustrated MILTON watches
           the car speed away.

           just for him. He feels like he's tumbling into the abyss,

           boarding school when I was eight.

           It seems to me that you've had most
           things pretty easy.

                          COLIN
           In one way, yes. But when you're
           brought up in a house of over-
           achievers, it's hard to make your
           own mark.
          She looks at him, sympathetic but pushing a little harder.

                          MARILYN
           So how are you going to do it?

                          COLIN
           Maybe it will be in films, but if
           not, there are so many
           possibilities out there.

                          MARILYN
           Sounds pretty good to me.
          She smiles warmly, liking him a lot more for his openness.
          We sense their relationship has moved quietly to a different
          and deeper level.
          But before either of them can say anything a SCHOOLBOY turns

           he simply turns and runs, shouting at the top of his voice.

           MARILYN blows kisses to them all. ROGER has to plunge into
           the crowd to rescue her. COLIN follows after them with
           difficulty. MARILYN pauses, jumping on a bench to wave
           goodbye and blow more kisses to the boys.

           clothes off. He hurries to find a bush to get changed
           behind. As he ducks down behind it he hears a splash and
           MARILYN's cry of shock as she hits the water.

           the water. She holds her head up to him.

           She tips her head back. He looks deep into her eyes - and
           suddenly she grabs him and kisses him on the lips. Before
           he can respond she laughs playfully and swims away.

           She swims happily, totally relaxed. COLIN is much more self-
           conscious, keeping one nervous eye open for pleasure boats.
           Finally she swims back into the shallows and wades to the
           shore. She glances back, catching Colin looking. He glances
           away, embarrassed.

          erection with his cupped hands. MARILYN giggles.

          arms.

           Let me warm you up.
          She snuggles into him gratefully, her teeth chattering. He
          rubs her naked back briskly, her thin blouse the only
          barrier between their bodies. Slowly his embrace becomes
          more sensual, his hands slowing, stroking rather than
          rubbing, his face buried in her hair, his arms pulling her

           I haven't had a real date since I
           was 13 years old.
          She suddenly looks much younger, her smile a poignant echo
          of a lost childhood.
          He steps back politely, allowing her to put on her blouse.
          As she buttons it, she gazes at him, then impulsively leans
          forward to kiss him chastely on the lips. The kiss is as
          sweet and innocent as any 13 year old might wish.
          The kiss lasts for a few seconds, their lips touching
          gently, the river shimmering magically in the sunshine
          behind them. When they finally break apart she rewards him
          with a radiant smile.

           real world but reluctant to face it. There is a discreet
           cough and ROGER appears.

           as she puts on the rest of her clothes. ROGER averts his
           eyes respectfully and waits for COLIN. The two men look at

           If it wasn't for me she'd still
           be on contracts that make slave
           wages look good. I gave her back
           her freedom, and now Miller's

           down to whisper at the keyhole.

          stare intently at each other, their mood fragile, touched
          with both sensuality and a longing for something less
          tangible. MARILYN leans forward and kisses him gently. The
          embrace grows in passion and they kiss properly, hungrily.
          He kisses her eyes and her face and she sighs happily.
          He wants her more than he has wanted anything before.

          weeks is within his grasp but he knows that whatever it
          does for him it will only damage her further. He pulls away
          from her gently. Her eyes flicker open lazily.

          cradle each other like spoons in a cutlery draw. As she
          buries her head in his neck he feels her breasts against

           felt is Olivier's loathing and
           contempt. He thinks I'm

           COLIN comes in with PAULA. MARILYN looks at him dully, her
           eyes clouded and unfocused. A half empty pill bottle stands
           on the side. COLIN sits down next to her and she takes his
           hand, ignoring the surprised look on Milton's face.

          MILTON looks at him grimly but finally surrenders the
          field. Paula is more reluctant to give in. She sits on the
          bed, stroking Marilyn's hand.

           You have no idea of your position
           in the world, Marilyn. You are the

          Paula's love and sincerity are obvious. She means it. COLIN
          watches her in silence. MARILYN squeezes her hand and PAULA
          gets up with a heavy sigh, bitterly reluctant to leave.
          Finally she drags herself out, leaving them alone.
          As the door closes MARILYN curls herself up in the bed.

           I am happy. I got everything I
           ever dreamed about.
          She smiles tentatively, but he sees a terrible fear in her
          eyes. He looks down, realising with a cruel stab of pain
          that Olivier was right. There is no way back. She doesn't
          want to be rescued.
          He finally looks up, smiling despite the tears in his eyes.

           Of course you're happy. (Pause)
           You're a star. The biggest star
           in the world.
          She smiles, reassured. He drags himself off the bed and
          goes to the door, pausing for a second as he looks back.

           As the door closes we see Marilyn's smile fade to be
           replaced by a bleak, frightened expression.

           The crew are ready. The actors are on set. OLIVIER stands by
           the camera. COLIN is half-hidden in the shadows. There is a
           flurry of activity and MARILYN emerges, with PAULA on one
           side and MILTON on the other. She looks exactly as Marilyn
           should. With her white dress shimmering in the lights and her
           platinum blonde hair glowing, she has the air of a Goddess.
           She sweeps past only inches away from Colin but ignores him.
           He can't help feeling a stiletto sharp pang of regret.

          MARILYN turns to the assembled crew. A silence settles. She
          smiles around, blinking in the lights. She looks for comfort
          or support among the technicians but sees only blank faces or
          sullen hostility. She smiles nervously.

           I hope you will all forgive me. It
           wasn't altogether my fault. I have
           been ill.
          She smiles up at their uneasy expressions, struggling to
          understand herself and their expectations of her.

           I'd like you to remember I tried.
          This oddly moving and open confession is received in silence.
          No one quite knows how to react to her lacerating honesty.
          Perhaps they think it is just another performance.

           OLIVIER, in character, lies back on a sofa, with MARILYN on
           top of him, singing the waltz that Colin first heard after
           his night with her. MARILYN looks kittenish and irresistible
           as she sings only a few inches from OLIVIER's face.

           MARILYN (AS ELSIE)
           "..I found a dream and lay in your

           there will be nothing to lose till
           you lose your heart.."
           She sings with touching delicacy, nailing it perfectly. There
           is pin drop silence on the set as the crew watch. COLIN is
           amongst them. It is a moment of almost unbearable poignancy
           for him. He suddenly realises that SYBIL THORNDIKE has crept
           up silently behind him to watch the scene. As he turns to her
           she smiles with infinite wisdom and compassion, murmuring
           softly so that only he can hear.

           First love is such sweet despair,

           She touches his cheek gently and smiles, perhaps lost in a
           long ago memory of her own, before retreating quietly into
           the darkness at the back of the set.

           CLOSE on MARILYN as she smiles, her face radiating joy and
           vitality.
           And then, in the split second before ORTON calls `cut',
           MARILYN turns her head just a fraction and winks at Colin. He
           grins. OLIVIER looks up from the sofa, notices and smiles

          At first there is a buzz of excitement but then something odd
          happens. One of the crew simply picks up his present without
          looking at it and drops it in the large bin standing against
          the wall.
          There is a moment, then a WOMAN does the same with hers.
          Suddenly there is a rush for the bin as almost everyone dumps
          their present. The bin is soon overflowing.
          MILTON stares at the scene, then simply shrugs and walks out.
          ARTHUR JACOBS, utterly indifferent to the hostile
          undercurrent, grins and waves cheerfully.

          He goes out, grabbing a discarded bottle of booze from the
          dustbin as he goes.
          COLIN watches all this in shocked silence. He looks at the
          label on his own small parcel, which reads simply "To Colin,

           90), a performance both sexy and yet touchingly innocent.
           HOLD on COLIN for a long moment, gazing at her image in the
           darkness, then -

           The circus is leaving. The film is shutting down. Not knowing
           his next job COLIN sits, suitcase next to his chair, wearing
           the 'Marilyn' experience on his face and in his soul. Head
           down, sipping a pint. He could be a regular here.
           BARRY behind the bar, flitting around - the dart players and
           regulars at play.
           And then, as if a gust of wind invaded, BARRY looks up and
           freezes. The DART PLAYER, sensing something, turns to look up
           as well. The regulars are frozen in mid-action.
           COLIN is missing it all. 100% of his attention is given to
           his woe and his pint.

                          MARILYN
           Buy a girl a drink?
           COLIN doesn't turn. He recognizes the voice and smiles.

                          COLIN
           Can I get another one of those
           please, Barry?
           BARRY for once is silent, pours a pint. The regulars try not
           to stare.

                          MARILYN

           The first time you saw this, all I
           had on was the radio.
           Colin opens the package. It's her copy of the script. On the
           first page she has written a message scrawled in ink: TO THE

           MOST CHARMING THIRD ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IN THE WORLD

           She smiles, touched.

           The ever faithful Roger stands by the idling car. COLIN opens
           the car door for MARILYN.
           MARILYN beckons him closer. She kisses him gently. He smiles
           and says lightly:

                          COLIN
           What's that for?

                          MARILYN
           That's for being on my side; and
           remember, when you see me wink,
           that's for you.
           ROGER walks around the car and looks over at COLIN.

           than when I first saw you.
           ROGER nods at COLIN (a silent salute suggesting job well
           done.) He gets into the car and we stay on COLIN as he
           watches it pull away. BARRY comes to the doorway of the pub.

                          BARRY
           Was that really Marilyn Monroe?

           No - just a good friend of mine.
           BARRY walks back into the pub, leaving COLIN alone, staring
           at the vanishing car. And then the sun swallows it as it
           drives into the English countryside.

           COLIN walks along chatting to friends. Dressed in a neat
           dark suit he looks older and more confident. There is
           little sign left of the callow young man who paced up and
           down the pavement outside Sir Laurence Olivier's office.
           We see the caption: SIX YEARS LATER.

                         

          154 INT. COLIN'S OFFICE. WARDOUR STREET. DAY. 154

           COLIN walks into a small office. Film cans are piled up all
           over the floor and books and papers spill off the shelves.
           A SECRETARY sits typing at her desk. COLIN goes to his own
           desk, glances at his diary, then looks up.

                          COLIN
           Any messages?
           THE SECRETARY pushes a piece of paper at him.

                          SECRETARY
           It's probably just someone having
           a joke.
           COLIN looks down at the message. There is a Los Angeles
           phone number and then the name - Marilyn Monroe.

           It is late. COLIN stares at the number on the scrap of

           The phone rings. He picks it up eagerly.

           The room is large and tasteful - white sofas and cushions
           and deep rugs. Picture windows look out onto the Hollywood
           hills.
           A white phone rings on the table.
           It rings continuously, insistently.
           It carries on ringing.
           No one comes.
           HOLD on the jangling phone. Each time it rings we think
           Marilyn might appear, but she never does.
           It carries on ringing, unanswered, in the empty room. As
           the picture fades we hear like a ghostly lament the sweet
           echo of Marilyn's voice singing the Sleeping Prince Waltz.

           The fragile voice hangs in the air for a second, then slowly
           drifts away to nothing.

                         

          157 INT. COLIN'S OFFICE. WARDOUR STREET. NIGHT. 157

           COLIN sits with the phone to his ear. The sound of Marilyn
           singing the Sleeping Prince Waltz dies away and we realise
           has been revisiting it in his memory.
           He waits as long as he can but it is obvious no one is going
           to answer. In the end he puts the receiver back in its cradle
           in resignation.
           His gaze drifts up to a shelf stacked with film cans. He
           stands up and looks through them, blowing dust away; they
           have been here for a long time, ignored. He finds the one he
           is looking for - it says simply MM on the can.
           He takes the short reel of film and threads it through a
           Movieola in the corner of the room. He turns it on and bends
           to look.
           The screen bursts into life with an image of MARILYN at her
           most vital and captivating. It is a copy of some rushes from
           The Prince And The Showgirl, perhaps given to Colin by
           Olivier, or perhaps "borrowed" as a souvenir and long since
           forgotten.
           We see MARILYN dancing happily, exaggerating off camera,
           looking playful and sexy. She is radiant and full of life.
           After a moment she turns and looks off camera - perhaps to
           where Colin himself would have been standing - and winks
           happily.
           Blown up to the full size of the screen it is utterly sweet
           and charming.
           There is something so completely natural about the gesture
           COLIN feels he has been swept back seven years in time and
           MARILYN is standing in front of him again, in the flesh. It
           moves and delights him; perhaps he has never even really seen
           this clip before. At any rate he hasn't thought about it for
           years.
           It is MARILYN as he will always remember her, relaxed,
           affectionate and vital, a part of her, however tiny, forever
           his.
           She smiles, laughs at something, giggles in delight (without
           sound). She says something to an unseen crew member, then
           looks back, smiling at the camera.

          Her face fills the screen.
          Beautiful, timeless -
          Happy.
          HOLD on the image for as long as we dare, then -
