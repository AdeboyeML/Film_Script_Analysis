          INT. FULGHAM KINDERGARTEN -- WEDNESDAY MORNING


          
          Two dozen KINDGERGARTNERS listen to their teacher, MS.
          BERRY. The word "Work" is on the blackboard.

                                MS. BERRY
                    "Work." Today we're going to
                    share what our parents do for
                    work.
          QUICK CUTS of a series of five-year olds standing beside
          their desks, addressing the class:

                              JEFF
                    My dad is a truck driver.

                              MELINDA
                    My mommy is a doctor.

                                CAROLYN
                    My dad is a librarian and my
                    mom is a vegetarian.

                              THEODORE
                          (with difficulty)
                    My father is a struck-sher-al-
                    engine-ear.

                                CRAIG     -
                    My mother is an actress. She
                    works at Denny's.

                                KELLY
                    My daddy works at a place
                    where they make stuff, and my
                    mommy is a mommy.

                                ELLIOT
                          (looking a little

                           CRAZED)
                    My father is a postal worker.
          The QUICK CUTS end with MAX:

                              MAX
                    My mom's a teacher.
          As Max starts to sit:

                              MS. BERRY
                    And your dad?

                                MAX

                          (HESITANT)
                    My dad? He's . . . a liar.

          

                                  MS. BERRY
                             (taken aback)

                        A liar? I don't think you
                        mean "a liar."

                                  MAX
                        Well... he wears a suit and
                        goes to court and talks to the
                        judge and--

                                  MS. BERRY

                             (RELIEVED)
                        Oh! I see-- you mean he's a
                        lawyer.

              Max shrugs.

              INT. COURTROOM .-- DAY


          
              FLETCHER REID, early 30's, stands before the JUDGE. His
              manner is utterly genuine and convincing.

                                  FLETCHER
                        A dark street. . . a stormy
                        night... two desperate men
                        struggle... one man is taken
                        to the hospital, the other to
                        ja il. The prosecutor wants
                        you to believe this is an
                        open-and-shut case of a poor
                        man, brutally victimized.
              He nods at the victim - - a fragile OLD MAN in his 70's.

                                  FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                        Well, for once I agree with
                        t he prosecutor. This is an
                        open-and shut case -- but the
                        true victim is my client.
              Fletcher's CLIENT is a 250 pound brute in a suit.

                                  FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                        Put yourself in his shoes for
                        a moment--walking home from
                        church, alone, in a
                        frightening part of the
                        suburbs.
              As he describes his client's movements, Fletcher ACTS THEM

              OUT:

          

                               FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    You're nervous, timid, looking
                    over your shoulder -- when
                    suddenly, you encounter him--
                          (pointing at the
                           old man)
                    pouncing from the shadows.
                    You quiver in fear. The
                    streetlight flashes on
                    something shiny in his hand--
                    a knife?

          Suddenly Fletcher becomes the attacker, brandishing a
          weapon. The jurors RECOIL.

                                 FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    And in that terrifying instant
                    you do what any respectable
                    citizen would -- you defend
                    y ou rse lf. Only after you
                    shatter his arm and collarbone
                    do you realize it's all a
                    mistake... the man was merely
                    walking away from an ATM
                    machine, the apparent flash of
                    metal caused by his bank card.
          He reveals the weapon in his hand is only a credit card.

                                FLETCHER (CONT'D)

                           (CONCERNED)
                    As you stand over his
                    crumpled, though potentially
                    still-dangerous form, your
                    he art goes out to him. You
                    want to help. First, you
                    gather up the many bills he
                    dropped, to stop them from
                    bl owi ng away. Second, in an
                    effort to get the name and
                    number of someone to notify,
                    you take his wallet. Finally,
                    you leap into the man's Lexus
                    to head for assistance, when
                    suddenly a police car speeds
                    up. You breathe a sigh of
                    relief: "Someone to look -after
                    the injured man! Oh joy!"
                    But do the police applaud your
                    initiative? Do they hail your
                    heroism? No-- they arrest you
                    and throw you in the slammer!
          He walks along the jury box:

          

                              FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                  · And why? Why does the State
                   turn its massive power against
                   this individual?
                         (takes an

                          IMPRESSIVE
                          moment, then
                          answers his own

                          QUESTION:)
                   Discrimination,
                         (to a black

                          JUROR)
                   But this time it's not based
                   on race.
                         (to a female

                          JUROR)
                   Not based on gender.
                         (to a man wearing
                          a crucifix)
                   Not based on religion,
                         (to a heavy set

                          JUROR)
                   No--this time it's
                   discrimination based on size!
                 . I know what the prosecution
                   wants you to think - - i t ' s
                   always the big guy's fault.
                   Is that what we've come to as
                   a society -- persecuting
                   people because they're large?
          Fletcher points accusingly at the opposition.

                               FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                   Shame on you, Mister
                   Prosecutor! Shame on you!
                          (turning back to

                           JURY)
                   The state is trying to
                   barbeque my client on the spit
                   of Justice. Only you can douse
                   the flames. The decision is
                   your s. And please...don't let
                   your emotions run away with
                   y ou . The fact that my client
                   is a family man, raising his
                   sons alone after the tragic
                   death of their mother, has
                   absolutely no bearing on this
                   case.
          In the front row we see two sad-faced YOUNG CHILDREN.

          

                              FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    Instead, let cold reason be
                    your guide as you decide the
                    fate of this church-going,
                    orphan-rasing widower!
          Fletcher returns to his seat. Jurors, dab their eyes.

          EXT. COURTHOUSE -- AFTERNOON

          Fletcher bounds down the stairs, passing a fellow LAWYER,

                              LAWYER
                    How's it going, Fletcher?

                               FLETCHER
                          (he' s won)
                    Another gratifying day serving
                    Justice.
          Fletcher's huge client catches up to him.

                              CLIENT
                    Hey great job, Mr. Reid. I
                    wish there was some way I
                    could show my appreciation.

                              FLETCHER
                    Stay out of my neighborhood
                    after dark.
          A PUBLICIST carrying, a clipboard approaches Fletcher.

                              PUBLICIST
                    Mr. Reid, do you have a ·
                    moment-?

                              FLETCHER
                    No, I'm late picking up my
                    son.

                              PUBLICIST
                    -Because a couple of reporters
                    want to interview you about
                    your big win today.
          Fletcher instantly shifts directions.

                              FLETCHER    ..
                    How's my hair?
          And he's off to woo a GANG OF REPORTERS.

          

          EXT. SUBURBAN PORCH - AFTERNOON


          
          A sad Max and his mother, AUDREY, wait silently on the
          steps.

                              MAX
                    What time is it?

                               AUDREY
                           (checks her

                            WATCH)
                    I ' m sure he just got tied up
                    in court again.
          Finally, Fletcher's BMW pulls up. Max races to him,
          delighted.

                               MAX
                    Dad!

                           COMMAND)

                    TRANSFORMERS!! .
          Fletcher instantly becomes a human version of the
          TRANSFORMER TOY making ROBOTIC MOVEMENTS and SOUNDS. Max
          knows the routine well, moves in perfect sine with dad. . ...
          Until --                       .

                    Look out! It's on tickle
                    mode!!
          Fletcher's "mechanical arm" becomes CLAW-LIKE, TICKLING MAX
          like crazy! Max loves it.
          Audrey watches these two kids, smiles.

                    Max, could you introduce me?

          Fletcher's other robotic arm becomes a "pincher", comes
          after Audrey.

                    we were married, I wasn't

                    Yo u gonna be okay? Because if

                    your sister and I could go out
                    with you two, does that appeal
                    to you at all?

          Flet cher's EYES WIDEN. He has clearly forgotten.

                    I'm sure your dad'11 give you
                    something wonderful.
          Fletcher tries to wave her off, awkwardly stopping when Max
          turns to him.     .

                              MAX
                    Yeah?

                              FLETCHER
                    Oh, yeah. You're going to
                    love it. Uh, why don't you
                    play in my office for a
                    minute? Fax something, sue
                    someone, have a good time.
                    We'll be leaving in a second.

          
          Max heads into the office. Fletcher closes the door behind
          him turning it into a silly, two-handed wave.

                                FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    Damn!   I completely forgot.

                    Oh, there's a surprise.
          Greta produces a wrapped GIFT.

                               FLETCHER
                    You're a saint. I should get
                    you something.

                    You did.
          She holds up another, smaller package.

                               FLETCHER
                    Ah. Well, I always do the
                    classy thing. Any calls?

          As Miranda approaches, Fletcher switches gears in an

          Fletcher turns -- and pretends to be surprised.

          He grabs Greta's gift and hands it to Miranda.

          A sad Max sits on Fletcher's big sofa. His heart sinks
          further when Fletcher enters. . . carrying two boxes of
          documents.

          Fletcher types on his computer.   He's been up all night.
          He leans back, rubs his eyes. When he opens them he sees
          Max standing there in pajamas. Fletcher SMILES.

          EXT. JERRY'S CAR - MORNING

          Jerry and Audrey are driving. Audrey's holding a couple of
          airline tickets.

                            (re: tickets)

                                 JERRY
                       The company wants me to get
                       started right away.

                                 AUDREY
                   I can't just pick up and move
                   to Boston with two days
                   notice.

                              JERRY

                   a nd Max, see the town. Let's
                 . pick out a place together.
                   Then, if you want to turn me
                   down and scar me for life,
                   fine.

                                 AUDREY
                   It's just not that simple...
                   What about my job? I've been
                   at UCLA three years.

                                 JERRY
                   It's New England. They're
                   lousy with colleges. You
                   can't swing a bat back there
                   without hitting a college.

          
                    You'd get a job there in a
                    second.

                              AUDREY
                    There are other factors
                    involved.

          They pull up in front of Fletcher's building where Fletcher
          and Max are waiting. Fletcher's still reviewing a file.
          As Audrey gets out of Jerry's car, Max runs over.

                              AUDREY
                    Did you have fun? How were
                    the wrestling matches?

                    So how were the wrestling
                    matches ? Did you have fun?

                              JERRY
                    Max , my man! My happy
                    birthday man!
          Max and Jerry exchange "fives" and'a hug.   Jerry gives Max
          a light punch on the arm.

                    Did you see that? He struck
                    the child!

                   Whoa! Great! I have my glove
                   in the car. We'll stop in the
                   park on the way home and play

          he spent the previous·night putting together.

          

                                VIRGINIA
                    This is good. This is really
                    smart.

                                FLETCHER
                   Thank you.

                                VIRGINIA
                   Only i t ' s . . . Like not true.
                   Every word of it is a lie.
          Fletcher and Miranda exchange glances.

                             VIRGINIA (CONT'D)
                   I mean... isn't that a
                   problem?

                                FLETCHER
                   Mrs. Cole, the only problem
                   here is that after you've
                   provided years of faithful
                   service and loving support, of
                   raising his children -- They
                   are his?

                              VIRGINIA
                   H m ? Oh yeah. One for sure.

                               FLETCHER
                   After all that, your husband
                   wants to deny you a fair share
                   of the marital assets based on
                   one single act of

                                            ]

                   INDISCRETION--

                              VIRGINIA
                   Seven single acts of
                   indiscretion.

                   --Seven acts of indiscretion,
                   only one of which he has any
                   evidence of, and all of which
                   he himself is responsible, for.

                              VIRGINIA
                   He is?

          Mrs. Cole, I stayed up all
          night last night studying your
          c ase. Not just your case...
          b ut you. And, by now, I feel
          I know you. You are the
          victim here. The wife of a
          cold, distant businessman.
          Starved for affection, driven
          into the arms of another man--

                     VIRGINIA
          Seven.

                     FLETCHER
                (not missing a

                 BEAT)
          --Seven .other men. You're not
          trying to deny him what is
          r ig htf ull y his. All you're
          insisting on is what is
          r ig htf ull y yours. And maybe
          an idgy-smidgy bit more. I
          think you're bending over
          backwards.

                     VIRGINIA
          Well, I did agree to give him
          j oint custody of the kids...
                (to Miranda)
          He's always been a good
          father.

                     FLETCHER
          And you've always been a good
          wife.

                  (getting worked

                   UP)
          Yeah. . .

                     FLETCHER
          There's such a thing as being
          t oo nice. That's why you need
          aggr essive representation. To
          show the court that there is
          more than one side to this
          st ory. All I'm asking is the
          opportunity to see that
          justice is done on your
          behalf.
                (takes her hand)
          Will you give me that
          opportunity?

          
          He stares into her eyes. A moment, then...

                                 VIRGINIA
                    Yes! I ' m tired of getting
                    kicked around.

                              FLETCHER
                    Good for you!

                                 VIRGINIA
                    Thank you, Mr. Reid. I ' m so
                    grateful I have an attorney I
                    can trust.
          S he gives him a HUG and momentarily grabs his ass. With a
          farewell nod to Miranda, she leaves.
          Miranda turns, smiles at Fletcher, then shuts the door.
          She moves in on him.

                                 MIRANDA
                    You're good. You're really
                    good.

                                 FLETCHER
                    Oh, pshaw.

                                 MIRANDA
                   N o, I mean it. The Cole case
                   is worth a truckload of money
                   to this firm, not to mention
                   the press it's going to
                   g en er at e . You win this case
                   and I guarantee you'll make
                   partner.

                             AUDREY
                   I can't move Max three
                   thousand miles away from his
                   father.

          

                                JERRY
                     Audrey, I have never said a
                     bad word about your ex --

                                AUDREY
                     I know.

          

                                JERRY
                    But how much responsibility
                    does Fletcher take for Max,
                    now? He'd never come over if
                    you didn't remind him.

                               AUDREY
                    I know. But if they're three
                    thousand miles apart they'll
                    never see each other.
                    Fletcher will never come to
                    Boston and how can I send Max
                    cross-country to him?

                    emotional. I'm sorry.
          Pause.

                              JERRY

                                   FLETCHER
                      Urn, actually, something has
                      come up. A problem on a new
                      caaa--                .
          Miranda bites one of Fletcher's nipples.

                                   F LET CHE R
                      A-h-h-h-!

          

                                AUDREY
                      What happened?

                                   FLETCHER
                      Nothing. I just nailed my
                      ·knee into the desk... Listen,
                      I'm really sorry I can't 'make
                      it.

                                AUDREY
                      Max is going to be so
                      disappointed.

                                   FLETCHER
                      I'll make it up to him, I
                      promise. I'll pick him up
                      from school tomorrow, okay?

                                 AUDREY
                      Do you want me to put him on
                      the phone?
          Miranda starts "reeling in" the phone cord.

                                   FLETCHER
                      Ah, no.     I have to go.

          

                                 AUDREY
                    Right.
          ANGRILY, she hangs up. Fletcher stares UNHAPPILY at the
          phone, before Miranda THROWS HIM BACK ONTO THE COUCH.

          INT. AUDREY AND MAX'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          WE PAN DOWN from banners reading HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAX!. . . to
          a room full of guests... to a desultory five-year-old.
          Audrey finishes lighting the candles on the homemade cake.

                              AUDREY
                    All right, birthday boy, make
                    a wish.
          Max doesn't respond.

                              AUDREY (CONT'D)
                    C'mon, honey. It can be
                    anything-- whatever you want
                    most in the world.
          When he .doesn't respond, she leans down to him..

                              AUDREY (CONT'D)
                    Max, your dad is sorry. He
                    had to work.

                               MAX
                    He said he was coming. He
                    promised.

                               AUDREY
                    Yes, well, he... promises
                    he'll see you tomorrow.
          Max doesn't believe it.     <
          He turns his full attention to the candles on the cake.   In
          VOICE OVER we hear what she does not.

                               MAX (V.O.)
                    I wish, for just one day, Dad
                    couldn't tell a lie.
          He takes a breath --and blows out all the candles. A
          strange WIND blows the drapes and the wisp of smoke up, up,
          up... to the clock on the wall. It's 9:15.

                                                    CUT TO:
          A clock on a wall.   It's 9:15'. We are--

          

          INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT


          
          PAN around Miranda's office, where the displaced sofa is
          adorned with Fletcher's shoes...
          To the credenza, where Fletcher's pants hang...
          To the lamp, where Fletcher's shorts swing...
          To the desk, where a ravished Miranda lies next to
          Fletcher. Superbly confident of the answer, she asks--

                                MIRANDA
                    S o . . . was it good for you?
          Without thinking, Fletcher responds in the most astonishing
          way possible-- he TELLS THE TRUTH.

                              FLETCHER
                    I've had better.
          Miranda turns to him in disbelief -- but it's nothing
          compared to the LOOK OF SHOCK on Fletcher's face.

          INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT


          
          The door opens -- and the naked Fletcher is forcefully
          kicked out. He goes TUMBLING over a desk as a RAIN OF
          CLOTHES follow.
          The door SLAMS SHUT again, leaving him without his pants.
          A CLEANING LADY stares at him in shock, then takes her
          broom, aims for his crotch, SWINGS.and. . .

          INT. BEDROOM - FRIDAY MORNING


          
          An alarm CLOCK RINGS. Fletcher BOLTS UP in bed. With
          regret and wonder he remembers:

                              FLETCHER
                    "I've had better?"

          INT. FLETCHER'S BATHROOM - MORNING


          
          Fletcher brushes his teeth, looks up at his reflection in
          the mirror, mouth foaming.

                              FLETCHER
                    "I've had better?!"

          INT. HALLWAY OF FLETCHER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

          Dressed for work, Fletcher waits for the elevator.

          

                               FLETCHER
                         (laughing it off)
                    "I've had better?"
          I t arrives. He steps in.

          INT. APARTMENT ELEVATOR - MORNING

          The elevator is empty, except for Fletcher... and a
          beautiful young WOMAN.

                              FLETCHER
                    New in the building?

                              MODEL
                    I just moved in Monday.

                              FLETCHER
                    Ah. Well, you must allow me
                    to give you the grand tour.

                               MODEL

                          (SHE'S

                           INTERESTED)
                    O h? Do you do that for all
                    the new tenants?

                              FLETCHER
                    No. Just the ones I want to
                    bang like a drum.
          Fletcher's face REGISTERS extreme SHOCK and...

          INT. LOBBY OF APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

          We HEAR a SMACK off camera and a PING as the elevator door
          opens. The model storms off and A STUNNED Fletcher steps
          out, rubbing his freshly slapped face.

          EXT. COURTROOM -, MORNING

          A SHAKY Fletcher strides toward the courthouse... when he
          is accosted by a BEGGAR.

                              BEGGAR
                    Any change, Mister?

                              .FLETCHER
                    Absolutely.
          But he continues walking.

                              BEGGAR
                    Could you spare some?

          

                               FLETCHER
                    Unquestionably.
          Fletcher walks faster, PUZZLED that he has answered
          truthfully. The beggar is even more puzzled.

                                BEGGAR
                    Will you?

                                FLETCHER
                    No.

                                BEGGAR
                    How come?

                                FLETCHER
                   Because I resent your
                   p re sen ce. You fill me with an
                   unpleasant mixture of disgust
                   and guilt. Further, I don't
                   believe you'll use the money
                   for food, but I believe you'll
                   use it for, at worst, drugs,
                   or, at best, whiskey, or
                 . cigarettes. Also, I'm cheap.
          As Fletcher heads up the stairs...

                                BEGGAR
                   Jerkoff.

          INT. COURTROOM - MORNING


          
          A winded Fletcher joins Virginia at the respondent's table,

                             VIRGINIA
                   You look like you're having a
                   rough morning.

                              FLETCHER
                    I've had better.
          He WINCES as he recognizes the words. Then, an extremely
          wealthy, respectable industrialist, RICHARD COLE enters
          with his attorney, DANA APPLETON, young, brisk, confident.

                              DANA
                   Good morning, Fletcher.

                                FLETCHER
                   Dana.         "

          

                                RICHARD
                    All right, Virginia, how much
                    will it take to put an end to
                    this?

                              FLETCHER
                    Fifty per cent of your estate.
          Richard is SHOCKED.

                                DANA
                    Fifty per cent? With a pre-
                    nup and proof of adultery?
                    What's your case?

                               FLETCHER
                    Our case is simply this. . .
          Fletcher opens his mouth to enlighten her -- but he CAN'T
          GET THE WORDS OUT. He tries to FORCE OUT SOUNDS, but
          succeeds only in looking like a fish gasping on dry land.

                                DANA        .
                    Interesting, though based on
                    your track record, I expected
                    a little more.
          Nearing panic, Fletcher whirls to his BRIEFCASE and grabs
          the brief.

                                FLETCHER   ..
                   Wa it! Wait!    I've got it in
                   writing!
          But when Dana tries to take the document, the astonished
          Fletcher finds himself PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO RELEASE IT.

                                DANA
                    Let go!

                              FLETCHER
                    I'm trying!

          
          He INVOLUNTARILY snatches the document away and IT PULLS
          HIM to a nearby TRASH CAN where he throws it out.
          At this moment the BAILIFF calls.

                                BAILIFF
                   All rise for the Honorable
                   Judge William Stevens.

          

                              DANA
                    Very funny, Fletcher. You
                    want to play hardball, I'm
                    game.
          JUDGE STEVENS takes the bench.

          

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    Calling case BA 09395, Richard
                    Cole versus Virginia Cole.
                    How're we doing this morning,
                    counsel?

                              DANA
                    Fine, thank you.

                             JUDGE STEVENS
                   And you, Mr. Reid?

                              FLETCHER
                    Well, I'm a little upset about
                    a bad sexual episode I had
                    last night--
          Fletcher screeches to a standstill, suddenly aware of what
          he just said. After an awkward silence--

                              JUDGE STEVENS

                         (DRYLY)
                   Well, you're still young.
                   It'll happen more and more.
                   In the meantime, what do you
                   say we get. down to business?
                   First, Mr. Reid, I see that
                   your client was previously
                   represented by Mr. Rand of
                   your office.

                             FLETCHER
                   Yes, Your Honor.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    I take it you're seeking to
                    substitute in as counsel?

                             FLETCHER
                   Yes, Your Honor.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                   Fine , fine. And for the
                   record, the reason is?

          

                                 FLETCHER
                    Mr. Rand had severe ethical
                    objections to my client's
                    case.
          Fletcher is incredulous. Somehow his greatest asset in the
          world, his mouth, has become his worst enemy.

                                JUDGE STEVENS
                    I take it you don't share the
                    same ethical objections, Mr.
                    Reid?

                                 FLETCHER
                    I have lower standards, Your
                    Honor.

                                JUDGE STEVENS
                    I see. Well, if Mrs. Cole
                    wants the substitution of
                    counsel, I'll allow it. Is
                    that what you want, Mrs. Cole?
          Virginia looks to the judge, then to Fletcher, whose
          unorthodox syle seemed so brilliant earlier.

                                 VIRGINIA

                            (UNSURE)
                    Yes?

                                JUDGE STEVENS
                    Fine.

                             VIRGINIA

                         FLETCHER)

                                                                       .
                   I don't know.

                   Your Honor, I ' d like a
                   continuance!

                             JUDGE STEVENS "
                   This case has already been
                   delayed several times, Mr.
                   Reid.

          

                                 FLETCHER
                    I realize that, Your Honor,
                    but I ' d really, really, really
                    like a continuance.

                                 JUDGE STEVENS
                    I'll have to hear good cause,
                    counselor. What's the
                    problem?

          FLETCHER'S P.O.V.

          
          The ROOM begins to SPIN slowly -- then faster -- then
          faster -- until we wind up squarely on --

          FLETCHER'S FACE

                              FLETCHER
                    I can't lie!

                                 JUDGE STEVENS

                            (IMPATIENT)
                   Commendable, Mr. Reid, but I'm
                   still waiting for the good
                   caus e. Now, do you have it or
                 . not?

                            (TRUTHFUL)
                    Not.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    Motion for a continuance
                    denied. Is there any chance
                    of a settlement in this case?

                                DANA
                    I don't think so, Your Honor.
                    Mr. Reid made it abundantly
                    clear that the last thing in
                    the world he wanted was to --

                               FLETCHER

                          (DESPERATE)

                    SETTLE! SETTLE! SETTLE!
          Dana and Mr. Cole look at Fletcher with surprise.

                                JUDGE STEVENS
                    There appears to have been a
                    change in strategy. Let's go
                    to my chambers and negotiate.
          He BANGS the gavel.

          

          INT. JUDGE STEVENS'S CHAMBERS - MORNING

          Dana and an apprehensive Fletcher sit before the judge

                             DANA
                   Your Honor, under the terms of
                   the prenuptual agreement, if
                   Mrs. Cole commits adultery,
                   she is entitled to nothing.
                   We have in our possession an
                   audiotape made by a licensed
                   private investigator of an
                   explicit act of sexual
                   congress with a man who is not
                   her husband.

                             JUDGE STEVENS
                   Sounds pretty damning, Mr.
                   Reid.

                             FLETCHER
                   It certainly does.

                             DANA
                   However, my client has no
                   desire to see his ex-wife
                   destitute. Against my advice,
                   he's willing to offer her a
                   cash settlement of.two point
                   four million dollars.

                             JUDGE STEVENS
                   Two four seems like a pretty
                   fair offer, Mr. Reid.

                             FLETCHER
                   Fantastically fair.
                   Phenominally fair. In fact,
                   I'd say beyond fair, bordering
                   on stupid.
          Dana fumes. The judge finds Fletcher's boldness
          refreshing.

                             JUDGE STEVENS
                   What are you suggesting, Mr.
                   Rei d? That Ms. Appleton's
                   willingness to proffer such an
                   offer betrays a lack of faith
                   in her position?

                             FLETCHER
                        (utterly sincere)
                   No, not at all. She's got my
                   client dead to rights. When

          
                    attorneys go to sleep at
                    night, they dream of having a
                    case as strong as hers.

                              DANA
                    Can the sarcasm, Reid. All
                    right, I admit it -- I've seen
                    you make even the lamest case
                    fly. But this time I have
                    you. Even Clarence Darrow
                    couldn't explain this away.
          She brandishes the audiotape.

                              JUDGE SAMIOAN
                    Wel l, Mr. Reid? without a
                    dynamite explanation, I'd say
                    you're dead in the water.
                    How's you client's story?

                              FLETCHER
                    The best that money can buy,
                    Y o u r Honor.       ·

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    Strong corroborating evidence?

                              FLETCHER
                    We have evidence that you are
                    not going to-believe.
          Despite herself, Dana is beginning to look worried.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    You're pretty confident how
                    this trial is going to come
                    out, eh, Mr. Reid?

                              FLETCHER
                         (hopeless) .
                    "Confident" is too weak a
                    word, Your Honor. I am
                    certain what will happen if I
                    take this puppy to trial. The
                    verdict will be a stunning,
                    humiliating defeat that will
                    cut a spectacularly promising
                    legal career off at the knees.
          Fletcher is referring to himself, of course, but Dana
          thinks he's speaking about her. She buckles.

          

                                DANA
                      All right! Double the offer!
                      Four point eight! And not a
                      penny more.
                            (venomous, to

                             FLETCHER)
                      Bastard!
          She storms out, leaving an astounded Fletcher behind.

                                JUDGE STEVENS
                      You are some negotiator, Mr.
                      Reid. If your client has half
                      a brain, she'll jump at the
                      offer.

                                                     CUT TO:

                      No? ! Mrs. Cole, this offer
                      was a miracle. I'm talking

                      yesterday -- I'm the victim
                      here, starved for affection,
                      driven into the arms of
                      another man--

                    don't think I can lose. I
                    want to proceed.

                    understand, I--
          But before Fletcher can finish, the judge enters.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    Well , Mr. Reid. Do we have a
                    settlement?
          Fletcher looks pleadingly at his client, but she is firm.
          He shakes his head unhappily. The judge is irritated.

                               JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)
                   Th ere' s no settlement. Trial
                   to start at one-thirty sharp.
          He BANGS the gavel. Fletcher emits an involuntary whimper.

          INT. HALLWWAY OF LAW OFFICES - MORNING

          DA ZED, Fletcher makes his way down the hall. Jane comes
          toward him wearing a hairstyle that resembles a nest. He
          tries to avoid her, but...

          S TR AIN S HARDER. He's out of his chair, on the desk. His
          feet KICK OVER OBJECTS on the shelves'behind him. He
          finally forces pen to paper. He looks down where he wrote

          INADVERTENTLY:

                    Hey, Fletcher. T was
                    wondering if you were going to
                    still pick up Max after school
                    today.

                               FLETCHER
                   I don't think I can. I had a
                   case I was certain would
                   settle and it didn't. I have
                   to go to trial this afternoon,
                   God help me.

                   It's true... I really do want
                   to see Max, today.
          Fletcher considers what he just said, realizes it is true.

                             FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                   How about that. I really do.

                   the last minute.

                              FLETCHER
                   Yes, but-this time it's
                   different.

                   I see. And how is that?

                   It must have been with someone
                   very "special."

                             FLETCHER
                   No. It was with someone I
                   don't even like. But I
                   thought it would help my
                   career and at the moment that

          Hello.

                    FLETCHER
          Audrey, let me explain.
          Something has happened to me--

                    AUDREY
          Fletcher, something else is
          about to happen to you.

                    FLETCHER.
          What do you mean?

                    AUDREY
          Max and I are moving to
          Boston.

                    FLETCHER
          What?!

                    AUDREY
          Jerry asked me to marry him.
          He wants Max and I to fly with
          him this weekend to pick out a
          house. And I'm going to go.
          God knows I don't have any
          reason to stay here.

          Wait, you can't move! If you
          take Max away... I'll
          practically never see him.

                    AUDREY
          Well then you'll have pretty
          much the same relationship you
          have with him now.

                    FLETCHER
          Audrey, please.... Is this
          because of what I just said on
          the phone?

                    AUDREY
          That was the straw and this is
          the camel's back saying
          goodbye.

                   after last night's incident, I
                   was. . . hurt. So hurt. I was
                   tempted to do whatever little
                   things lie in my power to
                   scuttle your chances of making
                   partner.
          Fletcher is FRIGHTENED.

                              MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                   But then I thought, "No,
                   that 's not fair. Fletcher
                   didn't mean to insult me."

                   and Fletcher is very, very
                   sorry."
          Fletcher smiles.   It looks like he's off the hook, until--

                              MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                    Isn't that right, Fletcher?

                        (in agony)
                   Uh -- not really, no.

                               FLETCHER
                    None, whatsoever. I mean, I ' d
                    like to respect you, and if it
                    weren't for your mistreatment
                    of the associates, your
                    rudeness to the staff, and the
                    fact that your work sucks, I
                    would.

                    support my partnership if I
                    turned you down. Plus, I have
                    an immature need for sexual
                    conquests.

          But he hasn't regained the ability to lie -- he's referring
          to the RED LIGHT he just ran, nearly colliding with a
          truck. The DRIVER screams:

                              DRIVER
                    What's your problem, schmuck?!

                                FLETCHER
                           (the truth)
                    I ' m an inconsiderate prick!

          
            Fletcher once again focuses on the blue pen.

                                FLETCHER (CON "ID)
                      C'mon, you can do this! The
                      color of the pen is -- RED!
           This time he's referring to the flashing red light of a
           POLICE CAR in his rearview mirror.

                                  FLETC HER
                     S hi t !!

          
           Fletcher pulls over. A POLICE OFFICER strolls up.

                               POLICE OFFICER
                     Do you know why I stopped you?

                                  FLETCHER
                     Depends on how long you were
                     following me.

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                     Why don't we take it from the
                     top.

                                FLETCHER
                    ·     (in agony)
                     Here goes -- I didn't fasten
                     my seatbelt, I didn't glance
                     in my rearview mirror, I
                     didn't signal when I pulled
                     away from the curb, I sped, I
                     followed too closely, I ran a
                     stop sign, I almost hit :a
                    Chevy Camaro, I almost hit a
                    ge ezer, I sped some more, I
                    failed to yield at a
                    crosswalk, I changed lanes in
                    the intersection, I changed
                    lanes without signalling, and
                    I changed lanes in the

                    INTERSECTION-WITHOUT
                    signalling while running a red
                    light and speeding.
          A long moment.

                             POLICE OFFICER
                   May I see your driver's
                   license?

                                 FLETCHER
                   No.

          

                              POLICE OFFICER
                    And why is that?

                              FLETCHER
                    It's in my other pants.

                              POLICE OFFICER
                    I see. And where are your ·
                    other pants?

                              FLETCHER
                    Hanging from my boss's
                    credenza.

                              POLICE OFFICER
                    Do you expect me to believe
                    that?

                              FLETCHER
                    No.

          

                              POLICE OFFICER
                    Do you think I'm an idiot?

                              FLETCHER
                    Yes -- but that's beside the
                    point! My license actually is
                    in my other pants, and they
                    actually were hanging from a
                    credenzaJ I wouldn't lie to
                    you! I mean, I would if I
                    could, but I can't!

                              POLICE OFFICER
                    I see. So you ..have no reason
                    to try and hide your license
                    from me?

                              FLETCHER
                   I didn't say that. I have
                   other reasons. Seventeen
                   reasons, to be precise.
                         (begrudgingly,
                          off the
                          officer's look)
                   Unpaid parking tickets.

                         (BESEECHINGLY)
                   Be gentle.

          EXT. AUDREY'S HOUSE - MORNING


          
          A cab speeds up to the house. Fletcher runs out. Audrey is
          headed to her car.

          

                              FLETCHER
                    Audrey, wait!

                              AUDREY
                    Wait? You know, I just had an
                    insight into myself. I ' m
                    crazy. You call me up and .
                    tell me to wait here because
                    you'll be right over and --
                    here's the crazy part -- I
                    actually wait.

                              FLETCHER
                    I can explain--

                              AUDREY
                    I missed a department meeting.
                    I. . . Did you come in a cab?

                              FLETCHER
                    Yes.

                              AUDREY
                    Where's your car?

          EXT, POLICE IMPOUND YARD - MORNING

          
          Audrey finishes paying the impound-yard CASHIER and joins
          Fletcher, who is waiting alongside hundreds of towed cars.

                              FLETCHER
                    Thank you. . I can't tell you
                    how much this means to me.

                              AUDREY
                    I can. One thousand, six
                    hundred, and fifty-four
                    dollars and eleven cents.

                              FLETCHER
                    Ow.

          
          At this moment WE HEAR a hideous scraping noise -- and a
          TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE whips Fletcher's BMW into view and.
          parks... revealing a prominent new scrape on the door.

                              FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    You scratched my car!

                              TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE
                    Where?     .

                              FLETCHER
                   Right there!

          

                              TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE
                    Oh that? That was already
                    there.

                                 FLETCHER

                            (OUTRAGED)
                    Why, you -- you liar! Do you
                    know what I ' m going to do
                    about this?

                                TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE
                    What?

                              FLETCHER
                         (angrier and

                          ANGRIER)
                    ...Nothing! Because if I take
                   you to small-claims court, it
                   will just drain eight hours
                   out of my life, and you
                   probably won't show up, and if
                   I finally got the judgment
                   you'd just stiff me anyway, so
                   what I'm gonna do is piss and
                   moan like an impotent jerk and
                 . then bend over and take it up
                   the tail pipe!

                              TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE
                    You've been here before,
                    haven't you?
          He flips Fletcher the keys and goes.

                                AUDREY
                    Well I can't remember when
                    I've had more fun, now if
                    you'll excuse me, I have a
                    class.
          She starts out.

                                FLETCHER
                    Audrey, wait. I want to talk
                    to you about this Boston
                    situation.

                             . AUDREY
                    What do you want to say?

                                FLETCHER
                   You can't go. It's not fair.
                   Taking Max three thousand
                   miles away is not fair.

          

                              AUDREY
                    Let' s define "fair." Last
                  · night a five-year old boy was
                    crushed because his father
                    lied to him about coming to
                    his birthday party. Fair?

                              FLETCHER
                    Last night--

                             AUDREY
                   -- Was none of my business.
                   When it happened two years ago
                   it was my business, but now I
                   don't have to care anymore.
                   See, that's the magic of
                   div orce . But it does matter
                   to Max. Everything you do
                   matters to him... and
                   everything you don't do.

                              FLETCHER
                   All right-- now let me tell
                   you something...you're
                   absolutely right. I'm guilty
                   of all charges. I'm throwing
                   myself on the mercy of your
                   -court.
          Audrey doesn't know what to say. Fletcher seems very
          sincere, but she can't trust him.

                              FLETCHER {CONT'D)
                   I have an idea. I'll come
                   over tonight, right after
                   court lets out and play with
                   M ax. Have him invite some
                   fri ends over. We'll have a
                   game and everything. Then,
                   you and I can sit down and
                   talk.

                             AUDREY
                   We're suppose to be on a plane

                   TONIGHT--

                             FLETCHER
                   No, Audrey. Just talk to me
                   abou t this first. Please.
                   Au drey, I've lost you. Don't
                   make me lose Max, too.

                             AUDREY
                   You're really coming?

          

                              FLETCHER
                    This is iron-clad. This is
                    the mother of all promises.
                    What time?

                              AUDREY
                    ...Six?

                              FLETCHER
                    Ten-to-six.

                               AU DR EY

                          (UNSURE)
                    All right... only if I tell
                    Max you're coming and you
                    don't show up and I have to
                    see that look on Max's face --
                    that heartbreaking look-- it's
                    Boston, Fletcher.

                              FLETCHER.
                    I will be there.

          
          As Audrey gets in her car -- .

                              AUDREY
                   I hope so. Do you know what
                   your son was doing at nine-
                   fif teen las t ni ght? He was
                   making a wish on his birthday
                   c ake. He was wishing that,
                   for just one day, his dad
                   couldn't tell a lie.
          She drives away. Fletcher starts for his car, pensive,
          when a new thought strikes him.

                              FLETCHER
                   Oh my God! That-'s it! An
                   innocent kid - - a heartfelt
                   plea-- a birthday wish! Sure,
                   it' s impossible --but it
                   'makes sense!..! If he can wish
                   it, he can unwish it!

          INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HALLWAY


          
          Fletcher marches quickly down the hall, cake box under his
          arm.

          INT. MAX'S KINDERGARTEN CLASS

          Ms. Berry's reading a story when Fletcher enters.   Max
          brightens.

          

                               MAX
                    Dad!

          

                               MS . BERRY
                    Are you Max's dad? I ' m Ms.
                    Berry, Max's teacher!

                               FLETCHER
                    Hi. Listen, I need to talk to

                    MAX--

                               MS. BERRY
                    Mr. Reid, we were just talking
                    ab ou t careers. You're a
                    lawyer, aren't you?

                                FLETCHER

                           (WARY)
                    Yes.

                              MAX

                    right now.
          Max is disappointed again.

                    Stupid. His big nose and

                    make-up.
          Fletcher elbows Max, playfully, trying to induce a laugh.
          Max doesn't laugh.

                    told me about... the wish you
                    made last night. It came
                    true.
          Max is amazed.

                    Really? You mean you have to
                    tell the truth?

                              FLETCHER

                   No matter what.

          
          Max grins -- then suddenly asks, in rapid succession.

                              MAX
                    Is wrestling real?

                              FLETCHER

                    set make me go blind?

                               FLETCHER
                    Not in a million years.

                               MAX
                    If I keep making this face--
                         (makes a horrible

                          FACE)
                    will it get stuck that way?

                   .If I go in the water right
                   after lunch, will I drown?

                               FLETCHER
                    Only if you can't 'swim.

                              MAX
                    Why do I have to eat squash?

                               FLETCHER
                    Because your mom buys it.

                             MAX
                   How come you're always too
                   busy to play with me?
          The sudden shift in tone startles Fletcher. He feels
          awful.

                               FLETCHER
                   I . . . I don't know. I ' m . . . Hey,

                    A-number one promise. You and
                    I -- tonight -- baseball.
          Fletcher and Max do their ritual "five" slap.

                                FLETCHER
                      Now, listen, Max, I need a
                      favor from you. I ' m in a
                      little trouble today. I need
                      you to take that wish back.

                                MAX
                      So you can lie?

                                FLETCHER
                      Not to you.

                                MAX
                      To who?

                                FLETCHER
                      Max, sometimes grownups...
                      need to lie. It's hard to
                      explain, but i f . . . Look,
                      here's an example. When Mommy
                      was pregnant with you, she
                      gained a little weight.
                      Se venty pounds. I thought she
                      was gonna give birth to a car.
                      But she'd say to me "How do I
                      lo ok?" So I'd say, "Oh,
                      honey, you're beautiful,
                      you're glowing.11 Otherwise, I
                      would've hurt Mommy's
                      fee ling s. Understand?
          Max nods.

                                MAX
                      You didn't think she was
                      beautiful.

                                FLETCHER
                      Right. No... Max, I don't
                      know how to get along in the
                      grown-up world if I have to
                      stick to the truth. I could
                      lose my case, I could lose my
                      promotion, I could even lose,
                      my job... Do you understand?
          Max shakes his head "no."

          

                                FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                      Will you help me anyway?
          A moment -- then Max reluctantly nods.

                      That's my boy!
          Fletcher opens the box, revealing a cake and candles.... He
          takes out two birthday hats. He puts one on Max and one on
          himself.

                                FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                      Now, do whatever you did last
                      night... only this time, make
                      an un-wish.
          Not really happy, Max turns to the candles on the cake. He
          takes a breath-- and blows them out.

                                MAX

                    this time, mean it.

          at it, then dumps it in a trash barrel.

          A worried and preoccupied Fletcher is heading toward his
          office building when a MACHO ATTORNEY passes by.

          shields his face with his briefcase. Philip recognizes him
          anyway.

                               PHILIP
                    Fletcher! I'm still waiting
                    for your call. I guess you
                    must've lost my card --

                               FLETCHER
                    No --

                              PHILIP
                    Or my phone was busy --

                               FLETCHER
                    No --

                                                                   ·

          

                              PHILIP
                    Or you just forgot --

                              FLETCHER
                    No --

                               PHILIP
                          (cannot be

                           DISCOURAGED)
                    Or something. So anyway,' why
                    don't you swing by my place
                    around seven-thirty!
          Philip starts off, when Fletcher calls after him
          resolutely.

                              FLETCHER
                    Philip... I don't want to come
                    over to your house!
          A long moment, then --

                               PHILIP
                   Fi n e ! We'll go out! There's
                   this new karaoke bar I've been
                   dying to try. I'll pick you
                   up at your office! Seven-
                   thirty! !
          And he runs off.   Frustrated, Fletcher hurries on.

          

          INT. OFFICE'S - DAY


          
          Fletcher drags himself past Greta's desk. Miranda gives
          him the stink-eye. Fletcher doesn't see her.

                             GRETA
                   Do you want your messages?

                                FLETCHER
                   No.
          He goes into his office. Greta is concerned.   She follows
          him in, leaving his door open.

          INT. FLETCHER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS


          
          Fletcher collapses onto his couch. Greta enters.

                             GRETA
                   Are you okay?

                             FLETCHER
                   My son hates me.

                                GRETA
                   No! He loves you. I've seen
                   y ou together. You're his
                   hero.

                                FLETCHER
                   O h yeah? Last night at his
                   birthday party, he made a
                   ·wish. That I wouldn't be able
                   to tell a lie for one whole
                   day.

                                GRETA
                   Kids...

                             FLETCHER
                   It came true.

                                GRETA
                   What?

                                FLETCHER
                   It's true. Didn't it seem odd
                   to you that I kept telling the
                   truth all morning?

                             GRETA
                   Well, yeah, but...

          

                         (INCREDULOUS)
                    You're telling me that you
                    can't lie.

                              FLETCHER
                    That's right!     I am incapable
                    of lying.

          Miranda is 'eavesdropping.    A wicked gleam in her eye,

          INT. FLETCHER'S OFFICE


                              GRETA
                    Just today?

                              FLETCHER
                    Apparently until 9:15 tonight.
                    It's a twenty-four hour curse.

                              GRETA
                    Yes, those are going around.

                              FLETCHER
                    You don't believe me.

                              GRETA
                    Of course not.

                              FLETCHER
                    Go ahead. Ask me something
                    I ' d normally lie about.
          She thinks.

                              GRETA
                   A ll right. Remember a few
                   months ago, I wanted a raise--

                              FLETCHER

                         (QUICKLY)
                    Forget it. Let's not do this.

                              GRETA
                   -- and the firm wouldn't.give
                   me one. And I asked you if
                   you would give it to me out of
                   your own pocket and you said
                   the company wouldn't permit it
                   because it creates jealousy
                   among the other secretaries?
                   Was that true or did you just
                   not want to pony up the dough?

          

          INT. OUTER OFFICE


          
          Greta is emptying all her personal effects into boxes.
          She's leaving. Fletcher is on the phone and looks very
          harras,sed.

                               FLETCHER

          He wants to say "yes", but he can't.

                    Hello... Mom!!
          The phone flies into the air. He catches it.

                              FLETCHER {CONT'D)
                    Mom... Well, I wasn't actually
                    on vacation... Because I
                    didn't want to talk to you...
                    Because you insist on talking
                    to me about Dad's bowel
                    movements -- size, color,
                    frequency... I'll call you
                    later... No, not really.
          He pushes -two more buttons. Then SCREAMS.

                              FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    Oh dammit! I cut him off! I
                    cut off the Judge! Greta...
          He falls to his knees.

                              FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    I'm on my knees in a nine
                    hundred dollar suit. Don't
                    leave.
          Greta stops.     She seems to consider.

                                 GRETA
                    A few years ago a friend of
                    mine had a burglar up on her
                    roof.

                                 FLETCHER
                    Yes?

                   A burglar. -He fell through
                   the kitchen skylight and
                   landed on a cutting board on a
                   butcher's knife, cutting his
                   l e g. He sued my friend. The

          
                    burglar sued my friend.
                    Thanks to guys like you-- he
                    won. My friend had to pay him
                    six thousand dollars. Is that
                    justice?

                               FLETCHER
                    No. . . but what' s your poijit!

                               GRETA
                    My point is, it's hard to get
                    justice. But this is justice,

          She leaves.   Fletcher starts to give chase...

                                 FLETCHER

                    GRETA--
          He runs directly into Miranda.

                                 FLETCHER
                    Aaaah!
          Miranda smiles like a cat that's trapped a mouse.

                                 MIRANDA
                    Ah, Fletcher, so nice to bump
                    i nto you. Are you busy?

                                 FLETCHER
                    Extremely.

                                 MIRANDA
                    Good. Would you follow me,
                    please?
          Highly nervous, Fletcher follows Miranda down the hall.

                               MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                   Fletcher, did you know that
                   the partnership committee is
                   being headed up by Mr. Allan
                   himself?
                         (off his wary

                          NOD)
                   Say, you used to work directly
                   for Mr. Allan, didn't you?
                        (off his waried

                          NOD)
                   Tell me, what do you think of
                   him?

          

                              FLETCHER

                         (HELPLESS)
                    He's a pedantic,
                    pontificating, pretentious
                    bastard, a belligerent old
                    fart, a worthless, steaming
                    pile of cow dung.

                              MIRANDA

                         (GRINNING)
                    How delightful!
          She swings open a door, ushering Fletcher into --

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          The room is filled with ATTORNEYS, including MR. ALLAN,
          the founder himself. Fletcher freezes.

                              MIRANDA
                    Pardon me for interrupting
                    your, meeting. Mr. Allan, you
                    remember Fletcher Reid.

                                                                       ·

                   ·It's good to see you again,
                   Fletcher. '.
          An involuntary WHIMPER from Fletcher.

                              MIRANDA
                    Oh, that's right. You used to
                    work together. .Tell me, what
                    do you think of Mr. Allah?
          Fl etc he r gulps. This is it. His career is history. He's
          trying to hold it back, but--

                              MIRANDA
                    I said... What do you think of
                    Mr. Allan?

                              FLETCHER     .
                    He's a pedantic,
                    pontificating, pretentious
                    bastard, a belligerent old
                    fart, a worthless, steaming
                    pile of cow dung.
          DE AN SILENCE. Then --Mr. Allan bursts into raucous
          LAUGHTER. He is joined by everyone except Miranda, who
          looks on, STUNNED. Everyone pounds the table in hysterics.

          

                                 MR. ALLAN
                    Marvelous! Marvelous! That's
                    what I love most about this
                    firm-- the collegial
                    atmosphere, the hearty good-
                    fellowship!
          Miranda is incensed.

                              MR. ALLAN (CONT'D)
                    And thanks for those flowers
                    for my anniversary. My wife
                    loved them.

                                 FLETCHER
                    Well, I'm due in court... bye-
                    bye.

          INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

          Fletcher exits the conference, closes the door, breathes a
          sigh of relief, then FAINTS.   .

          INT. COURTROOM


          
          CLOSE UP of Fletcher, seated alone at a table. His hands
          are on his-face. He looks totally dazed. At the other
          table, sit Dana Appleton and Mr. Cole.

                                BAILIFF
                    All rise.
          They do. Judge Stevens enters. He sits. Everyone sits.

                                JUDGE STEVENS
                   Counselors, are we ready to
                   begin?

                               FLETCHER
                          (eagerly and a
                           little too

                           LOUDLY)
                   N o sir! We are not ready to
                   b eg in. My client has not
                   arrived.
          The doors OPEN and Virginia Cole enters with her CHILDREN
          and a NANNY.

                               FLETCHER      ·   .
                    --   until now.

          
          He collapses into his chair.

          
                          (to Falk, with

                           DETERMINATION)
                    Did you and Mrs. Cole ever
                    make lo-- forni-- roll in the
                    h-- make the beast with two
                    ba -- Did you two ever fu--
                    fu-- Fu!
          He begins to hyperventilate.     Virginia turns to Falk.

                               VIRGINIA
                    Wate r! Get him water!
          Falk hurries into the building as Fletcher hacks on.

                                FLETCHER
                    Fu-- fu--

                                                              /

                               VIRGINIA
                    S it down! Get some air!
                          (slaps him on the

                          BACK)
                    Try to relax! Breathe deeply!
          Falk hurries out with a cup, hands it to Fletcher, who
          downs it in one gulp -- then spews it out again, SCREAMING
          in PAIN. -

                               VIRGINIA (CONT'D)
                   W hat?!   What?!

          

                                FALK
                    I couldn't find any water, so
                    I got him coffee!
          Fletcher runs up and down the steps, frantically fanning
          h is scalded mouth. The bailiff appears.

                             BAILIFF
                   Judge is taking the bench.
          Fletcher's expression turns to terror.

          INT. COURTROOM - DAY

          The judge settles in. Mr. Allan and a smug Miranda look on
          from the gallery.

                             JUDGE STEVENS
                   You may proceed, Mr. Reid. .
          Everyone turns to Fletcher in anticipation.    In a voice
          quaking with fear...

          

                              VIRGINIA
                    Sorry. One of the kids threw
                    up in the car.
          Virginia takes her seat, leaving her two young children
          sitting dejectedly in the gallery with their nanny.

                               FLETCHER

                          (INCREDULOUS

                           WHISPER)
                    You brought your kids. . . to
                    your divorce?

                              VIRGINIA
                         (by way of

                          EXPLANATION)
                    Sympathy.

                              FLETCHER
                    Well, it's working. I feel
                    sorry for them already.
          The judge BANGS the gavel.

                               JUDGE STEVENS
                    Ms. Appleton, you may begin.

                                                     CUT TO:
          Dana Appleton questions BRYSON, a private investigator.
          Fletcher watches with mounting anxiety, NERVOUSLY DRINKS
          from a GLASS OF WATER at his table.

                              BRYSON
                         (referring to his

                          NOTES)
                    -- From March six through June
                    twelve, I surveilled Mrs. Cole
                    at the behest of Mr. Cole.
                    During that period, I noted
                    that Mr. Cole left each day
                    between seven-forty and seven-
                    fifty. Thereafter, Mrs. Cole
                    would frequently have a male
                    visitor arrive and stay for
                    one to four hours. I was able
                    to take several photographs of
                    the male visitor.
          He shows a photo - - o f a strapping hunk. Fletcher TAKES A

          HUGE DRINK.           .

                              DANA
                    I see. And do you .know what
                    Mrs. Cole and her male visitor

          
                    did during their frequent...
                    visits?

                              BRYSON
                    Well, they were pretty good
                    about keeping the shades drawn
                    -- but I sure was able to
                    hear. I made an audiotape of
                    one such., "session."
          H e hands her the tape. Fletcher refills his glass.

                              DANA
                    With the Court's permission, I
                    would like to play the tape.

                              FLETCHER
                    Your Honor, I object!

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    And why is that, Mr. Reid?

                               FLETCHER
                          (can't help

                           HIMSELF)
                    Because it's devastating to my
                   ·case.
          The judge is startled by his candor.

                               JUDGE STEVENS
                    Overruled..
          As Dana pops the tape into a player, Fletcher anxiously

          DOWNS THE GLASS.
          Periodically CUTTING to Virginia, Mr. Cole, Dan and the
          thirsty Fletcher, we hear Virginia and her visitor engaged
          in intense physical activity.

                              MALE VISITOR (O.S.)
                    So , what did you say? You
                    ready?

                              VIRGINIA (O.S.)
                    Oh boy am I ready.

                             MALE VISITOR (O.S.)
                   Good. Let me help you off
                   with that. Come on, lie down.

                              VIRGINIA (O.S.)
                   Wai t a minute. Do you have
                   protection?

          

                               MALE VISITOR ( O . S . )
                    Right here. Okay, now I ' m
                    gonna show you something new.

                               VIRGINIA ( O . S . )
                    Oh, I've never done it like
                    this before.                    .·.

                              MALE VISITOR (O.S.)
                    Don't worry, you can take it.
                    Oh yeah. That's it. There
                    you go. Yes! Yes!
          WE HEAR labored rhythmic breathing.

                              MALE VISITOR (O.S) (CONT'D)
                    Yes, yes, yes --
          As Dana fast-forwards again, then resumes... with still
          more labored breathing, building intensity and --

                               MALE VISITOR (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Oh yeah, bring it on .home --
                    yes! Yes! Yes!

                              VIRGINIA (O.S.)
                    Yes! YES! YES!
          The groans reach their incredible climax. There's a still
          moment. . .
          As the shy COURT REPORTER, the macho BAILIFFS and the no-
          nonsense judge all mop their brows, Dana shuts off the
          tape. She turns to Fletcher with a satisfied smile.

                              DANA
                    Your witness.

                               FLETCHER
                    No questions.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    No questions? .

                              VIRGINIA
                    No questions?

                                FLETCHER
                          (afraid to ask

                           ANY)
                    No questions.

                                DANA

                          (TRIUMPHANT)
                    Petitioner rests.

          

                                 JUDGE STEVENS
                    All right, Mr. Reid. You may
                    proceed.

                                 FLETCHER
                            (to himself)
                    How?!
          Gathering his courage, he stands, downs the last of his
          water, and moves to the lecturn. He's about to speak...
          when a WONDERFUL FEELING sweeps through him.
          After a momement, he grins.

                              FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    Would the Court be willing to
                    grant me a short bathroom
                    break?

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    It can't wait?

                              FLETCHER
                    Not unless you want to mop up.

                                 JUDGE STEVENS

                            (FRUSTRATED)
                    All right, but get back in
                    here immediately so .we can
                    finish this.
          Fletcher beams. Then necessity compels him to race out.

          INT. REST ROOM - DAY

          Fletcher stands before the urinal, taking the longest leak
          i n legal history. Relief. Then, he looks at his watch.
          It's only 4:15. '

                                FLETCHER
                    What did I think? That I
                    could piss for forty-five
                    minutes?!
          He HITS HIS FOREHEAD in frustration... and gets an idea.
          He HITS HIMSELF AGAIN and AGAIN, SMASHES HIS HEAD INTO THE
          WALL, POKES HIMSELF IN THE EYES, YANKS ON HIS EARS, finally
          KNOCKS HIMSELF IN THE STALL, where he continues his attack.
          A MAN enters, hears a commotion from behind the stall door.

                              MAN
                    What's going on in-there?

          

                                FLETCHER (O . S . )
                    I ' m abusing myself! Do you
                    mind?!
          The man looks disgusted. He carefully leaves the room.

          INT. COURTROOM - DAY

          The judge is PISSED. Suddenly the bailiff helps in the
          severly beaten Fletcher. The entire courtroom is SHOCKED.

                              BAILIFF
                    I found him like this in the
                    bathroom. Somebody beat the
                    hell out of him.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    Who did this?

                               FLETCHER

                          (TRUTHFULLY)
                    A madman, Your Honor.. A
                    desperate fool at the end of
                    his pitiful.rope.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                   -What did he look like?

                              FLETCHER

                         (DESCRIBING

                          HIMSELF)
                    About five eleven, hundred
                    eighty-five pounds, crazed
                    look in his eye.

                                 JUDGE STEVENS
                    Bailiff, have the deputies
                    search the building.
          A HUBBUB rises. He bangs the gavel.

                             JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)
                   Under the circumstances, I
                   have no choice but to recess
                   this case until tomorrow
                   morning at nine.
          Fletcher smiles serenly -- until --

                              JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)
                    -- Unless, of course, you
                    think you can still proceed?
          Fletcher covers his mouth in a desperate attempt to avoid
          answering, but he can't repress the truth.

          

                                 JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)
                    Can you?

                               FLETCHER
                    Yes, I can.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    Splendid. I admire your
                    courage, Mr. Reid. I'll give
                    you a few minutes to compose
                    yourself, and then we'll get
                    started.
          Fletcher looks as if he has just been sentenced to death.

          EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - DAY

          Fletcher sits on the courthouse steps, miserable. PHONE

          RINGS.

                                 FLETCHER
                    Hello.

          INTERCUT WITH MAX AT HOME. AUDREY IS THERE.

                                 MAX
                    Dad...

                              FLETCHER
                         (summoning up

                          ENTHUSIASM)
                    Maxi-pad. How's it going?

                                 MAX
                    Great. You know Paul and
                    Emanuel from across the
                    street?

                                 FLETCHER
                    The twins.

                                MAX .

                           (EXCITEDLY)
                   Well, they never want to play
                   baseball with me, but I told
                   them I was gonna play tonight
                   with my Dad, so now they want
                   to play with us. Is it okay?

                                 FLETCHER
                   Sure.

          

                               MAX
                    Oh boy. We're setting up a
                    whole field in the yard.
                    Where we buried Petey the
                    hamster is second base.
                         (Fletcher sighs)
                    You're still coming right?'

                               FLETCHER
                          (sees Virginia

                           APPROACHING)
                    I'11 be there. I gotta go
                    now, Max. I'll see you in two
                    hours.
          Max hangs up.

                               MAX
                         (to Audrey)
                    He's really coming.
          She smiles, but she's worried. .

          COURTHOUSE STEPS

                                                                    ·

          
          Virginia approaches with her handsome lover, LAURENCE FALK.

                               VIRGINIA
                    Mr. Reid, you remember
                    Laurence Falk, the man from
                    the tape.

                              FALK
                    How are you?

                               FLETCHER
                    I've slipped into the seventh
                    circle of Hell, thank you, and
                    you?
          Virginia exchanges an anxious look with Falk.

                               VIRGINIA
                    Shouldn't we go over our
                    testimony?

                               FLETCHER
                    Well, basically the plan is I
                    walk you through the tape step
                    by step, I ask you questions--

                               VIRGINIA
                    And we give the explanation
                    you came up with.

          

                                 FLETCHER
                    Exactly.

          

                                FALK
                    So all we have to do is lie.
                    Sounds simple enough.

                                FLETCHER
                    Do esn't it? And I'll finish
                    up with a dramatic series of
                    questions, something like...
                    "Mr. Falk, isn't it true that
                    you and Mrs. Cole have never
                    made lo--"
          But Fletcher GAGS. He CAN'T GET THE QUESTION OUT.   The
          others look concerned, but he waves them off.

                              FLETHCER (CONT'D)
                    Sorry. I'm fine. "Mr. Falk,
                    isn't it true that you and
                    Mrs. Cole have never made lo--

                    IO-.H

          
          To his horror, he GAGS AGAIN, .unable to form the word.

                                 FLETCHER
                            (to himself)
                    Oh my God! I can't do it! I
                    can't finish the question if I
                    know the answer is a lie!
          At this moment Miranda and Mr. Allan come up the steps.

                                MR. ALLAN
                    Don't let me interrupt,
                    Fletcher. I just want you to
                    know I'll be observing this
                    a fternoon. Miranda insisted I
                    see you in action.
          Fletcher shoots a hateful look at Miranda. She smiles.

                              MR. ALLAN (CONT'D)
                    I'm looking forward to it. Go
                    get 'em!

          
          Mr. Allan and Miranda head into the building, leaving
          Fletcher more desperate than before.

                                FLETCHER
                   C'mon! Gotta rephrase the
                   question!

          

                                      FLETCHER
                         Respondent calls... Lawrence
                         Falk.
               Fletcher's clears his throat.       Here goes...

                                      FLETCHER
                         Mr. Falk, do you know my
                         client, Virginia Cole?

                                      FALK
                         Yes.

                                      FLETCHER
                         Isn't it true that your
                         relationship with my client is
                         entirely platonic, not?
               The "not" was INVOLUNTARY.       It takes everyone by surprise.

                                      FALK
                         Excuse me?

                                     FLETCHER
                        If I might rephrase your
                        Honor.
                              (trying again)

                               it, beams with

                        Mr. Falk, is not your
                        relationship with my client
                        entirely platonic?

                                     FALK

                                (CONFUSED)
                        No.     I mean, yes.     I think.

                                     FLETCHER
                        Yes, is your relationship with
                        my client not entirely
                        platonic, or yes, is not your
                        relationship with my client
                        entirely platonic?

                                    FALK
                        What?

          

                               FLETCHER
                    How 'bout just answering the
                    question you think I'm asking?              '

                          (screaming at

          A MURMUR erupts from the crowd.

                   lie . Until nine-sixteen
                   tonight, I can't even.ask a
                   question that calls for a lie!
          Virginia GRABS HIM BY THE TIE, pulls him CLOSE to her face.

                   attorney had a sudden attack
                   of conscience!
          Fletcher suddenly stops -- focused on something Virginia
          said.

                   any younger...
          Fletcher quickly looks at the blowup of Virginia's prenup
          and her passport.

          So on this single document,

          as vain as you would also lie
          about her age. It says you
          were born in 1964. What's the
          truth? 1962? '60? How young
          did you try to make yourself?

          My client lied about her age
          because she was only 17 when
          s he got married. Which makes

                    In light of this new evidence,

                               VIRGINIA
                   No. You pointed out that my
                   husband took advantage of a
                   poor underage girl. I was the
                   vic tim here. And now I'm

                   M r. Reid? Do we have an
                   agreement on custody or not?
          Fletcher takes a distressed look at the children.

          A sad Max is seated on the steps. TWO other BOYS are there
          with baseball equipment.

          

                               PAUL
                    We're going home.

                              EMMANUEL
                    Yeah, thanks for the great
                    game, Max.
          Emanuel knocks Max's hat off. Audrey's been watching from
          the door. She goes and sits by her son.

                              AUDREY
                    Max, honey. Your dad had a
                    very big case today. It
                    probably just--

                              MAX
                    I don't want to talk about it.

                              AUDREY
                    Okay.

                              MAX

                         (SUDDENLY)
                    I hate dad! I hate him!

                              AUDREY
                    Honey, don^t say that.
          Max is really upset. It's "that look" and then some. The
          look Audrey never wanted to see again. She makes a
          decision.

                              AUDREY
                    Max, there's something I-want
                    to talk to you about. . .

          Max and Audrey at the table. The airline tickets Jerry
          gave her are in front of them.

                                MAX
                      When would we move?

                                 AUDREY
                      Soon. My semester's almost
                      over. You only have a week
                      left of school... You like
                      Jerry don't you?
                            (he nods)
                      So what do you say, should we
                      check it out? Jerry wants us
                      to come with him tonight. He
                      has to pick out a place to
                      live and he really wants our
                      help?

                                 MAX
                      Could I get a sled for when it
                      snows?

                                AUDREY
                      Of course you can.
          Max thinks, then:

                                 MAX
                      Okay.

                                BEGGAR
                      Change? Absolutely.

                      I'll give you ten bucks.

                    You're saving my life, Philip.

                              PHILIP
                    You know, it's funny, but for
                    some reason I was beginning to
                    think you didn't like me.
                    Isn't that silly?

                               FLETCHER .
                    No. It's not silly.       I don't
                    like you.

                               PHILIP
                    What?

                               FLETCHER
                   I don't like you. I'm sorry.
                   I find you boring. I hate
                   ch ara des . And you wouldn't
                   know a good time if it sat on
                   your face.
                          (feels bad)
                   I'm sorry. It was easier than
                   telling you how I really felt.
                   Are you upset?
          A moment, then:

                               PHILIP
                   No. To be honest, I don't
                   like you either. You treat
                   people like obstacles and you
                   cheat at charades. .

          

                                FLETCHER
                     Then why are you always trying
                     to socialize with me?

                                PHILIP
                     You're a client. I figured if
                     I didn't try to be your
                     friend, you'd get a new
                     accountant.

                                FLETCHER
                     Philip, I don't like you as a
                     person, but I'm crazy about
                     you as my accountant. I ' d
                     never hire a new accountant.
                     Never!

                               PHILIP
                     So we don't have to like each
                     other anymore?

                               FLETCHER    -
                     Not at all.

                 .              PHILIP
                     All right. Sooner I get you
                     ·to the airport, sooner I can
                     dump your sorry ass off.

          No way he'll catch it.
          Then, he sees a MECHANIC working on a MOBILE STAIRS UNIT
          (These are the steps they pull up to planes) Fletcher gets
          an insane idea. . .
          The worker hears an ENGINE START, looks up to SEE FLETCHER
          in the truck, driving off, TOWING THE STAIRS.

                                  WORKER

          Fletcher's DRIVING THE STAIRS trying to catch up with the
          plane. GROUND WORKERS react.
          Soon, the "stairs" are racing alongside the plane.
          Fletcher looks for signs of Audrey and Max but he's too low
          to see in the plane.
          He grabs the TOOL BOX'on the passenger's seat,-puts it on
          the accelerator, pinning it to the floor. Then, he CLIMBS

          THE STEPS!

          
          The "stairs" sway back and forth as he reaches the top.

          EXT. TARMAC - DAY

          Fletcher is BANGING on the windows. People on the plane
          POINT, STARE in amazement.
          Fletcher looks ahead, SEES the stairs about to CRASH INTO
          THE WING! Fletcher desperately fiddles with some controls.
          At the last second, finds the one that LOWERS THE STAIRS.
          He surfs under the wing...
          ...    and RAISES UP THE STAIRS at the other side.
          Fletcher's at the front of the plane, where he finally
          spots. . .

          MAX, AUDREY AND JERRY SEATED IN THE BULKHEAD
          Max has the window seat, Audrey arid Jerry are next to him.
          Audrey has on her headset and Jerry is looking for his
          seatbelt. NEITHER SEES FLETCHER.
          Fletcher SCREAMS to get their attention. But it's TOO

          NOISY.
          Then, Fletcher looks ahead and his EYES GO WIDE!

          FLETCHER'S POV
          The RUNWAY is ENDING!.

          
          Just then, Max looks up...SEES HIS DAD. Audrey is now
          trying to help Jerry find his seat belt.

          

                                    AUDREY
                          (checks under his

                           SEAT)
                     It's right here, honey.

                                    M AX
                     Mom!   Mom!!               '

                               AUDREY
                     Just a second, Max.

                               MAX
                     Mom, it's dad!

                               AU DREY
                     W hat? What about dad?
          Audrey turns. Then she sees Fletcher WAVING weakly...

                                  AUDREY
                     Fletcher?!

          AT THAT INSTANT -- THE PLANE MAKES A SHARP TURN!
          BUT THE STAIRS DON'T! They keeps going straight, heading ·
          right for the END OF THE RUNWAY and a parked LOADED LUGGAGE

          CART. . -
          And BAM!   FLETCHER, THE STAIRS, THE LUGGAGE ALL GO FLYING!

          
          Audrey strains to watch as FLETCHER lands hard ONTO A

          MOUNTAIN OF BAGGAGE!

          CLOSE ON FLETCHER

          
          With all the strength he has he lifts his head, sees he's
          in one piece, and then COLLAPSES IN DEFEAT.

                                                      CUT TO:

          INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT


          
          Fletcher's BANGED UP pretty good. His head is BANDAGED.
          He.puts a COLD COMPRESS to his BRUISED FOREHEAD and WINCES.

                                FLETCHER
                           (mumbles to

                            HIMSELF)
                     Oh boy, the truth hurts.   Yes
                     indeed.

                                DEPUTY
                     Mr. Reid. Someone made bail
                     for you.

          

          EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT


          
          Fletcher comes out LIMPING, totally dishevelled, missing a
          shoe, and still holding the compress.

                               FLETCHER

                          (WEAKLY)
                    Greta? Is that you?
          He looks up and is surprised to see AUDREY and JERRY
          waiting for him just outside the door.
          Max is sitting at the bottom of the stairs, still ANGRY.
          He sees his dad, then quickly turns away.

                              FLETCHER
                         (to Audrey and
                          Jerry, trying to
                          seem chipper)
                   Sorry I made you miss your
                   flight, not really.
                         (no response)
                   You're obviously a little
                 . upset, not that I blame you...
                   although I'll bet you'll still
                   get the bonus miles. . .

                              AUDREY
                    Fletcher, are you crazy?
                    What were you doing?

                              FLETC HER
                    That's two questions. A; Yes,
                    but I think the legal term is
                    temporarily insane. And B; I
                    was trying to finally have
                    that talk with you about
                    Boston.
          Audrey's patience are growing thin...

                              FLETCHER
                   Okay, okay... The whole truth
                   and nothing but the truth,
                        (with difficulty,

                         SINCERELY)
                   I tried to stop the plane
                   because it was taking off with
                   my life... you and Max.
          This comes as a surprise to Audrey. Not just what Fletcher
          said, but the way he said it.

          

                               FLETCHER
                    I know you've met somebody...
                    somebody pretty great... and
                    the truth is I wish you didn't
                    but you did and... All I ' m
                    asking i s . . . Please don't move
                    to Boston. Please don't take
                    Max away.
          She's definitely moved by Fletcher, but not convinced.

                               AUDREY
                    You can come visit anytime.
                    It's only a four hour flight.

                               FLETCHER
                    I don't want to visit him.
                    That's what I've been doing--
                    visiting him, dropping by,
                    stopping in. I want to be in
                    his life. I don't want to be
                    some jerk that sees him at
                    Easter. I want to be his
                    father.
          Fletcher turns to Jerry.

                               FLETCHER
                   I know I have no right to ask,
                   but can I talk you out of
                   taki ng that job? I can get
                   you a better job here in L.A.
                   I've got all kinds of
                   connect ions... what do you do
                   again?

                              JERRY
                    I design security systems.

                               FLETCHER
                    How symbolic. Okay great.
                    You know Pac-Tec?

                             JERRY
                   The biggest.

                               FLETCHER
                   One of their systems shorted
                   out and burned down a
                   supermarket. I got them off.
                   Another proud day for justice.
                   If I ask them they'll beat
                   your Boston offer in two
                   s ec on ds .    ..

          

                               AUDREY
                    Don't put Jerry in the middle.

                               JERRY
                    It's okay.
                          (to Fletcher)
                    Boston means this
                          (snaps his

                           FINGERS)
                    to me. All I want is for this
                    lady and Max to be happy.
                    Preferably, with me. Whatever
                    they want, I'll go along with.
          They both look to Audrey.

                              AUDREY
                    All I want is for Max to be
                    happy.
          Audrey looks over to Max seated at the bottom of the
          stairs. He's still upset.

                              AUDREY
                    You better know your jury.
                    You're hot exactly Max's hero
                    today.

                              FLETCHER
                    Just let me present my case.
          Fletcher walks over,, tries to be playful, starts WALKING,

          TALKING LIKE THE TERMINATOR.

                                FLETCHER/TERMINATOR
                    I have been sent from the
                    future to destroy you. . .
                    Argghhh!
                         (no response, a

                          BEAT)
                    You mad at me?
          Max nods. Fletcher's at a loss for how to begin. Then:

                               FLETCHER
                    You wanted me to stop lying.
                    But lying isn't the problem. ..
                    Why we lie ~ that's the
                    problem. Sometimes we lie to
                    make someone else feel better.
                    But sometimes we lie because
                    the truth gets in our way...
                          (touches him)
                    But being an adult means you
                    sacrifice some things for more

          
                    important things. Much more
                    important things. I was so
                    stupid, Max.
                          (pointing to his
                           own head)
                    Malfunction in vector one.
                    All this time you've been here
                    and I could see you anytime I
                    felt like it. And I...
                    didn't. Please don't go to
                    Boston. Max, I love you more
                    than anything else in the
                    world and you know it's true.
                    I couldn't say it if it
                    weren't true. Not today.
          A moment as Max studies his father, then:

                              MAX
                          (to Audrey)
                    He's telling the truth, Mom.
                    He's not allowed to lie. I
                    made a wish and anything Dad
                    says has to be the truth.
                          (to Fletcher) ..
                    Right?
          But Fletcher's looking at his watch...

                               FLETCHER
                    Max. .. it's 9:22.

                              AUDREY
                    What?

                              FLETCHER
                    Max, you made the wish at
                    9:15. I've been able to lie
                    for the last seven minutes.
          Max steps away from Fletcher.

                              MAX
                    So then, you were...

                              FLETCHER
                    No! It wasn't a lie. I just
                    wanted to be honest with you
                    and tell you -- there was no
                    wish to guarantee it anymore.
                    You just have to believe me.
          Max looks at Audrey, who is letting Max decide for himself
          Max looks at Fletcher and tries to decide.

          

                                       MAX
                          (to Audrey)
                     Mommy... do we have to go to
                     Boston?
          Audrey looks at Jerry, then back at Max.

                                   AUDR EY
                     No.      We don't have to.
          Fletcher hugs his son -- the kind of hug that says "I'll
          never let you go."

                                       MAX
                          (to Fletcher)
                     Can we play catch tomorrow?
          Fletcher smiles. . .

          EXT. PARK - DAY

          A beautiful park with a basball diamond. Fletcher is
          seated on a bench, waiting. He's dressed in sweats, with a
          baseball glove. Soon, Jerry, Audrey, and Max pull up...

                                       M AX
                     Dad! !

                                       FLETCH ER
                     Ma x i mu m ! !
          Fletcher picks Max up.

                                       MAX
                    Transformer!!! .
          Fletcher and Max do the TRANSFORMER ROUTINE again...

                                       FLETCHER
                     Malfunction in vector seven.
                     I have lost control of my
                     affection reflex...
          Fletcher starts KISSING MAX on the head over and over. He
          sees Audrey.

                                       FLETCHER
                     Procreate!          Procreate!

                                   AUDREY

                              (PLAYFULLY)
                     Fletcher... You're gonna lose
                     a limb--

          

                              MAX
                    Come on, dad, let's play
                    catch!!

                              FLETCHER
                    Sr. . .

                    UE
                          (starts to toss

                           MAX)
                    Here you go, mom.
                          (Max screams)
                    Oh, you mean with a ball...
          He puts Max down. Max runs into position. Fletcher stops
          for a second and turns to Jerry, man to man.

                              FLETCHER
                    I take back every dirty,
                    dishonest thing I ever said
                    about you, wrote about you,
                    faxed about you, E-mailed
                    about you.

                              JERRY
                    Appreciated.
          Fletcher tosses the baseball up and down.

                              FLETCHER
                    So, you up for a little
                    friendly competition?

                             JERRY
                   No, you go play with your son.

                              FLETCHER
                   I wasn't talking about
                   basesball.
          A slow smile from Jerry. Fletcher winks and tosses the
          ball to Max.

                              FLETCHER
                         (to Max)
                   Alright, it's time to show you
                   the old Fletcher Reid change up.

          
          Fletcher winds up in an EXAGERATED SUPER FAST MOTION, then
          instantly shifts to SUPER SLOW MOTION. Max CRACKS UP.
          Audrey LAUGHS. Jerry can't help but smile, too.
          There may be better things in life... but at this moment,
          it's hard to think of a single one. Honestly.
          

          

                              THE END
