     FADE IN:


1   EXT. BEACH HOUSE - MONTECITO, CALIFORNIA - DAY                1    
    A late afternoon sky, a red tile roof and the Santa Barbara
    coast line frame this party of old friends. A trio plays           
    Brazilian music as guests carry drinks and nibble on dessert.      


2   CLOSE - ON A FOURSOME OF FRIENDS                              2
    The Couple who live in this house, SALLY AND TED, drink
    champagne as they chat with their closest friends, JANE AND        
    JAKE.

    JANE is mid-fifties and has embraced that fact. She knows 50
    is not the new 40 and because of that, she is still described
    by all who know her as beautiful. Everything about this
    woman's appearance screams "solid."

    The years have been good to JAKE. He's never lost his looks,
    his killer smile, or his ability to charm. He lifts his
    glass of champagne.

               Some things never change.

The Two Women exchange a quick look when a tall, ADORABLE 21    
YEAR OLD BOY joins the group, holding a bottle of beer. This
is OLIVER, Sally and Ted's son. All four light up as Oliver
puts his arm around his Mom.

    in jeans and a tank top CARRYING A CARTON OF BOOKS, A YOGA
    MAT AND A SMALL LAMP. Gabby is Jane and Jake's middle child.       
    But unlike most middle children, this one has never suffered
    from being ignored. Not a possibility with Jane as your
    mother. We are:


    EXT. JANE'S HOUSE - LATE DAY

    The house is modest and charming and sits on a few acres in
    the lush green hills of Santa Barbara. Neat rows of
    vegetables dot the landscape.

    Gabby arrives at her already packed Prius, where her OLDER         
    SISTER, LAUREN, 26, is trying to fit everything into the
    trunk. Lauren is more conservatively dressed than Gabby and        
    has an air of maturity about her.

              I will. I'll call you!                                       
                        LAUREN
              Knock `em dead, little one.

                        HARLEY
              And call us when you get there,
              too. And no texting and driving.

    Jane loves that Harley said that. Gabby gets in her car and            
    starts off.

                        HARLEY
                  (puts his arm around
                   Jane's shoulder)
              They grow up so friggin' fast. I
              hate it.                                                     
    Gabby pulls out of the driveway and out of sight.                      
                        LAUREN
              Maybe you should get a dog.

                           JANE
              Oh my God.     Goodbye you two.   Love
              you.

                        HARLEY
                  (heading for their car and
                   getting into the
                   passenger seat)
              Love you boss!

    As Lauren and Harley drive off,    Jane turns and looks at her
    suddenly very empty nest.


4   INT. JANE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                                    4
    A Woman's house. Books and art collected over years.
    Interesting, unexpected pieces of furniture. Jane kicks off
    her heels, now feeling short and alone. Deep breath!


5   INT. KITCHEN                                                      5
    Cramped, but clearly a cook's kitchen.      The Kids have left a       
    few glasses and plates on the island.
                                                              9.


    Jane gathers them and as she rinses them at the sink, she          
    suddenly and surprisingly feels very alone. She pauses,            
    allows herself the moment, then forces herself to snap out of      
    it.                                                                


7   INT. THE BAKERY - MONTECITO - DAY                             7    
    This is Jane's other home. A large, bright, bustling
    BAKERY/RESTAURANT. The bakery counter could rival any in
    Paris. Last year, The New York Times rated Jane's pain au          
    chocolat the best in the United States. A line waits to get
    in.

    A very relaxed Jane is behind the busy counter, easily moving
    between her young staff. The atmosphere is efficient and           
    friendly.

    Jane adjusts a few signs on the counter, then reaches inside
    the display case, pulling out a tray of muffins topped with
    powdered sugar. She carries the tray to the open pass-
    through to the BUSY KITCHEN and calls to the head Baker.

                        JANE
              Reynaldo...
                  (nods to the muffins)

                        REYNALDO
              Too much sugar.

                        JANE
              Little bit.                                              
    Reynaldo nods as Jane hands him the tray.                          
    Jane notices a line waiting to get up to the bakery counter.
    Knowing what to do, Jane's staff has already set out cups of
    coffee with lids.

                        JANE
              Who wants coffee while they're
              waiting?

    Jane and the staff hand out the free coffee.

    JANE WALKS THE COUNTER - MOMENTS LATER

    refills a glass of water, checking on her customers.               
                        JANE
                  (quietly to a Young                                  
                   Employee)

                                                             10.



    The Young Employee nods as Jane looks up and sees a MAN on         
    the other side of the counter. They exchange polite hellos         
    when Jane notices PETER, tan and confident, approaching her.       
                        JANE
                  (all smiles)                                         
              Peter!

    PETER joins ADAM, the man who stands across from Jane. Adam        
    is handsome in a way that sneaks up on you. There's                
    something reserved and refreshing about his demeanor. He
    holds rolled blueprints.

                        PETER
              Jane, I can't remember, have you                         
              ever met Adam Schaeffer?                                 
                JANE                             ADAM
    No.                             Yes.


                        ADAM

                        JANE
                  (to Peter)
              So excited!


8   INT. JANE'S SMALL OFFICE - UPSTAIRS AT THE BAKERY             8
    A farmhouse table almost fills the room. On the walls,
    posters for Jane's two cookbooks, framed food photos and a
    few reviews.

    Jane, Peter, and Adam sit around the table as Adam rolls out
    the blueprints in front of Jane.

                        JANE
                  (before she looks)
              I've been thinking about this
              addition for ten years.                                  

    Peter and Adam watch as Jane's eagle eye examines the plan.
                                                          11.



                    JANE
          Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh, niiice....I
          like this wall of windows, Peter.

                    PETER
          That was Adam actually.

                      JANE
          Oh.
              (still perusing, then to
               Peter)
          Love where you put the stairs.
          That's so good!

                    PETER
          Adam's idea...

Did she hear that?

                    JANE
          Oh my God, the kitchen! Finally -                      
          I have a real kitchen with four                        
          walls... It's...oh, wow...you                          
          actually understood what I wanted!

Jane looks to Peter with enormous appreciation.   Peter looks    
to Adam.

door.

          No, no, didn't mean to be.

          The truth is, in my current                             
          bathroom, I have two sinks and

9   INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - FOLLOWING                              9
    Way too chic for a dentist's office. Jane sits nervously in
    a chair in a well styled, well upholstered examination room.
    The door opens quickly and a handsome, crisp looking DOCTOR
    ENTERS.

                         JANE

              Hi. Jane Adler. So, I just wanted
              to start with... and please don't
              take this the wrong way but I'm the
              type of person who kind of makes
              fun of people who get plastic
              surgery.

                        DR. MOSS
              I understand.

                        JANE
              You do? Good, because, you know,
              some women can look a little fake                        
              and plasticky. And in my opinion --
              worse.

                         DR. MOSS
              I agree.

                        JANE
              Oh, that's good, so, well, as
              against the whole thing as I am, I
              do have a problem that's been
              bugging me. My left eyelid is
              really saggy. I find I'm sometimes
              holding it up when I'm watching TV
              or reading and I was wondering if
              that's something you could fix.

                  (looking at her closely)
              It's resting on your eye lashes.

                    very tiny ruler)
               Actually you have the same amount
               of excess skin on both sides.

                         JANE
               I do? Well, I'm only interested in
               fixing one eye.                                       
                         DR. MOSS
               Jane, what you need to fix this is
               a brow lift.

                         JANE
               A brow lift? Wh-what is that
               exactly?

                           DR. MOSS
               We surgically cut at your hair
               line. Incision goes right across                      
               here.

                     by indicating a line
                     drawn like a headband)
               Then we just lift the skin up a
               little tighter across the skull.
                   (Jane nods, already hating
                     this)
               We staple it back in place right
               above your ears. Recovery isn't
               all that bad but you could be
               fairly numb and you'll probably                       
               have a headache that lasts anywhere
               from say 3 to 6 months.


10   INT. ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING                               10
     Jane flies into the elevator, out of breath and a little
     nauseous. She taps on the Lobby button.   The elevator moves
     down. PING. The DOORS OPEN and Jane looks into an empty
     hallway, facing a SIGN that reads, Santa Barbara Fertility
     Center. Helping Couples Become Parents.

     Jane hears someone is about to get on the elevator, steps
     back toward the corner. A messy looking 5 YEAR OLD BOY          
     dashes in. Jane recognizes him. She looks up and Jake and
     his wife, Agness, in oversized dark shades and a long black     
     dress (very Angelina Jolie) get on the elevator, obviously      
     mid-argument.

Agness' mood seems very dark today. They instantly shut up
when they realize Jane is in the elevator.

                     AGNESS
          Jane!

                    JAKE
          Hold on Pedro, I'm talking to
          someone.

Pedro sits on the floor, crashing into the back wall of the
elevator.

                    AGNESS
          Pedro, up! Now!!

Jane unconsciously holds up her left eyebrow.

                    JAKE
          What are you doing in this
          building?

                     JANE
          Dentist.

          You don't go to Sharon anymore?

                    JANE
          Uh, no... changed.

Jane looks at the fertility literature in Jake's hand just as
Jake slips it behind his back. An awful two seconds of
silence, then Jane notices a tattoo of a tiger on Agness'
back. It creeps her out.
                                                              16.


     Jake catches Jane's reaction, then thank God the doors open.
     Jake leans down and picks up Pedro who instantly climbs up      
     his back.                                                       
                         JAKE
               Honey, don't do that..

11   As they all EXIT THE ELEVATOR, Pedro has now made his way up
                                                               11    
     to Jake's shoulders. Think chimpanzee. Agness' cell RINGS       
     and as she answers it --

                         JANE
               -- See you in the Big Apple.

12   INT. JANE'S KITCHEN/DINING AREA - THAT NIGHT              12
     Jane and THREE OF HER GIRLFRIENDS are mid-meal. The wine is
     flowing and the women are laughing. TRISHA has happily never
     been married. JOANNE is widowed and DIANE is divorced. They
     are all Jane's age and have been friends forever.

               the staples and the headache for
               six months... it was the most                         
               insane hour of my life.

                         DIANE

                         DIANE
               I know. First of all, he was a
               complete prick for cheating on you.

                         JANE
               Well, can't disagree with that.

          DIANE
And then he marries her... a known
lunatic.

          JANE
She has a big job.

          TRISHA
Why do you always say that?

          JANE
Because she does. She runs the
whole marketing department at KY,
whatever that station's called so
she's not that big of a lunatic.

          DIANE
Janey, come on, he cheats on you
with her, your 20 year marriage
ends then six months later she
leaves Jake for some random guy,
has a baby, leaves that guy,
marries Jake and she's not nuts?

Jo, you're so lucky Jerry's dead.

          JOANNE
Oh, thanks.

No, I mean, you never have to bump
into him.

          JOANNE
That's true.

Janey, you want to meet a guy I met
on Match.com that I didn't like?

Gee, what a great offer.   I don't
think so.

He wasn't that awful.

Trisha stops at Jane's seat, refilling Jane's wine glass.

          Okay. I don't know if this is true,                  
          but I read on line about this woman
          who hadn't done it in so long her
          vagina closed up.

All the Women SCREAM.

      them.

      Lauren and Gabby run to Luke, hug him, commenting on his            
      hair, his shoes, his jeans, his tan. Jane lights up when she

     close, a Good Looking Couple in their early forties gets on.
     As they go up. The Guy has his hand around the woman's
     waist, his fingers fanning her butt. The Couple looks at

HEARS something very familiar. Jake's laugh. She looks
across the bar and sees Jake talking to the bartender. He
seems to be alone. Jane waves. Jake notices her and smiles.

     Jake and Jane are dancing...it's familiar yet with the blush
     of the new. Something's going on here. Jake starts singing.
     Jane joins in. This is by far, the loosest we've seen her.
     Of course, it helps that she's drunk. They dance around one
     another without inhibition. A mating dance....

     They're in bed and they've done it. They're not even
     entirely undressed. They're spent, sweaty, breathing
     heavily. Jake cups his hand on Jane's vagina, gives it a
     solid pat and hold.

     are Gabby, Harley and Lauren, hooting, clapping and                
     screaming, "There he is!!!" And next in line is Jake manning
     the video camera, wiping away tears.

     ON THE FIELD, Luke spots his gang in the bleachers and gives
     a broad bow.

     The Adlers go crazy, especially Jane, who does a finger
     whistle. Jake looks over at Jane with puppy dog eyes. The
     girls notice, assuming their Dad is emotional over the
     ceremony. Jane feels Jake's glare but won't dare look over
     at him. Gabby nudges her Mom to look over at Dad. Jane             
     turns his way, sees that look in his eyes and starts to bawl.

     Jake slips off his shoe and rubs his foot up Jane's leg and
     under her skirt.

     BACK TO SCENE

     Jane jumps, quickly turning it into a reaction to Luke's
     story. She gives Jake a private stare that says, "stop or
     I'll kill you."

     taking out juice...

                    JANE
          Jake, come on. This is just too
          weird. We have to just never do
          what we did - ever again. You're            
          an adulterer and I'm an awful
          person, basically. I haven't slept
          in days. What we did was just so
          wrong on so many levels.

                    JAKE
          And it was so right on a couple of

          bar, dancing...after dancing...

               reminded)
          Come on, you and I haven't had fun
          like that in a hundred years.

          Yes! Because we're not supposed to
          have fun like that! We're
          divorced!   Are you like, what?
          Unhappy at home?   Does she not
          "understand" you? Did you just              
          want to know what it would be like
          with someone my age? What is this?

                    JAKE
          I'd be lying if I said I never
          think about you, Janey. I think
          about you. A lot. And no, it's not
          perfect at home. Obviously. Look
          at me. I've got three grown kids
          and I'm going to kindergarten
          interviews. I'm a walking cliche.

Jane shrugs.   She agrees.
                                       38.



           JAKE
And I can't, literally can't stop
thinking about what happened in New
York. Fate brought us together
once, maybe it happened again.
    (she pauses...)
And I know... you've moved on with           
your life, I get it, but you can't
deny something real and honest
happened that night. Can't we just
go with it, see where it takes us.
No one has to know.
    (Jane shudders)
You were so great. So loose and
sexy. How often do you get to be
like that?    You can run and open
restaurants and build your perfect
kitchen but what about having
someone to hold you in the middle
of the night...?

          JANE
Not high on my list these days.

          JAKE
But what if that someone is someone
who's known you since you're 23 and
loved you for most of your life.

          JANE
I forgot what a good lawyer you
are.

          JAKE
Give this a shot, Janey.... Life is          
short and it's tough. Don't
discount what we have with each
other.

You know what they say... people in
nursing homes who have plants live
longer than the people without

     Jane and Jake have done it again. In broad daylight and
     sober. They catch their breath.

                         JANE
               Oh, God, it's official.    We're
               having an affair.

                         JAKE

               everything?

                         JANE
               Because that's what this is.

                         JAKE
               Yes, in its crassest form, maybe,
               if we were two other people.

                         JANE
               Just because we were married for 19
               years does not not make this an
               affair.

                         JAKE
               Okay, but since we were together
               for so long, it's not really that
               wrong.

                         JANE
               Really? You want to run that logic
               by your wife?

     Jane fans herself.


                         JANE
               Do me a favor, you're on my side.
               Can we switch? I feel disoriented.

                         JAKE
               Since when is this your side?

                         JANE

They switch sides. In the middle of this maneuver Jake lands
on top of Jane. He pauses.

                    JAKE
          Could I interest you in a little...

They flop onto the opposite sides of the bed.    Jane fans
herself. So hot.

Jane pulls the sheet up.   They look at one another. He gets        
her to smile.

Jake starts to get dressed. Jane watches him from bed,
checking out his stomach. He notices.

Literally. You know me.

Yes we do. You don't do anything
wrong, or bad. Ever. So you're               
allowed this one. I'm sorry ... I
kinda love it.

He was yours first.

True. Not that I want him back by
the way.

Thanks.

I mean you've outgrown him. You've
blossomed, you feng shuied your

let him talk you into saving him.

I won't...
    (wonders what that means)

               Oh, forget that.    Agness is still

     Jane walks through the busy kitchen holding a sheet of paper.
     Her shirt is a little more fitted. Her make up, a little
     prettier. She crosses to the head Baker who's just taking a
     tray of cookies out of the oven.

     Water is running in the sink, even though no one's at the
     sink. Jake is in the shower stall, fully dressed, putting
     away his cell. He quietly pushes the shower door open and
     then carefully shuts it with a small snap. Jake fake coughs
     and then turns off the sink water. He checks his watch when
     he hears GLASS BREAKING in another room then hears Agness
     calling his name in anger. He leaps.

path is blocked by Pedro who sits on a tricycle staring up at
him.

Agness joins in briefs and a white tank, black bra peeking

               last day of the trip they announced
               they were in love.

               Yeah.   Not a great plane ride home.

                         JANE
               I can imagine, sitting there for
               eleven hours with your wife who you
               know is -- oh, that's rough.

                         ADAM
               Actually they went on to Venice and
               I flew back with Carol, his wife.

               I was talking about me. Anyway,
               they're married now and it's
               pretty much an ongoing awful thing.
               But, you and your ex... When I saw
               him stop by for a cup of coffee the
               other morning, I thought -- Wow!                        
               That's the way it's supposed to be.                     
               You two seem to have it all figured
               out.

          Not yet.

Jane stands ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND and hands Adam
another croque-monsieur. She stays on her side, like a
waitress at a counter. She refills his water glass.

                    ADAM
          Actually, I find it really
          stressful. You know, the last time
          I was in the dating world was 1978.                      
          It's a little more complicated
          these days. I can't tell you how                         
          nice it is to have a conversation                        
          with a woman and have the pressure
          off. Not to mention, a home cooked
          meal that no one else I know could
          possibly cook.

Jane's not sure if she feels a little hurt by that.   She
smiles, wiping the counter.

          That was a compliment. So you

     Jake rises from the bushes outside of Jane's Kitchen Window.        
     He PEEKS in the window, balancing himself precariously on a         
     stack of loose bricks. He sees Jane telling Adam a story and        
     both of them cracking up. Jake leans in further to try to           
     hear what Jane's saying when the bricks slip under his feet,

     CHECKING IN and chokes on his French Fry.

     Harley grabs Lauren's face in his hands and kisses her, even
     though he's choking. He coughs while kissing her.

          It worked.     I'm not choking
          anymore.

Harley swallows a cough, reaching for his water, HIS EYES ON
JAKE as Jake is HANDED A ROOM KEY and POINTED TOWARD THE
ELEVATOR. Harley drinks his entire glass of water as he
watches.

     The curtains are drawn,   the lights are low. Jane, in a hotel
     robe, slips a cd in the   cd player and we hear a mellow song,
     perfect for love in the   afternoon. The Bathroom Door OPENS
     and Jake EXITS, also in   a hotel robe.

     Jane stands across the room from him. They smile at one
     another. From behind, we see Jane untie her robe, letting it
     fall to the floor. Jake looks at her, from head to toe and
     back. They smile at one another, then something comes over
     Jake. His eyes roll back, his legs give out and he collapses
     against the wall.

                  in blood pressure so I suggest you
                  stay off it for a few weeks, which
                  apparently your wife will

     Jake is instantly jealous.   He rises, crosses to the closet,
     starts dressing, his eyes glued to Jane who seems to be very
     engaged by Adam.

                         ADAM
               I just found out there's a French
               Film Festival in town and that made
               me think of you so I was wondering
               if you'd like to go to the opening
               night tomorrow night.
                   (a little nervous... will
                    she accept?)

                         JANE
               Oh, that sounds so fun...
                   (Jake rolls his eyes)
               Let me think, tomorrow's what?

               dinner thing tomorrow, I can come
               over.

               Please.

                         JANE
               Oh, um, you know, I'd really love
               to, but, my son is coming home from
               college the next day and I have a
               bunch of things I have to do to get
               ready...
                   (hates lying, Jake crosses
                    to her, smiles)
               I'm so sorry.

                         ADAM
               No, don't worry. No problem. Maybe
               we can see something another night.

                         JANE
               Absolutely. I would love that.                         
     Jake smiles appreciatively, crosses to Jane, hugs her.           


67   ADAM HANGS UP                                              67
     We see he is holding Two Movie Tickets. He looks at them
     then crosses to the desk of a Female Worker.

               Melanie, how would you and your
               husband like two tickets to the
               opening of the French Film

     Jane and Jake are finishing getting dressed, moving about,
     putting on shoes, blouses, ties, jackets, belts...

     Jake grabs his heart. Jane leans on him, a smile on her face

     ON JAKE

     His eyes glued to the clock. We are IN JAKE AND AGNESS'
     BEDROOM. Jake and Agness lie on their bed, both doing paper
     work. Pedro is asleep between them. Jake gets up, slipping         
     his cell into his hand.

     Jake gently lies Pedro in his bed, pulls up the covers. Pedro
     takes Jake's hand, holds it to his chest, looking up at him.       
     Jake offers a comforting smile and Pedro closes his eyes.

     Candles are lit on the table, but are now low. The table is      
     set with flowers from the garden. The wine has not been          
     opened. CAMERA CRANES to FIND Jane INSIDE THE KITCHEN, still
     dressed for dinner and deep in thought. She then sighs very      
     deeply and decisively as she turns out the lights and room by
     room, the house becomes dark.

Jane looks to Harley again when they all hear a car horn        
HONK. Jane LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW and sees JAKE'S PORSCHE PULL    
UP with Luke in the passenger seat. The Girls rush out the      
Kitchen door. Harley sees Jake getting out of the car and       
pours himself a larger glass of wine as Jane approaches him.

Harley watches their interaction tennis match style. Jake
looks at the table set for five, wishes he was joining them.
He sees last night's dinner, now being served as left overs.
Jane slices the roast chicken.

                    JAKE
          That looks incredible.                                
Jane looks up at him, knife poised.    Is he kidding?

                      JANE

She goes at the chicken with the knife, slicing off a leg.
Jake flinches.

     Luke opens a cupboard, takes out a bottle of olive oil, hands
     it to Jake.

               Just for a sec.

     Jane and Jake stand in the courtyard off of the Living Room.

                         JANE
               What is it, Jake?   What?

                         JAKE
               I don't get not calling me back.

                          JANE
               `Cause I don't care what your
               excuse is.
                   (shuts the door to the
                    living )

                         JAKE
               She didn't go out, Jane. She
               cancelled her plans and every
               time I tried to call or write, she
               caught me. I wanted to be here.

                         JANE
               You know what, Jake? You were
               worried about rocking the boat at
               home? Well now you're rocking my                        
               boat and I don't like it.

                         JAKE

          JANE
You don't understand. I'm not even
blaming you. I fully participated
in this. But I don't want to do it
anymore. The last thing in the
world I should be right now is your
mistress, sitting around at nine at
night wearing heels and perfume and
blowing out candles and wrapping
everything in Saran Wrap because
your wife cancelled her plans. It
was cliche and humiliating.

          JAKE
    (wistfully)
You lit candles?

          JANE
Oh, shut up. Look, I've had a
pretty good life these past 10
years. I figured it out and I
moved on. I no longer feel alone
or divorced. I just feel normal.
You know how long that took, just
to get my balance back?

          JAKE
No.

          JANE
The point is, I'm going in the
wrong direction here. But the
worst part is... It's feeling like
it used to feel. All the little
untruths that are hard to catch but
add up...

           JAKE
-- Janey, c'mon, it was one
mistake...

          HARLEY
    (joining them)
-- Everything okay out here?
    (Jane and Jake turn)
The kids are gettin' hungry...

          JANE
Yeah. We're done.

     front of Harley)
We were just...
                                                            82.

          tomorrow night, for sure, right?                        
Harley starts to follow them out when Jane grabs his shirt        
sleeve.

Jane gives him a look that could get blood from a stone.

      Jane and Harley ENTER from the courtyard just as Jake is          
      about to leave. Jane immediately crosses to the table which       
      now has dinner on it.                                             
      Lauren kisses Jake good-bye on the cheek then joins the           
      others who are about to sit down for dinner.

                   Thanks for picking me up, Dad...

      Jake pauses awkwardly at the door. He can't catch Jane's          
      eye. He waves to the kids, who don't seem to notice then          
      heads out.

      Jake EXITS, turns back, looks INSIDE THE DINING ROOM, sees        
      his family sitting around the table, talking, laughing. He        
      heads toward his car as...                                        
      JANE

      glances out the window at Jake as he drives off. One of the       
      kids says something, distracting her, and she laughs...


A80   EXT. LAUREN AND HARLEY'S COTTAGE - THE NEXT NIGHT          A80
      Harley and Luke, on ladders, are stringing paper lanterns
      across a small patio. Lauren crosses under them, carrying a
      tray of food and joins Gabby who is setting out drinks.

      Jane sits at her dressing table, dressed for the party. She       
      puts on hoop earrings -- likes the way she looks. She opens       
      a drawer to take out a lipstick.

      INSERT - THE DRAWER

      Sitting among her cosmetics is the joint Jake left for her.
      She looks at the joint, then looks at herself in the mirror.

               them with post-its and wrote them
               in red and then highlighted them in

     Jane and Adam, two very straight laced grown ups, ENTER the
     party, pausing as they peruse the crowd.

     Adam starts to move to the music insanely well and then just
     insanely. Lauren and Harley greet them. Jane greets them
     back with a huge hug.

Jane takes the joint out of her purse, lights it up and hands

     from Adam to Jake then back to Adam and then doesn't look

     dough.... Nervous at first, he gets the hang of it. Then,         
     Jane teaches Adam how to place a bar of chocolate in each         
     triangle and roll it into a croissant. Laughing as they           
     work, they make a dozen croissants... NEXT...into the OVEN.

     Jane and Adam sit at a table in the corner, a stack of
     croissants piled high between them. Music plays as Adam
     takes the top croissant and Jane takes the next.
                                                     95.

          It's crazy how good this is.

                    JANE
              (biting into one, nods)
          Yeah, and I'm not even stoned
          anymore.

                    ADAM
          Neither am I.

                    JANE
              (happy about that)
          Oh, then...merci, Monsieur.

                    ADAM
          Do you remember when I asked you
          the other night, if you were dating
          anyone and you said no... It
          sounded to me like you were maybe
          saying yes.

                    JANE
          I was sort of seeing someone.     But,
          it's over now.
              (Adam nods)
          Honestly.

                    ADAM
          `Cause I'm not strong enough to
          fall for someone who's with someone
          else. Wouldn't be able to take
          that again.

                    JANE
          I understand. I wouldn't say it
          was over if it wasn't.

Adam takes Jane's hand in his...relieved.

                    ADAM
          Great.                                           
Adam turns Jane's hand over and looks at it a bit
quizzically.

                  Ooooo. What about that one?

                             JANE
                  That one's from boiling sugar...I
                  wasn't very skilled in the
                  beginning.    And that one is from a
                  large French...

     Adam presses Jane's palm to his lips and kisses her scar.

                            JANE
                  -- Saute pan.

     Adam then kisses the burn on her forearm. Jane sighs, closes
     her eyes. This feeling is unexpected. She opens her eyes as
     Adam moves closer.

                            ADAM
                  Would it be okay if I...?

     Jane nods.    He kisses her great.

                  I was going to say, kiss you.

                  If you feel this is in any way
                  wrong because we're working
                  together...

                            JANE
                  ... I don't ...

     He smiles as she folds into him and they kiss and kiss and
     kiss again.

INT. JANE'S KITCHEN - THE NEXT DAY                                
Quiet. Jane enters from the garden, humming, "Wouldn't It Be      
Nice." Luke ENTERS, still looking half asleep in his T Shirt      
and boxers.

          Hi. I didn't know you slept here.

Lauren, in an open robe over drawstrings and a tank top,
takes out a box of cereal.

                    LAUREN
          We were playing Scattagories with
          Gabby and Ollie then Harley fell                        
          asleep on the couch.

Harley meanders in wearing Victoria Secret Heart patterned PJ
bottoms and a Girl's V-neck T-shirt.

     Jane EXITS as Jake steps out of his car. He looks like he's
     had a rough night and has something on his mind. Jane
     cautiously looks back at the house. The kitchen windows are
     all open.

               That I'm still in love with you.   I
               admitted it, I told her about us
               and I've left her. For you.

     PJ's, looking confused.

             Okay, then do it for me....just go
             in please.

Luke and Lauren join Gabby on the porch.                          
                       LUKE
             What's up, Dad?

                       JAKE
             Having some problems on the home
             front, just wanted to talk to your
             Mom for a sec.

Jane shakes her head.    Why did he have to say that?   Harley
joins the Kids.                                                   
                       LAUREN
             Problems on the home front?   Is one
             of you seeing someone else?

Hearing that, Harley does a swift about face and goes right       
back inside. Jane's eyes widen toward Jake.

                       JAKE
                 (off Jane's cue)
             No, it's nothing like that. I just
             need to find a hotel or something

             Mom, can Dad stay here for a few
             days? He can share my room.

                       JANE
             I don't think that's the best idea,
             Luke.

     effect, could be real.

     Jane nervously nibbles on her fingernail as the family sits
     silently around the table watching a ravenous Jake eat French
     Toast, bacon, coffee, side of fruit. His mood has been
     lifted. His energy is in full bloom.

     across his face.

               Jake, you knew the kids were all
               here. Shouldn't we have talked
               about this? Agreed this was the
               right thing to do? This is so
               typical. Only thinking about works
               for you.

                         JAKE
               I'm sorry, I guess I should've
               called before showing up.

          see if we can make this work.

                    JANE
          We can't, Jake. I told you this
          the other night. Please listen.

                     JAKE
          But you were all pissy because you
          thought I stood you up. Things are
          different now. I'm a free man.

      Jane cringes as the Kids laugh. She looks over at Jake
      snuggling between the Kids, all eating popcorn and laughing.
      He catches Jane's eye and mouths.

      Jake, bare legged and wearing a robe and slippers, crosses to
      the KITCHEN where he finds Luke and Gabby digging through the

                kitchen. Remember when you weren't
                even allowed in. Mom used to go out

          I was eight actually and I don't
          know...it's all foggy to me now.

                    JAKE
          You don't remember us in Hawaii or
          all sleeping in that tent in the
          backyard.

                    LUKE
          Yeah, of course, but I don't
          remember like you and Mom hugging
          or waking up together...

Jake grabs his heart, moans.

                     LUKE

          we should stay.

Jake turns his beams on Harley.

                    HARLEY
          She exaggerates. I just thought
          perhaps you might want to talk
          later, or ... Is that the noodle

      Jane, sits on her bed, talking to Adam via iSight. On her
      LAPTOP SCREEN, we see Adam but he's a bit of a BLUR.

                          JANE

      CLOSE ON JANE'S LAP TOP SCREEN - ADAM IN HIS BEDROOM

      He back ups from the lens and models a rather ridiculous ski
      sweater.

                Into the pile. Hey, check out the
                pile, Jane.

      Adam POINTS HIS LAPTOP to the floor to show a HUGE STACK OF
      OLD CLOTHES.

103    INT. JANE'S BEDROOM - WIDE - SAME TIME                      103
       Jake pokes his head in, looks around, sees no one in the
       room. He hears Jane in the bathroom and ENTERS quietly,
       quickly squirms out of his boxers and T-shirt, then, DROPS      
       HIS ROBE, and lies on his side, on the bed, completely NUDE --
       elbow up, palm supporting his head -- a smile on his face. He
       changes his smile to a smoulder.

       Jake hears water running. Suddenly modest, he quickly drags
       over the open Laptop and places the open screen in front of
       his privates. He smiles, ready to be discovered.

105    JANE ENTERS HER BEDROOM, SEES JAKE and lets out a SCREAM. 105

       Simultaneously, ADAM PLOPS DOWN IN HIS DESK CHAIR, LOOKS AT
       HIS SCREEN and instantly YANKS HIMSELF AWAY in disgust.

                    ADAM
          Okay, I'm gonna be sick.

Jake LEANS IN, covers Adam's eyes on the screen, which, of
course, does nothing.

Jake rises, now his ass gets the close up, he bends over to
get his robe.

          Okay!   Good night!

Jake SPINS THE LAPTOP and the ISIGHT LENS LANDS ON JANE.
Jane and Adam look at one another. No time to say anything.
She's desperate. He's lost.

The DOOR FLIES OPEN, the KIDS RUSH IN, just as Jake ties his
robe.

No one says anything.

          What's happening?

Adam listens, his eyes on Jane. Jake crosses to Jane, facing
the Kids. He walks in and out of the iSight shot.

                    JAKE
          Okay. Let me explain. The reason I
          left Agness wasn't just because my
          marriage wasn't working.

                think this is the best thing that's
                ever happened to me. Your Mom and
                I have been seeing each other, on

      Gabby breaks down in tears.    Lauren puts her arm around her.    
      Jane starts to cry, looks at her laptop, just as she HEARS A
      CLICK and THE LAPTOP SCREEN GOES BLACK.

      The Kids, in their cars, drive down the road, away from the
      house. Jane stands in the driveway, watching, never before
      feeling quite like this. Jake EXITS THE HOUSE, holding his
      bag. He stops, looks at Jane. She has nothing left to say.
      Jake gets in his car and pulls away as Jane walks back
      inside.

123   EXT. JANE'S POOL/BACKYARD - EARLY MORNING                   123
      CAMERA DRIFTS ACROSS THE POOL TO JANE, asleep on the pool          
      chaise, still wrapped in a blanket. The sprinklers go off          
      and wake Jane. She opens her eyes, looks around, realizes          
      she's spent the night outside.

      Jane sits up too fast, a tad disoriented, then quickly             
      realizes what she must do.

      Jane, who stands across from him, ready to right it all.

      JANE'S POV - INSIDE THE BEDROOM

      Her Three Kids are under the covers. Lauren is between Gabby       
      and Luke. They look like they just woke up.
                                                      111.


Jane stands in the doorway. The Kids don't say a word. Jane
doesn't wait. She crosses to the bed, sits on it, looks at
her children.

                    JANE
          Knowing how to be divorced is next
          to impossible... and sometimes over
          the years, I've thought that your
          Dad and I weren't quite finished.
          And, as it turns out, we weren't.
          So I went out of my comfort zone,
          which, I found out, if you're
          really honest with yourself, isn't
          all that comforting. So, I
          experimented with a part of myself.
          I wanted to find out if, after all
          these years there was still
          something there between us.

                    LAUREN
          And was there?

                    JANE
          There kinda was.

Lauren smiles with her eyes.

                    GABBY                                      
          But Mom, you have to understand how
          bonkers this sounds to us. For two
          people who for years couldn't be in
          the same room together...to then
          have an affair??? You and Dad...!

                    JANE
          I know...it was hard for me and I
          was doing it. I hope you'll
          forgive me for confusing you or
          betraying your trust, but I did
          this for me and for him and I
          realized even though your Dad and I
          once had something extraordinary...
          we no longer really fit together.
          But he is a part of me and always
          will be.

                    LUKE
          So it's over now? You guys are
          back to being divorced.

                    JANE
          For better or for worse.

      Lauren takes her Mom's hand. Harley joins them, sitting on
      the other side of the bed, holding back tears.

                because I wasn't sure you would
                take the call and then I thought
                that could go on for months and...                       
                          ADAM

                          JANE
                Oh. Well, anyway, it's better to
                say these things in person. Adam,
                the man I was seeing was...

                          ADAM
                I think I'm up to speed on that
                part.

                    JANE
          I want you to know it didn't last
          long and you're divorced, so maybe
          you understand, when marriages end,
          there's doubts and hurt, and you've
          got kids and sometimes you wonder
          if you did the right thing and when
          the moment presented itself...

                    ADAM
          -- I get it. I could imagine it...I
          could...

                    JANE
          I told him it wasn't going to work
          between us but I guess he didn't
          believe me and unbeknownst to me,
          he showed up at my house yesterday.
          He left Agness and...

                    ADAM
          -- Jane. I actually think I
          understand what happened
          but...uh...you know I'm not as
          macho as I appear and I think it's
          probably best for us not to get any
          more... involved because your
          relationship with Jake isn't really
          done and I know you're saying it
          is, but he's in love with you and
          for everyone's sake, that should
          probably get resolved.

                     JANE
          Wow.   So that's how grown ups talk.

Adam smiles.

                    JANE
          Please tell me you're not going to
          quit my job and ask Peter to take
          over because then I'll never get to
          see you and...

                    ADAM
          I was thinking of asking Peter to
          step back in.

129   EXT. ROAD TO JANE'S HOUSE - LATE DAY                    129
      Jane drives home, when she notices Jake's Porsche in her
      driveway. She gets out of her car, finds Jake sitting on the
      bench swing hanging from a large oak in the front yard.

      Jane crosses to Jake. He moves over. Jane sees the humor in
      this gesture and sits on the swing with him, letting out a
      sigh. Side by side, they swing in the late afternoon breeze.

                             JAKE
                I'm sorry.

      Jane doesn't answer right away.

                          JANE
                How far back does that sorry go?

                          JAKE
                How far back do you need it to go?

                             JANE
                Way back.

                          JAKE
                Consider it an all inclusive
                apology. From not being the
                husband you needed to showing up
                nude on your bed last night.

                           JANE
                Yeah, what were you thinking with
                that move?

                          JAKE
                That you'd find me irresistible.

      Jane turns to him, her eyes warming up to him.

                          JAKE
                Never considered the alternative.

                          JANE
                Gotta love that about you.

      They swing some more.
                                        115.



          JAKE
Oh, man, can't believe I got up to
bat again and blew it.

          JANE
You didn't blow it. We blew it.
We blew it the first time around.
This time... we just should've
known better. Too much has
happened. Too much time has passed.

          JAKE
And you don't think we could make
it right?                                      
          JANE
Does that mean you didn't feel it
was totally right either?                      
          JAKE
Being with you Jane is the best I'm
gonna be.

           JANE
But do you agree that it wasn't
really...?                                     
          JAKE
It was complicated.

          JANE
Begging for an answer.

          JAKE
I thought it was good.   I wanted it
to be good.

          JANE
Guess that's as close as I'm gonna             
get.

          JAKE
Do you always have to be so hard on
me?

           JANE
No.   I don't.

          JAKE
I don't regret giving it another
shot.
                                                               116.

                Probably would've been better if
                you hadn't been married.

                          JAKE
                It may never have happened if I
                wasn't married.

      Jane looks at Jake, knowing how true that is. They sit, side       
      by side, as they sway in the breeze.

                I don't regret it either.

someone talks.
