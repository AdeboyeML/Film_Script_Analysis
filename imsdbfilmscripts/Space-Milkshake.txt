     A glowing blue box like a large toaster (the Time Cube) sits
     in a sterile lab shelf, plugged in. A rubber duck sits on a
     cluttered desk. GARY PINBACK (40) identified by "Gary"
     stitched on a white lab coat - enters frame, unplugs the box
     and shoves it in a duffle bag nervously (his face framed out
     of this entire montage). An ALARM SOUNDS. RED SIREN LIGHT
     splashes into frame. Opening credits play on walls and other
     surfaces of this montage before and after Gary runs through
     frames.
     Gary goes to a desk and rushes to steal stationary, staplers,
     pencils, a calculator etc; he sweeps the desk surface junk
     with his arm into the duffle bag on top of the Time Cube. He
     picks up the rubber duck and shoves it in his pocket.

     A white lab coat fills the frame then reveals Gary running
     away. Gary's feet running. Duffle bag in frame.
     HIGH ANGLE: long hall, following Gary running.
     ANGLE ON DOOR: it's marked SPACEPORT LEVEL 4, Gary slams into
     it and runs through.
     LOW ANGLE: Gary runs through long high ceiling hall away from
     camera. Red Siren light spins on the wall. Gary goes through
     the far door.
     Gary slips and wipes out, spilling his stationary. He grabs
     his time cube bag and duck and keeps running.

     MEDIUM CLOSE: Gary throws the bag into a hatch and climbs in
     after it, closes the hatch, spins the handle from the inside.
     It's marked with decals reading CARGO DRONE 9.
     A blast door lowers into frame covering the drone and we hear
     SPACE SHUTTLE TAKING OFF SOUNDS.

    JIMMY ANDERSON (25) wears a jumpsuit with utility belt, has a
    small rolling suitcase, and a bunch of papers in the other
    hand. Elevator music. He stands waiting in a small industrial-
    looking passage with heavy duty inner and outer doors. A red
    light. He's sweating, pale. He presses the button repeatedly.

                         JIMMY
               You still have a WENDI?
     The light turns green and the inner door opens, Jimmy enters
     the space station airlock module.
     A sign above the airlock says: "REMEMBER ALL ACCIDENTS IN
     SPACE ARE SERIOUS ACCIDENTS". Jimmy sneezes again, wipes his
     nose, offers his hand to shake. He reads Anton's name tag.
                         JIMMY (CONT'D)

     ANTON BALVENIE (35) snatches the documents, and walks away as
     he reads. Jimmy follows him.

     Anton is unimpressed. Jimmy stops to poke a panel with a
     loose wire.
                         ANTON
               Level 9 engineers aren't rated for

              Great. This is my first orbital
              assignment.
                        ANTON
              Let me clue you in. Up here the
              work never stops. There's always
              orbital debris piling up and
              someone has to be in each sector
              with a line of sight on it to keep
              launch vectors clear. Do you follow
              me?

              No problem chief.

              Sorry, Captain.
    They keep walking, reaching the junction at the end.
                        ANTON
              Just make sure you finish by zero
              eight hundred Zulu. I'm not signing
              overtime forms. Do you know how to
              fix mess hall food dispensers?

              No. Maybe. What's the matter?
                         ANTON
              All it's giving is sandwiches.
              That's your next job after the

              That's Lieutenant Tilda Genero. You
              don't need to talk to her.
    Tilda glances at him and turns her chair away from him.
    Jimmy drags his suitcase, hitting everything, and dumps out
    electronic junk near the terminal. He opens up a panel near a
    screen showing static.
                        JIMMY
              There's your problem.

              Whatever, get it done.

     and they come out. Tilda helps them with their space suits.
                         ANTON
               Any luck with Ground control?
                         TILDA
               There's no response. On any
               channel. There was a bright flash
               of light. Did you see that?
                         ANTON
               Yeah, we saw it too.
                         VALENTINA
               Was it a Solar flare?
                         TILDA
               Maybe. Doesn't seem like it.
     A strange HUMMING SOUND starts. Jimmy pokes his head in.
                         JIMMY
               Good salvage?
                         ANTON
               Who said you could take a break?
                         TILDA
               Are you ok?
                         VALENTINA
               We're fine. I'll get on the coms.
               Check out what that humming noise
               is. We might have taken damage.
                         ANTON
               Report to me in ten.
     Tilda rolls her eyes and goes.
                         JIMMY
               What can I do?
     Valentina shoves her space suit into Jimmy's hands. She and
     Anton walk off in the other direction. Jimmy tries to hang up
     the space suits on the rack. They don't fit. He tries again.
     Jimmy drops the space suits and follows after Tilda.

      Tilda walks past large devices, storage tanks, incinerators
      and cargo containers. The HUMMING is louder. She sees the
      Time Cube glowing with blue light.
      A FLASH OF LIGHT! The humming dies down. Tilda looks around
      the scary, poorly lit and greasy room.
      Tilda turns suddenly and sees ANOTHER TILDA, in a dirtier
      jumpsuit, walking towards her. They both stop and stare at
      each other.
                          TILDA
                Who the hell are you?
      TILDA2 is disoriented and scared. Her jumpsuit has different
      computer symbols instead of standard station number stencils.

      Jimmy walking looking for Tilda hears A SCREAM O.S. He goes
      around a corner at the end of the hall where it came from.

      INT. ENGINEERING MODULE - DAY
30B                                                               30B
      Tilda2's arms framed, stuffing a female human leg into a
      hatch marked ORGANIC WASTE RECYCLING. She bends down and
      picks up a clean dry Tilda jumpsuit off the floor.
      Around the corner in a different area of the room, Jimmy
      pokes his head in and looks around.
                          JIMMY
                Tilda?
      Jimmy finds a way around a large machine just as Tilda2 zips
      up her jumpsuit, facing away. She has strange geometric lines
      like tatoos on her back. He's struck by her picturesque
      beauty and doesn't realize he's staring. She turns and meets
      eyes with him. He's very embarrassed and ducks back behind
      the machine.
                          JIMMY (CONT'D)
                Is this the laundry room? I was
                looking for the mess hall. Sorry if
                I surprised you. I thought I heard
                something. I didn't see anything.
      The heavy machinery starts grinding and humming. CRUNCHING,
      SAWING AND SPLATTERING SOUNDS. The light turns from red to
      green.

               Okay well I'll see you on the
               bridge. Sorry.
     Jimmy turns and starts to head out, bumping into Tilda2 with
     a start. She's different; dissociated, laconic, very nervous.
                         JIMMY (CONT'D)
               I was just going.
     Tilda2 (henceforth "Tilda") stares at him, shivering.
                         JIMMY (CONT'D)
               Hey, what's the matter?
     Jimmy pats her shoulder. She looks up and they meet eyes.
                         JIMMY (CONT'D)
               Are you ok?
     She turns and runs away. Jimmy watches her go out the hatch.
                         JIMMY (CONT'D)
               You forgot your shoes!
     Jimmy picks up some sneakers. He doesn't notice blood
     dripping out from below the organic waste reprocessor as he
     goes.

     The HUMMING SOUND again: The Time Cube sits in deep shadows,
     glowing with faint blue light - the light dims and the
     humming stops.

     The wall is marked W.E.N.D.I. Orbital Station System
     Computer. Jimmy sits next to the computer with Tilda's
     sneakers. Wendi has a female voice this scene only.
     Jimmy hits buttons on the keyboard. The computer turns on.
                         JIMMY

               Does Tilda have a boyfriend?
     The intercom buzzes. Anton voice is distorted to the edge of
     comprehensibility.
                         ANTON (O.S.)
               Jimmy, how are the repairs coming?
               Jimmy? Get on the intercom Jimmy.
                            JIMMY
               Anton?
                         ANTON (O.S.)
               You'd better be getting all over
               this mainframe problem. I want
               hourly reports every half hour.
                         JIMMY

                         JIMMY
               Roger that.
     Jimmy opens the top binder from a tall stack of binders. The
     screen turns off.
                            JIMMY (CONT'D)

     The vast view of the Earth from space. Pretty. The sunrise
     terminator approaches Western Canada, as we drift slowly
     backwards into peaceful space. Nothing else is in orbit. The

     Jimmy sips juice from a sippy cup and goes back to soldering
     wires in an open panel near the screen. He wears safety
     goggles, reads from a technical binder marked SONOVAC SYSTEMS
     REPAIR. The tall stack of binders is now a mess of them

     Valentina sits at the communications station and holds a

          message? Please respond. This is
          the sanitation station Regina,
          Please respond.
She puts down the microphone, tweaks some knobs and pushes
some buttons.
Anton comes over to her and presses buttons at her station.

She slams shut a procedure binder. Jimmy comes in.

          Have you got the mainframe back up?
                    JIMMY
          It's taking me a bit longer than I
          thought. I might need to call down
          for some parts.
                    VALENTINA
          There's nothing out there.
                    ANTON
          I don't see how that's possible. It
          has to be a communications problem.
                    VALENTINA
          We're having a communication
          problem right now. I'm telling you
          there's nothing out there. We need
          Wendi to do an analysis.
                    JIMMY
          Why didn't anyone tell me? I have
          to get back to Earth.

     A large table, kitchenette, free weights, shake weight, book
     shelf with board games. Val's Rubber Duckie sits on the shelf
     with a few other personal items. Anton cycles an elliptical
     exercise machine. Valentina comes in with leotards and
     stretches next to him. Anton stops.

               You're worried. Don't worry. We're

     He leans in to give her a kiss, she leans away from his kiss
     as she stretches. He sits to stretch next to her.
                         VALENTINA
               I'm going to put in for

               There's always something on deep

                         VALENTINA

               If this is because of the other
               night, I already told you that was
               because of the bad egg sandwiches I
               ate after the refrigeration system

     Tilda pokes a water filtration system. A sign says DANGER

     SMASH! The sound of an impact, like a car accident. The room
     trembles. METAL CREAKING NOISES. Things jiggle and fall off

      Tilda looks at him.

      Tilda and Jimmy are in the middle of a scrabble game.

                What's happening to us Tilda?
                What's with the rubber ducks?
      She looks at him.

     Tilda makes the word "oxyphenbutazone" and looks at him.
                         JIMMY (CONT'D)
               Sometimes you do seem kind of
               distant.
     Tilda turns the board to face her.
                         JIMMY (CONT'D)
               I guess you're just dealing with
               things in your own way.
     Tilda has an idea! She grabs all the tiles and starts making
     words. SECRET. INTRUDER ON BOARD. DANGER.
     Jimmy leans over looking. Tilda is very serious.
     Anton leans in (out of nowhere).
                         ANTON
               You have to connect the words.
     Jimmy knocks the board up in nervous reaction to hide the
     message.
                         ANTON (CONT'D)
               Did I startle you? I'm everywhere
               Jimmy. I've got my eye on you. Is
               that my jumpsuit? Who said you
               could wear my jumpsuit?
                         JIMMY
               I didn't pack anything else.
                         ANTON
               You have to earn that uniform. You
               can't just put it on. Wash it
               carefully, fold it and put it back.
     Jimmy gets up, hesitantly leaves Tilda.
                         ANTON (CONT'D)
               And you, shape up.
     Anton goes to his quarters.

                         VALENTINA
               I don't know. It's not all about
               you. I want to get off this station
               Anton. I wanted out of here before
               we were stranded. I need a change
               of scenery. I'm sick of this place.
                         ANTON
               So, whoever gave you the rubber
               duck has nothing to do with your
               change of heart.
                         VALENTINA
               No. It has nothing to do with Gary.
                         ANTON
               Oh, Gary? So we have a name now.
               Right... Gary. So what's Gary up to
               these days? Do you keep in touch?
     Valentina grabs her duck, bath robe and towel from the room.
                         VALENTINA
               I haven't spoken to him in years.
               He was just a friend.

          Yes Jimmy, it is. I am pleased that

                    WENDI (O.S.)
          I am operating on default human
          interface settings.
                    JIMMY
          Anton hates it.
                    WENDI (O.S.)
          Would you like to select a
          different interface protocol?
                    JIMMY
          No stay like this. Can you show me
          the station video monitors?
A grid of grainy black and white video cameras comes up.
One screen shows Valentina walking down the hall angrily with
her bath robe, towel and 2 rubber duckies.
Another monitor shows a medium shot of Tilda kneeling in
engineering area next to a wall panel marked T518. She looks
around nervously and opens it.
                    WENDI (O.S.)
          Jimmy, I appear to have an open
          access port in my T518 array.
Jimmy zooms in, it's grainy. Tilda pulls out a row of
circuits labeled "T518 D7", removes a small circuit board and
looks at it. She closes the panel.
Jimmy watches Tilda on the monitor screen: she sits back and
unzips her flight suit. He leans in towards the monitor.

          What's your T518 array used for?
                    WENDI
          T518 is a language processor for
          human interface systems.
On the monitor we can see Tilda take the circuit board and
jam it into her torso on her right side.
The screen garbles slightly with electrical interference.
Jimmy zooms in but it's hard to see what's going on. Tilda
rubs her side, there's no mark and the circuit board is gone.
She zips up her jumpsuit and tries to talk with fax sounds.

Jimmy watches the monitor with distracted fascination.

          Have you ever been in love, Wendi?
                    WENDI (O.S.)
          I love being the orbital sanitation
          station mainframe computer.
                    ANTON (O.S.)
          You didn't fix the voice.

around. Anton comes in.

      there. She's confused. It moves toward her. She's paralyzed
      with horror. It has tentacles peeking out under it.

      Gary moves very close to her. He puts a tentacle on her hand.

                There was an accident. The cube was

                shunted through a dimensional

      Val and Anton sit at the controls as the room shakes. Evil
      metal creaking noises tear through. Alarms sound. More
      screens turn to static and garbled.

                Anton?
                          ANTON
                Something is definitely wrong.

                honest.
                          ANTON
                Oh?
      The rubber duck (duck 2) scuttles across the floor behind
      them but Anton doesn't see it.

                    VALENTINA
          Gary is onboard.
                    ANTON
          Where is the bastard? How the hell
          did he get on the station?
                    VALENTINA
          You brought him in.
                    ANTON
          When did I do that?
Valentina notices that Gary (Duck 2) is in front of Anton,
hiding on a shelf, dripping slime.
                    VALENTINA
          He's just come for the time cube.
          That's all he needs to get back to
          his dimension and put things right.
Its eyes glow faintly red.
                    ANTON
          Sure. Naturally. He just wants his
          time cube. He's not interested in
          you?
                    VALENTINA
          He's the only one that can send us
          home and set things right.
Anton follows her gaze and sees the duck there.
                    ANTON
          What the hell is that?
Anton moves around and slowly approaches it. He takes out his
laser blaster and charges it. The Duck cowers and backs
deeper into the corner of the shelf.
                    ANTON (CONT'D)
          Anton, you're scaring him.
                    ANTON (CONT'D)
          Him? Hello little guy. Don't be
          afraid. We mean you no harm. Hey
          there. Val what the hell is this
          thing?

                That's Gary.
      Anton slowly moves closer to it.
                          ANTON
                What? This thing?
      Anton points his laser. Gary trembles with fear.
                          VALENTINA
                No!
      Anton pulls the trigger. It goes click click.
                          ANTON
                That's odd. The batteries must be-
      Gary LEAPS at Anton's head. They crash through the room as it
      attacks him. Papers fly from binders thrown around. Anton
      screams. The laser pistol is knocked to the floor, broken.
      Blood splatters against a console, and across Valentina's
      face. Val screams, staring at the off-screen attack. Anton is
      thrown down, he turns around and tries to see where the duck
      is. He's scratched up. It scuttles away down the hall behind
      him, out of his sight.

          How is your head?

Valentina sticks a band-aid on Anton.

          He was frightened.
                    ANTON
          Whose side are you on?
A noise down the hall. Anton pulls the handlebar off the
elliptical exercise machine and holds it like a club as he
goes to one side of the room next to the hall.
                    ANTON (CONT'D)
          Can you see it?
                      VALENTINA
          No.
Anton peeks down the hall quickly. He reaches to draw his
laser blaster - his holster is empty.

          Something is coming. Stay back.

      Tilda and Jimmy try to access the computer. It's not working.
                          JIMMY
                The power system is still on. We
                need to locate the damaged

                          TILDA
                Let me ask Wendi.
      She reaches into the computer panel and finds an RS232 cable.

                What are you going to do?

                             JIMMY
                Ok.
      Jimmy turns around. Tilda sticks the RS232 cable down the
      front of her jumpsuit bottoms area and feels around with the
      cable until she finds her socket. CLICK.

          I'm accessing Wendi's backup

          I mean what are you doing with that

          Hello Tilda.
                    TILDA
          Hello Wendi. Central logic
          processor is up. All systems are
          online - the control interface has
          been disconnected.
Tilda keeps accessing the computer with her brain.

          It was the duck.
                    JIMMY
          Gary? What is it trying to do?
                    TILDA
          Look.
The monitor shows a wire-frame diagram of the space station
in motion, with trajectories and readings. A red circular
line indicates the orbit of the station, and it intersects
with Earth. The little icon of the station is slowly moving
on that line toward the `red zone'. "WARNING" text blinks.
                    TILDA (CONT'D)
          The station's orbit has been
          altered. We're going to hit the
          atmosphere.
                    JIMMY
          How long do we have?
                    TILDA
          About twenty eight minutes.
                    JIMMY
          Are you sure?
She's sure. Jimmy hits the intercom.

                The intercoms are locked out. We
                have to get to the control room.
      Tilda turns away, unplugs the cable with a shiver and pulls
      the cable out of her pants. She zips up.
                          JIMMY
                You're going to have to explain
                that later.
      Tilda reaches her hand toward Jimmy. Jimmy puts his hand out.
      A spark jumps between their hands.
                          JIMMY (CONT'D)
                Ow!

                Meat that loves you, Tilda.

                It may not be possible for us to
                overcome our physiological

      Valentina looks under the communications equipment. There's a
      half-open compartment at the end of the room, filled with
      deep shadows. A wall panel is also open.
      She moves slowly toward it. She peeks in the wall panel. It's
      empty. She moves on toward the other compartment.
      Valentina reaches slowly toward the open compartment, her
      heart racing.

       aiming his handlebar, guessing where Gary is hiding. Anton is
       almost at the door.
       Anton turns right. The shadow of Gary (Duck 3) rises up next

      Gary leans out for a moment (duck3) revealing a little more
      of himself and then slinks back.

                Come with me. We will return to
                Earth, to the dawn of man. There we
                will lay the foundations of a

                We're dead.
                          TILDA
                No we're not.
      The room shakes more. Tilda unplugs the RS232 cable from the
      wall and grabs a cable cutter from Jimmy's belt. She pulls
      down her jumpsuit shoulder exposing her back tattoo lines
      again. Jimmy watches in fascination.
      Tilda jabs herself and cuts a 6 inch hole in her abdomen.
      There's no blood. She reaches in and feels around.
                          JIMMY
                I wish you would warn me if you're
                going to do something like that.

Tilda grunts and grimaces - something rips and her hand comes
out with an organic/electric device with blinking lights.
Wires and cables poke out of the hole in her stomach and drip
with goo, she tucks them back in painfully with one hand and
holds herself closed as she hands the device to Jimmy.
                    TILDA (CONT'D)
          Try using this.
Jimmy takes it with a mixture of horror and curiosity.
                    JIMMY
          Don't you need it?
                    TILDA
          I have two of them.
Jimmy notices Valentina is gone.
                    JIMMY
          Where's Val?
Tilda turns.
                    TILDA
          The time Cube!
                    JIMMY
          Hold on, let me plug this in.
Jimmy ducks back under   the panel and stuffs the strange
device into the socket   of the circuit board. Sparks fly and
lights start blinking!   The SOUND of the midrange data
processor humming back   to life. Green lights on monitors.
Jimmy clamps alligator clips around a broken cable and
scrambles up. The monitor screens show green blinking
symbols. Tilda uses a staple gun to close her wound, showing
no sign of pain, tucks away her RS232 cable and zips up.
                       JIMMY (CONT'D)
          It worked!
Jimmy sees one monitor still shows ERROR.
                    JIMMY (CONT'D)
          It's not working.
                    TILDA
          Thruster control is on a different
          circuit. It's still offline.
Tilda sinks into a chair. The effort has worn her down.

                There's another break in the

                I'll be okay. But there's only one
                way to target the thrusters.
                             JIMMY
                How?
                             TILDA

                          TILDA
                Yes outside.
      The digital vector diagram monitor shows their orbit falling
      into the `danger zone' past the `Kármán line'. Jimmy sees
      Tilda suffer.
                             JIMMY
                Take this.
      Jimmy hands Tilda Anton's blaster - Jimmy found time to
      repair it with wires, duct tape, and junk.
                          TILDA
                You'll need it.
                          JIMMY
                I'll be ok.
      Jimmy gets up to go, summons his courage.

                Jimmy, in ten minutes the outer
                hull will burn away completely.

      jiggle as he speaks, suggestions of a jaw moving, but lots of
      amorphous tentacles and bulging monstrous shapes.

       Gary comes out of the shadows ('duck 3'). He's a hulking
       monstrous thing. Valentina is not intimidated. Anton is a
       little intimidated, still weak from his injuries.

       Valentina swings high at Gary and catches him upside the
       head. He snarls and bashes her with a tentacle, knocking away
       the handlebar. She gives him a few punches, kick in the duck
       nuts. Gary knocks her down by the sandwich machine. Anton
       grabs a chair. A tentacle comes at Anton - it pulls him over
       by his neck, he drops the chair, and is thrown down by the
       hatch.
       Gary side steps quickly, looking around. He sees the Time
       Cube on the counter and sends a tentacle at it.
       Valentina stabs the tentacle with a plastic fork and it pulls
       back, spraying green blood and mucous in an unexpectedly
       heavy geyser over Valentina, Anton and the room.
       Valentina throws the time cube over the table to Anton, who
       catches it.

      Gary and Val turn toward the hallway: Tilda's there. She
      throws the laser blaster to Valentina who catches it and aims

      Jimmy at the thruster, he grips the joystick, feeling woozy.
                          JIMMY
                Here goes nothing.
      He's sweating profusely. He looks at his glove - it's
      burning. There's orange-glowing cinders flying off his boots.
      Jimmy hits the big red button! A BLAST OF PLASMA fires out of
      the thruster next to him.
      (Wide shot) Over the course of five long seconds, the station
      stops falling. The thruster stops firing.
      He's burning more now. His suit POPS A LEAK! Smoke whizzes
      out of a hole in his arm. He stares at it.
                           JIMMY (CONT'D)
                Oh crap.

      Tilda runs in to see a screen that shows a vector graphic of

      Tilda and Jimmy are sitting, eating sandwiches. The room is
      tidy now, cleaner than it's ever been. Food wrappers around.
