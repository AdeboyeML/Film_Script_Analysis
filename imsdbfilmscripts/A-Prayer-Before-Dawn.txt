he would never win but trying anyway. Every fucking day of it
was a war."

1   INT. SHACK (THAILAND) - NIGHT - ON A MAN'S HANDS                 1

    strong...raw skin, callused, with hard scar tissue build-up.
    Knuckles raised and damaged...They unfold a scrap of aluminum
    foil with a red pill inside it: `YABA'...Southeast Asia's
    crack cocaine.

    Zippo sparks beneath the foil -- Huge inhale, fumes rise and
    steam a glass Pyrex pipe.

    The Man chokes back, tries to hold the toke. He burps, smoke
    spurting from his nostrils.

    Meet BILLY MOORE...mid-20's, rugged, handsome, intense.

    We HEAR THAI VOICES O.C., sharp tones. Billy moves to a wall
    of rotted wood planks that divides the shack into two
    "rooms." He peers through a crack, SEES --

    BILLY'S POV: a larger MUAY THAI BOXER in his 30's (ECKACHAI).
    Barrel chest, crude. A TRAINER holds mitts as Eckachai snaps
    HARD/LOUD COMBOS of knees/fists. It's intimidating as hell.

    Billy stares through the cracks...Suddenly, a distant CROWD
    ROARS. A thousand voices firing at once, and we --

                                                       SMASH TO:

2   INT. RING: SLUM GYM - NIGHT - TWO MUAY THAI BOXERS               2

    -- both twelve years old, are fighting in a ring surrounded
    by GAMBLERS. It's loud, primal...A Thai promoter, PAPA (50's)
    commentates rapid-fire on a mic, his voice echoing over bad
    speakers as his wife, MAMA, shouts from the crowd...

    In the ring, the smaller child boxer, NINDAM, is on the attack
    -- Bodies twisting, grappling, their tiny fists, knees and
    shins crashing, as--

3   INT. SHACK - BILLY                                               3

    gets ready. Shirt off, his ripped build, battle scarred...He
    POUNDS a cement post with his bare fist. One blow after another,
    fists then forearms...Slow, dense thuds, tempering his nerves
    NOT to feel, as--

4   INT. RING: SLUM GYM - NINDAM + OPPONENT                          4

    are fighting, jack-rabbit fast. Ringside gamblers shove and
    shout. Bets exchange, hand signals flashing, odds rising, the
    violence shocking, as--
                                                             3.


5   INT. SHACK - BILLY                                              5

    stands, legs apart and brutally slams a 4x4 BOARD against each
    of his shins...bruises blossom, shins cracking, NUMBING, again,
    again and again, and--

6   INT. RING: SLUM GYM - NINDAM                                    6

    jabs Opponent, who reels and drops his guard. Nindam fires a
    kick to the jaw...

    ...and Opponent drops cold. Crowd roars. TRAINERS swarm in.
    The REFEREE lifts Nindam's arm in victory. He smiles.

    As Nindam exits the ring, two ADULT THAI FIGHTERS climb in...
    Papa intros each, new odds soar. That fast, while --

7   INT. SHACK - BILLY                                              7

    paces the room, anxiety rising, a caged beast...He pauses...
    drops his shorts and cup guard, then grips his knees and
    takes several fast, deep breaths....

    Billy...sopping sweat...yanks up his guard/shorts...His hands
    are shaking as he wraps them in KNOTTED ROPE...

    We HEAR the SOUND of Eckachai leaving. Billy peeks outside
    the shack, sees Eckachai and his Trainer walking away...

    Billy smokes more Yaba. Breathes it deep in his lungs.

    AND THE DOOR BANGS OPEN. Nindam enters -- Billy spins, quick
    hides his pipe and foil in a gym bag, just in time;

    Nindam says something in Thai, grabs a pair of BOXING GLOVES
    and helps Billy put them on.

    There's a feeling of urgency, that Billy is late.

    As Nindam ties and tapes the gloves, Billy is too high/amped
    and avoids Nindam's gaze.

    After, both nod, bump fists.

8   EXT. SHACK - NIGHT - FOLLOW BILLY                               8

    with Nindam, hurrying together beneath a ROARING OVERPASS...
    they cross a TRASH STREWN ALLEY lined with other shacks, slum
    tenants drinking and smoking.

    A MAN sits on a bucket holding a chain with a TINY MONKEY on
    the end. The monkey wears a plastic doll mask;
                                                              4.


     Two other MEN quickly carry a BLOODIED, UNCONSCIOUS FIGHTER on
     a stretcher, the opposite way;

     Billy and Nindam rush past...Sounds of the crowd and music
     rise...They enter the slum gym...

     Papa joins them...

9    INT. RING: SLUM GYM - AS BILLY STEPS THROUGH THE ROPES           9

     with Nindam and Papa. Adrenaline charged...methamphetamine
     spiked POV, he darts a look to the crowd: Gamblers trading
     fistfuls of cash. Mama rallies loudly in Thai...A wired Billy
     turns to Eckachai in the opposite corner with his Trainer...

     The crowd getting louder...LOUDER...

     Nindam and Papa, and Trainer exit the ring.

     A COW-BELL rings for ROUND ONE.

     BILLY + ECKACHAI
     come out firing -- Explosive trades, bone-on-bone impact --
     Through BILLY'S HEIGHTENED SENSES, we FEEL the visceral rage--

     Mid-round, Billy sees an opening and SMASHES a hook to
     Eckachai's jaw -- He hits the canvas hard -- Crowd ROARS --

     Eckachai gets up -- Billy charges, a wild boar -- two fisted,
     savage attack to the head and body....Eckachai survives.

     THE BELL.

10   INT. RING: BILLY'S CORNER - BETWEEN ROUNDS - BILLY              10

     sits. Papa and Nindam, as cornermen, go to work...but Billy's
     HEART IS RACING, PULSE POUNDING, TOO FAST -- the drugs have
     zapped his energy. As Billy inhales several sharp breaths, a
     strange RINGING fades in OVER the following...

     -- GAMBLERS' hands signals, the odds rising;

     -- MAMA watching, concerned;

     -- PAPA and NINDAM shouting instructions to Billy, but he/we
     can't hear them, only this shrill RINGING...

     -- ECKACHAI gets off his stool, revived and ready;

     AND THE BELL FOR ROUND TWO.
                                                                5.


11   INT. RING - ROUND TWO - BILLY                                   11

     storms out, tries to put Eckachai away -- Billy SWINGS
     HEAVILY, THUNDERING HAYMAKERS THAT MISS and MISS --

     Nindam, screaming encouragement in Thai as --

     Eckachai AVOIDS, then SLAMS an elbow into Billy's eye, jarring
     and concussive -- Billy staggers, blinking, dazed...

     Eckachai unleashes a ROUNDHOUSE KICK and Billy's out on
     impact.

     BILLY'S HEAD bounces off the canvas -- eyes flash -- brain
     stem shocked. SENSES CONTORT...He tries to get up as the Ref
     counts over him. Takes seconds, feels like hours. AS HIS
     SENSES RECONNECT ...Billy climbs to his feet -- but the Ref
     counts "Sip!" (ten)

     The fight's over.

     The crowd goes crazy, IMPOSSIBLE TO HEAR, as --

     Billy protests to the Ref, who affirms in Thai. Billy doesn't
     understand.

     CORNERMEN pour in. Ref and Billy keep arguing. Nindam gets
     between them -- Ref violently SHOVES Nindam away, and --

     Billy reacts -- hair trigger fast -- HEADBUTTS Ref full in
     the face. Ref goes down. A nasty cut opens above Billy's eye
     as he KICKS/STOMPS the Ref with MANIC, UNCONTROLLABLE RAGE --

     BOUNCERS/OTHERS swarm over Billy, forcibly restraining him
     from killing the Ref -- He tries fighting them too --

     NOW PAPA FORCES IN -- grabs Billy hard around the neck, yanks
     him close, sees the drugs in his eyes...And Billy knows it.

     Billy's POV, SEES: Nindam is crying. SEES: the Ref writhing on
     the floor, blood oozing through cupped fingers. SEES: the crowd
     roaring. All of it, a disaster.

     HOLD TIGHT ON BILLY'S FACE
     as the RAGE...becomes REMORSE...becomes SELF-HATRED...and PAIN.

                                                        SMASH TO:

12   EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - NIGHT - MOVING WITH BILLY                12

     as he walks the crowded streets. Face bruised, blood dried
     through a bandage above his eye...
                                                              6.


     From Billy's DRUGGED POV, IMAGES are kinetic and abstract, a
     nightmarish KALEIDOSCOPE:

     Flashing lights.   Psychoactive.   Multicolored.

     Shadows pass/undulate. Stray dogs everywhere...

     SOUNDS are discordant, reverberating: Car horns. Motorbikes.
     People talking, laughing, shouting...

     Billy moves through it, focus jumping, blurring. Everything
     pulsing, pounding, claustrophobic.

13   INT. GO-GO CLUB: RED LIGHT DISTRICT - NIGHT                     13

     Music assaults us. Bass so heavy, it jars our teeth. We're in
     a seedy sex playground, under harsh neon lights. Strippers on
     stage, on poles, in cages...Most of them high on drugs, empty
     eyes, bored. "Coyote Girls" in string bikinis, servicing
     tourists, all sweating like fiends...

14   AT THE BAR - BILLY                                              14

     slams a double-shot of whiskey.

     He turns and scans the crowd till he spots a young Thai
     girl...NINA, 20's, bikini clad...giving a lap dance to a mid-
     60's CUSTOMER.

     To Billy, Nina is impossibly beautiful, an angel, a rose. His
     anger builds, as the Customer paws Nina's breasts and legs.

     Nina looks up from her Customer, and sees Billy watching her.
     Eyes meet...Billy forces a smile...Nina nods to a booth where
     two YOUNG AUSTRALIAN MEN (20's) nervously wait.

     Billy slams another whiskey, then--

15   INT. STALL: CLUB BATHROOM - BILLY + AUSTRALIAN #1 + #2          15

     are in a stall. The Australians stare at Billy's bruises and
     bloodied bandage...as he counts out two packets of 100 Yaba,
     wrapped in cling film.

     Australians hand Billy cash. Billy counts, pockets it. Gives
     them the pills.

     Then Australians #1/#2 watch as Billy cooks up a hit of Yaba.
     Foil -- lighter -- smoke -- suck...
     a
     THUNDEROUS
     FUCKING
     RUSH
                                                                7.


16   SMASH TO: LATER - BILLY                                         16

     works the club...

     ...and the SEQUENCE BUILDS, Billy hustling deals...Yaba for
     cash, deal after deal. Getting HIGHER with customers. Getting
     HIGHER alone, in between SHOTS OF WHISKEY and BUMPS OF COKE.
     The music gets LOUDER. The action HEAVIER. More NARCOTIC...

17   BATHROOM. LATER                                                 17

     A very intoxicated Billy throws water on his face. He shadow-
     boxes a few punches in front of a filthy mirror...then stares
     at his reflection, morosely.

18   INT. MAIN FLOOR: GO-GO CLUB - NIGHT - BILLY                     18

     looks around for Nina. He finds her in a corner chatting with
     other girls. THE MUSIC DEAFENING NOW -- We cannot hear what's
     being said as...

     Billy heads over. Nina sees his condition and stands up.

     Billy tries to talk to her. Nina rejects him.

     Billy takes her by the arm and pulls her close.

     Nina catches the desperate pain in Billy's eyes, and looks at
     him, gravely.

     Billy lets Nina go. She hurries off --

19   LATER. BILLY                                                    19

     is obliterated, sweating profusely as he walks through the
     club...Only the hardest sex/drug addicts remain. Billy's legs
     buckle; he uses a wall for support, sparks a JOINT to slow his
     heart.

     His distorted POV.....A Stripper slides a cigar from her vagina
     and pumps out smoke rings. Men applaud, hurl cash on stage.

     Billy blinks, unsure if he's hallucinating.

20   DANCE FLOOR. LATER                                              20

     Billy dances, alone, trancelike. Releasing himself from himself.
     Everything rising to a fever pitch. Then, without warning...
     SOUND CUTS OUT...and Billy starts to weep.

     OVER THIS LONG, VERY LONELY SILENCE;

     A STRANGE THUMPING begins, quietly, that carries us into....
                                                                 8.


21   INT. BILLY'S APARTMENT - PRE DAWN - BILLY                        21

     sits in a chair, nude, his back to us.

     Billy is, by now, paralytic. Mouth open, head tilted back,
     like a corpse...The strange and dull THUMPING builds, like a
     muted heart beat...
                        boom...
                               boom...
                                      boom...

     Billy mumbles, incoherent. Eyes rolled back, the drugs
     cocooning him in a blissful isolation from all else. The
     thumping, louder now...
                            Boom...
                                   Boom...
                                          Boom...

     Billy's eyes start to flutter. Tries to open them: can't.
     Suddenly, loud/startling...
                                BOOM!! BOOM!! BOOM!! BOOM!! BOOM!!

     Billy snaps alert -- turns to the door. Someone's BANGING on
     it from the other side;

     THEN, LOUD VOICES BEGIN SHOUTING IN THAI...

     Billy peers through the peep-hole: SEES 4 THAI COPS, guns out.
     He spins, looks at his table --

     It's full of EIGHT YABA PACKETS, burned matches, a pipe.

     He looks at his desk -- it's covered with WEAPONS: a Colt .45,
     machete, a stun gun, knuckle duster, a pile of cell phones/sim
     cards, and a Samurai sword.

     Fuck.

     POLICE BANG AWAY AT THE DOOR --

     Billy quickly grabs a few yaba packets and forces them up his
     ass -- painfully as --

     POLICE KEEP SHOUTING/KNOCKING VIOLENTLY --

     BILLY STARTS TO EAT THE OTHER YABA PACKETS: SIX OF THEM.

     THE COPS KICK THE DOOR. THE SLIDE LOCK HOLDS IT SHUT; BARELY.

     BILLY CHOKES DOWN THE LAST PACKET DRY. HACKS, SWALLOWS --

     ANOTHER KICK. THE LOCK IS ABOUT TO GIVE.

     While pulling on clothes, Billy takes a fall, gets up, as --
                                                               9.


     DOOR BREAKS OPEN -- NEARLY OFF IT'S HINGES. COPS STAMPEDE IN
     AND ROUGHLY THROW BILLY TO THE GROUND --

     THEY CUFF HIM, SEARCH HIM. GUNS AT HIS HEAD, A FOOT ON HIS
     NECK, ALL SHOUTING IN THAI --

     COPS #1 + #2 inspect Billy's arsenal, chattering fast, as COPS
     #3 + #4 find TWIN SYRINGES in a pie tin on the stove. They
     immediately search for drugs: ripping open cabinets, rifling
     drawers, kicking out panels, trashing everything they touch...

     ON BILLY, terrified, sweating.

                                                         CUT TO:

22   INT. STAIRWELL: APT BUILDING - PRE DAWN - BILLY                  22

     is dazed, his cut reopen, bleeds down his face and t-shirt as
     the Cops walk him downstairs in handcuffs...

     They slow for a moment, passing the reception desk...where the
     MANAGER sits, staring at Billy in horror.

     Billy looks away in shame. They force him outside to...

23   EXT. CITY STREET - PRE DAWN                                      23

     ...a waiting POLICE PICKUP TRUCK. Billy is shoved in the back
     of the truck, like an animal. And as they drive away, the
     first streaks of dawn light the horizon over Bangkok...


24   I/E. POLICE PICKUP (TRAVELING) - PRE DAWN - BILLY                24

     in back. A POLICE MOTORBIKE follows, headlight glaring bright.

     Billy watches as various BANGKOK STRATA goes past...Empty
     streets. Markets opening. Vendors and shops. The city waking,
     coming to life.


     Title:              A PRAYER BEFORE DAWN

                                                         CUT TO:

25   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM: POLICE STATION - DAWN - BILLY           25

     We slam in mid-scene. Billy -- sweating, nervous, hands
     cuffed behind his back, sitting in this room -- as five THAI
     COPS are all SCREAMING in Thai at Billy.

     All the weapons and phones from his apartment are spread
     across a desk, along with his passport...Billy is terrified,
     doesn't know what's being said.
                                                          10.


Then, FIRST OFFICER slams down a DOCUMENT before Billy: it's
written in Thai.

                    FIRST OFFICER
          You sign, na!

Cop #1 roughly uncuffs Billy, shoves a pen in his hand.

                    BILLY
          I can't read Thai.

                    FIRST OFFICER
          SIGN!

Billy, scared, shakes his head "no."

                    FIRST OFFICER
          --SIGN!

The Cops all SHOUT again in Thai. Voices ARGUE, OVERLAPPING,
GETTING ANGRIER, SCARIER. It goes on and on and on...Billy
frozen. Until:

                    BILLY
              (erupts; top of his lungs)
          GET ME THE EMBASSY!! GET ME THE
          FUCKING EMBASSY!!!

BEAT...thick silence.

                    BILLY
          AY?!

First Officer smugs. He smokes a cigarette.

     First Officer glances -- Cop #1, lightening fast, yanks Billy
     to his feet. First Officer grabs the KNUCKLE DUSTER off the
     desk and SLAMS a vicious punch to Billy's sternum.

     Billy loses wind, vomit/pills tunneling up his throat -- He
     retches violently, gags it back;

     Billy slumps in his chair, trembling hard, about to puke.

26   INT. HOLDING TANK: POLICE STATION - AFTER - BILLY                26

     is shoved inside by Cops. The cell is small, dark and foul,
     filled with 30 or so other sweating bodies.

     Billy paces intensely, anxiety in his eyes. He waits for the
     Cops to vanish down a hall.

     THEN...

     ...Billy turns around and VOMITS.

     Yaba packets hit the floor, plastic burned by intestinal
     acid. Billy drops to his knees, anxiously digs through chunks
     and fluid to find the Yaba pills.

     A few others in the cell take notice: ADDICTS, sweating,
     scratching...They hungrily move toward him...

     Billy quickly starts to eat the pills.

     He looks up, sees the Addicts standing over him. Threatening
     tension hangs.

     Billy moves back. The Addicts swoop in, devouring the rest of
     his pills like wolves.
                                                               12.

27   I/E. CAGED PRISON BUS (MOVING) - A WEEK LATER - BILLY           27

     rides, crammed among PRISONERS. He's having acute withdrawals.
     Sweat soaked, in a lot of pain. Even sunlight hurts.

28   EXT. PRISON - DAY - AS THE PRISON BUS ARRIVES                   28

     Gates open, revealing the compound...High concrete walls and
     barbed electric fences. Looming guard towers at intervals.

     The bus lurches forward, rumbling through the gates...GUARDS
     approach with SHOTGUNS and CATTLE PRODS. The door jerks open:
     prisoners disembark, all in CHAINS, Billy among them...

     He gazes around, swallowed by the prison.

29   INT. RECEIVING BLOCK - DAY - BILLY + PRISONERS                  29

     are herded in. It's dim, narrow. Guards unlock the shackles;
     chains drop, rattling to the floor...Guards bark orders in
     Thai and the prisoners shed their clothes, lining up for
     cursory exams -- mouth, ears, feet, balls, armpits, ass...

     Billy watches, repulsed, as a SKINNY GUARD wearing a latex
     glove, uses the same finger for each exam, without sterilizing.

     Suddenly a muffled THAI RING-TONE plays from somewhere. It
     RINGS, RINGS and RINGS...

     Guards look around. Prisoners/Billy are still. NO ONE MOVES.
     The ring-tone keep playing.

     Then, Skinny Guard looks at a naked Thai (NOK, 20) and orders
     him to step forward. He squats, coughs...and a CELL PHONE
     drops out.

     The name of the incoming caller: "Mom" (in Thai)

     Cued by Skinny Guard's look, a BULL GUARD lashes out, BATON
     across Nok's jaw, splaying it open. He goes down in a heap,
     gash gushing red, defenseless.

     Billy stares in shock as Bull Guard hails a series of blows,
     baton beating Nok hard...The room goes DEAD SILENT.

     Bull Guard walks away, leaving Nok a motionless pulp...

     Skinny Guard says something in Thai...Billy steps up.

     Mouth, ears, feet, balls, armpits, ass -- demeaning.
                                                               13.


     GUARD #1 hands Billy his clothes. As he puts them on, GUARD
     #1 extracts a SWITCHBLADE and cuts Billy's pants into shorts.

30   INT. RECEIVING BLOCK (END OF THE LINE) - AFTER - BILLY          30

     is seated on the floor...He's dopesick, scared, and looks it.
     Other Thais sit with him, cross-legged, not looking up.

     NOW: OFFICER PI SIT steps in, lowering his head to get thru
     the door. Chief of guards. 50, large, imposing. Without a
     doubt, the man in charge. He motions Billy to stand. Billy
     does, staring dead ahead, nervous, shaking...not meeting
     Officer Pi Sit's stare.

                         OFFICER PI SIT
               Chi yeng yeng... (keep cool heart.)

     Officer Pi Sit taps Billy's chest lightly. And again:

     It's jam packed with over 70 THAI PRISONERS on threadbare
     blankets, inches apart...Their clothes tattered, some with
     blood-stained bandages, some in shackles. The chattering is
     loud, incessant. Stench, unbearable. Flies and mosquitoes
     ...Like a mass grave.

     Billy enters, nervous...The cell becomes VERY quiet. Guard #2
     barks something in Thai and forces Billy along. He tries to
     keep a brave face as all the prisoners STARE at him...

     Seated on a blanket is TIFFANY, a Lady-boy in his 20's, long
     hair, unshaven, scabbed lips, fake tits, penis bulging under
     loosened shorts, and a t-shirt w/slogan: "NO MONEY, NO HONEY"

     Nearby: A BODY lies on a damp, stained mattress. Insects feed
     on open wounds. A shirt covers his face.

     Tiffany and the corpse.

pack of cigarettes.

          You like smokey?

Billy hesitates, then snatches the cigarette. Tiffany smiles,
lights it for him.

     corner and fill them up with water.

     Billy, still sitting there, hears someone giggle...He looks
     over to see a mentally retarded Thai inmate, filthy, in moldy
     flip-flops, (NOI, 19) watching him...Laughing. Noi is the
     only other prisoner not trying to get water.

     Now, Billy gets up and hurries in to get water. It's rowdy,
     chaotic: NUMEROUS PRISONERS all yelling in Thai, forcing
     their way in to fill up their bottles.

     Billy gestures/talks. No one understands him.

     Billy finally manages to fill up three bottles for himself.

42   EXT. TROUGHS - MORNING - BILLY                                  42

     in line among prisoners. Billy struggles to hold/carry his
     bottles of water. One is leaking. He tries to cover the hole.

     Two THAI PRISONERS in their underwear, leaving the troughs,
     bump into Billy...and he drops all his water.
                                                               20.


     Billy holds in his frustration...barely.

43   INT. CANTEEN - MORNING - BILLY                                  43

     and prisoners are fed breakfast. Rice and soup (fish skeleton
     with only the head attached). Billy forces it down.

44   EXT. OPEN-AIR TOILET AREA - MORNING, AFTER - BILLY              44

     in line, looking nauseous. He waits, and waits...It's finally
     his turn. He runs into the stall and vomits.

                                                          CUT TO:

45   EXT. CORRIDOR - DAY, LATER - BILLY                              45

     walks down this long corridor alone, then heads out a door...

46   EXT. THE COURTYARD - WIDE - WITH BILLY                          46

     ...into the chaos and cacophony of the MAIN YARD, a strange
     world overflowing with bodies: all selling, eating, thieving,
     drugging, betting, fighting and fucking.

     MAKESHIFT SHOPS and STANDS throughout: Thai massages, a
     barber, laundry, food, crafts, flavored water on ice for sale.
     STATIC, THAI MUSIC drones over speakers...

     PRISONERS IN SHACKLES play tackle FOOTBALL, argue and fight.
     Some are in groups (North and South Thai gangs), gambling and
     hawking wares. Lady Boys on the prowl. A human piranha tank.

     Above it all, GUARDS watch from the two-story cell block and
     surrounding towers.

     ON BILLY -- taking it in...

                         UNSHAVEN LADY BOY
               Yoo-hoo, farang!
                   (off Billy's look)
               You want fuck arse me?

     The Unshaven Lady-Boy lifts up her top to show giant, fake
     breasts. Billy ignores.

     Billy notices a few Westerners together: Australian and Arab.
     They look at Billy...Billy stares them down.

     Then;

     BILLY'S POV -- across the yard...Amidst it all, he spots who
     he's been looking for: Elyias.
                                                                21.


     As Billy approaches...he sees Elyias with TRUSTEES #1 + #2 in
     a heated argument with THREE MUSLIMS. It's loud, threatening,
     lots of shoving, shouting in Thai.

     Billy stands back, watches. The Muslims storm away.

     Elyias turns...sees Billy, who discreetly gestures with his
     hands what he needs...

47   E/I. PRISON LOCKER AREA - DAY - BILLY                            47

     follows Elyias through a gate, into the hangar-like structure.
     It's dim, red bulbs hang, row upon row of lockers. Elyias
     signals Billy to wait, then disappears into the shadows.

     HOLD ON BILLY
     alone. Nervous. Above him, Guards loom on balconies. They eye
     Billy, then move on...Billy waits and waits...It's intense
     and unnerving. Feels like forever.

     He decides to leave -- when Elyias suddenly returns with
     Trustees #1 + #2. Billy looks at them, ill at ease.

     Then, Elyias slips Billy a lighter, gum foil, and YABA PILL.

     As Trustees #1 + #2 stand watch, Billy lights up, cooks the
     drug. Thick smoke rises...Billy hard INHALES, and --

                                                      SMASH TO:

48   EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAY, AFTER - PRISONERS                   48

     A FIST-FIGHT breaks out among prisoners. Then ANOTHER.
     Someone gets STOMPED. Other prisoners crowd around and gamble
     on who will win.

     BILLY
     is alone, motionless and drugged. WE SEE what/how HE SEES...

     The nude INDIAN PRISONER in the turban runs past, yelling, "I
     HAVE GOD POWER! I HAVE GOD POWER!..."

     A BLIND PRISONER with a stick...An OLD MAN in a broken
     wheelchair...Another prisoner with NO LEGS on a wooden board
     with tiny wheels pulls himself along...A few PRISONERS being
     publicly punished, jogging in chains in the scorching heat...

     The Indian scurries onto a low divider laced with BARBED
     WIRE. GUARDS shout at him to get down. The Indian keeps
     moving/yelling "I HAVE GOD POWER," then jumps for the main
     wall -- hits the ELECTRIC FENCE -- instantly fried.

     "God Power" gone.
                                                                22.


     The Guards cut the Indian down.

     Billy just stares, over-fucking-whelmed.

     Then, a strange calm washes over him...as if feeling the
     Indian is now free.

49   INT. NEWCOMER CELL - PRE DAWN - BILLY                            49

     lies awake, depressed. Fluorescents blaze, humidity hangs.
     He looks around at the other prisoners, inches apart.

     BILLY'S POV: Some are asleep. Most in bad health: open sores,
     diseases. Tiffany snores beside him. One prisoner mumbles to
     himself, incoherent. Another cries quietly, his foot badly
     infected with gangrene. A third prisoner makes a crude weapon
     out of a SPOON. An OLDER PRISONER sits on the toilet steps,
     whistle around his neck, on suicide watch. He just stares at
     Billy, saying nothing...

     ON BILLY. ALONE.

     In the distance, faintly rising, we hear atonal CHANTING. The
     Islamic call to prayer. It drones, hypnotic, a hundred voices
     bypassing the prison walls...

     "Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akba, Ash-hadu anla ilaha illah Allah,"
     on and on.

     Billy rises, drapes a wet rag over his head, then moves to
     the bars and listens...
                                                        CUT TO:

50   INT. NEWCOMER CELL - DAYS LATER - PRISONERS                      50

     do morning head-count for Guard #2. When the count reaches
     Billy, he yells "Nok!" and the count keeps going...

51   INT. NEWCOMER CELL - DAY - BILLY                                 51

     sits on his blanket. Sweating, nauseous. Leg bouncing rapid.
     The itch to get high...Tries to fight it.

     He looks at the nail on his thumb. Starts to bite it.

     He begins to tear it off with his teeth.

     He rips it completely off and spits it on the floor.

     His thumb is torn and bleeding.

     Billy just stares at it.
                                                             23.


     He hears someone laughing. Billy looks over to see Noi, the
     mentally retarded inmate...laughing at him again.

     Then, Billy bursts out the door.

52   INT. PRISON LOCKER AREA - DAY - AS A LIGHTER                  52

     sparks, a yaba pill boils...and Billy inhales full blast.
     Trustee's #1 + #2 keep watch.

     Then, Elyias:

                         ELYIAS
               Yaba...Tiger. Horse. More you use,
               more you need...

     Billy, in some otherworldy place.

                         BILLY
               The fuck are you on about?

                         ELYIAS
               Now time, you pay me.

                         BILLY
                   (slow, high)
               ...I'll pay when I can.

                         ELYIAS
               Must pay now. No money, you pay
               other way...

     AS BILLY AND ELYIAS MOVE OUT TO THE YARD
     they/we see a distant GROUP OF MUSLIMS...CHANTING in Muslim
     prayer, using newspapers for prayer mats: "Allahu Akbar,
     Allahu, Aakbar..."

                         ELYIAS
               Muslims. Bad for business...
               You, boxer-- Boom boom them.

     Elyias pounds a fist into his hand.

                         BILLY
               I don't do that. Fuck off.

                         ELYIAS
               Then me sell your debt to supplier:
               "the Samurai."

     Billy follows his gaze to a gang of SIX THAI in a nearby
     section of the yard. Predatory, junkie-thin, full tattooed.
     The leader, KENG, face tattooed, holds court.
                                                               24.


                         ELYIAS
               HIV, AIDS, all them...
                   (off Billy's look)
               Syringes are swords. Buy drugs and
               you no pay? Give AIDS to you...

     Hidden by the rest, A YOUNG SAMURAI sits in the dirt...a full
     skeletal structure tattooed on his hands. He uses a strange,
     CROOKED KNIFE to deeply carve/scar his own arms.

     He looks at Billy. Eyes meet. Billy looks away.

                         ELYIAS
               Choice yours.

     As Billy stands there, on the edge of a precipice....

53   INT. PRISON KITCHEN: BUILDING SIX - LATE DAY - THREE MUSLIMS    53

     busily work the stoves. Steam and flames rise in the dark as
     they cook. Malaysian music plays low on a RADIO. They talk in
     good spirits (AD LIB). THE OLDEST MUSLIM fills a large bowl
     with food and leaves to feed the others.

     MUSLIMS #1 + #2 talk/cook. One makes a joke, the other
     laughs...Then, SOMEONE (O.C.) turns the radio up, LOUD. The
     Muslims stop, turn...

     BILLY
     stands there. STARK STILL. A pain in his eyes: self hatred,
     remorse. Then, his rapid breathing induces a RAGE, RISING...

     The Muslims furrow their brows.

     A split-second heartbeat...just one;

     AND BILLY ATTACKS. MANIACAL VIOLENCE. So fast, so shockingly
     brutal it's hard to watch. Malaysian music blares, drowning
     out the Muslims' screams. Billy destroys them both...till the
     Muslims lie there, barely breathing, bloody, crippled pulps.

54   MOMENTS AFTER - BILLY'S HANDS                                   54

     are blood covered. He runs water in a sink, fills up a
     bucket, and sinks his hands into it. The water turns red.
     Billy stares at it. Silent and tense.

                                                       CUT TO:

55   INT. NEWCOMER CELL - PRE DAWN - BILLY                           55

     lies awake, under a white sheet. Empty, sick, defeated.
     Nowhere to turn. Nothing to hope for.
                                                                25.


     One Prisoner on watch; everyone else asleep.

     HOLD ON BILLY....staring up at the security camera, his sheet
     pulled to his chin. He glances at Tiffany, asleep nearby.
     It's VERY TENSE, VERY QUIET...

     Prisoner on watch looks around.

     Then, Billy makes the tiniest flinch. And we see something
     dark -- moving... A SPOT OF BLOOD FORMS ON THE SHEET. THEN
     ANOTHER...AND ANOTHER...ALL THEM POOLING OUT UNTIL THE SHEET
     IS SOAKED WITH BLOOD.

     Under the sheet: BILLY IS CUTTING HIMSELF WITH THE CRUDE
     SPOON WE SAW EARLIER. CUTTING DEEP. CUTTING EVERYWHERE.
     FLOODING WITH SELF-HATRED.

     Billy holds in tears;

     Suddenly, FEAR sets in. Instant REGRET and PANIC. Billy
     throws the sheet off...It's an horrific sight...His arms and
     leg and stomach opened and bleeding.

     Billy drops the spoon by the inmate he stole it from, waking
     and startling him. Nearby, Tiffany wakes up too, shocked as --

     Billy staggers toward the bars...wounds pumping blood, air
     leaving him...

     Everyone begins chattering, incessant Thai; The prisoner on
     watch loudly blows his WHISTLE. Again and again.

     Billy grips the bars...Blood and drool and foam in his mouth,
     he sputters, no words...

                         BILLY
               Hel-- Hel-- I, I need--

     Billy, scared, lost-- rears up, SCREAMING---

                         BILLY
               HEEEEELLLLLLLLLLPPPPPPP!!!!!

                                                        BLACK.
56   INT. PRISON INFIRMARY - DAYS LATER - BILLY                       56

     lies still and bandaged in a bed. Other patients in beds:
     AIDS-ridden, organs failing, runaway sepsis. One can't stop
     shaking. We're in Death's waiting room.

     Billy just lies there. Grave emotion. He quietly breaks down,
     ...then wipes the tears away.
                                                               26.


57   EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - LATE DAY - BILLY                          57

     is walked by two Guards past the ENTIRE INMATE POPULATION
     (500), gathered in the yard for head-count.

     All eyes on Billy. Humiliated.

     Officer Pi Sit watches from a distant balcony as the Guards
     lead Billy toward a tiny cell, built beneath the prison
     staircase -- And that is...

58   INT. THE ISOLATION CELL                                           58

     No bed or   sink. Just a bucket for a toilet. Paint peels in
     scabs off   the ceiling, only three-feet high. Porno mag photos
     are stuck   to a wall, among dozens of markings from previous
     prisoners   counting down days.

     Billy grips the bars, on his knees, staring across the yard.

     THE WHISTLE BLOWS and all prisoners return to their cells.
     Officer Pi Sit returns to his office.

     WE HOLD ON BILLY for the longest time...alone with the empty
     courtyard. Only a large BUDDHA STATUE remains; incense and
     candles burning, it's solemn face staring at Billy.

     Billy staring back.

     And as the sun starts to dip...In the distance, two GUARDS
     exit a cell, followed by a group of MEN...well built, full
     tattooed, shackled and chained...GYM BAGS in hand and BOXING
     GLOVES tied around their shoulders. The Boxers and Guards go
     past, not looking at Billy...

     Billy watches them go. Forlorn. Numb.

                                                          CUT TO:

59   INT. SECTOR 5: CORRIDOR - DAY - BILLY                             59

     Days have passed. Billy -- bearded, filthy -- and three THAI
     INMATES are led down a corridor.

60   INT. SECTOR 5 CELL - DAY - BILLY, THAI #1, #2 + #3                60

     enter this huge, crowded cell, deemed maximum security.
     Guards slam the bars behind them.

     It's dark, foul. Wet clothes hang on lines. Bottles of murky
     fluids. It's a SAMURAI CELL. Wall-to-wall packed w/INMATES,
     tattooed from head-to-toe, many in shackles. Surveillance
     cameras...The air itself is dangerous.
                                                             27.


     Billy and the three Thai Inmates stand before the "cell boss,"
     we saw in the yard: KENG. He sharply barks the rules in Thai.

     Billy's quiet, doesn't like the tone. A few Samurai laugh.

     As Billy looks for a space to sit, one Samurai gets up...KIAW
     (30, Thai, body and lips tattooed, wearing shackles). He
     shouts in Thai at a sleeping Samurai, "Bie!" (move!) then
     kicks him hard in the ribs to make room for Billy.

     Then Kiaw looks at Billy and smiles...

                         KIAW
               Okay, farang. You sleep here.

     Billy sits.

                            KIAW
               I am Kiaw.

                            BILLY
               Billy.

                         KIAW
                   (smiles)
               Me hear of you...

                         BILLY
               Yeah, what'd you hear?

                         KIAW
               That you crazy foreigner. Farang,
               ba. I like that. Kiaw friend to
               you...

     SUDDEN COMMOTION. EVERYONE TALKING. Billy looks up to see the
     three Thai Inmates he came in with are clutching the cell
     bars as Samurai take turns kicking them from behind.

                         KIAW
               Initiation...not for Westerner.

     When it's over, the three Thais celebrate. Samurai embrace
     them. Billy watches, feeling oddly rejected.

                                                       CUT TO:

61   EXT. SHOWER AREA - MORNING - BILLY + KIAW                       61

     wait in a long cue of prisoners leading up to the troughs.

     When it's their turn: five cups water, ten seconds soap, four
     cups water; Next prisoner's turn.
                                                               28.


     After, Billy and Kiaw shave, using dull razors and sharing a
     small plastic bowl of water.

     Kiaw gives Billy a clean t-shirt.

     Billy puts it on.

                                                        CUT TO:

62   EXT. LAUNDRY AREA: PRISON COURTYARD - DAY - A SEA OF WHITE      62

     linen sheets, clipped to lines, undulates in the breeze. Go
     behind it TO REVEAL: small clusters of junkie prisoners,
     using makeshift rigs out of Bic pens to boot heroin.

     BILLY
     watches, nervous and horrified as Kiaw builds a "syringe":
     taking apart a Bic pen, then using a lighter to burn/melt one
     end of the stem around a needle;

     As Kiaw breaks open a straw of heroin and mixes it with water
     in a bottle cap...

     Kiaw sucks the heroin mix up through the "syringe," then
     forces the needle into his vein, and blows the heroin in;

     Billy is shocked.

                            KIAW
               Now you.

                            BILLY
               Fuck that.

                         KIAW
               Best high like this.

     Billy, ill at ease, contemplates, then....

     ....we HEAR a distant chorus of SOUND, IN THE DISTANCE:
     rhythmic POUNDING, chains JANGLING, ropes WHIRRING...

     It gets Billy's attention...he's unsure what it is;


63   EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - RIGHT AFTER - WITH BILLY                63

     as he starts thru the yard...He moves through the chaos, not
     saying a word...

     The SOUNDS get louder as we get closer, Billy following it...
     drawn to it, now arriving at...
                                                                29.


64   A PRISON BOXING GYM                                              64

     Billy enters...Its cage enclosed, decrepit, yet full to
     bursting with MUAY THAI BOXERS at work: SKIPPING ROPES,
     POUNDING BAGS (Two on each bag alternating kicks), HAMMERING
     MITTS and PADS, SPARRING and SHADOWBOXING -- a great machine
     of perpetual violence.

     A DESK GUARD sits, reading a newspaper.

     BILLY'S FACE as he edges forward, transfixed. Everything
     that's happened writ deep in his eyes. Everything he did
     wrong. All he'll never become. Wounded and frightened by the
     abundance of strength around him...

     The Boxers are aware of him now. They stop training.

     And Billy freezes.

     The Boxers staring at him. Every one of them, dangerous.

     Billy staring back. SCARY SILENCE. And just like that....

     AN ANGRY THAI MAN SPRINGS INTO FRAME, STARTLING US -- SHOVING
     BILLY BACK AND SHOUTING AGGRESSIVELY IN THAI --

                         BILLY
                   (stumbling backwards)
               --I'm sorry...sorry, I didn't--

     The Man (NAN, 40's) keeps shouting/driving Billy out --

                         BILLY
               Wait, I'm a fighter! I'M A
               FIGHTER!!

     A LIGHTENING FAST SHOVE and Billy's balance goes -- He falls
     completely out of the gym, lands on his back, on cement.

     Nan yanks the gate SHUT. Locks it with a SNAP.

     Billy looks at him, dumbstruck.

     Nan stares through the gate, smoking a cigarette. Then turns,
     disappearing into the gym.

     OFF BILLY. Mad. Stung. Confused. Roaring sounds of the gym
     resume, and we CUT TO--


65   EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - ANOTHER DAY - BILLY                      65

     sits alone, head in hands, feeling sick. Other prisoners
     ignore him.
                                                             30.


     A Guard looms on a balcony. Billy wipes sweat, stands and
     gestures to him:

                         BILLY
               I need a doctor.


66   INT. PRISON INFIRMARY - DAY - DOZENS OF PRISONERS                66

     line up to a medical hatch, where TRUSTEE #3 hands out little
     cups of pills, with little cups of water. Other TRUSTEES mill.
     Billy, among the queue, ill, says to anyone in line --

                         BILLY
               What're they knocking out up there?

     In front of Billy, an enormous NIGERIAN INMATE answers --

                         NIGERIAN
               Tramadol. Good for pain.

                         BILLY
               Yeah? It's enough to do damage?

                         NIGERIAN
               Not like Dilaudid or Roxinol. But
               good enough.

                         BILLY
                   (slight laugh)
               I'm Billy Moore. What's your name?

                         NIGERIAN
               Black Dildo.

                         BILLY
               "Black Dildo--?" Got a Christian
               name, haven't you?

                         BLACK DILDO (NIGERIAN)
               God name me this. I am Black Dildo.

                         BILLY
               Well you know your painkillers,
               Black Dildo. How much they charging
               for it?

     Black Dildo regards Billy. He doesn't look well.

                         BLACK DILDO
               Free to all. Help get prisoners
               clean.

     Billy nods;
                                                           31.


Black Dildo reaches the hatch. Trustee #3 hands him a cup.
Black Dildo swallows his pills, then water.

Billy's turn...Trustee #3 hands him a cup: it's empty.

                    BILLY
          Where's me pills?

                      TRUSTEE #3
          You pay.

                    BILLY
          "Pay?" The hell you mean? It's
          free, isn't it?

                     TRUSTEE #3
          You, farang. Pay five pack
          cigarette.

                      BILLY
          -- What?!

Prisoners in line grumble, getting impatient. Another TRUSTEE
#4 approaches...so does Black Dildo;

                    BLACK DILDO
          Come back tomorrow. You no want
          trouble here.

                    BILLY
          No, no. It's alright, Dildo. I got
          this...

The situation is now very dangerous. Billy, a volcano of
violence, is about to erupt.

                    BILLY
          Now look, you lil' fuckin' cunt--
          There's people waitin' here...I
          don't want no trouble, so play
          fuckin' nice and give me my pills.

Trustee #4 shouts something in Thai.

                    BILLY
          What'd he say?

                    TRUSTEE #3
          No pill for you!

                    BILLY
          I NEED these pills--

Trustee #4 shouts in Thai again.
                                                          32.


                    TRUSTEE #3
          --He say you go now!

Billy, rattlesnake strike, grabs Trustee #3's head and slams
it into the wall -- plaster splits -- startling us. Billy
snaps a hard right-left across #3's snout, blood sprays.

And all hell breaks loose.

Prisoners yell and scatter. Trustee #3 screams, cups his
nose, gushing. Trustee #4 and another, #5, grapple with Billy.

                    BILLY
              (to Trustees)
          GET OFF! GET FUCKIN' OFF ME!

Billy breaks loose and sinks his TEETH into #4's throat.
Blood spurts, #4 howls. Billy bites down even harder. Even by
his own brutal standards, it's shocking.

Trustee #5 chops away at Billy's head, who takes the pain.
Trustee #4 collapses. Billy hurls Trustee #5 to the floor.

A WHISTLE blows in the distance. Blood is everywhere: On
Billy's clothes/face/mouth. He looks at the injured Trustees,
smiles bloody teeth, crazed and raises both middle fingers.

                    BILLY
          Three on one, shitbags!

Black Dildo grabs Billy and restrains him in a rear/jaw
headlock.

                    BLACK DILDO
          STOP! CALM DOWN! NO MORE!

Billy, straining with anger, in Black Dildo's grip. A DOZEN
MORE TRUSTEES arrive with BATONS shouting in Thai.

                    BILLY
          Okay! Alright, Dildo. I'm calm. I'm
          calmed down.

The Trustees w/batons look at the Trustees that are injured.
They see the blood, then the bite marks.

Trustee #6 turns to Billy and grins.

                    TRUSTEE #6
          Hey, farang. You no good boxer.
          Fight very bad.
                                                                33.


     Billy, ADRENALINE SURGE at the insult -- SCREAMS and breaks
     loose again, charging Trustee #6. The other Trustees knock
     Billy down with their batons and bury him.

67   EXT. CONTROL SECTION - AFTER - ON THE DOOR                       67

     it slams open. Two TRUSTEES throw Billy on his face, like a
     sack of raw meat. Trustees go back inside...

     Billy rolls to his back, leaving a blood mask on the ground.

     Billy lies there...bloody and swollen. Eyes, purple slits.
     The sun beating down on him, flies nipping at him, barely
     able to breathe...

     Then, a YOUNG WOMAN approaches, blocking out the sun. Early
     20's. A paige-boy hair cut. We see her in SILHOUETTE...

                         BILLY
                   (barely a whisper)
               ...help me...

     The Woman gently dabs Billy's wounds with a wet rag, cleaning
     the blood. When she leans closer, her FACE comes into light.

     Her name is JOM.

     And she's a man...in bright red lipstick.

                           JOM
               You okay?

     Billy isn't.

                         JOM
               Face look very bad.

     Billy blinks.

                         JOM
               No worry now. Me name Jom. I help
               you.

     Jom sits Billy up, continuing to nurse him. After a moment,
     she helps Billy get to his feet.

     Billy holds onto Jom for support...step-by-painful-step,
     slowly making their way toward a looming ADMIN. BUILDING in
     the center of this fenced-in compound.

     Suddenly GUARDS #1 and #2 arrive, and shout at Jom in Thai.

     Jom shouts back. Arguing ensues. She's protecting Billy.
                                                                34.


     Guards roughly grab Jom and throw her aside.

     Billy collapses again.

68   INT. ADMIN BUILDING: CHAIN ROOM - DAY, LATER - AS A HAMMER       68
     SWINGS DOWN

     onto an iron cuff, around Billy's ankle. WIDEN. And Billy's
     leg is set on an anvil. A BLACKSMITH hammers a bolt through
     the clasp.

     Officer Pi Sit stands by with the Guards.

     Blacksmith hammers ANOTHER CUFF around Billy's ankle, then
     runs two ENORMOUS 6 KG CHAINS between shackles...

     Billy stands, bound, shackled...his swollen eyes, defiant.

     Officer Pi Sit signals to the Guards and Blacksmith to leave.

     Then, Officer Pi Sit exhales heavily, glares at Billy...

                         OFFICER PI SIT
               Why are you so fucked up?

     Billy says nothing, inwardly tense.

                         OFFICER PI SIT
               Disappoint me, William Moore. Fight
               like mad dog, no good. Must be same-
               same like Buddha.

     Billy is silent. Officer Pi Sit slowly circles him...

                         OFFICER PI SIT
               You say you are "boxer."

                         BILLY

               Are you sayin' I'm not?

                         OFFICER PI SIT
               Why you need drugs?

                         BILLY
               Who said I "need" it?

     Pi Sit stops. Stares. Cold.

     Billy stands there. All his failures, like shrapnel, moving
     through his heart...
                                                             35.

               When I use, I don't hear it.

     Pi Sit looks at Billy: sees the hard miles in his eyes. The
     pain in his voice.

                         OFFICER PI SIT
               If you want fight, you should fight
               in the ring. But you must deserve
               it.

     Billy is silent;

                         OFFICER PI SIT
               Behave, William Moore. Chi yeng
               yeng...and maybe real fighters can
               teach you something.

                         BILLY
               ...I can't box with chains on...

                         OFFICER PI SIT
               For three months, get used to it.


69   EXT. CONTROL SECTION - HOURS LATER - BILLY                     69

     waits alone, chained and shackled, seated against a wall. In
     the b.g., two LADY-BOYS (MAY and CHAR) give massages to a
     pair of Guards on a shaded veranda of the Admin. buiding.

     Now, Jom approaches Billy...

                         JOM
               So you like fight?

     Billy is quiet, morose.

                         JOM
               -- Officer Pi Sit, good man. He
               protect us.
                   (leans in close to Billy)
               And now, he try and protect you...

     Billy is silent. He touches his lip: it still bleeds.

                         JOM
               Here, I feel safe. I go outside

     A BEAT.

     Billy just stares at her, unsure what to say.

                          JOM
               I spend next thirty-five years of

     Billy is silent.

                         JOM
                   (smiles)
               Do you have girlfriend in prison?

     Just then, two Trustees arrive to escort Billy from the
     compound. He struggles to rise, chains rattling...glancing
     back once at Jom as he leaves...


70   EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAY, LATER - BILLY                      70

     walks with great difficulty through the yard, flanked by
     Trustees. The iron cuffs cutting into Billy's ankles...step
     by step...

     A few Samurai hang around...Billy keeps walking.

71   INT. SECTOR 5 CELL - LATE NIGHT - BILLY + KIAW                  71

     face to face, both high, smoking heroin, lying under blankets
     to avoid being seen by Guards.

     The effects of the drug hit Billy hard. He crawls out of the
     blanket amidst a plume of SMOKE. Slumps back against a wall,
     sweating, heart pounding, eyes/lungs burning...

     Thru Billy's haze he/we see/hear...a Thai pop-music video
     playing on a small tv, sealed to the wall...Fans whirring...
     Kiaw's lighter sparking under a blanket...Smoke and heat
     rising...

     Then, cell boss, Keng, sits up and signals to other Samurai.
     One by one, three then four then five get up, and quietly
     scale over other prisoners sleeping...making their way toward
     the Young Thai inmate (we saw initiated earlier).
                                                                37.


     Billy stares, unsure what's happening.

     Suddenly, Keng and five Samurai throw themselves onto the
     Young Thai, cover his mouth and rape him.

     Billy tries to move. Can't. The attack's silent. Terrifying,
     AIDS infecting. The Thai pop-song keeps playing...

72   EXT. OUTDOOR KITCHEN: PRISON COURTYARD - MORNING - COOKS         72

     crack eggs, scramble, pour, flip and fold them. The stoves
     are electric. PRISONERS wait in line for omelets, then move
     to a gallery of lawn chairs and eat.

     BILLY + KIAW
     sit on buckets, using toothbrushes to scrub their ankles
     beneath their shackles. Their eyes are hollow, black circles
     from weeks of abuse. Track marks visible.

     Billy scrubs roughly...His ankle starts to bleed. He keeps
     scrubbing.

     Suddenly the sound of HUNDREDS OF PRISONERS WHISTLING, making
     CAT-CALLS in Thai. Billy and Kiaw look up --

     Jom -- in a long wig and makeup -- is being escorted through
     the yard by TRUSTEES. She swings her hips with exaggerated
     sexiness, like a peacock flaunting it's feathers.

     Billy is surprised at how attractive she looks.

     Jom sees Billy, waves and calls out to him:

                          JOM
               Hey, farang ba! You think me
               beautiful?

     Billy just watches. No words.

     Jom enters a shop with an encaged window for protection. The
     Trustees lock her in. Ready for business...

73   EXT. PRISON SHOP AREA: COURTYARD - DAY - BILLY                   73

     is trying to find cigarettes from one of the shops and stands.
     It's loud, unruly: DOZENS OF PRISONERS all bargaining,
     arguing, shoving at once.

     Billy gestures over the noise. Every SHOP OWNER refuses him.

     ANGLE, JOM
     behind the counter of a CAGED-IN SHOP. She's selling
     cigarettes, toiletries, coffee, homemade Valentine cards, etc,
     along with May and Char.
                                                        38.


Deep in the crowd, Jom sees Billy -- frustrated, vulnerable.
Billy notices Jom watching, and works his way toward her.

                    JOM
              (smiles, flirtatious)
          Hello. How I can help you?

Billy, getting bumped on all sides, tries to hold ground.

                    BILLY
          ...cigarettes...

                    JOM
          Five dollar.

                    BILLY
              (pause, low)
          Can I buy `em on credit?

Jom looks at him.

                     BILLY
               (lying)
          -- I'm expecting some cash from me
          mum.

Jom regards him, then opens her ACCOUNT BOOK.

                    BILLY
          William Moore.

                       JOM
          I know...

She writes down Billy's name with a baht amount.

                    JOM
          I give you fifty dollar credit. Pay
          me back when you can?

Billy nods, embarrassed.

Jom slides him a CARTON OF CIGARETTES.

                    BILLY
              (pause, then)
          -- I never thanked you for fixin'
          me head. So...

Billy nods "thanks."

                    JOM
          You want, I can be your sexy
          girlfriend...
                                                             39.


     Billy's uncomfortable. VERY uncomfortable. So Jom just smiles
     and then he leaves. Jom watches him go.


74   EXT. SECTOR 5 CELL - NIGHT - BILLY                              74

     and a THIN SAMURAI trade cigarettes for straws of heroin.

75   LATER - BILLY                                                   75

     is hunched under a blanket. He cuts two lines of heroin on a
     bucket. Billy SNORTS one line, quickly switches nostrils,
     SNIFFS the other, both barrels.

     Billy's eyes press shut, to ESCAPE, for a moment. SILENCE...
     precious silence...

     Billy lifts an edge of the blanket, peers out: Thin Samurai
     sits there, smoking a cigarette, watching him.

     AMBIENT SOUND/REALITY...SELF-HATRED comes back;

     Thin Samurai smiles, puts the cigarette out on his tongue.
     Then he eats it.

     Billy just looks at him. Then --

     REVEAL NOW, across the cell...the YOUNG SAMURAI w/tattooed
     hands. His head is bowed as Keng uses the CROOKED KNIFE we
     saw earlier to shave Young Samurai's scalp...Slowly,
     methodically...hair falls in bits, revealing Young Samurai's
     scalp is full tattooed with the image of a DRAGON.

     Billy watches this ritual, nightmarish and surreal --


76   I/E. SECTOR 5 CELL - DAWN - BILLY                               76

     is alone at the bars. Arms slung over the crossbars, smoking
     a cigarette. Quiet, sullen.

     It's DAWN - faint Buddhist and Muslim CHANTING O.C.

     Kiaw hides a handful of heroin straws in a SHAMPOO BOTTLE.
     Billy notices. Kiaw looks at him, smiles.

     Billy picks up the carton of cigarettes. Only one pack left.
     When he opens it, he finds a small NOTE tucked inside between
     cigarettes. Billy mumbles low, as he reads --

                          BILLY
                   (to himself)
               "Hi Billy.
                          (MORE)
                                                               40.

                         BILLY (CONT'D)
               You missing me, yes or no?...I want
               you be a good man for me, Billy. I
               can be a good person for you
               too...Can't say love now, but when
               everything okay, you will be the
               one, my boyfriend."

     At the bottom of the note, a lipstick mark. Signed: "Jom"

     Billy's jaw tenses. Silent. Disturbed.

     Then, we hear the sound of MEN RUNNING. A lot of men. Billy
     looks up: THE MUAY THAI BOXING TEAM is doing wind sprints in
     the yard. Back and forth, powerful as horses, no one out
     there but them.

     Billy watches. One man coaching, looks up: NAN, smoking a
     cigarette. Eyes meet.

     And as the team keeps running...

     The chanting grows louder... Louder... Fearful... CUT TO:

                                                           BLACK.

     A LOUD SIREN SCREAMS ACROSS THE PRISON GROUNDS......

77   INT. SECTOR FIVE CELL - LATE NIGHT - BILLY                      77

     and all his cellmates bolt up. Billy looks at Kiaw:

                         KIAW
               Someone killed...

                                                     SMASH TO:

78   EXT. PRISON WALKWAY - LATE NIGHT - MOVING SHOT: ELYIAS          78

     lies mortally wounded -- the CROOKED SAMURAI KNIFE plunged
     into his chest, as Trustees quickly push him on a cart to--

79   THE COURTYARD                                                   79

     where Officer Pi Sit + Guards have also found the corpses of
     Trustees #1 + #2, blood sodden, knife wounds bleeding out.

     Guards HEAVE the corpses onto PUSHCARTS. An ENRAGED Officer
     Pi Sit shouts in Thai at Guards and Trustees, and we--

                                                     SMASH TO:
80   PRISON RAID SEQUENCE                                            80

     GUARDS
                                                                41.


     in riot gear -- move FAST and LOUD, charging into cells with
     batons, flashlights and DOGS -- shouting rapid-fire Thai as --

     PRISONERS

     are violently grabbed, yanked out -- Their cells are
     ransacked -- bedding and pillows ripped apart -- bins dumped
     over -- false bottoms kicked out...sifting, searching...


81   INT. SECTOR 5 CELL - THAT MOMENT - BILLY                         81

     peers through the bars to get a glimpse of what's happening.

     We HEAR distant mayhem. Batons hitting flesh. Men screaming
     insanely.

     Billy turns to see all of the Samurai sitting in silence.
     Cross-legged, waiting. Only Keng looks at Billy...and
     gestures for him to stay quiet.

     The sound of beatings/screaming intensifies as the raid gets
     closer to their cell.

     Billy tries to swallow his fear, but it's impossible.

     We begin hearing FOOTSTEPS somewhere. Lots of them. Coming
     hard and fast. HEAVY KEYS jangling.

     Billy steps back.

     He blinks.

                                   CUT TO BLACK/THEN ABRUPT TO:

82   THAT MOMENT - GUARDS                                             82

     crash in. So fast, so frightening, giving us only glimpses --

     BILLY + KIAW
     and other Samurai are roughly grabbed and thrown in line.

     A few Samurai protest/spit back -- Dogs bark and bite them --
     Guards kick and punch them -- smashing batons across Samurai
     bare backs with relentless force.

     Billy sees another Samurai being dragged out by the hair.

     Contraband hits the floor: cell phones, chargers, pocket
     knives, spikes, shivs, drug paraphernalia, porn mags;

     Guards keep shouting -- Terrified prisoners are marched along
     landings -- down stairs -- Billy and Kiaw among them....
                                                             42.


     Chaos everywhere, impossibly violent. Then;

83   EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - PRE DAWN - BILLY + KIAW +              83

     the ENTIRE PRISONER POPULATION stand in rows, nude, their
     clothes on the ground. For Billy, and those in shackles,
     their shorts/underwear are pulled to their ankles.

     SILENCE IS DEAFENING. BRIGHT LIGHTS FLOOD THE YARD.

     GUARDS body-search the prisoners one by one, then search
     their clothes. The dead bodies of Elyias, Trustees #1 + #2
     displayed for all to see.

     Billy sees Nan and the Boxing Team amongst prisoners, also
     nude. Nan doesn't notice Billy.

     Then, TRUSTEES push Jom, May and Char to a distant corner,
     wearing bras and panties. For the first time, we see Jom
     without any makeup on.

     She looks at Billy, his pale, naked body amongst tattooed
     Samurai. Jom stares...Billy looks away...it's awkward.

     OFFICER PI SIT
     walks the line, tapping his baton against his leg, scanning
     prisoners' faces, a cold anger in his eyes...

     A paranoid Kiaw VERY SUBTLY kicks his shirt on the ground in
     front of Billy...but Billy doesn't notice.

     The Guards are getting closer, roughly searching prisoners
     and their clothes.

     THEN Bull Guard arrives/searches Billy: mouth, ears, feet,
     balls, armpits, ass.

     Bull Guard grabs Kiaw's shirt off the ground (thinking they
     are Billy's). Billy SEES they aren't his...

     Bull Guard folds back the seam of Kiaw's shirt: REVEALING A
     HIDDEN POCKET stitched inside.

     Billy glances at Kiaw in disbelief...Kiaw just stares ahead.

     Bull Guard rips the pocket out, finds: STRAWS OF HEROIN --
     then shouts in Thai to Officer Pi Sit.

     Officer Pi Sit walks over. Takes the heroin. Bites open one
     straw, tastes the powder.

     Officer Pi Sit glares at Billy.
                                                              43.


                          BILLY
                Those aren't mine.

     Kiaw says something in Thai. Bull Guard shouts angrily back.
     Kiaw talks/gestures to Billy -- says the heroin is his;

     Billy shakes his head "no," frantic, terror stricken. Officer
     Pi Sit just keeps staring at him.

     As Bull Guard shouts in Thai, Billy snatches the shirt from
     his hands and tries to put it on.

     Too small. Doesn't fit. A SLEEVE rips, then hangs off.

     Bull Guard goes silent. Officer Pi Sit looks at Billy and
     Kiaw. A VERY SCARY, VERY INTENSE MOMENT.....

     Officer Pi Sit turns, signals sharply to the Trustees.

     IN A FLASH, the Trustees grab Kiaw and fiercely hurry him out
     of the yard.

     Kiaw protests, frantic-- as Billy watches, shackled, still.

     Trustees wrestle Kiaw to an upstairs office and shut the door.

     There's a sudden SQUALL OF FEEDBACK over the LOUD SPEAKERS,
     followed by SOUNDS of footsteps scuffling -- A door being
     slammed -- A chair being dragged -- Kiaw being interrogated --

     IT GOES ON AND ON FOR A FEW SECONDS, THEN JUST STOPS.

     SILENCE.

     Then the SCREAMING begins.

     Billy and the prisoners are frozen, listening to the SOUND OF
     KIAW'S BLOOD-CHILLING SCREAMS as TRUSTEES SAVAGELY BEAT HIM
     WITH BATONS.

84   I/E. - VARIOUS P.A. SPEAKERS + PRISON LOCATIONS - THAT MOMENT 84

     The beating/screams/sobs broadcast across the entire prison.

85   EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - BILLY + PRISONERS                        85

     all staring at the speakers: NOBODY MOVES, NOBODY SPEAKS.

     HOLD ON BILLY, this just awful moment.
                                                       CUT TO:
                                                             44.


86   INT. LARGE ANTECHAMBER - DAY                                    86

     A rather dark room, or lobby, filled with inmates lounging
     and smoking cigarettes. Billy is high, among them.

     The antechamber is connected to a small cell. And behind
     those bars: a dressed up Jom is singing Karaoke. May and Char
     sing back-up, lyrics roll on a shitty tv, as Jom sings into a
     microphone. It's a slow, very seductive Thai BALLAD...

     BILLY
     his eyes glazed, watching Jom through the smoke...as do all
     the other inmates. The room pulses slowly. Billy is totally
     captivated by Jom's singing and stares without blinking.

     Jom looks right at Billy, as if singing just for him. With
     the effects of the drugs -- DREAMLIKE, SURREAL -- Jom becomes
     emotional as she sings, appearing like a star...an angel...

     For Billy, forgetting the prison surroundings for just this
     moment, he's trancelike...mesmerized...as if he and Jom are
     alone. Even the cell bars disappear;

     When the song ends, Billy continues watching Jom and everyone
     else loudly APPLAUDS.

87   EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAYS LATER, MORNING - WIDE              87

     The usual chaos and activity. We hear a TRUSTEE'S VOICE over
     the loudspeaker:

                         TRUSTEE'S VOICE
               William Moore, yat yeim...William
               Moore, yat yeim

     No sign of Billy. Instead, he --

88   INT. SECTOR 5 CELL - MORNING - BILLY                            88

     lies inert on his blanket, alone in the cell. A shirt covers
     his face. Kiaw's shampoo bottle is open, empty, next to him.

     BULL GUARD
     stands over, puts a boot on Billy's chest. No response. He
     yanks the shirt off Billy's face.

     Billy's mouth is wide, eyes rolled back. Looks like a corpse.

     Bull Guard lifts Billy's head, shakes it. Then harder. Billy
     is totally limp.

     Bull Guard gives him a VIOLENT KICK to the ribs. Billy's eyes
     snap back in place. He wakes up, as if from a coma.
                                                              45.


     Bull Guard shouts something in Thai.

     Billy doesn't get up, zombie-like.

     Bull Guard yanks him to his feet, throws a sky-blue uniform
     shirt on him, and drags him out of the cell.

89   INT. VISITING AREA - MORNING - BILLY                            89

     is dragged in by Bull Guard, chains jangling. He's dumped
     onto a stool before a STEEL MESH PARTITION.

     Billy almost falls over. Bull Guard sits him up straight.
     Billy is badly disheveled, bloodshot eyes, grey skin,
     unshaven, beyond high. To his left and right, PRISONERS shout
     back and forth to VISITORS on the opposite side -- ten feet
     apart -- divided by bars/mesh. A BABY cries. It's madness.
     Like talking across a freeway.

     BILLY'S POV swims for a moment to an OUT OF FOCUS VISITOR
     seated on the other side of the mesh...

     As Billy blinks, strains to see, the Visitor comes INTO FOCUS
     revealing: NINDAM (the young boy from the opening scene.)

     He stares at Billy in shock. Shock of his decay. Shock of time
     gone by.

     Billy looking back, his bloodshot eyes moving down to:

     BILLY'S POV -- NINDAM'S HANDS, holding a small TROPHY. He
     grips it nervously, speaking slow and distinct; unsure if
     Billy understands:

                         NINDAM
               ...Billy...you hear me?

     Billy's mouth moves: no words come out.

                         NINDAM
               I win tournament. In Bangkok. Muay
               Thai, number one.

     Billy tries to respond. Strains to focus...Can't.

     Then, Nindam sadly sets an OLD GYM BAG on the divider:
     Billy's gym bag.

                         NINDAM
               This from gym locker. We wait long
               time. Can no more keep for you...
                   (upset)
               Sorry.
                                                               46.


     Billy clenches his jaw-- a flood of emotion roils inside him.

     Nindam FEELS it too, trying to be brave...

                         NINDAM
               Next time I fight...when you leave
               here, me want you walk me to ring.

     Billy tries to smile. It falls quickly;

                         NINDAM
                   (low, tears welling now)
               ...bye, Billy...

     Billy nods -- fighting back tears. Nindam, staring at him.
     Then quietly, as if whispering a prayer...

                         BILLY
               bye.

     As Billy stands, Bull Guard searches him, checks his chains.
     Nindam watches desperately.

     After a moment, Billy turns back to look at Nindam...

     ...He's gone.

     Billy, seeing it...feeling every fucking bit of it...

                                                         CUT TO:


90   INT. SECTOR 5 CELL - MORNING, WEEKS LATER - BILLY               90

     Time has passed. He sits alone, clean shaven, writing a
     letter in pencil.

     We see GLIMPSES of his crude, childlike handwriting:

     "...I know how difficult this is...""...I made a mistake..."
     "...no one to blame but myself..."

91   INT. CHAIN ROOM - DAY - BILLY                                   91

     is having his chains removed by the Blacksmith. Officer Pi
     Sit stands nearby with Bull Guard;

     After the shackles are pried off, Billy stretches his legs.
     The lack of weight is relieving.

     Bull Guard signals Billy to sit on the floor.

     He does, then;
                                                        47.

          I want to fight.

                    OFFICER PI SIT
          You already did that.

                    BILLY
          I mean with the team. I need to
          fight...

Officer Pi Sit stares.

                    BILLY
          You understand me.

BEAT.

                    OFFICER PI SIT
          It's you who no understand.
              (off Billy's look)
          Boxing come with good behavior,
          long time. We have prison
          tournament each year, government
          allowed. A chance for boxers at
          life, privilege...and honor.
              (pause)
          You've earned nothing, William
          Moore.

                    BILLY
          So let me fight. I need it to
          change. That's something...

                       OFFICER PI SIT
          No.

BEAT;

Billy reaches into his pocket, pulls out a folded addressed
envelope.

                    BILLY
          Will you mail this?

Pi Sit doesn't move.

                    BILLY
          It's for me mum.

Pi Sit takes the envelope. Then he pulls out a SWITCHBLADE
and swiftly cuts the envelope open.
                                                             48.


     Billy watches, uncomfortable, as Pi Sit reads the letter
     inside. After a silence, he nods to Billy that he'll mail it.

                                                       CUT TO:

92   EXT. SHOP AREA - ANOTHER DAY - JOM                              92

     is working, selling. She wears a tight t-shirt that says,
     "GUILTY" across the front. Muscular Trustee stands sentry.

     BILLY
     without his chains, approaches the shop and Jom smiles, bats
     her eyelashes.

                         JOM
               Hi, Billy! Missed you!
                   (off Billy's look--)
               Long time, I thought you got
               released...

                         BILLY
               I, uh...I need cigarettes. A lot of
               `em.

                         JOM
               You need for drugs?

     Billy looks at Muscular Trustee.

                         JOM
                   (smiles)
               Relax. He no speak English.

                         BILLY
               -- No, it's not for that. Not this
               time.

     Billy's hand is on the counter. Jom watches his expression as
     she reaches through the bars, slowly...and lays her hand on
     his. The tips of her fingers brush Billy's scarred knuckles,
     lightly back and forth.

     He's uncomfortable, and slides his hand back.

                         BILLY
               I can pay you back. I mean, I will.

     They look at each other for a moment, then...

                         JOM
               I believe you.

     She gives him a CARTON OF CIGARETTES, then discreetly hands
     him another LOVE NOTE. Billy pockets it.
                                                                49.

93   EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - RIGHT AFTER - MOVING WITH BILLY          93

     through the heat and congested yard. He grips the cigarette
     carton in one hand, his old gym bag in the other.

     He pulls Jom's note from his pocket, throws it away without
     reading it.

     Then Billy looks, walks with steely determination toward --

94   E/I. THE PRISON BOXING GYM                                       94

     -- and reaches for the gate. From inside, a BAMBOO STICK
     comes down hard. Billy yanks his hand back...It's Nan.

                         BILLY
               You speak English?

                         NAN
                   (stares; then)
               ...Some.

     Billy holds up the carton of cigarettes. Says intensely:

                         BILLY
               Let me train, and they're yours.

     BEAT. HOLD. THEN:

     Nan draws back the gate. Takes the cigarettes. Billy enters.


95   INSIDE THE GYM - MOMENTS AFTER - TWENTY BOXERS                   95

     work out. It's very loud. Desk Guard in the corner.

     BILLY
     stands ringside, and wraps his own hands. Nan lights a
     cigarette and watches as Billy pulls a small jar of Vaseline
     from his gym bag and greases up his face, then inserts his
     old mouthpiece and bites down. Last, he pulls out his old
     boxing gloves (worn in, blood-stained).

     Billy puts them on, looks to Nan to lace them.

     As Nan laces Billy's gloves, he sees the SCARS on Billy's arm
     and looks at him. Billy says nothing. Nan finishes tying the
     gloves.

     Billy climbs into the ring, THROUGH the ropes...and waits.
                                                        50.


Nan looks around the gym at all the BOXERS training. He
gestures to one: LEK (20's) -- lean, tattooed, much smaller
than Billy -- to get in the ring.

Billy, dead staring, watches as Lek steps OVER the ropes and
moves to a corner...

There's a moment. A LONG one.

                    NAN
          Chok!(fight)

Billy charges out fast. Lek feels his aggression and starts
to circle.

Billy attacks and Lek nails him with a front kick to the
chest. Billy takes it, then fires a punch. Blocked. A leg
kick. Blocked. Lek snaps Billy's head back with a jab. Then
again. And again.

Then a HUGE KICK to the jaw -- THAT HITS WITH THE IMPACT OF A
TRUCK -- Billy goes down in a heap.

He shakes it off, clears his head. Other Boxers stop what
they're doing and watch as Billy picks himself up, fire in
his eyes...and goes after Lek with a vengeance --

Within moments, Lek is throwing and battering Billy like a
rag doll. Pounding him at will, with solid PUNCHES and KICKS
that knock Billy to the canvas over and over.

Billy keeps getting up...But the harder he retaliates, the
harder he gets hurt.

Nan, ringside, stoically smokes cigarettes, as --

Finally, Lek grabs the back of Billy's head, hauls it down
and launches knee after knee after knee into Billy's ribs.

Billy goes down hard. He slowly gets up. Balance wavers. Then
he turns and VOMITS over the top rope;

Humiliated.

Nan nods to Lek, who then exits the ring.

Billy looks up at all the Boxers talking in Thai, joking and
laughing about Billy.

He exits the ring...Nan removes the gloves, saying nothing.

An assistant trainer, TANE (45) approaches with a MOP and
BUCKET on wheels. He points to Billy's puke with disdain.
                                                                 51.


      Billy mops the floor.

      The Boxers resume training.

      When Billy finishes, he shoves the gate back, and leaves.

      bucket, stabbing it repeatedly with a bike cog.

97    TIMECUT. Billy sits alone against concrete, holding ice          97
      wrapped in a towel against his face. His head is throbbing,
      ribs and legs hideously bruised and swollen...

      He takes the ice pack off, revealing bad facial damage: Black
      eyes, forehead knotted with welts. Dried blood in his nose.
      He runs a finger inside his mouth, spits blood on the ground.

      Billy sets the ice-pack on the back of his neck, and hangs
      his head. A portrait of abject loneliness.

      yells his number: "paet" -- Bull Guard SEES Billy's welts and
      bruises and calls a halt to the count.

      Bull Guard shouts something in Thai at Billy.

      Billy doesn't understand;

      Bull Guard then shouts at Keng and a few others in Thai ("Who
      fucked this guy up?! He looks like shit, who did this?!")

      The Samurai all deny it.

      Bull Guard storms out.

      The Samurai glare at Billy...a VERY uncomfortable tension.

      Billy watches the boxers hitting bags, mitts, skipping ropes,
      sparring, getting massages, etc.

      They all ignore him;

      Lek is pounding a heavy bag. He stops and looks at Billy.

      Lek smiles, nods...Billy nods back. There's a mutual respect
      in this exchange.

      Billy jumps rope. His legs are sore. Feet get tangled.

      Billy's slow on the heavy bag. Sweats profusely, breathing
      hard. Skills/body gone dormant from drugs.

      Billy does sit-ups hanging off a bench. Grimaces thru a set.
      No one holds his legs.

      Billy shadowboxes before a large mirror. He watches the other
      boxers, and tries to emulate their movements...

      ...then, Billy sees his own reflection: the face/body of a
      drug addict. Inward/outward decay.

      Billy can't look at himself.

      thrashing...scales and blood floating...

      All the Samurai scream/shout, push/shove. Billy is nervous,
      hoping his fish will win.

      It does.

      He exhales. Some Samurai cheer, others are mad. Cigarettes
      wildly exchange. Billy doesn't get his.

      He points to the fish he bet on. Samurai refuse to pay. More
      shoving and shouting. Billy shoves back;

                You don't need to send me no more
                love letters.

      Jom's smile falls.

                          BILLY
                I can't be your boyfriend. I just
                can't...and never will be. Thanks
                anyway.

      Jom's eyes well up.

      Billy walks away...

                                                           CUT TO:

112   INT. PRISON BOXING GYM: RING - ANOTHER DAY - BILLY              112

      is in line behind three other Boxers in the ring. Across from
      them, stands a ripped powerful fighter: PON (28).

      One at a time, each Boxer challenges Pon to grappling combat,
      until one of them is thrown to the floor.

      Billy watches as Pon destroys each opponent with astonishing
      speed and strength.

      Then, it's Billy's turn.

      Pon grins and waves him forth.

      Billy moves in and --

      PON + BILLY
      slam into a clinch. Working hard, Billy takes the brunt of
      the pain. He pushes Pon, the stronger man, toward the
      ropes...They grapple aggressively. Then, Pon picks up Billy
      and tosses him 180 degrees with his power.

      Billy hits the canvas like a rag doll. Stunned.

      Pon just laughs...He's extremely dangerous.

                                                           CUT TO:

113   EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAWN - BILLY                            113

      waits alone with a Trustee in the empty yard. Eyes bleary,
      Billy just woke up.
                                                                 57.


      THE BOXING TEAM jogs past. Billy watches them go...Then,
      Trustee gestures that Billy's allowed to join;

      Billy hesitates, then starts to jog...and falls in line...

      MOVING WITH THEM

      through different SECTORS of the empty prison. Some shadowbox
      while running.

      Billy struggles to keep pace, huffing and puffing. But then
      he realizes...he's jogging through areas of the prison that
      he's never seen...

      Streaks of dawn light the sky. Cool morning air. For Billy,
      he feels ALIVE...and smiles.


114   INT. PRISON GYM: RING - DAY - BILLY                              114

      is hitting the pads as Tane holds them. Billy fires fist/shin
      combos. Hard shots resound. Sweat pours off Billy ...his
      skill clearly improving.

      Nan stands at the ropes, giving instructions.

      THE BUZZER SOUNDS. Billy paces the gym, dripping sweat, hard
      breathing. He suddenly FREEZES....

      OFFICER PI SIT

      is in the gym. Two GUARDS with him. They stare at Billy.
      IMMEDIATE TENSION.

                          OFFICER PI SIT
                Why you here?

                          BILLY
                ...

                          OFFICER PI SIT
                I warned you. Made very clear, you
                must earn this. And how you do
                that? By defying me--?

                          BILLY
                    (low, sincere)
                I have earned this.

      Officer Pi Sit says something in Thai to the Guards. Then
      turns to Billy:
                                                        58.


                    OFFICER PI SIT
          You will be punished for a month.
          Whole cell will be punished too.

One Guard pulls out shackles. The other, a baton.

Billy sighs and exits the ring. The Guards remove his gloves.
Nan just watching, then...

...As Officer Pi Sit angrily walks over to the Desk Guard,
talks firm, Nan walks over and talks to Pi Sit in private.

The Guards roughly cut off Billy's handwraps as he watches
Nan and Officer Pi Sit talk in the distance.

WE/BILLY CANNOT HEAR WHAT THEY'RE SAYING OVER THE ROAR OF
BOXERS HITTING BAGS, MITTS, PADS, ETC. Billy just watching,
several tense moments...

...then Officer Pi Sit walks back to Billy. A BEAT, THEN:

                    OFFICER PI SIT
              (firm, still angry)
          I give you one chance: You will
          fight at Songkran.

Billy lets out a deep breath, nods.

                      BILLY
          thanks.

As Officer and Pi Sit and Guards start to leave --

                    BILLY
          Who am I fightin'?

                    OFFICER PI SIT
              (keeps walking)
          Could be yourself.

Nan joins Billy.

                    NAN
          You know what is Songkran?

                      BILLY
          No.

                    NAN
          Thai New Year. In three weeks: all
          prison celebrates...Boxers fight to
          qualify for National tournament.

Off Billy's look --
                                                                 59.


115   INT. PRISON BOXING GYM - WEEKS LATER - PON                       115

      is on a scale. All the Boxers are checking their weights for
      Songkran. The gym is crowded with Guards and Officer Pi Sit,
      who supervises.

      Outside the gym gate: DOZENS OF PRISONERS have gathered to
      watch, deciding who they'll bet on. Among them, are the
      SAMURAI.

      Pon makes weight: 175

      Next, Billy steps on. Pi Sit leans in to read Billy's weight:
      210 lbs. (about 35 lbs overweight)

                          BILLY
                The fuck? Is the scale broke?

      Billy looks down: Someone else's foot is on the scale: Pon.
      He grins, malevolent.

      Billy heels Pon's leg off.

      Officer Pi Sit watches without expression.

      On the verge of erupting...Billy gets off the scale, Nan
      resets, and Billy gets back on.

      Pon inches up behind...blows in Billy's ear, then whispers
      something we can't hear.

      Billy makes weight: 175

      Then, he reels and throws a punch that doesn't land, because
      they're separated. Shouting. Pushing. The entire team now,
      the Guards-- CUT OUT;

116   EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAY - PRISONERS                          116

      celebrate. The yard is alive with festivities. Carnivalesque.

      ON STAGE, with A LADY-BOY BAND, Black Dildo wears a long wig,
      performs a romantic Thai song.

      Prisoners and Guards are mixing, eating, dancing to music,
      throwing water in all directions and laughing. Everyone in
      high spirits...

      OUT OF THE DARKNESS OF THE GYM, Billy and the boxing team
      emerge, carrying the RING out to the sunlit yard, where they
      set it down. THE SOUND OF A CELEBRATION FILLS THE AIR....

      Billy stand with Lek, watching, in disbelief.
                                                                 60.


      Then, a prisoner runs by and hurls A BUCKET OF WATER on
      Billy. He's soaked, freezing. Lek starts laughing, as--

      ANGLE, THE BUDDHA STATUE
      Two Prisoners on stools pour flowered water over it, as
      others pray, light incense and candles.

      A LINE OF BUDDHIST MONKS
      young and old, in bright orange robes, move through the yard,
      as the far as the eye can see.

      Billy SEES Prisoners and Guards flock to the Monks, kneeling,
      making offerings of fruit and ornaments.

      In return, the Monks give blessings, sprinkling sacred water
      with a stick on the prisoners' hands and faces...

      ANGLE, A YOUNG MONK
      that summons Billy forth.

      Billy hesitates, then steps closer. The Young Monk smiles and
      applies the sprinkles Billy's face. He doesn't know what it
      means. Doesn't need to. It feels peaceful. AND AS MUSIC
      CARRIES OVER...for the first time, Billy smiles.

      WIDEN. THE WHOLE YARD IS CELEBRATING. Only the ring is empty.
      Then, Black Dildo voice booms over the microphone:

                          BLACK DILDO
                Lady-boys and gentlemen, iiiiittt's
                FIGHT TIME!!

                                                      SMASH TO:

117   EXT. RING - DAY - LEK                                            117

      is fighting THAI BOXER #2. They trade shots. Then, a HUGE
      PUNCH from Lek CRASHES HARD into Thai Boxer #2's head -- AND
      HE FALLS FACE DOWN ON THE CANVAS, EYES WIDE, KNOCKED OUT.

      THE CROWD GOES CRAZY.

      Billy stands outside the ring, gloves on, just inches from
      the ko'd boxer's face.

      We SEE the FEAR on Billy's face.

      As the REFEREE (a Guard) tries to revive him, he sharply
      signals to Billy that he fights next.

      Lek exits the ring, pats Billy's shoulder and smiles,
      encouraging him.
                                                                61.


      Billy swallows, then climbs the steps to the ring, and we --

                                                   TIMECUT/SMASH TO:

118   EXT. RING - BETWEEN ROUNDS, PON'S CORNER - PON                   118

      sits as Tane and another CORNERMAN shout advice fast/loud in
      Thai, over the noise of the crowd. As--

119   BILLY'S CORNER - A WHITE TOWEL                                   119

      fills the frame. It's soaked with BLOOD. Go behind it as Nan
      is working Billy's corner. He's breathing hard, his EAR IS
      SPLIT OPEN down the middle. It's grotesque.

                          BILLY
                How bad is it? Is it bad?

                            NAN
                Not good.

                          BILLY
                His elbow done it, the cunt.

                          NAN
                Next round not for you. Your ear
                almost come off.

                          BILLY
                Fuck that. I got another one.

      Billy looks to the crowd: Everyone from Songkran going crazy,
      gambling. Keng and Samurai betting big on Pon. In the front
      row: is Officer Pi Sit, arms folded, watching stoically.

      JOM, in a short skirt and high heels, walks the ring w/a CARD
      FOR ROUND 4. The crowd WHISTLES/CHEERS. Jom winks at Billy,
      who looks away, annoyed.

      AND THE BELL.

120   INT. THE RING - ROUND 4 - BILLY + PON                            120

      rush in. Trade heavy shots. FISTS, KNEES and SHINS... Their
      bodies absorbing the shock.

      Pon GRINDS HIS GLOVE into Billy's ear. Blood and white cells
      pour. It's hard to watch.

      Billy reacts and fires a three-punch flurry that lands, then
      Pon steps over and hammers a hook to Billy's exposed kidney.

      Billy drops to one knee, air leaves him, pain engulfing him.
                                                              62.


      As the REFEREE (a Guard) counts, Billy looks to the crowd:
      SEES Officer Pi Sit watching him, SEES gambling prisoners
      going nuts. Samurai sensing victory. Then, he SEES Nan who
      signals Billy to rise....

      ....and he does. A split-second, and Pon charges. Billy
      blocks A RAGE OF PON'S HEAD SHOTS and KNEES, doing his best
      to cover. A FIST SLAMS through Billy's guard, like a shotgun.

      Billy comes off the rope and hits Pon with a vicious three-
      shot combo, right-left-right. WHAM-WHAM-WHAM. Feints. Then a
      solid OVERHAND RIGHT that BREAKS the bridge of Pon's nose.

      THE BELL. The Ref pulls them apart. Billy throws Pon a crazed
      look of defiance -- The crowd ROARS for Billy, as he goes to
      his corner and sits;

121   INT. BILLY'S CORNER                                            121

      Nan works Billy's arms and legs;

                            BILLY
                  How's the ear?

                            NAN
                  Still there.

      Jom walks the ring with a CARD FOR ROUND 5. This time, she
      blows Billy a kiss...taunting him.

      Billy gets even madder...Nan slaps him hard across the face.

                            NAN
                      (shouting)
                  Last round, Billy! Must knock out
                  or lose fight!

      IN THE OPPOSITE CORNER: Pon stares at Billy with disdain.
      Ready to finish him off;

      THE BELL.

122   ROUND FIVE: A PON BARRAGE                                      122

      slams us right into mid-round five. Billy covers. Pon --
      insulting, taunting -- grapples with Billy, cursing through
      his mouthpiece...

      Pon launches a short right that Billy counters with a BIG
      LEFT HOOK that connects. Pon's head snaps, sweat sprays.

      And Billy goes for the kill.
                                                                 63.


      A HARD RIGHT CROSS SLAMS HOME on Pon's face -- knocking him
      to the canvas with a HEAVY THUD, out cold.

      No need to count. The Ref waves it over, removes Pon's
      mouthpiece: it's a bloody mess.

      The Crowd erupts. The Samurai, staring, simmering. Officer Pi
      Sit, in disbelief. Pon lays unconscious, as Cornermen try to
      revive him.

      As Billy, drapes his arms over the corner, and breathes...he
      looks up, sees Jom being escorted out by Trustees.

      A beat of regret;

123   EXT. RINGSIDE - LATER, LATE DAY - BILLY                          123

      lies on a bench as a THAI CUTMAN stitches up Billy's ear.

      KENG + 70 SAMURAI
      stand nearby...all shouting/cursing/spitting/vehement in
      Thai, angry at having lost their bets. FOUR GUARDS stand
      post, keeping them back, as --

      Two THAI BOXERS fight in the ring, the tournament hasn't
      stopped. The crowd going wild.

      We can see the pain in Billy's face.

                                                        CUT TO:

124   EXT. SHOWER AREA: PRISON COURTYARD - DUSK - THE BOXING TEAM      124

      celebrate. The courtyard empty, but them and two Guards.
      Billy (his ear now bandaged) with Lek and the team, bathing
      their WOUNDS, their CUTS, their SWOLLEN LIMBS from their own
      fights at Songkran. They laugh and throw water, for the
      moment, as if children. Nan is with them, smoking, smiles.

125   INT. PI SIT'S OFFICE: COMMAND CENTRE - NEXT DAY - BILLY          125

      his ear bandaged, enters with a GUARD.

      Pi Sit waits at his desk.

      Billy sits on the floor, placing his hands together, as a
      mark of respect. After a moment:

                          OFFICER PI SIT
                Your fight at Songkran was
                impressive. Insane, but impressive.

                          BILLY
                ...
                                                        64.


                       OFFICER PI SIT
             I'm going to transfer you to the
             boxing team's cell...
                 (off Billy's look)
             You will share in their privileges:
             better food, earlier to shower to
             avoid line, same thing at night.

Billy nods, tight smile.

                       OFFICER PI SIT
             But if you lose in National
             tournament, you will be sent back
             to live with regular prisoners.

Billy's smile drops.

                       OFFICER PI SIT
             You are first Farang to compete.
             Consider this an honor. But for us
             to win, every - fight - count. Have
             two months to train...and you'll
             need it.

Billy's silent. Reality of the pain ahead floods in.

                       OFFICER PI SIT
             Tournament will take place in
             maximum security prison. The men
             you will face have life and death
             sentence. They no just try win,
             they try kill.

Billy reacts. The weight of these stakes hadn't occurred to
him.

                       OFFICER PI SIT
             If you no want face this, and can't
             represent this prison...say now.

PAUSE.....

                       BILLY
             I won't let you down.

Officer Pi Sit signals to the Guard, who then lifts Billy to
his feet. As he starts to leave...

                       OFFICER PI SIT
             Wait.

Billy turns to see Officer Pi Sit pick up an envelope from
his desk and holds it out to Billy.

      sit in silence, angry, simmering, as TWO GUARDS stand by the
      door, waiting --

      BILLY
      collects his belongings. He's being transferred out of the
      Samurai cell.

      As Billy heads for the door, he looks back at Keng, who
      gestures a knife cutting Billy's throat.

      Billy walks out.

127   EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAY - FOLLOW BILLY                      127

      and Guards as they escort him across the yard...into a
      separate, WOOD BUILDING and move down a long, dark hall in
      silence. Billy is led into a LARGE CELL and first sees the
      FOOTBALL TEAM, standing looking at him...

      ...Then, suddenly, Billy discovers Nan, Lek and the ENTIRE
      BOXING TEAM waiting for him in this SPORT TEAMS' CELL ("Hong
      Nak Geela").

      All the boxers cheer and whistle, call him "Crazy Farang."
      All except Pon.

      Billy, bewildered by it all, dives into the team. All of them
      laughing and wrestling.


128   INT. SPORT TEAMS' CELL - NIGHT - BILLY                          128

      is awake, as everyone else sleeps. Billy reads the letter
      from his Mum quietly to himself;

      Deep emotion fills Billy's face. He wipes his eyes.

                                                      SMASH TO:

129   E/I. SPORT TEAMS' CELL - PRE DAWN - GUARDS                      129

      loudly drag their batons along the bars of the team cell,
      waking Billy, Nan and the Boxers.
                                                                 66.


      A Guard gives them a head count.

130   EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAWN - WIDE:                             130

      The yard is very still, very quiet.

      As the sun dips low, the boxing team, in silhouette, jogs
      laps around the courtyard.

      Billy runs among the them...He sees a rapist Samurai, naked,
      hands tied behind his back, being forced to roll in the yard,
      while getting kicked and humiliated by Guards.

      Billy looks up at the Sector 5 Cell, sees the rest of the
      Samurai behind bars, watching. Billy keeps jogging...

      ALL WE HEAR IS BREATHING...IN/OUT/IN/OUT/IN/OUT/IN/OUT/AND


131   INT. SPORT TEAMS' CELL - NIGHT - BILLY                           131

      lies on his stomach in the dark, amidst a circle of Boxers,
      conducting a sacred Sak Yant tattoo ritual.

      It's EXTREMELY HOT, EXTREMELY INTENSE. Lek and two Boxers
      hold Billy down, as another: TIGER uses a 40cm long needle
      (the "Mai Sak") to apply the ink onto Billy's back with fast,
      repeated jabs....the image of a LEAPING TIGER beginning...

      Billy fights the pain, holding it in;

      The boxers invoke a deep, hypnotic mantra (the "Kata"), some
      clutching amulet fragments, the chanting becomes ONE VOICE...

      CU's. Billy's pores, needle scraping ink made of snake venom,
      and jabbing. Lek wipes blood off Billy's back, revealing the
      Leaping Tiger and SAK YANT tattoos forming.

      Billy's eyes roll back, the mantra inducing a trance state.
      As Nan blows into the tattoo, the Boxers become shadows,
      silhouettes...The cell walls fading. All we see is Billy. All
      we hear is chanting...


132   EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAY - BILLY                              132

      walks alone, thinking. Time has passed. His bandage is gone.

      Billy watches the swirl of activity from a distance.
      Prisoners eating in the outdoor kitchen. And Jom, in her
      shop, selling wares...engaging with prisoners.

      Billy stares for a moment...then keeps walking.
                                                               67.


133   EXT. PRISON GYM: CANTEEN - DAY - BILLY, NAN + BOXING TEAM      133

      are crowded around a long table. Plates/bowls of fish, ant
      eggs, crab somtam, chicken, pork, chiang-mai noodles are
      passed around as Billy and the boxing team eat. AD LIB
      talking/joking/banter.

                          THAI BOXER
                Hey Crazy farang, why you in
                prison?

                          BILLY
                ...Drugs...

                             THAI BOXER
                What kind?

                          BILLY
                All of `em.

      The Team laughs. Billy can't help but smile.

                          BILLY
                How `bout you?

                          THAI BOXER
                No, I no do drugs...I just kill.

      Thai Boxer pounds his own chest, as if stimulating a knife
      stabbing. The Team LAUGHS harder....so Billy laughs too.

134   INT. PRISON BOXING GYM: RING - DAY - BILLY + LEK               134

      in protective gear, spar and grapple. Flesh on flesh impact.
      Nan stands at the ropes, instructing.

      Billy gets thrown down.

      Nan yells at him to get up.

      Billy jumps up and re-engages. Lek throws him down again.

      Billy pounds the canvas with his fist, in frustration.

      Nan signals Billy to exit the ring.

      Two more Boxers climb in.


135   INT. SPORTS TEAM CELL - EVENING - BILLY, NAN + BOXING TEAM     135

      are given head count by a Guard at night.
                                                                68.


136   INT. SPORTS TEAMS' CELL - NIGHT - BILLY + LEK                   136

      sit together, looking at a PHOTO ALBUM of Lek's family.

      Lek points to things in the photos, then teaches Billy how to
      say them in Thai: ..."my house"..." "...my son..." "...my
      temple..." "...my father..."

      Billy repeats each in Thai.    Then:

                          LEK
                Do you have father?

      Billy pauses, then nods "yes."

                          LEK
                He come visit you?

                          BILLY
                ...no...we don't talk anymore.

137   INT. PRISON BOXING GYM - MORNING - BILLY                        137

      shadowboxes before the large mirror. He looks strong, fast.
      Now, comfortable facing his reflection.

                                                         CUT TO:

138   INT. LOCKER AREA - DAY - BILLY                                  138

      leaving the gym, walks out to his locker. He opens it, shoves
      his gym bag inside, shuts it.

      Then, Billy turns to see someone standing there.

      It's Kiaw. Cold stare at Billy.

                          BILLY
                Kiaw...When'd they let you out?

                          KIAW
                When I heal.

      Billy sees new scars on Kiaw's face. They're unnerving.

                          BILLY
                I haven't got time for this.

                          KIAW
                Your hair look good...

                          BILLY
                --What?
                                                                 69.


                          KIAW
                You take my shampoo bottle-- smoke
                all heroin inside it.

      Billy's silent. Then:

                          BILLY
                So? You was gonna throw me to the
                guards...Now we're even.

                          KIAW
                That heroin belong to Samurai. Cost
                much money!

                          BILLY
                That's your problem...

      Kiaw persists, getting angry:

                          KIAW
                You pay now.

                          BILLY
                    (in disbelief--)
                I don't owe you nothin'.

      SOMEONE WHISTLES from above...A GUARD on the balcony. He
      sharply gestures to Billy and Kiaw to move on.

      Billy walks away. Kiaw steps in his path:

                          KIAW
                You know I have AIDS. You pay my
                debt to Samurai or I inject you
                with my blood.

      Kiaw holds Billy's stare: it's murderous. Then, he leaves.

139   INT. PRISON INFIRMARY - AFTERNOON - BILLY                        139

      and a few other BOXERS sit on a bench, having their training
      injuries treated by DOCTORS: cut knuckles, cut lips and
      eyebrows, hyper-extended knees, black-eyes.

      Billy, still angry, is having his bruised ribs taped.

      A GERMAN INMATE in his 60's -- pale, fat, sweaty -- sits on
      another bench, waiting, eating a plate of food.

      Near the medical hatch, Jom is talking to a MUSCULAR TRUSTEE,
      fanning herself with a Chinese fan and flirting.

      She notices Billy-- glancing over, then ignores him and
      struts toward the other Boxers, as if an audience:
                                                          70.


                    JOM
          ...You good fighters, not bad. My
          father want me to be Muay Thai,
          like him.

The Boxers all look at her, in disbelief. Jom smiles;

                    JOM
          But his dream not mine. I start
          taking hormones when I was fifteen.
          Father say I bring great shame, and
          he disown me.
              (she looks deliberately at
               Billy--)
          But now I am who I want to be.
          Happy with myself.

Billy, simmering, as Jom turns back to Muscular Trustee and
smiles;

                    JOM
          My only regret is I should have had
          kids before I cut my dick off.

Muscular Trustee smiles back. Billy hides his jealousy, but
can't keep from watching Jom deliberately feign affection for
Muscular Trustee.

                    GERMAN INMATE
          Well me, I like to fuck `em
          younger. Much younger...Dick or no
          dick, it don't matter.

The German grins. Jom looks at him, uncomfortable.

For Billy, the tension rises to a boiling point.

                    GERMAN INMATE
              (to Jom)
          How many cigarettes to suck me off?

                    JOM
          You, Westerner-- what your
          problem?!

                    GERMAN INMATE
          -- I haven't got a problem, I've
          got cigarettes. Are you going to
          blow me or not--?!

THE SIREN BEGINS TO WAIL: time to go back to the cells.

They keep arguing; back and forth. Jom becomes livid,
shouting in Thai and --
                                                           71.


Billy reacts -- He charges across and yanks the German Inmate
up by the neck -- grabs the FORK from his plate --

German Inmate SCREAMS, terrified -- as an enraged Billy puts
the fork to his throat.

                    BILLY
          -- Shut your mouth, or I'll bash
          your fuckin' skull in, nob head!

Jom is frozen. Surprised. But also flattered.

                    GERMAN INMATE
              (pulls away; then to
               Billy--)
          Fuck off, faggot!

A crazed Billy overpowers the German Inmate -- fiercely,
intensely -- pushing the fork toward the German's EYE --

He can't hold Billy off --

                    BILLY
          Open your eyes...

He doesn't.

                    BILLY
          I SAID, OPEN YOUR FUCKIN' EYES!!!

He does, then shuts them immediately.

The fork's within centimeters -- about to force in --

              (shouts)
          BILLY, NO! CALM DOWN! LET HIM GO!

Billy reacts;

Now, Muscular Trustee shoves Billy off -- as the Boxers
forcibly restrain Billy from killing the German Inmate.

Jom moves away, well protected by Muscular Trustee.

THE SIREN KEEPS WAILING;

      Billy, held by Boxers, looks at her -- His rage replaced by
      shame.

      Jom leaves down a hall w/Muscular Trustee, who comforts her.

      Billy is led toward the exit by the Boxers, but he keeps
      staring after Jom. He feels rejected.

      They each wear a "mongkhon" (headband) and "pra jiad"

      Billy and Nan, also in the ring, stand near the ropes.

      Billy is deep in a stew of his own confusion, trying to hide

      fills the cell, and Billy watches them, isolated and apart.
      His thoughts elsewhere.

                                                       SMASH TO:

143   INT. RING: PRISON GYM - DAY - BILLY                            143

      is nailed with a punch in this sparring session. A combo of
      THREE MORE HARD SHOTS from Lek hit Billy clean, and he
      bounces off the ropes.

      Lek looks over at Nan, who is standing on the ring apron,
      watching: Billy is NOT throwing back.

                              NAN
                  Hands up!
                                                                74.


      Billy takes a kick to the chest. Then another. Lek gives an
      imploring look, then fires a series of PUNCHES; Billy just
      takes it, refusing to cover.

      Lek knees his ribs, and Billy slumps forward into a clinch.

      Lek shoves Billy off, paws with a jab...concerned. Suddenly,
      Billy dips and CRASHES A HOOK ON LEK'S JAW -- stunning him.

      As Lek staggers, Billy unleashes FOUR DEVASTATING PUNCHES AND
      LEK IS BADLY HURT.

                          NAN
                Billy! Hya Suk! (that's enough!)

      Other Boxers stop training now, looking over, as--

      BILLY KEEPS ATTACKING -- A BARRAGE OF HOOKS, BOTH LEFTS AND
      RIGHTS -- LEK IS OUT ON HIS FEET.

      DESK GUARD, ALARMED, SHOUTS SOMETHING IN THAI;

      NAN JUMPS IN THE RING, GOES TO JUMP IN-BETWEEN AS --

      BILLY LANDS A HUGE UPPERCUT AND LEK FALLS, HIS NECK BOUNCING
      OFF THE BOTTOM ROPE, WHERE HE LAYS, UNCONSCIOUS.

      SILENCE falls over the gym.

      Billy is shocked at what he's done. So is Nan, as he quickly
      goes to Lek's aid.

      Billy storms out of the ring, rips off his gloves with his
      teeth, then slams them in a trash bin and leaves...

      Desk Guard hurries after him.

      The rest of the Boxers, confused, watch Billy go.

                                                           CUT TO:

144   INT. PUNISHMENT CELL - NEXT DAY - BILLY                         144

      is walked in by Desk Guard, holding his belongings. He's been
      transferred to another cell: 12 square feet. Only five Thai
      inmates inside.

      As the Desk Guard shuts the bars, Billy hears someone giggle.
      He turns to see Noi -- the mentally retarded inmate from
      earlier.

      No one else says a word.

                                                           CUT TO:
                                                               75.


145   INT. PUNISHMENT CELL - DAYS/NIGHTS - BILLY                     145

      condemned in here for a week. No talking. Very little light.
      In the days/nights that follow....

      Billy pounds the wall with his fist. Slow, heavy thuds, that
      come one after another.

      Billy pumps out sit-ups.

      Billy does furious push-ups.

      Noi watches Billy, giggling. Billy stops and looks at him.

      Billy does push-ups with Noi on his back.

      Guards enter, drop off food, then lock the bars again.

      Billy and Noi sit/eat together. Noi smiles. Billy smiles back.

      Prisoners' clothes hang on a wire. Billy rips it down and
      uses it as a jump rope.

      As he does, Billy's eyes glaze over, somewhere else.

      Billy/Cellmates sleep, inches apart. Noi right next to Billy.

      Guards enter again. Drop off food. Shut the bars.

      In back of the cell/shower, Billy helps Noi bathe. Then dries
      him off with a towel.

      Later, Billy stands with a DULL RAZOR and starts to shave his
      own head. Intense expression on his face;

      All the prisoners watch in ominous silence.

      A few drops of blood stream down the back of Billy's scalp
      and neck.

      His head now shaved, he now shaves off his eyebrows...leaving
      the skin underneath beaded in blood.

      Guards bring in food; shut the bars.

      Billy starts shadowboxing. FIRING COMBOS that get faster and
      harder -- More and more violent...

      The other prisoners move back, nervous, afraid -- Except Noi.

      Billy keeps punching, pivoting, attacking...dripping with
      sweat. The combos coming with blazing force and speed --
                                                                76.


      Billy finally stops, drops to his knees. Noi applauds, his
      eyebrows shaved as well.

      Noi gives Billy water, smiles.

      And for the first time, Billy SPEAKS in THAI:

                          BILLY
                Pom chuu Billy khrap? (My name is
                Billy) Khoun chuu aray? (What's
                your name).

      Noi giggles.

                                                           CUT TO:

146   EXT. PRISON - DAWN - WIDE:                                      146

      It's still and quiet. Everyone in their cells, asleep.

                                                           CUT TO:

147   INT. SPORT TEAMS' CELL - EARLY MORNING - NAN + BOXING TEAM      147

      are sitting in their cell, quietly. Lek, among them, still
      with bruises.

      There's a sound of the door opening and a figure walks in:

      It's Billy...released from punishment. Brought in by Desk
      Guard.

      Everyone stares. Billy tries to gather courage as he walks up
      to Nan.

      There's a long moment before he speaks:

                          BILLY
                I fucked up. I know it, Nan.
                Honest.

      Nan says nothing...

                           BILLY
                I just lost it, is all. I lost me
                self,-- everything you taught me.
                    (beat)
                If I could, I'd rip me own heart
                out and show it to you...
                    (beat, then)
                I didn't come this far to quit.

      Nan stares. Silent. Billy tries not to break down.
                                                                 77.


      Then, Nan hands Billy a pair of BOXING SHORTS. Billy looks
      down, sees the name written on them:

      "CRAZY FARANG"

                          NAN
                Tournament very soon. Must train
                twice as hard now. Don't disappoint
                me.

      Billy nods, quietly comes alive.

                          BILLY
                    (realizes)
                I forgot cigarettes.

                          NAN
                I no more smoke. Bad for health.

      Billy's back on the team. He walks to Lek and sits down next
      to him. There's a moment...Then, Lek holds out a fist...Billy
      bumps it, both smile.

                                                        CUT TO:

148   INT. PRISON GYM - DAY - BILLY                                    148

      holds a rope between his teeth, that's tied to a weight. He
      lifts it up and down, strengthening his neck.

149   EXT. COURTYARD: SHOP AREA - ANOTHER DAY - BILLY                  149

      walks in the strangely almost empty courtyard. Like an
      uncomfortable dream. Suddenly he SEES in the distance...

      NOI

      sitting alone, on the ground. He's sad, dejected, for once
      not smiling.

      Billy walks over. Noi sees Billy and his mood changes
      immediately. He runs to him with his moldy FLIP-FLOPS split
      down the middle;

                             NOI
                BILLY!!!

      Noi hugs Billy tight.

                          BILLY
                You need new shoes...

      Noi doesn't respond.
                                                              78.


      Billy speaks in Thai:

                          BILLY
                Rong tow, see lao. (Your shoes are
                not good)

      Noi looks up, grunts.

                          NOI
                Roo lao! (I know!)

                          BILLY
                Pom Ja sue longtow mai hai khun na.
                (I'll buy you new ones.)

      Noi, a huge smile...He removes his flip-flops, gives them
      kiss, then HURLS them over the prison wall. He then marches
      quickly away, singing a Thai song loudly and out of tune.


150   EXT. SHOP AREA - LATER - BILLY + NOI                          150

      are at a stand, rummaging through items for sale. The shop
      owner is a VERY OLD THAI PRISONER.

      Billy inspects items: coffee, shaving cream, soup cans...They
      agree on the flip=flops that Noi likes.

      As Noi tries them on, Billy then moves to a row of feminine
      items: lipstick, eye shadow, a woman's headband with a
      plastic flower attached.

      He looks up at the Old Man watching him.

      Billy picks up the flower headband;

                          BILLY
                    (to the Old Man)
                ...it's not for me...

      The Old Man SMILES.

      Noi looks at Billy, concerned. Hopes it's not for him. Shakes
      his head, "no."

      Billy is amused.

      Both laugh.

151   INT. ANTECHAMBER - ANOTHER DAY - BILLY                        151

      is alone in the empty chamber, practicing the Ram Muay dance.
      The music plays on a bad radio...His movements are stiff,
      uncomfortable. He's clearly frustrated.
                                                              79.


      There's a sound. Billy turns;

      REVEAL: JOM
      is standing outside the chamber. She wears the hair band with
      the plastic flower. Two TRUSTEES stand sentry as Jom enters
      the chamber and walks to Billy.

      Billy stares at her in silence. Emotion roiling through him.
      They look at each for a long, unspoken moment.

      Then Jom steps back and begins to perform the Ram Muay dance.
      Billy watches, transfixed as she teaches. It's strange and
      spiritual. Her movements graceful, yet surprisingly powerful.

      Now, Billy tries, following Jom's lead. Back and forth...She
      guides him along, together...both moving like water.

      Both smile.    Forgiving.

152   INT. RING: PRISON BOXING GYM - EVENING (TWO WEEKS LATER -      152
      BILLY + PON

      are sparring. The gym is otherwise empty except for Nan, Tane
      and the Desk Guard. (Billy's eyebrows are mostly grown back.)

      BILLY + PON
      engage, grapple, then fight out. It's intense, but more for
      technique, ironing out Billy's flaws.

      Mid-round, Pon CRASHES a shin into Billy's kidney. Billy
      takes it. Covers and assaults, aggressively going after Pon.
      THE BUZZER ends the round...Billy and Pon bump gloves.

      IN THE CORNER: Nan gives Billy water, then notices that Billy
      is sweating profusely.

                             NAN
                   Faster! Let hands and feet go!

      Billy takes a labored breath, nods.

      THE BUZZER

      Billy circles, on the defensive. Pon cuts down the ring and
      tries to nail him, but Billy avoids and clinches. He's having
      trouble breathing...

      Pon wrestles Billy to the ropes. Billy hacks and splutters...
      a few FLECKS OF BLOOD spray onto Pon's shoulder. Only Billy
      notices...

      Something is wrong;
                                                                80.


      They break apart and Billy fends off more blows from Pon.
      THE BUZZER ENDS THE ROUND.


153   INT. PRISON GYM: BATHROOM - RIGHT AFTER - BILLY                 153

      walks in and shuts the door. Locks it.

      He stands there a moment, afraid.

      When suddenly and without warning -- a knife-like pain shoots
      through Billy's side -- his chest begins heaving --

      AND HE VOMITS BLOOD VIOLENTLY.


154   EXT. PRISON GYM + COURTYARD - MINUTES LATER - BILLY             154

      with Nan, Pon, Tane follow Desk Guard back toward their cell.
      WE SEE the concern on Billy's face. He tries to hide it from
      Nan...

                             NAN
                You okay?

                           BILLY
                    (he isn't)
                ...yeah...

                          NAN
                Fear is good for fight. Like fire,
                inside you.

      Billy's silent, struggling to hide his pain from Nan.

                          NAN
                It's almost time.

      Billy considers telling Nan about his pain: He doesn't.

                                                            BLACK.

155   INT. PRISON INFIRMARY: SMALL OFFICE - AFTERNOON - BILLY         155

      waits, alone. In the hallway, two other Westerner inmates
      wait on a bench.

                             A MAN'S VOICE (O.C.)
                Mr. Moore?

      Billy looks up: DR. ADI (40, British) has entered, holding a
      clipboard.
                                                81.


                    DR. ADI
          Mr. Moore, I am Dr. Adi.

                    BILLY
          Never seen you here before...

                    DR. ADI
          I come once a month to give medical
          aid to foreigners.

BEAT.

                    DR. ADI
          How are you feeling?

                    BILLY
          I'm not sure.

                     DR. ADI
          You have a delineation of the
          esophagus.

                       BILLY
          A what...?

                    DR. ADI
          It's a tear. Primary cause: drug
          and alcohol abuse. Through years of
          this, it's worn away the lining of
          your esophagus.

BEAT.

                    BILLY
          Well I'm sober now.

                    DR. ADI
          You need to stay that way.

                     BILLY
              (nods)
          So can I get out of here...get back
          to the gym?

                    DR. ADI
          You need to heal. After, exercise
          is good,-- but only moderate.

A BEAT.

                     BILLY
          I've got a tournament comin' up:
          Muay Thai.

                Doc, I'm in prison. I haven't got
                no "other plans."

      BEAT.

                          DR. ADI
                Boxing is what caused the rupture.
                You vomited blood because you had
                at least a pint in there. Any more
                trauma, and you could hemorrhage.
                You'll bleed to death.

      Billy looks at him.

      Dr. Adi starts to write on his clipboard.

                          DR. ADI
                I'm putting in a request to have
                you transferred to a government
                hospital. They'll patch your
                esophagus, or perhaps cauterize it.

                          BILLY
                I'll just, I'll keep my guard up.

                again.

      ON BILLY. HOLD.

156   EXT. PRISON INFIRMARY - AFTERNOON - BILLY                     156

      steps out of the infirmary into the heat. He stands there,
      alone, looking around...a lost animal.

                                                        CUT TO:

157   INT. RING: PRISON BOXING GYM - DAY, LATER - NAN               157

      stands at ring center, in full protective gear w/large pads --
      one by one, five boxers take their turn unleashing rapid-fire
      Thai kicks (20 at a time), shouting with each shot.
                                                                83.


      It's fast. It's loud. It's relentless.

      BILLY
      is the last to go. Hoping to prove the doctor wrong. He
      attacks the bag. fast. loud. violent.

      REVEAL: NOI is in the gym now, sitting on the ring steps. He
      LAUGHS and APPLAUDS Billy. (He also wears new flip-flops.)

      Nan points to a BROOM nearby.

                          NAN
                Nong Chai, Kub pai tum ngan khun na
                krub. (Little brother, go back to
                work.)

      Noi quickly gets up, starts to sweep the gym. He's the new
      team assistant.

      Billy looks at Nan, nods "thanks."

      And Billy walks away. Light-headed, he clutches his chest,
      hiding the pain.

                           BILLY
                    (low, to himself)
                ...fuck...

                                                        CUT TO:

158   INT. SHOWER AREA (TROUGH) - DAY - BILLY                         158

      under the water. It flows down his neck and tattooed back.
      Cup after cup. He breathes in the cold...breathing in that
      place where fighters go...where emotion is stilled and eyes
      focus, concentrating. Then --

      BILLY'S FACE
      plunges into water, FULL FRAME. Bubbles spiral, eyes peel
      open. Then, he whips his head back...

      ...out of a trough, as he stands in THE COURTYARD. He wipes
      water from his face. Then, sensing something in the distance,
      he instinctively turns...

      To his left: two Samurai.

      To his right: Kiaw and one more.

      Then Keng. All of them, staring.

      Billy freezes, staring back. Now, something in the Samurai's
      eyes goes dead and realization hits him...
                                                                84.


      Utter
      fucking
      TERROR

      Billy RUNS -- heart hammering, thru prisoner traffic as the
      Samurai give chase.

      Suddenly, KIAW catches Billy from behind, both go sprawling --
      Billy, on his feet fast, STOMPS KIAW HARD -- then sprints
      away, as the other Samurai close in...

159   THE LAUNDRY AREA - BILLY                                        159

      -- bursts in, frenetic thru a maze of sheets. He gets
      tangled, screams, falls. AND ALL FIVE SAMURAI POUNCE, fists
      and feet...pounding Billy, trapped in the sheet, as--

      KENG rips the sheet back. Faces inches apart. He shouts to
      Kiaw in Thai, who pulls out a SYRINGE and plunges it into his
      own veins...drawing out INFECTED BLOOD.

      Kiaw hands Keng the syringe, as the others hold Billy's neck.

                          BILLY
                NO! NO!

                          KENG
                    (to Billy)
                You have tournament come up, yes?

      Billy frozen, wide-eyed, nods.

                          KENG
                Win fight and pay us your earnings.
                You lose, it end bad for you...

      TENSE PAUSE. FUCKING ALL HELL TERRIFYING.

      Billy nods.

      The Samurai drops Billy in the dirt, then walk away.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

160   INT. SPORT TEAMS' CELL - PRE DAWN - BILLY                       160

      back in the cell with the entire Boxing Team and Football
      Team, as they kneel for Buddhist pre-dawn sutras. Chanting
      fills the cell.

      Billy shows Noi how to pray;

      They all pray together.
                                                              85.


161   INTERCUT: OTHER CELLS/AREAS + PRISONERS                        161

      also praying. Lady Boys, Samurai, et al. In the COURTYARD,
      Muslims pray ("Salat al-Maghhrib"). All of it, hypnotic,
      tonal overlapping floods the air... The prayer before dawn.

                                         BLACK/HOLD IN BLACK/THEN:

162   EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAY - BILLY, NAN, LEK, TIGER + A FEW 162
      OTHER BOXERS

      march in chains and shackles; gym bags in hand, some with
      boxing gloves tied around their necks. Guards watch the line.
      The yard is otherwise empty. All the prisoners, locked in
      their cells, watch the team pass.

      Billy sees: Jom in the Control Section. She smiles, waves
      through the fence.

      Billy nods, gratitude behind it.

      Then he glances at the Isolation Cell as he passes.

      They team is marched through a series of MASSIVE GATES and
      BARRED DOORS, onto the MAIN GATES...where a pair of GUARDS
      pull them open, showing us the outside....

163   EXT. PRISON: MAIN GATES - BILLY, NAN, LEK, TIGER + BOXERS      163

      step outside the prison gates. Billy pauses for a moment...
      taking in the open air. There's a few houses around, offices
      and empty lots. The slightest smile comes to his face.

      ANGLE, A WAITING PRISON BUS
      It's packed to the rafters with prisoners. Faces peer through
      steel-mesh. Billy follows the team into the bus...

164   INT. PRISON BUS - BILLY                                        164

      gets on. Prisoners crammed like cattle, everyone in chains.
      Billy squeezes through and sits next to Nan.

                          BILLY
                They all here for the fight?

                          NAN
                Only boxers go to tournament.

      Billy looks to the back of the bus: a group of prisoners are
      caged in a smaller compartment, facing a Guard w/a shotgun.

                          BILLY
                So where they headed?
                                                                86.


                          NAN
                Some get transfer. Others go to
                death house.

165   E/I. PRISON BUS (MOVING) - DAY/LATE DAY - VARIOUS               165

      shots of the prison bus, traveling through Thailand.

      BILLY
      watches scenery pass. People on the streets; temples;
      markets; life on the outside.

      As the bus moves through lush Evergreen forests...Billy leans
      against the mesh window, wind hitting his face. He breathes
      in clean air.

166   INT. MAX. SECURITY PRISON: RECEPTION - BILLY, NAN, LEK, TIGER166
      + OTHER BOXERS

      enter. They're given a SECURITY CHECK. Guards search them and
      their gym bags. Chains and shackles are removed.

      Nearby, FAMILIES wait in line as their bags are inspected.


167   EXT. MAX. SECURITY PRISON: COURTYARD - LATE DAY - WIDE:         167

      It's huge, filled with people. Guards and Prisoners, Families
      visiting. Some play basketball, some gamble, others talk and
      laugh with their loved ones. Lady Boys, dressed as Ring Card
      Girls, are in a separate caged area, putting on makeup.

      In the center of the yard, a BOXING RING is being prepared:
      Prisoners set the canvas (a giant logo: "Department of
      Corrections"); they secure the ropes, and corner pads. A
      gallery of chairs around it.

      BILLY
      sits alone. He watches other boxers with their families. Pon,
      Tiger, etc. Lek, holding and kissing his INFANT SON. Then,
      Billy looks away and quietly stares at the ring.

      ANGLE, OFFICER PI SIT.
      talking to Government Officials. He sees Billy sitting alone,
      walks over and sits. They both watch the families and
      prisoners interact for a moment. Then:

                          OFFICER PI SIT
                I talked to your Mother. She could
                no afford airfare, but she sends
                her love.

      Billy is silent.
                                                                 87.


                          OFFICER PI SIT
                They say boxers should have no
                pleasure before fight.

                          BILLY
                ...

                          OFFICER PI SIT
                They say it softens you,-- steals
                your hunger.

                          BILLY
                Well maybe "they" are full of shit.

      Officer Pi Sit smiles. Billy's loneliness is evident.

                          OFFICER PI SIT
                The man you fight tonight, he no
                deserve to ever leave prison...So
                he'll do anything he can to win.

      BEAT, THEN:

                           OFFICER PI SIT
                But you...
                    (off Billy's look)
                You had to go to prison in order to
                be free.

      Billy is still. Hard truth.

                                                        CUT TO:

168   INT. LARGE CELL: MAX. SECURITY PRISON - NIGHT - BILLY            168

      lies on a table, in this improvised locker room. Nan is
      giving Billy a pre-fight massage...Applying heated oil to the
      skin, the scars, the back tattoo, working the muscles with
      his hands. It's very quiet but intense, ritualistic, as wel
      FEEL the BUZZ in the air...

      Lek, Tiger, a few other boxers enter the cell. All sweating,
      breathing hard, just having fought.

      Billy sits up. Alert.

169   INT. BATHROOM: MAX. SECURITY PRISON - NIGHT - BILLY              169

      enters. Alone, he looks in the mirror, touches his chest
      nervously. Eyes closed, he prays. Focus and intensity
      builds...

      FADE IN SOUNDS of a distant crowd. Fights underway. CHANTING.
      SHOUTING. MUAY THAI MUSIC on the loudspeakers.
                                                                 88.


      There's a knock on the door. Billy opens it:

                             NAN
                It's time.

170   CU'S: BILLY                                                      170

      -- as he pulls on his cup guard, then his shorts.

      -- as Nan tapes his hands.

      -- as an OFFICIAL signs the tape.

      -- as Lek ties Prajiads around his biceps

      -- a garland of flowers around his neck.

      -- then the gloves.

      -- Billy bows as Nan puts the Mongkhon on his head.

      He's ready.

171   I/E. MAX. SECURITY PRISON - NIGHT - FOLLOW BILLY                 171

      with Nan and Lek, as he leaves the cell and makes the VERY
      LONG WALK down a corridor, lined with cells...

      The TIGER TATTOO vibrant on Billy'S back.

      Prisoners cheering, some taunting, other reach through the
      bars and pat him... Billy keeps moving, eyes charged, fixed
      ahead, shadowboxing a few punches as he goes...

      DOWN A FLIGHT OF STEPS

      into the bowels of THE YARD, where SIGHT/SOUNDS EXPLODE.
      Prison spotlights REVEAL THE YARD IS PACKED.

      Around the ring, a sea of prisoners. Guards in uniforms, Gov.
      Officials. Numerous families throughout. The NOISE builds to
      deafening levels as Billy makes his way toward the ring, and
      steps OVER the top rope...

172   INT. RING - WITH BILLY                                           172

      as he enters. And we're seeing him, now, at this moment, as a
      full Muay Thai warrior.

      Another ROAR sweeps over the crowd...His opponent entering
      the ring...And Billy turns to face the man who intends death
      for him: DIESEL CHOR (25, pure malevolence).

      Prisoners ROAR for him.
                                                                 89.


      Billy and Diesel walk the ring, opposite sides, praying to
      each corner, touching the ropes, "sealing" the ring...

      Ceremonial music begins...Billy and Diesel both perform the
      Ram Muay. As Billy moves rhythmically, in time to the music,
      his arms and legs telling his journey w/beatific precision...

                                                        CUT TO:

173   INT. LADY BOY CELL - NIGHT - JOM                                 173

      with May and Char are watching a small TV, chatting up a
      storm. Women's bras, thongs, hang on wires. Perfume and
      makeup abound.

      Jom watches Billy on TV intently, sees him perform the Ram
      Muay as she taught him.


174   BACK TO: INT. MAX. SECURITY PRISON: RING - NIGHT - BILLY         174

      FEELS the spirit now rising inside him...When he finishes the
      Ram Muay, the music cuts out.

      Billy locks eyes with Officer Pi Sit, ringside, for a moment.

      Then, Billy heads to his corner, lowers his head so Nan can
      remove the Mongkhon... They pray together, head-to-head...

      The crowd baying for blood, grows louder... LOUDER now...
      Then, suddenly, abruptly--

                                         CUT TO BLACK/SMASH TO:

      THE BELL;

175   INT. RING - ROUND ONE - BOTH                                     175

      rush in. A measured pace at first. Billy and Diesel circling,
      feinting, like a storm brewing...

      Billy fires jabs and teeps with a balance and deftness we
      haven't seen before... Diesel, taking shots, trying to cut
      the ring, but Billy evades...

      UNTIL: DIESEL'S TRAINER shouts something Thai. And Diesel
      fires an OVERHAND RIGHT that Billy doesn't see and hits him
      like a pole-ax.

      Billy's entire body feels it. (So do we.)

      A barrage of pulverizing kicks, elbows and punches follow,
      Billy trying to cover up. Diesel's attack goes through like
      bullets. It's fast. It's shocking. Hurts to watch. And --
                                                              90.


      THE BELL.

      Diesel throws Billy down, smiles. The crowd ROARS; the Ref
      warns him. Billy gets up, goes back to his corner.

      Ringside: Officer Pi Sit watches, concerned.

                                                        CUT TO:

176   INT. SAMURAI CELL - NIGHT - KENG, KIAW + ALL SAMURAI          176

      shout, wildly gambling cigarettes, as--

177   BACK TO: MAX. SECURITY PRISON/RING: BILLY'S CORNER - BILLY    177

      breathes, panicking. Nan and Lek work his legs.

                            BILLY
                  He's too strong!

178   ROUND TWO                                                     178

      Billy is under attack in seconds.

      Diesel firing in punches. Billy bounces off the ropes just as
      Diesel strikes with a flying knee that CRASHES into Billy's
      forehead-- then Diesel spins him around and KICKS BOTH LEGS
      OUT from under him.

      Billy goes down hard. HIS HEART STARTS POUNDING. Billy
      clutches his sternum, takes a breath and fights through it.

      The Ref counts. Nan and Lek shout from the corner in Thai.
                                                                 91.

      to get up.

181   BACK TO: INT. MAX. SECURITY PRISON: RING - BILLY                 181

      staggers up. Diesel resumes his assault. Billy tries to grab
      as Diesel drives him into a corner, where a STORM OF KNEES
      batter his legs and organs. Billy, taking HUGE SHOTS, can't
      escape, then--

      CU, BILLY
      under a BLUR of shots, something in him SLOWS...CALMS -- AS
      IF SPIRITUAL...HE/WEE SEE a split-second opening in Diesel's
      attack and Billy FIRES -- a COUNTER PUNCH that hits and hurts
      Diesel. His face is damaged. He staggers back.

      THE CROWD ROARS.

182   INT. SAMURAI CELL - KENG, KIAW + ALL THE SAMURAI                 182

183   INT. MAX. SECURITY PRISON: RING - NIGHT - BILLY                  183

      bores in...nailing Diesel with aggressive kicks, elbows and
      teeps, that knock Diesel back to a corner. Billy unloads:
      PUNCH AFTER PUNCH AFTER PUNCH!!

      THE CROWD GOES CRAZY. Even Officer Pi Sit.

185   BACK TO: INT. MAX. SECURITY PRISON: RING - NIGHT                 185

      THE BELL. And the Referee yanks them apart.

      SUDDENLY BILLY'S GASTRAL TRACK LURCHES and Billy doubles
      over, again clutching his sternum.

      sits. Nan and Lek feverishly rub Billy's legs. Billy spits in
      the bucket: it's a lot of blood.
                                                              92.

      A DIFFERENT LADY BOY WALKS THE RING WITH ROUND THREE CARD.

188   INT. RING - ROUNDS THREE + FOUR                                188

      They trade. Back and forth. Both fighters standing ground,
      creating angles, traps, dodging and attacking. "The Art of
      Eight Limbs" in full force.

      They slam into a clinch (reminiscent of the exercise with
      Pon). But this time, Billy throws Diesel down.

      Diesel jumps up immediately and attacks Billy;

      AND THE BELL. BILLY AND DIESEL CONTINUE TO FIGHT AFTER THE
      BELL. The crowd roars, shifting momentum, rooting for Billy,
      the Crazy Farang.

189   INT. LADY BOY CELL - JOM, MAY + CHAR                           189

      the ring with a card for ROUND 5.

190   INT. BILLY'S CORNER - BETWEEN ROUNDS                           190

      rubbing Billy's legs that are brutally swollen at the tendons
      around the calves and knees. He struggles to breathe.

                          NAN
                Last round! No get tired now!

191   INT. RING - MID-ROUND FIVE - DIESEL'S BARRAGE                    191

      has Billy hurt. A right to the jaw then three knees to the
      ribs knocks the wind out of Billy. He stumbles to his left.

      Diesel takes advantage and fires a left lead kick that almost
      knocks Billy down. They grapple, shove each other off.

      Both boxers exhausted, it's a matter of will. Trading shots.
      As Billy finds, masterfully, his distance, his timing, he
      chops a hard kick to Diesel's thigh that buckles him.

      THE HUNGRY CROWD ON IT'S FEET. Even Officer Pi Sit, who jumps
      up from his seat, CHEERING BILLY, as --

      Billy RUSHES in --

      -- but mid-charge, his GASTRAL TRACK LURCHES AGAIN. HEART
      POUNDING, DANGEROUSLY FAST. BILLY GRIMACES IN PAIN, AS --

      DIESEL COMES RIGHT BACK, SLAMMING IN SHOTS.

      BILLY FIGHTS THROUGH THE PAIN. PUSHING HIMSELF. IT'S BACK AND
      FORTH -- BOTH MEN LANDING....

      UNTIL A SOLID COMBO STAGGERS DIESEL...BILLY GOES FOR THE
      FINISH -- SEVERAL CHOPPING KICKS -- THAT BRUTALLY, FINALLY
      KNOCK DIESEL'S ENTIRE LOWER BODY BACKWARDS AND DROPS HIM ON
      HIS FACE.

      Diesel writhes in agony.

      The Ref pushes Billy back.

      Diesel is counted out.

      The Ref raises Billy's hand.

      CROWD GOES CRAZY.
                                                                94.


192   INT. LADY BOY CELL - NIGHT - JOM, MAY + CHAR                    192

      all on their feet. Chatting, clapping. A smile comes to Jom's
      face, as--

193   INT. SPORT TEAMS' CELL - NIGHT - NOI                            193

      His face filled, with emotion. Watching his friend win.

194   BACK TO: INT. MAX. SECURITY PRISON: RING - NOW - BILLY          194

      is swarmed by Nan, Lek, Pon, Tiger, and the rest of the team
      that floods the ring.

      Officer Pi Sit climbs in and congratulates him.

      AND SUDDENLY, ABRUPTLY, ALL SOUND CUTS OUT. BILLY/WE SEE ALL
      THE EXCITEMENT AROUND HIM IN THE RING AND CROWD, PEOPLE
      TALKING, CHEERING, ETC...

      FOR NOW, IT'S PERFECTLY SOUNDLESS.

      Then, Billy's knees buckle...and he COLLAPSES to the canvas.
      On his back. Eyes roll to WHITE. His body in shock, CONVULSES
      VIOLENTLY -- as BLOOD fills his mouth and he starts to CHOKE.

      The team gathers around him, all shouting in Thai (We can't
      hear any of it).

      Nan rolls Billy onto his side, and blood pours out...

      Nan reaches into Billy's mouth, digs out his tongue.

      Officer Pi Sit shouts to all security, this terrible silence,
      and CUT TO--


195   INT. PRISON AMBULANCE (MOVING HIGH SPEED) - NIGHT - BILLY       195

      lies in back, eyes rolled, breathing erratic. A MEDIC puts an
      oxygen mask on his nose. The siren wails. We do not see the
      GUARDS faces as they drive Billy to the hospital.

                                                         BLACK.

196   EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAY - WIDE                              196

      The yard is empty. We hear a TRUSTEE'S VOICE over the
      loudspeaker:

                          TRUSTEE'S VOICE
                William Moore, yat yeim...William
                Moore, yat yeim.
                                                                95.


      No sign of Billy.


197   INT. VISITING ROOM - DAY                                        197

      A MAN is waiting (50's, white, UK). He is alone. No one else
      is in the visiting area.

      He is still for a VERY LONG MOMENT.

      Finally, a Guard emerges.

                          GUARD
                Sorry, Mister Moore. We no can find
                your son.

                           MR. MOORE
                    (nods)
                It's okay. I'll come back.

198   INT. GOV. HOSPITAL: RECOVERY ROOM (DAYS LATER) - BILLY          198

      stirs awake. He sees a light overhead and an air vent working.
      Billy takes a moment to get his bearings...Lying in a clean
      bed, white sheets, quiet surroundings. There's a large post-
      op bandage on his side where a drain was removed.

      Then Billy looks down, SEES his ankles are shackled/chained.

      A PATIENT in a neighboring bed stares at him awkwardly.

      HOLD ON BILLY, THIS VERY LONG AND AWFUL MOMENT...then, he
      slowly sits up, turns to a window, peers out;

      REVEAL NOW: We're in a GOVERNMENT HIGH RISE, overlooking the
      city of Bangkok -- 20 stories below. Billy pushes opens the
      window, BREATHING IN FRESH AIR...HE LOOKS OVER THE LEDGE...A
      LOOOONGGG WAY DOWN.

      There's a sudden SOUND. Billy drops back into bed, just as
      the door opens and a NURSE walks in.

                          BILLY
                Nurse. `Think I should go to the
                loo.

      Nurse helps Billy out of bed. She looks down at his chains,
      then hands him a SARONG.

      Billy wraps the sarong around his waist, covering the chains.
                                                                 96.


199   INT. CORRIDOR: GOV. HOSPITAL - BILLY                             199

      as the Nurse escorts him...They pass a GUARD seated at a
      nearby desk. He hardly glances over from the TV he's
      watching.

      The Nurse leads Billy around the corner to the bathroom. She
      waits as he goes in alone.


200   INT. HOSPITAL BATHROOM - BILLY                                   200

      pisses in the urinal, then goes to the mirror and looks at
      himself. He washes his hands and face. Then walks out...


201   INT. CORRIDOR: GOV. HOSPITAL                                     201

      ...and finds an empty corridor. The Nurse is gone. Billy
      peers around the corner, SEES the Nurse talking to an AIDE
      down the hall.

      PAUSE...THEN;

      Billy moves to an elevator and quickly taps the button.

      The elevator door slides open...and Billy FREEZES.

      Inside: is a DOCTOR and two NURSES. They all STARE at Billy.

                          DOCTOR
                Going down?

      Billy nods, steps in, SLOW, careful not to shake the chains.


202   INT. ELEVATOR (DESCENDING) - BILLY                               202

      avoids eye contact. Instead, he focuses on the floor lights
      dropping: 9...8...7- DING!

      Door opens: two more DOCTORS get in. Billy tenses.

      The descent resumes: 6- DING! Door opens again: now an
      ORDERLY w/a WHEELCHAIR PATIENT enters. Billy edges to the
      back corner;

      Floor by floor, the elevator keeps stopping. Rapidly filling
      with NURSES, DOCTORS, ORDERLIES and PATIENTS. We can FEEL
      Billy's panic in this now crowded elevator, descending
      agonizingly slow...

      It finally reaches the LOBBY. Everyone files out, until Billy
      is alone. He steps out carefully, minding the chains...
                                                              97.


203   INT. LOBBY: GOV. HOSPITAL - DAY - BILLY                        203

      turns a corner, into the LOBBY. It's full-to-bursting with
      PEOPLE waiting for medical attention. Some in plastic chairs,
      wounded and sickly. Some on the floor. Others on gurneys,
      shoved against the walls. The Staff under siege, outnumbered.

      BILLY'S POV: at the far end of the lobby, is the EXIT TO THE
      STREET.

      Pulse racing, nervous, Billy moves toward it...ever-tiny
      steps, so NOT to hear the chains...step by step. A few people
      look at him curiously. Billy, heart pounding through his
      chest now, just reaches the exit and --

204   EXT. HOSPITAL/CITY STREET - BILLY                              204

      bursts out. WE'RE IMMEDIATELY STRUCK BY THE ROAR OF BANGKOK'S
      RUSH HOUR. CARS/PEOPLE EVERYWHERE, OVERWHELMING BILLY AND US.

      Billy, sweating profusely, walks down the sidewalk, fast as
      the chains will allow (which isn't fast at all); He glances
      nervously back at the hospital, keeps walking....

205   EXT. BANGKOK: VARIOUS CITY STREETS - WITH BILLY                205

      One city block after the next, navigating crowds, unsure
      where he's going. He turns down a quiet street lined with
      parked cars.

      He tries several car doors. All of them locked.

      Frustrated, scared, he looks across the street and STOPS.

      BILLY'S POV: A DRUG STORE. All lit up, open for business.

206   INT. DRUG STORE - DAY - BILLY                                  206

      enters. It's empty. No customers. He heads to the back for
      the pharmacy counter...then SLOWS when he SEES...

      AN ENORMOUS FLOOR-TO-CEILING WALL OF PHARMACEUTICAL DRUGS.
      (Painkillers, amphetamines, etc.)

      Billy stares, in awe.

      Billy's reverie snaps when a YOUNG PHARMACIST (Female, 25)
      appears behind the counter.

                          YOUNG PHARMACIST
                Can I help you?

      Billy just stands there. Staring. Realizes:
                                                              98.


                           BILLY
                ...no...


207   EXT. DRUG STORE - MOMENTS AFTER - BILLY                        207

      steps out to the street. Exhales.

      He watches people, cars, life go by. And suddenly it's clear.
      All the chaos in Billy's eyes is replaced with steel. He
      wants to live.

      And now he's walking. Toward the hospital.

      Walking faster. Determined. Faster and faster, toward the
      hospital as we....CUT TO:

208   INT. RECOVERY WARD + ROOM - DAY - GUARD                        208

      looks up from his TV, oddly, at Billy walking in, sweating.

                          BILLY
                    (smiles)
                -- How you doin'? Took a fuckin'
                helluva piss in there.

      Billy enters his room, hoists himself into bed-- and right at
      that moment, the Recovery Ward door opens: it's Officer Pi
      Sit. Accompanied by two other GUARDS with SHOTGUNS.

      Without a word, they help Billy out of bed, cuff his wrists.

209   E/I. BUREAU OF CORRECTION VAN - DAY, AFTER - BILLY             209

      is put in the back seat, next to Officer Pi Sit. The Guards
      up front, drive in silence....Then:

                          OFFICER PI SIT
                    (without looking at Billy)
                Why did you come back?

      BEAT. Billy looks at him.

                          OFFICER PI SIT
                You could be free. Why did you turn
                around?

                          BILLY
                    (caught, stunned)
                You saw me?

      Officer Pi Sit still won't look at him.
                                                                99.


                          BILLY
                I don't want to run anymore.

      Billy waits for a response; Officer Pi Sit doesn't give one.
      And as they ride in THICK SILENCE, en route back to prison...

                                                           CUT TO:

      TEXT ON SCREEN: After serving three years, Billy Moore was
      transferred to a UK prison and released on an amnesty by the
      King of Thailand in October 2010.

      Upon his return, he reconnected with his family.

      With the help of Narcotics Anonymous, Billy remains clean to
      this day, and works with other addicts who are in recovery.

      Now, a smile comes to Mr. Moore's face.

      Across from him, REVEAL: sits Billy.

      They look at each other for a LONG MOMENT, in deep silence.
      Emotion is palpable between them.
