          Sound of a piano being played. Sparse but beautiful.
          
                                                           FADE IN:
          
          
          INT. RECORDING ROOM - DAY
          
          HARVEY SHINE, mid-60's, sits at a piano in a scruffy
          recording room, tinkering. We hold on his slightly sad,
          intense gaze. Just then a shaft of crude light illuminates
          him, accompanied by a knocking sound. From behind a studio
          window, JOHNNIE, a young rocker type in his 20's beckons.
          Harvey closes the piano lid.
          
          
          INT. STUDIO - DAY
          
          Johnnie, unpacking his lunch and turning on various buttons,
          sits at a mixing desk. In front of him are 2 large TV
          monitors. Harvey joins him.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Put my score up first.
          
                              JOHNNIE
                    They don't want to hear it, Harvey.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I know, but I want to hear it. Put
                    it up.
          
                              JOHNNIE
                    I'm backed up already, Harvey.
          
                              HARVEY
                        (interrupting)
                    Johnnie, you were the one that was
                    late. Just put it up.
          
          Johnnie reluctantly presses various buttons.
          
          A `cheesy' commercial for a washing detergent plays. It is
          accompanied by a jolly classical score. Harvey looks on
          forlornly at his work. As it comes to an end with a flourish,
          Harvey lowers his head. Beat. Johnnie glances at him.
          
                              JOHNNIE
                    Listen, Harvey. Marvin wants me to
                    present my ideas while your away.
          
          Harvey looks up, confused.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Huh?
          
                                                                      2.
          
          
          
                              JOHNNIE
                    Look, I'm not doing myself any
                    favours here, Harvey. But, I'd
                    watch your back.
          
          We hold on Harvey's tired, pensive face.
          
          
          INT. STUDIO CAR PARK / QUEENS - DAY
          
          Harvey hurriedly exits the studio, catching up with a man
          walking to his car.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Marvin? Hey, Marvin?
          
                              MARVIN
                    Hey, Harvey. Shouldn't you be in
                    London?
          
                              HARVEY
                    Yeah, I'm heading there now. What's
                    going on?
          
                              MARVIN
                    Huh?
          
                              HARVEY
                    Johnnie said something about you
                    wanting him to present on Monday.
          
                              MARVIN
                    Oh yeah, No, I was just thinking
                    that, what with you being in London
                    - you should stay a while.
          
                              HARVEY
                    What?
          
                              MARVIN
                    There's no need to rush back. Enjoy
                    your daughter's wedding.
          
                              HARVEY
                    What?
          
                              MARVIN
                    Well, Johnnie can do it. I mean, he
                    can pitch the Samuelson account.
          
                                                          3.
          
          

          
                              HARVEY
                    No, I'm coming back. Those are my
                    connections. They have been for
                    years.
          
                               MARVIN
                    I know but... they've got new
                    people running things over there. I
                    think they're after something...
                        (beat)
                    ...different.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I want to come back. I should be
                    there in person.
          
                              MARVIN
                    `There in person'? Harvey, nobody
                    cares.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I have to stand behind my music!
          
                              MARVIN
                    They're demos! - They're already
                    pressed. No one needs to be there.
                    They're not looking for you,
                    they're not looking for me. They
                    just need a fucking track.
                        (beat/sighs)
                    Harvey, you haven't booked a top
                    line in 8 months.
          
                              HARVEY
                    You got me doing triangle chimes
                    for Christ's sake - give me
                    something to compose!
          
                              MARVIN
                    That's what I'm trying to tell you!
                    It's not about composition! It's
                    different now!
          
          Silence. Harvey looks at Marvin.
          
                              MARVIN (CONT'D)
                    What?
          
          Beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I'm back on Monday, Marvin. I'm
                    coming back.
          
                                                                     4.
          
          
          
          Beat.
          
                              MARVIN
                        (sighs)
                    You got to land this one, Harvey.
          
                               HARVEY
                    What are you saying?
                        (beat)
                    Say it!
          
                               MARVIN
                    I'm saying there are no more
                    chances, Harvey.
                        (beat)
                    Enjoy London.
          
          And with that Marvin gets in and drives   off, leaving Harvey
          standing alone in the car park. We hold   on his face - he's
          tired. He looks about him, then down at   his raincoat draped
          over his arm. He lifts it and drapes it   over the other arm.
          
                                                        CUT TO BLACK.
          
                               LAST CHANCE HARVEY
          
          Sound of interior airborne plane. The seat-belt `ping'
          chimes.
          
                                                              CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. PLANE - NIGHT
          
          Harvey, seated in a crowded economy cabin, looks down from
          the now extinguished seat-belt light. He looks a little hot.
          Reaching up to turn on the air, he knocks his tray - knocking
          his drink into his lap.
          
                                HARVEY
                    Shit!
          
          An attractive middle-aged woman, seated next to him, looks
          over.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        (to a passing Stewardess)
                    Miss? I'm sorry. I've spilt my
                    drink.
          
                              STEWARDESS
                    I'll get you some napkins.
          
                                                                   5.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                        (to his neighbour)
                    Why's it always me?
          
          The woman, perhaps wary of the length of the flight, smiles
          noncommittally. The Stewardess returns.
          
                              STEWARDESS
                    Shall I take that?
          
                              HARVEY
                    Thanks... And could I get another?
          
                              STEWARDESS
                    A whiskey, wasn't it?
          
                              HARVEY
                    Yes. `Jamesons', no ice.
          
          The Stewardess heads off. Harvey mops himself up. He places
          the small mass of wet towels on his tray and sighs. Glancing
          out the window, he then turns to the woman.
          
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    A holiday?
          
          The woman looks over.
          
                              WOMAN
                    No. Business.
          
          Harvey nods.
          
                              WOMAN (CONT'D)
                        (feeling obliged)
                    Yourself?
          
                              HARVEY
                    My daughter's getting married.
          
                              WOMAN
                    Congratulations.
          
                               HARVEY
                        (smiles)
                    Thank you.
                        (beat)
                    She's marrying an American. But for
                    some reason we've all got to go
                    over to London.
                        (smiling)
                    I told her we had a perfectly good
                    wedding system here.

                                                                     6.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        (beat/expecting more of a
                         response)
                    They both work there, you see.
          
          The woman smiles again, then looks up as the Stewardess
          returns with Harvey's drink.
          
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Thank you.
          
          Harvey is about to continue speaking when the woman
          interrupts.
          
                              WOMAN
                    I'm really sorry but I have a
                    meeting in the morning and I must
                    try and get some sleep.
          
                              HARVEY
                    No... Of course. I'm sorry.
          
                              WOMAN
                    It's just, I'll be useless - unless
                    I get some sleep.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Sure.
          
          The woman covers herself in a blanket and turns out her
          light, turning herself away from Harvey.
          
          We hold on Harvey from a distance, spotlit in a sea of
          darkness.
          
                                                        FADE TO BLACK.
          
          Sound of a commercial London Radio Station. A `phone-in'
          competition takes place.
          
                                                              FADE IN:
          
          
          EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING
          
          A radio hangs from a mail trolley. KATE, mid 40's, dressed in
          a green uniform, turns into the path of a suburban house. She
          passes a postman - who nods his head.
          
                              POSTMAN
                    Morning Kate. Looking lovely as
                    ever. If I was younger...
          
                                                                     7.
          
          
          
                                 KATE
                       Careful Paddy.
                           (pointing to her cheek)
                       Blushing! Is she up?
          
                                 POSTMAN
                       Oh yes.
          
          Kate smiles before unlocking the front door.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY - MORNING
          
          Kate comes through the door, picking up a small pile of mail
          off the floor.
          
                                 KATE
                           (calling out)
                       Mum. It's me - your daughter.
          
          
          INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
          
          Kate puts the mail on a kitchen table. Just then MAGGIE,
          Kate's mum, enters in her dressing gown.
          
                                 MAGGIE
                       Hello, my daughter.
          
          They kiss.
          
                                 MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                       Have a cup of tea with me.
          
                                 KATE
                       I can't, I'm running late.
          
          Maggie seems to ignore this piece of information and heads to
          the kettle. Filling it up, she peers out the back window.
          
                                 MAGGIE
                       He's at it again.
          
                                 KATE
                           (looking through her bag)
                       Who? At what?
          
                                  MAGGIE
                       The neighbour. Barbecuing or
                       something.
          
          We see her POV of her neighbour busying himself in his back
          garden. Smoke rises from a small garden shed.
          
                                                             8.
          
          
          
                              MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                    I heard he's from Poland.
          
                               KATE
                        (pulling a small package
                         from her bag)
                    So maybe Polish people like to
                    barbecue a lot. I'm leaving your
                    prescription on the table.
                        (beat)
                    You know, you don't have to keep
                    taking these - the Doctor said.
          
                               MAGGIE
                    I like to. It makes me feel better.
                        (beat)
                    Its 8 o'clock in the morning. Who
                    barbecues at 8?
          
                              KATE
                        (looking at her watch)
                    I've got to go. I'll call you
                    later.
          
          Kate's mum sighs and turns away from the window.
          
                               MAGGIE
                    Of course. Don't worry about me.
                    I'll be Ok.
                        (beat)
                    Have you got that date thing
                    tonight?
          
                              KATE
                    I don't know, maybe.
                        (kisses her mother)
                    Bye Mum.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    `Time and tide', Kate, as your
                    father liked to say.
          
          Beat.
          
                              KATE
                    Was that from his terrace in the
                    South of France?
          
          Kate winces. Kate's mum looks hurt.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    I'm sorry. That was mean.
                        (beat/takes a breath)
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                      9.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    Look, I'll call you later.
                        (kisses her mum again)
                    I love you.
          
          As Kate leaves, Maggie watches her go. She sighs, before
          returning her attention back to the window.
          
          POV: The Neighbour enters his smoking shed and closes the
          door.
          
          
          EXT. HIGH ST - DAY
          
          A busy High St. Kate moves amongst the throng boarding a bus.
          
          
          INT. BUS - DAY
          
          Close up on Kate's face gently swaying. She stands reading a
          paperback, oblivious to the crowded bus around her.
          
          
          INT. TRAIN - DAY
          
          Kate sits reading on a speeding train.
          
          
          INT. HEATHROW AIRPORT / TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY
          
          The Heathrow Express comes into the station. Kate disembarks.
          
          
          INT. TERMINAL 3 / BOOTH - DAY
          
          Kate arrives at a booth. A sign reads: `PSA - Public
          Statistics Agency'. A West Indian woman, dressed in the same
          green uniform, stands waiting. She holds a newspaper, folded
          open at the crossword.
          
                               KATE
                    Aggie.
          
                              AGGIE
                    Morning darling.
          
          Kate goes behind the counter and turns on a light. As the
          booth illuminates, Kate unlocks a door behind and goes in.
          Without looking up from her crossword, Aggie follows.
          
          
          INT. PSA / LOCKER ROOM - DAY
          
          Kate places her bag in a locker and takes out a pair of
          heels. Sitting down to put them on, Aggie enters.
          
                                                                  10.
          
          
          
                              AGGIE
                    Four across. A filmy layer on the
                    surface of a liquid?
          
          Kate thinks for a beat.
          
                               KATE
                    Scum.
          
          Aggie giggles to herself and writes it in. Kate stands just
          as another co-worker hurries in.
          
                              OONAGH
                    Sorry. Sorry.
          
          She kisses Kate on the cheek and opens her locker.
          
                              OONAGH (CONT'D)
                    Thank God you're my boss.
          
          Without looking up, Aggie `tuts' and shakes her head. Oonagh
          decides to ignore.
          
                              OONAGH (CONT'D)
                    Are we still on for tonight? Matt's
                    definitely bringing Simon.
          
                               KATE
                    No.
          
                               OONAGH
                    Please.
          
                              KATE
                    Only if you guys swear you won't
                    leave if it's not going well.
          
                               OONAGH
                    No way.
          
                               KATE
                    Promise?
          
                               OONAGH
                    Promise.
          
                              AGGIE
                    Seven down. Another word for
                    `souvenir'?
          
          Kate thinks for a beat.
          
                                                                     11.
          
          
          
                               KATE
                    Memento.
          
          Aggie laughs and scribbles it in. Oonagh rolls her eyes.
          
                              OONAGH
                    Aggie, why do you bother? You just
                    get Kate to give you all the
                    answers.
          
          Aggie `tuts' again and waves Oonagh away. Kate hands Oonagh a
          clip-board and the two of them head out.
          
          
          INT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL - DAY
          
          As luggage spews out, a dishevelled Harvey looks on. He sees
          his case and awkwardly pulling it from the belt, heads off.
          
          
          INT. ARRIVALS HALL - DAY
          
          Oonagh and Kate stand next to each other, interviewing
          returning travellers. Kate interviews an elderly couple. It's
          clear she's good at her job.
          
                              KATE
                    So you spent the whole 2 weeks in
                    the Toronto area?
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    Yes. Our daughter lives there, see.
          
                               KATE
                    Ah.
                        (filling in a form)
                    So not a business trip then?
          
                              ELDERLY MAN
                    Oh, no. Unless you count grand-
                    children as work.
          
                              KATE
                        (smiles)
                    Some might.
          
          
          INT. ARRIVAL DOORS
          
          Harvey comes through a set of sliding double doors, wheeling
          his case behind him.
          
                                                                  12.
          
          
          
          
          INT. ARRIVALS HALL - DAY
          
          Kate finishes up the interview with the elderly couple, and
          turns to see an approaching Harvey in the distance. She
          registers his attempts to steer a wide berth of her, but
          matches his movements, bringing him to a stop.
          
                              KATE
                    Sorry, I couldn't just ask you a
                    few very quick questions, could I?
          
                              HARVEY
                    I'm sorry, but I'm in a bit of a
                    hurry.
          
                              KATE
                    It won't take a moment.
          
                              HARVEY
                        (starting to walk on)
                    Look, I'm sorry, but I'm tired, you
                    know?
          
                                 KATE
                    Yes. I do.
          
          Beat. Kate's directness, brings Harvey to a stop. He turns to
          look at Kate. She smiles. Beat.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    I'm sorry.
          
          Harvey continues on, glancing back once more as he walks
          away. Kate turns to Oonagh and shrugs, before returning her
          attention back to the sea of arrivals.
          
          
          EXT. TERMINAL 3 - DAY
          
          A Taxi pulls away from the Terminal.
          
          
          INT. TAXI - DAY
          
          Harvey sits in the back with his phone to his ear.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Hi Suzie, it's your Dad. I've made
                    it in one piece. I'm in a Taxi on
                    my way to the Hotel. I guess i'll
                    see you all there. Can't wait. Love
                    you.
          
                                                                  13.
          
          
          
          Harvey hangs up. He dials another number.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Hi, it's Harvey, Harvey Shine here.
                    Just wanted to confirm Mike for
                    Monday. I'm in London at the
                    moment, but reachable on my cell.
                    Which is... Well you've probably
                    got it on file, but just in case,
                    917... Well you may have to dial an
                    international code first, I'm not
                    sure. Anyway, it's 917 749 7558.
                    That's 917 74...
          
          A sharp `beep' cuts him off. Harvey hangs up and looks out
          the window. Cranes loom on the horizon. He yawns.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL - DAY
          
          The Taxi pulls into the forecourt of a mid-market West End
          London Hotel. Harvey gets out and pays the driver.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY
          
          Harvey approaches the front desk.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Hi. I'm with the wedding party.
                    There should be a room for me.
                    Harvey Shine.
          
          The Concierge taps into his computer.
          
                              CONCIERGE
                    Yes. I have a double room for you.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Good. Has everyone else checked in?
          
                              CONCIERGE
                    I'm not sure, sir.
          
                              HARVEY
                    My daughter. Susan Shine. Or maybe
                    she's already going by Wright.
                    Susan Wright.
          
          The Concierge taps some more.
          
                              CONCIERGE
                    No, sir. No one of that name.
          
                                                                  14.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                    Do you have a Mrs Pearce?
          
          More tapping.
          
                               CONCIERGE
                    No, sir.
          
          The Concierge looks at Harvey. Beat. Harvey shrugs.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I'll go up.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY
          
          Harvey enters the room. He places his case on the bed, takes
          off his jacket and goes to the window.
          
          A roller blind is pulled down. Harvey tugs on the cord, to no
          avail at first. Then suddenly it whips up, causing Harvey to
          duck backwards as the flailing cord almost takes his eye out.
          
          Warily, Harvey steps forward and looks down at the busy
          street below. He goes to open the window but it is stuck. He
          tries again - but it won't budge.
          
          He looks around the room, then up at the now fully contracted
          blind. Tentatively he reaches up and pulls the cord to lower
          the blind a little. It slowly starts to unravel and
          unravel...and unravel, until it hits the bottom of the window
          sill with a gentle thud. Harvey stands in semi-darkness.
          
          Just then, to his relief, his phone rings. He hurries over to
          the bed and retrieves it.
          
                               HARVEY
                    Hello?
                        (beat)
                    Suzie! Hi darling. Yes, I'm here.
                    Where are you - where is everyone?
                        (listens/Harvey's face
                         drops a little)
                    Oh...I see. No, I didn't realise. I
                    thought the plan was for everyone
                    to stay together.
          
          Noticeably dejected, Harvey sits down on the bed.
          
                               HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    No its...fine. I just wasn't sure.
                        (beat)

                               HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    So your mother has rented a house
                    for you all.
                        (beat)
                    I see. No, no, don't be silly. I'm
                    a big boy. It's fine.
          
          Harvey looks around the bland room.
          
                               HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Home from home.
                        (beat)
                    Yes, I've got the address. So, I'll
                    see you there.
                        (beat)
                    I love you too. Bye.
          
          Harvey hangs up.
          
          
          EXT. STREET - DUSK
          
          Kate, dressed for the evening, hurries along a street. Her
          phone rings.
          
                                 KATE
                    Mum?

          Kate's mum stands not far from her back window.

                    haven't you heard?
          
                                                                     16.

                              MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                    Now don't be nervous. Just be
                    yourself.

                    Oh, listen. I've been thinking
                    about Greece for our holiday.

                    Ok, Let's talk about it later.
                        (beat)
                    I love you too.
          
          Kate hangs up and crosses a busy road.

          Kate's mum continues to spy. POV: The Neighbour bends down
          out of sight. On rising again, he sees Maggie at the window
          and waves. Maggie flinches, before dropping the curtain.
          
          
          INT. PUB - DUSK
          
          Kate comes through the door. Oonagh sits on her own at a
          booth. Kate joins her.
          
                                                                     17.

                    Sorry i'm late.
          
                              OONAGH
                    Don't tell me...
                        (makes the gesture of a
                         telephone)
                    ...your mother?
          
                              KATE
                    She's worrying about her new
                    neighbour. Says he barbecues a lot.
          
                              OONAGH
                    Very suspicious.
          
                              KATE
                        (smiles)
                    I know.
          
                              OONAGH
                    I got you the same as me.
                        (off Kate's gaze)
                    They're at the bar. He seems very
                    nice.
          
          Just then two guys approach from the bar.
          
                                MATT
                    Hey Kate.
          
                                KATE
                    Hi Matt.
          
          Matt embraces Kate, then turns to his friend.
          
                              MATT
                    Kate, this is Simon.
          
                                SIMON
                    Hi.
          
          Simon shakes Kate's hand. Kate blushes ever so slightly.
          
                                KATE
                    Hi.
                        (beat)
                    You work with Matt?
          
                              SIMON
                    Yes. If you can call it work.
          
                                                                  18.

                         eagerly)
                    Right.
          
          Awkward pause.
          
                               OONAGH
                    Come on, i'm feeling small down
                    here. Sit!
          
          They all sit down.

          INT. BEDROOM - DUSK
          
          Harvey puts on a cream linen jacket, that matches a pair of
          slacks. He looks at himself in a full length mirror. He looks
          good. There is a knock at the door, just as his phone rings.
          
                              VOICE (O.S.)
                    Room service.
          
          Harvey opens the door, as he answers his phone.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Just over by the bed. Thank you.
                    Hello?
          
          A young African man wheels in a trolley with a pot of tea and
          some biscuits.
          
                              YOUNG AFRICAN MAN
                    Shall I open this for you?
          
          He heads towards the window. Harvey turns.
          
                                HARVEY
                    Careful!
          
          Too late. The blind wips up - toggle hitting the young man in
          the eye.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Are you Ok?
          
          The porter, covering his eye, nods, backing towards the door.
          
                                                                  19.
          
          
          
                              YOUNG AFRICAN MAN
                    Oh, yes. Yes, fine.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Are you sure? Here.
          
          Harvey wedges a fiver into his free hand as he retreats
          rapidly. The door closes. Beat. Harvey returns the phone to
          his ear.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Hello?
          
          No answer. He sits down on the bed and pours some tea. Just
          then his phone rings again. He reaches for it, knocking the
          trolley and the tea onto himself.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Fuck!
          
          Grabbing a tea towel, he dabs his trousers.
          
          
          INT. PUB - NIGHT
          
          From a distance, across a crowded Friday night bar, we watch
          our gang chat. It seems to be going well. Laughter hangs in
          the air.
          
          
          EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          A cab pulls up in front of a posh looking restaurant. Harvey
          steps out, dressed in the same cream jacket, but now sporting
          a pair of dark trousers. He looks like a bad lounge act. The
          cab pulls away as Harvey turns towards the restaurant.
          
          
          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          Harvey enters. Three young men stand to one side, chatting
          animatedly. On seeing Harvey, one of them looks up.

                    Scott.
          
                              SCOTT
                    You made it.
          
                                                           20.
          
          
          
                                   HARVEY
                      Yes.
          
          Scott turns to his friends.
          
                                 SCOTT
                      This is Susan's father, Harvey.

                      Harvey, this is my best man, Josh
                      Stillman and Pete Turner.
          
                                   HARVEY
                      Hi.
          
                                   FRIENDS
                      Hi.
          
                                SCOTT
                      How are you Harvey?
                          (glancing at Harvey's
                           attire)
                      Its great to see you.
          
                                HARVEY
                      Good thanks. Great.
                          (sensing his gaze)
                      How are you holding up?
          
                                SCOTT
                      Great.
                          (turning to his friends)
                      Can't wait to marry your daughter,
                      really.
          
          Laughter.
          
                                   HARVEY
                      No...
                          (beat)
                      Is she..?
          
                                SCOTT
                      She's through there. She'll be
                      thrilled you're here. I'll go and
                      find her.
          
          Just then Harvey's phone rings.
          
                                   HARVEY
                      Sorry.
          
          Harvey turns away and answers.
          
                                                                  21.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Yes.
                        (listens)
                    No, no, that's not right. I booked
                    Mike. It's important. I spoke to
                    him about it two weeks ago. I
                    booked him.
                        (getting flustered)
                    Have you told him its Harvey. It's
                    really important...
                        (suddenly conscious of
                         Scott's friends standing
                         nearby)
                    Just...Just get him to call me, Ok?
          
          Harvey hangs up. And putting on his `positive' face turns
          back to Scott's friends.
          
                               HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry.

                    What's your field, Harvey?

                               HARVEY
                    I'm a composer.

                    Sort of.
          
                              PETE
                    Cool. What kind of stuff?
          
                               HARVEY
                    Oh, you know, for...commercials,
                    that sort of thing. TV.
                        (beat)

                    of thing.
          
                              JOSH
                    I see.
          
                                                                  22.
          
          
          
          Slightly awkward pause.
          
                              PETE
                    Sounds profitable.
          
                               HARVEY
                    It can be.
                        (wanting to change
                         subject)
                    You guys work with Scott?
          
                              PETE/JOSH
                    Yes.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Oil, right?
          
                              JOSH
                    Futures, yes.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Well, I'm sure that's pretty
                    profitable too.
          
          The guys smile a little too readily.
          
                              JOSH
                    Sometimes, yes.
          
          Harvey tries to smile back.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Well, I'd better find my daughter.
          
                              PETE
                    Absolutely. Good to meet you,
                    Harvey. See you in there.
          
          As Harvey moves off into the adjacent room, the guys watch
          him go.
          
          
          INT. PUB / HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kate and Oonagh wait in line for the bathroom.

                    So?
          
                              KATE
                    He seems nice.
          
                                                                  23.
          
          
          
                              OONAGH
                    Nice? Nice like good. Or nice like
                    dull.
          
                              KATE

                              OONAGH
                    Old enough. Your age...ish.
          
                              KATE
                    He can't be, he's looks like a
                    baby.
          
                              OONAGH
                    Alright, my age. But Matt says he's
                    very mature.
          
                              KATE
                    Oh right. Did Matt offer that up -
                    or was that in response to you two
                    discussing my approaching
                    barrenness.
          
                              OONAGH
                    Kate?
          
          Just then Kate's phone rings.
          
                              OONAGH (CONT'D)
                    Don't answer it.
          
                               KATE
                    I have to. She's on her own.

                    Just tell her you're busy.
          
          Kate nods and indicates that the loo is free. Oonagh goes in,
          as Kate answers her phone.
          
                              KATE
                    Mum?
          
          
          INT. DINING ROOM / RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          Harvey enters the room. He sees his daughter, standing off to
          one side, with Scott, talking to some friends.
          
                                                                  24.
          
          
          She looks beautiful. He takes a moment to just watch her. As
          she turns in slight slow motion, she smiles on seeing her
          father and joins him.
          
                                 SUSAN

                    Thank you.
          
          Slightly awkward pause.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Give us a hug then, as they say in
                    this country.
          
          They embrace. Beat. Off Susan's look...
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    I know, I look ridiculous.
          
                              SUSAN
                    No. You look...
          
                              HARVEY
                    Like a bad lounge act.
          
          Susan smiles at her Father. Beat.
          
                               HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    I spilt something on my trousers.

                    I've been doing that a lot

          Harvey looks over at Scott in the distance, sharing a laugh
          with his buddies.
          
                                 SUSAN
                    Dad.

                    Long way to come to see two
                    American kids get married.
          
          Susan looks at her father, a little irked.
          
                              SUSAN
                    Sorry for the inconvenience, Dad.

                    Have you seen mum yet?
          
                              HARVEY
                    No. They're here?
          
                              SUSAN
                    Yes. They're over by our table.
          
          Harvey looks over.
          
                              SUSAN (CONT'D)
                    Please Daddy.

                    I'll be good.
          
          Just then, they are approached by Scott guiding some friends
          over to say hello.
          
                              SCOTT
                    Look who i've got!
          
          Susan's girlfriends shriek with delight as they approach.
          Susan turns to greet them.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I'll speak to you later Suz. You
                    enjoy your friends.
          
          As Susan greets her friends, Harvey retreats.
          
          
          INT. PUB - NIGHT
          
          Kate rejoins the others. Oonagh and Matt are standing. Matt
          has his jacket on.
          
                              OONAGH
                        (to Kate)
                    We've gotta go. Problem at home.
                    Baby-sitter just rang. Nothing
                    serious.

                               OONAGH (CONT'D)
                        (beat)
                    But you guys stay.
          
          Kate makes eyes at Oonagh, who shrugs innocently. Oonagh goes
          to kiss Kate, while Matt says goodbye to Simon.
          
                               OONAGH (CONT'D)
                        (under breath)
                    Enjoy yourself - you miserable cow.
                    And turn off that phone.

                    Are you working tomorrow?
          
                              KATE
                    Yes. Half-day.
          
                              OONAGH
                    I'll see you Tuesday.
          
          Oonagh kisses Kate and heads off with Matt, leaving Kate
          standing slightly awkwardly next to a seated Simon.
          
                              SIMON
                    Looks like we've been set up.
          
                                 KATE
                    Yes.

                    Sorry.
          
                              SIMON
                    No. It's not your fault. I mean,
                    I'm fine with it. I mean, I'm happy
                    to meet new people.
          
                              KATE
                    Yes, me too.
          
                              SIMON
                    Why don't you sit down?
          
                                 KATE
                    Yes.
          
          Kate sits down.
          
                              SIMON
                    So you're Oonagh's boss?
          
                                 KATE
                    Yes.

                    Sorry, I'm saying `yes' a lot.

                    Yes.
                        (smiles)
                    You are.
          
          They share a smile.
          
                              SIMON (CONT'D)
                    Do you want another drink?
          
                              KATE
                    Ye...
                        (smiles)
                    Sure. I can get them.
          
                              SIMON
                    No, it's fine. What do you fancy?
          
                              KATE
                    I'll have another white wine.
                    Anything dry.
          
          Simon heads off to the bar. Kate watches him go. She allows
          herself a smile.
          
          
          INT. RESTAURANT/BAR AREA - NIGHT
          
          Harvey stands at the bar and downs a whiskey. Picking up
          another glass, he turns away, and with drink in hand,
          approaches a group of people standing around a table. As he
          nears, a distinguished older man with a healthy main of white
          hair sees him and momentarily touches the arm of the woman
          standing next to him. She turns around to see Harvey
          approaching.
          
                                JEAN
                    Harvey.
          
                                HARVEY
                    Jean.
          
          Harvey turns his gaze to the white haired man and nods.
          
                                HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Brian.
          
                              BRIAN
                    Harvey. Good to see you.
          
          There is a palpable sense of tension in the air.
          
                                                         28.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                        (deliberately only
                         directed to Jean)
                    So our baby girl is really getting
                    married. Who would've thought?
          
                              JEAN
                    Yes.
          
                              BRIAN
                    Harvey you remember the Watsons.
                    Barry and Jill.
          
          Harvey turns to a couple, standing nearby.
          
                              HARVEY
                        (slight sarcastic tone)
                    Of course I do. Hell, its been a
                    while. I guess, not since Jean and
                    I split up.
          
                              JILL
                    Hi Harvey. You look well.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Thank you, Jill. You're looking
                    well too. Both of you. I guess you
                    guys stayed in touch with Jean.
          
          Awkward Beat.
          
                              BRIAN
                    Barry and I work together now.
          
                              HARVEY
                    No kidding? Insurance?
          
                              BARRY
                    No.

                    Property, now. A small portfolio
                    down in Florida.
          
                               HARVEY
                    Real Estate. That's great.
                        (beat)
                    That's really great.
          
          Awkward silence.
          
                                                                  29.
          
          
          
                              BRIAN
                    Well I think we should sit. I know
                    Susan wanted us all seated before
                    they joined us.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Sure. Good idea.
          
          Everyone begins to take their assigned seats. Harvey is on
          the inside close to the middle. It's a bit tight and involves
          people getting up to make way. Harvey gets to his seat and is
          just about to sit when his phone rings. Brian and Jean share
          a look. Taking it out of his pocket Harvey looks at the
          incoming number.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry, I have to take this.
                        (picks up)
                    Can you hold a minute?
          
          Harvey makes his way back along the table, causing people to
          stand again.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry. Sorry.
          
          Harvey walks away from the table.
          
          
          INT. PUB - NIGHT
          
          Kate sits waiting. Simon has finally been served and turns
          from the bar with drinks in hand. As he does a young woman,
          standing with a small party of two other girls and a guy,
          greets him. Kate looks on. It's obvious from Simon's reaction
          that they know each other well. Just then Kate's phone rings
          again. She looks at the number and thinks about ignoring it,
          but in the end, reluctantly picks up.
          
                               KATE
                    Mum. You've got to stop calling.
                        (beat)
                    What? I can't hear. Hold on.
          
          Kate gets up and moves towards the back-room.
          
          
          INT. RESTAURANT FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Harvey stands on the phone.
          
                                                                 30.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                        (getting more and more
                         flustered)
                    It'll take two hours max. No
                    longer.
                        (listens)
                    Have you told him its Harvey? Look,
                    we go back! He'll tell you. Just
                    have him call me.
          
          
          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          Harvey returns to the table. Everyone is seated.
          
                               HARVEY
                    Sorry...
          
          He notices his name place has been moved to the end.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        (smiling/to Jean)
                    Did you move me darling?
          
                              JEAN
                    No, Harvey. I didn't touch it.
          
                              SUSAN
                    Dad. I moved you. I thought it
                    might be easier in case you needed
                    to get out.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Ok, sweetheart.
          
          Harvey takes the last remaining seat. Brian stands.
          
                               BRIAN
                    Shall we have a quick toast to get
                    things going?
                        (beat)
                    I'm going to save my big speech for
                    tomorrow.
                        (laughter)
                    Dear Susan and Dear Scott, I just
                    want to take us all back to that
                    wonderful holiday we all had in
                    Rome together last year and wish
                    you `Salute'!

                              BRIAN
                    Jean and I love you both so much.
                    And we're so happy that Scott is
                    going to part of our clan now. And
                    so I say many, many, happy, happy
                    years ahead. Salute!

                    Salute!
          
                                 HARVEY
                    My turn?
          
          Everyone turns to Harvey as he stands to make a speech. Just
          then his phone rings on vibrate.
          
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry.
          
          Harvey scrambles to turn it off, as Jean rolls her eyes.
          
                               HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry, I thought it was off.
                        (flustered he finally
                         manages to stop it
                         buzzing)
                    Um, uh.
                        (beat)
                    To Susan and Scott. A great couple.

                    Cheers.
          
          Momentary awkward silence.
          
                                 EVERYONE
                    Cheers.
          
          Harvey sits.
          
                                 SUSAN
                    Let's eat.

                    Yes...
          
          Everyone tucks in. Harvey sits slightly blushing at the end
          of the table, knowing he's blown it.
          
                                                                  32.

          Kate hangs up and returns to the main room, to find that
          Simon has been joined at their table by the young group. Kate
          bolsters herself before returning to the table.

                    Sorry, i bumped into these guys and
                    couldn't shake them.
                        (turning to his friends)
                    Everyone this is Kate.
          
          Kate holds up her hand, before blushing a little.
          
                              KATE
                    Hi.
          
                              SIMON
                    Kate this is Andrew, Melissa, Gwen,
                    and Elinor.
          
                              EVERYONE
                    Hi.
          
          Kate sits down.
          
                              MELISSA
                    Sorry, I hope we're not barging in
                    on your evening.
          
          Kate shakes her head.
          
                              MELISSA (CONT'D)
                    It was Simon's idea. How do you
                    guys know each other, anyway?
          
          Kate glances at Simon.
          
                              KATE
                    We don't really. We just met.
          
          Melissa looks at Simon and grins.
          
                              MELISSA
                    A blind date?
          
                                                                  33.
          
          
          
                                SIMON
                    No.
                        (beat)
                    We met through friends.
          
                              MELISSA
                    I see. I think we should leave you
                    guys alone.
          
                                KATE
                          (a little too abruptly)
                    No.
                        (beat)
                    Don't. Stay. It's fine.
          
          Slightly awkward pause, broken by Andrew.
          
                              ANDREW
                    Hey does anyone know the cricket
                    score?
          
                              SIMON
                    England were all out by tea, when I
                    last checked.
          
                              ANDREW
                    Bloody hell.
          
                              GWEN
                    Cricket. Don't get it.
          
                              MELISSA
                    What? Men in white. Oh, I do.
          
          Kate looks on as the girls laugh.
          
          
          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          Harvey sits at the end of the table, looking on, as everyone
          talks animatedly around him. He eats his food and drinks
          plenty of wine. Up near the middle Scott shares a joke with
          Brian. Just then Susan, who has been talking to the best man,
          turns and catches her father's eye. He smiles at her and
          raises a glass. Susan smiles back before returning her
          attention back to her neighbour.
          
          
          INT. PUB BOOTH - NIGHT
          
          Kate sits among the group. She too seems to be detached from
          the proceedings.
          
                                                                  34.
          
          
          
                              GWEN
                    I heard that they did it in her
                    bedroom, while she was away.
          
                              SIMON
                    It was her flat?
          
                              GWEN
                    Yep. He has his own, but was
                    basically living at hers.
          
                                ANDREW
                    Ouch.
          
                              MELISSA
                    That is evil.
          
          As the conversation continues in this vein, Kate glances at
          Simon. He seems more at ease in this company.
          
          
          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          The meal is drawing to a close. People have gotten up and are
          circulating around the table and nearby.
          
          
          INT. BAR AREA - NIGHT
          
          Harvey stands at the bar. He downs a drink. Jean approaches.
          
                                JEAN
                    Harvey.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Hello Jean.
          
                              JEAN
                        (to barman)
                    Can I get a glass of water please?
          
          The Barman obliges.
          
                                JEAN (CONT'D)
                    You Ok?
          
                              HARVEY
                        (Downing another drink)
                    Fine.
          
          Beat.
          
                                                        35.
          
          
          
                            JEAN
                  Go easy Harvey.
          
                            HARVEY
                      (getting quite loaded)
                  Why, Jean? Are you worried i'm
                  going to embarrass you again?
          
                             JEAN
                  No Harvey, I'm worried you're going
                  to embarrass yourself.
                      (beat)
                  And more importantly Susan. This
                  weekend's just about her and Scott.
                  Nothing else.
          
                             HARVEY
                  Oh, you're good Jean. You're really
                  good. You've always known how to
                  make me feel shit, haven't you?
                      (beat)
                  You've always been so good at that.
          
                            JEAN
                  I've had cause to practice.
          
          Beat.
          
                            HARVEY
                  Tell me, Jean. Were you ever proud
                  of me?
          
                             JEAN
                  Yes. Sometimes.
                      (beat)
                  But you never listened.
          
                            HARVEY
                  The parties Jean. The fuckin'
                  parties, where I would hear you -
                  dressing up what I did for a living
                  - film composer this, film composer
                  that - trying to make it more
                  palatable for your friends. I'm
                  a...
          
                            JEAN
                      (cutting him off)
                  Don't Harvey.
          
          Beat.
          
                                                                  36.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                    What is it you see in Brian?
          
          Jean looks into Harvey's eyes. Long beat.
          
                               JEAN
                    He doesn't talk about himself.
                        (beat)
                    He talks about me.
          
          Harvey stares back, momentarily transfixed, before turning
          away dismissive.
          
                              JEAN (CONT'D)
                    Go home Harvey. Go to bed and see
                    your daughter get married tomorrow.
          
          Jean walks away. Harvey stands at the bar. Susan comes into
          the room. She approaches.
          
                               SUSAN
                    Hi Dad.
          
                               HARVEY
                    Hey Suz.
          
                              SUSAN
                    Are you alright?
          
                              HARVEY
                        (upbeat)
                    Yeah. I'm great. How are you doing?
                    Enjoying yourself?
          
                               SUSAN
                    Yeah.
          
          Beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    He seems a good guy, Scott. You'll
                    be alright.
          
                               SUSAN
                    Yeah, he is.
                        (beat)
                    I'm sorry, I haven't had much time
                    to talk to you.
          
                              HARVEY
                    No Sweetheart, it's your weekend.
                    It's no problem. You just enjoy
                    yourself.
          
                                                          37.
          
          
          
          Beat.
          
                              SUSAN
                    How's work?
          
                               HARVEY
                    Great.
                        (beat)
                    Well, not great, but...fine. You
                    know the usual. Triangle chimes.
          
          Susan smiles.
          
                              SUSAN
                    Are you still doing your own stuff?
                    You should.
          
                              HARVEY
                    A bit... Not so much.
          
          Beat. Harvey looks away, then back.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Listen Suz, I'm really sorry about
                    having to leave early. It's just
                    bad timing. There's a sudden rush
                    at work, you know, a couple of big
                    jobs in at once.
          
                                 SUSAN
                    Sure.
          
                               HARVEY
                    It just can't be helped. But I'll
                    be there at the ceremony, at the
                    really important bit. I'll be there
                    to give you away.
                        (beat)
                    And then I'm sure Brian or your
                    mother will talk at the reception.
                    You know me, I've never been very
                    good at speech...
          
                                 SUSAN
                           (interrupting)
                    Dad.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Yeah, Suz?
          
                               SUSAN
                    Listen, I've been thinking.
                        (beat)
                               (MORE)
          
                                                                  38.
          
                               SUSAN (CONT'D)
                     Brian has been a really big part of
                     my life now for some time. And...
                         (long beat)
                     And I'm going to ask him to give me
                     away tomorrow.
          
          Silence.
          
                               SUSAN (CONT'D)
                     I'm sorry, Dad.
          
          The colour drains from Harvey's ruddy face.
          
                                  HARVEY
                     But Suz...
          
                               SUSAN
                     Dad, I've hardly seen you in the
                     past five years.
          
                               HARVEY
                     That's not true.
          
                                SUSAN
                     Dad, it is. Maybe a quick coffee
                     here, or a telephone call there but
                     no, you haven't been part of my
                     life. And...
                         (beat)
                     And Brian has.
          
          Beat.
          
                               SUSAN (CONT'D)
                     You having to leave early this
                     weekend. I don't know, it just
                     seems typical.
          
                               HARVEY
                         (flash of irritation)
                     It's work darling. It pays for
                     things.
                         (beat/sighs)
                     Sorry. Look, I...
          
                               SUSAN
                         (interrupting)
                     I'm sorry Dad, but it's what I've
                     decided.
          
          Harvey momentarily turns away from his daughter, to compose
          himself, before turning back.
          
                                                                     39.
          
          
          
                               HARVEY
                    Sure.
                        (beat)
                    I understand, Suz.
          
          Harvey leans in and kisses his daughter on the forehead.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    You go and be with your friends. Go
                    and enjoy yourself.
                        (pulls out his phone)
                    I gotta make some stupid calls. You
                    know. Go and enjoy yourself,
                    Sweetheart. I'll see you tomorrow.
          
          Susan reluctantly walks away as Harvey lifts the phone to his
          ear. We hold on his face. With Susan gone he lowers the
          phone. He looks frightened.
          
          
          INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Harvey enters the rest-room and heads to a bank of basins. He
          turns on a tap and bends down - drinking profusely. He
          splashes his face then rises and begins to dry it with some
          paper towels.
          
                              HARVEY
                    You fuckin' asshole!
          
          Harvey suddenly bends over as though he'd been punched hard
          in the stomach. He rises, red in the face, holding his nose,
          desperately trying to hold it in. But he can't - Harvey sobs
          huge heaving muffled cries...
          
          Just then, someone enters. Head down, Harvey lunges for the
          door and exits.
          
          
          EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          Harvey stumbles out of the restaurant and into a waiting cab.
          The cab pulls away.
          
          
          INT. PUB - NIGHT
          
          Kate sits surrounded by laughter. Simon's attention is firmly
          fixed on his friends. Kate's humiliation is magnified as we
          slowly move into her face.
          
                              KATE
                    Sorry.
          
                                                                    40.
          
          
          
          Kate gets up and walks away. Everyone momentarily stops
          chatting and looks to Simon, who shrugs.
          
          
          INT. LADIES - NIGHT
          
          Kate enters a cubicle. She sits down to have a pee. We hold
          on her sad face. She suddenly grimaces, before holding firm.
          But not before a tear has been expelled and rolls down her
          cheek. She swats it away.
          
          
          INT. TAXI - NIGHT
          
          We hold on Harvey's sad face as it gently bobs in the back of
          a moving cab.
          
          
          EXT. PUB - NIGHT
          
          Kate exits the pub, just as a cab pulls up. As Harvey exits
          one side, Kate gets into the other, as the cab pulls away
          again.
          
          
          
                                                     FADE TO BLACK.
          
                                                           FADE IN:
          
          
          INT. REGISTRY OFFICE - MORNING
          
          Bride and Groom stand at the head of the room, saying their
          vows. Harvey stands near the back, looking on. As the
          ceremony is concluded the audience spontaneously burst into
          applause. Harvey looks around the room, then back at his
          daughter, as she smiles giddily at her husband. Harvey slips
          out the door.
          
          
          EXT. STREET - DAY
          
          Carrying his case, Harvey hails a Taxi and gets in.
          
          
          INT. TERMINAL 3 - DAY
          
          Kate, back in green, stands next to a young couple asking
          them questions about their travel arrangements.
          
                                                                     41.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. STREET - DAY
          
          The Taxi comes to a stop in `classic' mid-day London traffic.
          
          
          INT. TAXI - DAY
          
          Harvey glances at his watch, then out at the mass of cars in
          front of them. His phone rings. He picks up.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Hello?
          
          The line goes dead. Harvey puts his phone away. He glances
          out the window again as the Taxi crawls forward, before again
          coming to a stop. Harvey leans forward.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Is there another way we could try?
          
          The driver, looking a little irked, glances at Harvey in his
          mirror.
          
                              TAXI DRIVER
                    It's going to be bad everywhere.
                    Your president's in town. It's
                    causing chaos.
          
          Harvey rubs his neck and glances again at his watch.
          
          
          INT. BOOTH - DAY
          
          Kate eats a snack, while reading a book. Her phone suddenly
          rings. She sighs quietly before slowly picking it up.
          
                              KATE
                    Mum?
          
          
          EXT. HEATHROW / TERMINAL 3 - DAY
          
          A Taxi pulls up. Harvey gets out, pays the driver and hurries
          into the Terminal.
          
          
          INT. TERMINAL 3 / CHECK-IN COUNTER - DAY
          
          The counter is mobbed. A long queue snakes away from it.
          Harvey hurries to the front, where a male Steward is
          attending to another passenger.
          
                                                                  42.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                    I'm sorry but, I'm on the 4.30 to
                    JFK.
          
                              WAITING PASSENGER
                    Hey pal, we're all in hurry.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Just hand luggage, can i go
                    straight to the gate?
          
                              STEWARD
                    Sir, I'm dealing with a passenger,
                    you'll have to wait.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Please. I've gotta make that
                    flight.
          
                              STEWARD
                    Sir, everyone is in a hurry. You'll
                    just have to wait.
          
          Harvey sees another Steward momentarily free, and turns to
          her.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Miss, i'm on the 4.30 to JFK. Can
                    you check me in?
          
                              STEWARD #2
                    I'm afraid that flight's now
                    closed.
          
                              HARVEY
                    But it's not yet 4! I just have
                    hand luggage. It doesn't take off
                    for another 40 minutes.
          
                               STEWARD #2
                    I'm sorry sir, but we have to close
                    the gate 45 minutes prior to
                    departure.
          
                              HARVEY
                    But I just have hand luggage.
                    Please. I've got to get on that
                    flight.
          
                              STEWARD #2
                    I'm sorry sir, there's nothing I
                    can do.
          
                                                                  43.
          
          
          
          Harvey looks around.
          
                              HARVEY
                    When's the next flight?
          
                               STEWARD #2
                    There's one at 8.30. But I     know
                    that's full. I can put you     on stand-
                    by, but I doubt you'll get     on.
                        (beat)
                    The earliest I can get you     on for
                    sure, is tomorrow morning,     10.30.
          
                              HARVEY
                        (shouts)
                    Jesus!
          
          People look over.
          
                               STEWARD #2
                    Sir, I'm sorry, but you have to
                    stay calm.
          
          Harvey looks about him.
          
          
          INT. TERMINAL 3 - DAY
          
          Harvey sits holding his phone. He dials a number, lifting the
          phone to his ear. He gets voice-mail.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Marvin. It's Harvey. Listen,
                    there's been a mess up, the traffic
                    was crazy. I'm going to have to
                    reschedule the pitch slightly.
                    Frank can set up. I'll email him
                    the cue numbers - he knows what to
                    do. And then I'll be there lunch-
                    time at the latest. I'll come
                    straight from the airport. I'll try
                    you again shortly.
          
          Harvey hangs up and stares at the phone. Beat. He looks up
          and around the Terminal. A young child has a tantrum nearby.
          Suddenly his phone rings.
          
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Hello?
          
                              MARVIN
                    I got your message.
          
                                                                  44.
          
          
          
                               HARVEY
                     The traffic was insane. But
                     listen...
          
                               MARVIN
                         (interrupting)
                     The traffic, Harvey? Jesus!
          
          Beat. Marvin sighs.
          
                               MARVIN (CONT'D)
                     Listen, Harvey. Stay in London.
                     Enjoy your daughter's wedding.
                     We'll talk when you get back.
          
                               HARVEY
                     It's fine, I'll be there lunch-
                     time. It's no problem. Steve knows
                     what I need. Mike's coming in. It's
                     all set u...
          
                               MARVIN
                         (interrupting)
                     Harvey!
          
          Silence.
          
                                MARVIN (CONT'D)
                     It's over.
                         (beat/sighs)
                     It's out of my hands Harvey. I have
                     people to answer to. We just can't
                     afford the space.
                         (beat)
                     We're letting you go.
          
                               HARVEY
                     Letting me go? Can't afford the
                     space? Marvin, I'll be there lunch-
                     time.
          
          Beat.
          
                               MARVIN
                     I'm sorry Harvey.
                         (beat/sighs)
                     Call me when you get back.
          
          The line goes dead. Harvey closes his phone. Beat. He stares
          ahead into space, then stands and walks away.
          
                                                                   45.
          
          
          
          
          INT. BOOTH - DAY
          
          Kate closes up the booth.
          
          
          INT. TERMINAL 3 / CHEZ GERARD (BAR/RESTAURANT) - DAY
          
          Kate sits at a table near the bar, drinking a glass of wine
          and reading her book. She glances up as a man enters. Harvey
          takes a seat at the bar.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Jamesons, no ice.
          
          The Barman serves Harvey. Harvey immediately downs it.
          
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Another.
                        (beat)
                    Please.
          
          The Barman refills his glass. Again Harvey knocks it back.
          Kate glances up from her book.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Another, please.
          
          The Barman glances at Harvey.
          
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    What?
          
                                 BAR MAN
                    Sorry.
          
          Harvey reaches for the now full glass. But knocks it,
          spilling it into his lap.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Shit!
          
          Kate looks up again, along with the few other patrons in the
          bar. Harvey registers their gaze.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry. Vulgar American.
          
          Kate smiles, before returning to her book. Harvey dabs his
          trousers with some napkins.

          
                                                                  46.
          
          
          
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                           (to himself)
                       I know, we don't raise our voices
                       in this country. It's not done.
          
          Harvey puts the sodden napkins down onto the bar. He looks at
          himself in the mirror behind the bar and rubs his chest. He
          sighs and glances around the room. He sees Kate and
          recognizes her.
          
                                  HARVEY (CONT'D)
                           (to Kate)
                       I'm sorry.
          
          Kate looks up. Beat.
          
                                    KATE
                       For what?
          
                                 HARVEY
                       For yesterday. I was rude. You
                       tried to ask me some questions.
          
          Kate nods.
          
                                 HARVEY (CONT'D)
                       You were just trying to do your job
                       and I was rude.
          
                                 KATE
                       I don't really remember, but I'm
                       sure you were. Most people are.
          
          Kate returns to her book. Beat.
          
                                    HARVEY
                       Good book?
          
          Kate looks up.
          
                                  KATE
                       It probably would be, if i could
                       finish it.
          
                                 HARVEY
                           (holds up his hands)
                       I get it.
          
          Beat. Harvey downs another shot. Kate looks up again.
          
                                 KATE
                       That'll help.
          
                                                                    47.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                        (looks over)
                    Sorry?
          
                              KATE
                    I said, that'll help.
          
          Beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Believe me, it will.
          
                              KATE
                    Right.
          
          Beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I reckon it'll help as much as that
                    trashy novel and a glass of
                    chardonnay.
          
          Beat.
          
                              KATE
                    O-kay.
          
          Harvey winces, lowering his head into his hand. Putting some
          money onto the bar, he turns and joins Kate, taking a seat at
          an adjacent table.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I'm really sorry. That was out of
                    line.
          
                              KATE
                        (looks up)
                    What? Go away and stop apologizing.
          
                              HARVEY
                    It's just that i've had a really
                    shitty day.
          
                              KATE
                        (looking back at her book)
                    Join the club.
          
                              HARVEY
                    No. I mean really shitty. Yours may
                    have been shitty, but mine was
                    shittier.
          
          Beat. Finally, Kate looks up again at this strange man.
          
                                                               48.
          
          
          
                              KATE
                    How shitty?
          
                              HARVEY
                    I missed my flight. I lost my job.
                    And my daughter who got married in
                    London today asked her step father
                    rather than me to give her away.
          
          Kate looks at Harvey sympathetically for a moment.
          
                               KATE
                    Not bad.
                        (beat)
                    But what can I do for you?
                        (beat)
                    Make it worse, maybe?
          
                               HARVEY
                    Let me make it up to you.
                        (beat)
                    Would you let me buy you lunch.
                    What time is it - tea time? I'll
                    buy you tea.
          
          Kate blushes ever so slightly.
          
                              KATE
                    That's very sweet of you, but... I
                    don't know you. And... you don't
                    know me.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Exactly. That's why we should have
                    lunch - tea.
          
          Kate can't help but smile. Beat.
          
                              KATE
                    Thank you, but...no.
          
          She indicates her book.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Because you've got your book. And
                    it's a good replacement for humans.
          
          Kate smiles and nods. Just then her phone rings.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    If that's for me I'm in the shower.
          
                                                                    49.
          
          
          
          Kate smiles as she takes out her phone and looks at the
          incoming number. She is about to answer, when she stops
          herself.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Aren't you going to answer that?
          
          She thinks for a moment, before putting the phone back.
          
                              KATE
                    No.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Should I take that as a hopeful
                    sign.
          
          Kate can't help but smile.
          
                              KATE
                    If it is, you could just give me a
                    little wider smile.
          
          Kate can't help but smile wider.
          
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
          
          Kate's mum pulls the phone away from her ear, perplexed by
          the lack of response. Her eyes wander to the window. Drawing
          back the curtain, she looks out. POV: The Neighbour, now
          sporting a white apron, busies himself as usual. He suddenly
          bends down and heaves what would best be described as a body
          bag onto his shoulder. As he stumbles under the weight, he
          carries it into the shed. Kate's mum turns away ashen.
          
          
          INT. CHEZ GERARD - DAY
          
          Harvey and Kate remain seated at adjacent tables. Muzak plays
          in the background. They are now virtually the sole patrons of
          Chez Gerard. Kate eats a salad and reads her book. Just then,
          Harvey's food arrives. Beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Look we are having lunch together.
          
                              KATE
                        (looks up and smiles)
                    No. We're having lunch next to each
                    other.
          
                                                                  50.
          
          
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Ah.
                        (beat/suddenly holds out
                         his hand)
                    I'm Harvey. Harvey Shine.
          
                              KATE
                        (takes it)
                    Kate. Kate Walker.
          
          Kate can't help but smile at Harvey's persistence. Beat. She
          puts down her book.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    So why aren't you at the wedding?
          
          Harvey, momentarily taken aback by the directness of Kate's
          question, is about to answer, when the sound of a vacuum
          cleaner erupts. Harvey and Kate look over to see a cleaner
          vacuuming the floor nearby.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Ah, that's better. I knew something
                    was missing.
                        (shouting over the din)
                    I had to get back for a work thing.
          
                              KATE
                        (over the din)
                    A work thing. For the job you just
                    lost?
          
          Beat.
          
                                 HARVEY
                           (over din)
                    Yes.
          
                               KATE
                        (over din)
                    I see.
                        (beat)
                    So, this job you lost. You liked
                    it?
          
                                 HARVEY
                           (over din)
                    Yes.
                        (beat)
                    No. Not really. They've beaten it
                    out of me. But its what i do - did.
          
                                                                 51.
          
          
          
                              KATE
                        (over din)
                    Which is - was?
          
                              HARVEY
                        (shouts)
                    I'm a composer.
                        (stops himself)
                    I write jingles.
          
          The vacuuming stops. They both look over, then back.
          
                                 KATE
                    Wow.
          
                              HARVEY
                    That's about the normal response.
          
                              KATE
                    Anything I would of heard?
          
                               HARVEY
                    Yes. Uh...Uh...
                        (long beat)
                    Well, maybe, I mean it maybe before
                    your time.
          
                               KATE
                        (smiles)
                    No, go on.
          
          Harvey smiles a little sheepishly.
          
                              HARVEY
                        (singsong voice)
                    You can take the Salem out of the
                    country - but you can't take the
                    country out of Salem.
          
          Beat.
          
                                 KATE
                    No.
          
                              HARVEY
                    It's a cigarette.
          
                                 KATE
                    Oh really?
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Forget it.
          
                                                                     52.
          
          
          
                               KATE
                    Ok.
          
          The vacuuming starts up again. They look over then back.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                        (over din)
                    Did you always want to write
                    jingles or was there something
                    more?
          
          Harvey laughs.
          
                               KATE (CONT'D)
                    What?
          
                              HARVEY
                    No, I just love the way you...you
                    just cut through it.
          
                              KATE
                    I'll take that as a compliment.
          
                               HARVEY
                    You should.
                        (beat)
                    I was going to be a Jazz pianist.
          
                              KATE
                    Were you good?
          
          Beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    No. Not enough.
          
          Harvey looks away.
          
                              KATE
                    I'm sorry, I can be nosey. I tend
                    to blurt stuff out.
          
          Breaking from his reverie.
          
                              HARVEY
                    No. I like it. I like it...
                        (beat/over din)
                    ...Alot.
          
          Vacuuming stops. Beat. Kate looks away.
          
                                                          53.
          
          
          
                               HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    It's a relief to find someone in
                    this country who actually says what
                    they feel.
          
                              KATE
                    Oh, haven't you heard?
          
                                 HARVEY
                    What?
          
                               KATE
                    That's all changed. We're a nation
                    changed. Ever since Diana, we've
                    unlocked ourselves. Everything's
                    flowing out.
                        (beat)
                    You guys showed us the way.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Just as we're trying to adopt your
                    stiff upper lip.
          
          Kate smiles.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    What is a stiff upper lip, exactly?
          
          Harvey tries to physicalize it.
          
                              KATE
                    No, I think, it's more this.
          
          Kate stretches her top lip.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I see.
                        (copies her)
                    How's that?
          
                              KATE
                        (top lip stretched)
                    Yeah you're getting there. Stretch
                    it out further.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Let me see again.
          
                              KATE
                    No, now you're doing a bulldog.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Like this?
          
                                                                  54.
          
          
          
                               KATE
                    No, now you look like you don't
                    have any teeth.
                        (beat)
                    Are they your own?
          
                               HARVEY
                    What?
          
                              KATE
                    Your teeth?
          
                              HARVEY
                    The front ones.
          
                              KATE
                    My dad had a front one that you
                    could just take out.
          
                               HARVEY
                    Really?
          
          As they sit there, lips stretched, nattering away, we start
          to pull back. Accompanied by a simple piano score we look on
          as they appear to us, momentarily, like an ordinary couple.
          
          
          EXT. CHEZ GERARD - DAY
          
          Harvey and Kate exit the restaurant. They stand opposite each
          other in the quietening Terminal.
          
                              KATE
                    Thank you. I...enjoyed myself.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Yes. So did I.
          
          Slightly awkward pause. Kate glances at her watch.
          
                              KATE
                    I should get going. I have a class.
          
                               HARVEY
                    A class?
          
                               KATE
                        (a bit sheepish)
                    Yes. A...writing class.
                        (beat)
                    Twice a week. Just something I do.

                               KATE (CONT'D)
                    I take the Heathrow Express. What
                    about you?
          
          Harvey hadn't really thought.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I don't know. I guess I'll stay in
                    a Hotel near here. My flight's in
                    the morning.
          
          Beat.
          
                              KATE
                    Well...it's been a
                    pleasure...Harvey Shine.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Yes. Yes it has.
          
          They shake hands, smiling. Just then Kate's phone rings
          again.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    There's your phone again.
          
                              KATE
                    Yes.
                        (beat)
                    Sorry. I'd better go.
          
          Kate turns and leaves. Harvey watches her go.
          
          
          INT. TERMINAL / HOTEL PHONE BANK - DAY
          
          Harvey picks up a hotel phone.
          
                               HARVEY
                    I'd like a room please.
                        (beat)
                    One night.
          
          
          INT. HEATHROW EXPRESS PLATFORM - DAY
          
          Kate waits on the platform as a train glides into the
          station.
          
          
          INT. TRAIN - DAY
          
          Kate stands in a crowded middle section. A mild commotion
          ensues down the other end of the carriage as somebody
          squeezes aboard at the last.
          
                                                                     56.
          
          
          
                              MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                    Sorry. Excuse me.
          
          Kate looks up to see Harvey making his way down the crowded
          carriage.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Sorry.
          
          People reluctantly make way for Harvey and his case. He
          finally arrives next to Kate as the train jolts forward.
          
          Momentarily losing his balance, Harvey steadies himself on a
          businessman's shoulder. Kate leans forward to help, as the
          businessman turns slightly irritated.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry.
                        (turning to Kate)
                    Hi.
                        (a little sheepish)
                    I thought i might as well stay in
                    town. More fun than a hotel next to
                    a runway, right?
          
          Kate nods. Harvey smiles a little sheepishly as the train
          speeds off.
          
          
          EXT. TRACK - DAY
          
          The train speeds past on its way into London.
          
          
          INT. TRAIN - DAY
          
          Harvey and Kate stand next to each other, gently swaying, in
          the crowded carriage. The businessman standing next to
          Harvey, talks loudly on his phone about his day's conquest.
          Harvey and Kate share a look. In a Keatonesque performance,
          Harvey, keeping his body rigid, slowly leans further and
          further away from the man, making Kate smile.
          
          
          INT. PADDINGTON STATION - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          The train pulls into the station. We watch as Harvey and Kate
          alight with the crowd.
          
                                                                   57.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. PADDINGTON STATION - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          They come to a stop outside. It's still light. A beautiful
          fall afternoon.
          
                              KATE
                    Taxi's are over there. They'll take
                    you to wherever you need to go.
          
          Harvey looks towards the Taxi rank.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    So, I guess it's goodbye again.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Yes.
                        (looks up at the evening
                         sky/beat)
                    So, I couldn't walk you to your

                    Stand near the curb so you don't
                    get splashed.
          
          Kate smiles.
          
                                 KATE
                    Sure.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Is that a yes?
          
                                 KATE
                    Yes.
                        (beat)
                    Why not?
          
          
          EXT. LONDON STREETS - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Montage: Accompanied by a wonderfully romantic little ditty,
          we watch from a distance as Harvey and Kate navigate the
          buzzing streets of central London. All is alive and well.
          
          Harvey drops his suitcase off at the same hotel he was
          staying in before.
          
          As they wander through the city, foreign students mingle,
          policemen chat, and office workers linger. London is at its
          best.
          
                                                                  58.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. SOUTH BANK - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          The sky glows a pale orange as Harvey and Kate walk and talk
          along the South Bank.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Yours is a beautiful city, Kate.
          
          Kate looks at Harvey a moment, then smiles.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    What?
          
                              KATE
                    Its just a funny way of saying it.
                    Quite old fashioned.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Really?
          
                               KATE
                    But i like it.
                        (beat)
                    Yours is glorious country,
                    Honeychurch.
          
          Harvey looks at Kate quizzically.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    It's a line from a book. `Room with
                    a View'.
          
          Harvey shakes his head.
          
                               HARVEY
                    I'm afraid I'm not much of a
                    reader.
                        (beat)
                    Too fidgety, I guess.
          
          Kate looks at Harvey.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    You think less of me.
          
                              KATE
                    No, we're just quite different,
                    that's all.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Is that bad?
          
                                                                    59.
          
          
          
                                 KATE
                           (thinks about it)
                    No.
          
          Just then Kate's phone rings again.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Both our phones ring a lot. We have
                    that in common.
          
                                 KATE
                           (smiles)
                    Ah.
          
          They come to a stop as Kate takes out her phone and looks at
          the handset display.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    Sorry. I should probably take this.
          
          Harvey nods.
          
                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                    Mum?
                         (beat)
                    I've been busy.
                         (beat)
                    No, I'm out. Yes with someone. No
                    someone else.
                         (beat)
                    Yes.
                         (looks at Harvey)
                    ...a man.
          
          Harvey smiles. We hear Maggie's warble continue as Kate
          listens. Beat.
          
                               KATE (CONT'D)
                    You did, did you?
                        (beat)
                    An actual body.
          
          Harvey looks at Kate. Kate shakes her head. Maggie continues.
          
                               KATE (CONT'D)
                    Mum. Listen. I'll come over
                    tomorrow and we can check it out
                    together.
                        (beat)
                    I have to go now. Just get an early
                    night and i'll see you tomorrow.
                        (beat)
                    I love you too.
          
                                                          60.
          
          
          
          Kate hangs up.
          
                                 KATE (CONT'D)
                    Sorry.
                        (beat)
                    My mother.
          
                              HARVEY
                    She worries about you?
          
                               KATE
                    And herself.
                        (beat)
                    She's convinced she's living next
                    to Poland's answer to Ted Bundy.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    I see.
          
          They start walking again.
          
                               KATE
                    She means well. She's just had a
                    tough run.
                        (long beat)
                    My Father ran off to France with
                    his secretary. Then mum got cancer,
                    about four years ago now. She's
                    fully recovered. But won't admit
                    it.
                        (beat)
                    She's basically bored. And my
                    continued `situation' as she calls
                    it, being single, is her major
                    distraction. Her pastime if you
                    will.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    I see.
          
                              KATE
                    Yes, my rotting eggs are her raison
                    d'être.
                        (grimaces/turns to Harvey)
                    Sorry.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    No.
          
                              KATE
                    I talk too much.
          
                                                          61.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                    No. I like it.
          
                                KATE
                    Do you?
          
                                HARVEY
                    Yes.
          
          Kate comes to a stop and looks at Harvey.
          
                                KATE
                    Hmm.
                        (beat)
                    Well, here we are. My class.
          
          Harvey looks up at a grey municipal building.
          
                              HARVEY
                    How long is the class?
          
                                KATE
                    An hour.
          
                               HARVEY
                    Can I wait?
                        (beat)
                    Sorry - I promise I'm not
                    `Bundyish'.
          
                              KATE
                        (smiles)
                    It's getting cold. You don't want
                    to wait.
          
                                HARVEY
                    Yes I do.
          
                              KATE
                        (smiling and backing
                         towards the building)
                    Careful, I might get the wrong
                    impression.
          
          Harvey shrugs.
          
                              HARVEY
                    What can you do?
          
                                                                  62.
          
          
          
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Maggie, very tentatively, lifts her curtain again. No sign of
          the `Killer'. Suddenly the doorbell rings.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          As Maggie, slowly approaches the front door, the doorbell
          rings again. She slowly leans in and peers through the peep-
          hole. POV: The Neighbour looms large. He holds in his arms a
          large `something' wrapped in paper.
          
          Maggie pulls her head away. Beat. She looks again. POV: The
          Neighbour bends down out of sight and then rises again,
          turning to leave. Maggie watches him go.
          
          
          EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          The door slowly opens. Maggie looks around then notices the
          `thing' wrapped in paper on the ground. She quickly picks it
          up and takes it inside.
          
          
          EXT. SOUTH BANK - LATE AFTERNOON
          
          As daylight fades, Harvey sits waiting. Through a large
          ground floor window, he watches Kate, as her class wraps up.
          As she comes out, he gets up and joins her.
          
                              HARVEY
                    How did it go?
          
                               KATE
                    Oh, the usual.
                        (beat)
                    Lovely mild-mannered Mike read us
                    the latest installment from his
                    Physcho-Sexual Thriller, and we all
                    tried to look at him in the same
                    way after.
          
          Harvey smiles.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    Shall we keep walking?
          
                              HARVEY
                    Yes.

          Harvey and Kate walk under Waterloo bridge past the second
          hand bookstalls. A man plays a saxophone melancholically.
          
                               KATE
                    Do you ever wish you could try a

                              HARVEY
                    What would yours be?

                         uniform)
                    Well, no green, that's for sure.
          
          Harvey smiles.

                    It would take place in Spain. A
                    little house inland.
          
                              HARVEY
                    And what would you do there?

          Beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Ok. So this house in Spain would
                    have a little cabana looking out
                    over the plains for you to write
                    in.
          
                                 KATE
                           (smiling)
                    Yes.
          
                                                                  64.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                    And a little stream running by, to
                    bathe in.
          
                              KATE
                        (smiling)
                    Sure.
          
                               HARVEY
                    I'm there.
                        (beat)
                    Sorry, that's if you're receiving
                    guests.
          
          Kate smiles, coming to a stop.
          
                              KATE
                    Sure, you can visit Harvey Shine.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Why, thank you Kate Walker.
          
          Just then a sort of Skiffle come Rockabilly busking act
          starts up. Two girls and a guy. They're great! Harvey and
          Kate stand amongst the crowd watching. The South Bank is at
          its vibrant best.
          
          
          EXT. SOUTH BANK - DUSK
          
          With the sound of the Skiffle act still playing in the
          distant background, Harvey and Kate take a seat on some steps
          over-looking the river. As darkness descends, street-lamps
          reflect off the water. They sit in silence. Then...
          
                               KATE
                    What happened Harvey?
                        (beat)
                    Between you and your daughter?
          
          Beat. Harvey shakes his head.
          
                               HARVEY
                    I don't know.
                        (beat)
                    Somewhere along the way I lost her.
                    I lost my family.
                        (beat)
                    I just woke up one morning and
                    realised i didn't belong.
          
          Beat.
          
                                                                  65.
          
          
          
                               HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    I'd always had this mean little
                    feeling in my stomach, that they
                    were a bit embarrassed by me.
                        (beat)
                    If you saw them now, with Brian,
                    Susan's step-father. You'd see,
                    they make more sense. They look
                    right together.
          
          Beat. Harvey looks out over the Thames.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    I've not been a great father.
          
          Kate looks at Harvey's sad profile. Beat. She thinks for a
          moment.
          
                              KATE
                    The reception. It's still going on?
          
                              HARVEY
                        (looks at his watch)
                    I guess.
          
                              KATE
                    Where?
          
          Harvey looks up.
          
                              HARVEY
                    The Grovesnor. Why?
          
          Kate looks at Harvey.
          
                              KATE
                    You must go.
          
                              HARVEY
                    What?
          
                              KATE
                    What the hell are you doing here?
                    You must go!
          
          Harvey shakes his head.
          
                              HARVEY
                    She doesn't need me.
          
                                                                  66.
          
          
          
                              KATE
                    Stop feeling so sorry for yourself.
                    She's your daughter, you're her
                    father. Go!
          
          Harvey shakes his head again. Kate is not about to give up.
          
                               KATE (CONT'D)
                    Harvey, it would be unforgivable
                    not to go.
          
          Beat.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    Harvey?
          
                               HARVEY
                    Wait. I'm thinking.
                        (beat)
                    Only if you come with me.
          
                              KATE
                    What?
          
                              HARVEY
                    Please, come with me. As
                    my...bodyguard.
                        (smiles)
                    As my friend.
          
          Kate momentarily blushes, then shakes her head.
          
                               KATE
                    Harvey, firstly, i'm not about to
                    go to anyone's wedding in a green
                    polyester work suit. Secondly it's
                    not right.
          
                              HARVEY
                    We'll find you a dress. If we find
                    you a dress, will you come?
          
                              KATE
                    No.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Please.
          
                              KATE
                    No.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Please.
          
                                                                     67.
          
          
          
                               KATE
                    No.
          
          
          EXT. BURLINGTON ARCADE - NIGHT
          
          Music/Montage: The song is the same as that played by the
          buskers. It's a fast, fun Rockabilly Skiffle thingy. We watch
          as Harvey and Kate buy a dress. (Handheld/Double speed).
          
          
          EXT. GROVESNOR - NIGHT
          
          A Taxi pulls up and out step Harvey and Kate. Kate looks
          fantastic on Harvey's arm as they walk up the front steps.
          
          
          INT. WEDDING RECEPTION - NIGHT
          
          A reception is in full swing.
          
          
          INT. LOBBY - NIGHT
          
          The doors close behind Harvey and Kate as they enter an
          elevator.
          
          
          INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT
          
          Harvey and Kate stand side by side in silence. They both
          smile a little anxiously - almost like teenagers.
          
          
          INT. RECEPTION FLOOR / HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          There is a loud `ping' as the   elevator doors open onto a
          hallway. Harvey and Kate step   forward. Down the hall, through
          some double doors we hear the   familiar din of a buzzing
          reception. Harvey momentarily   falters.
          
                               KATE
                    Come on.
          
          Kate encourages Harvey forward.
          
          
          INT. RECEPTION - NIGHT
          
          The doors open and Harvey and Kate enter. Heads turn. Jean
          looks up and sees Harvey with Kate. She shakes her head.
          Susan sees Harvey and gets up. She joins him.
          
                                                          68.
          
          
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Hey.
          
                                 SUSAN
                    Hi.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I didn't go.
          
                                 SUSAN
                    I'm glad.
          
          Off Susan's look, Harvey turns to Kate.
          
                              HARVEY
                    This is Kate. A... friend.
          
                               KATE
                        (sheepish)
                    Hi. Congratulations. You look
                    fantastic.
          
                                 SUSAN
                    Thank you.
          
          Slightly awkward pause.
          
                              KATE
                    I'm really sorry to gate-crash.
                    Your father sort of insisted.
          
                              SUSAN
                    No, it's fine. I'm sure...
                        (looks around)
                    ...there's room.
          
          Susan looks back at the full top table.
          
                              HARVEY
                    You get back. Don't worry about us,
                    we'll find a place.
          
                                 KATE
                    Yes...
          
                                 SUSAN
                    No.
                        (stops a passing waiter)
                    Could you find them a seat please.
          
                                 WAITER
                    Sure.
          
                                                                     69.
          
          
          
          Pete, acting as Master of Ceremonies, stands and clinks his
          glass for attention.
          
                              SUSAN
                    I'd better go.
          
                              PETE (MC)
                    And now for the best man's speech.
                    Except we seem to be missing the
                    bride.
                        (laughter)
                    Oh, no, here she is.
          
          Susan heads back and resumes her seat at top table. The best
          man takes the mic...
          
                              JOSH
                    Scott. What can I say...
          
          
          INT. RECEPTION / BACK TABLES
          
          The waiter leads Harvey and Kate to a table.
          
                              WAITER
                    I'm afraid this is the only place
                    left.
          
          The waiter shows them to a few empty seats at the children's
          table.
          
                              HARVEY
                    That's fine.
          
          Harvey and Kate take their seats. The kids stare at them.
          
                              KATE
                    Hi.
          
          A brace clad, large girl in a white frilly dress speaks.
          
                              GIRL
                    Are you Uncle Harvey?
          
                              HARVEY
                    Yes. I guess.
          
                              GIRL
                    I've heard about you.
          
                                                                  70.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                    Oh.
                        (beat)
                    You're not Miriam's kid are you?
          
                              GIRL
                    Yes.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Wow...You've...got big. I mean
                    grown up.
          
                              GIRL
                    I'm fourteen.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Wow.
          
          Kate feels someone's eyes on her and turns to her left to
          find a smartly dressed young boy of about eight, staring up
          at her with his mouth open. Kate nods her head.
          
                              KATE
                    Hello.
          
          The boy remains silent, keeping his gormless gaze fixed on
          Kate.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    Now you're not to dominate the
                    conversation tonight.
                        (turning back to Harvey)
                    Chatterbox to my left.
          
          Harvey smiles.
          
          
          INT. RECEPTION / TOP TABLE - NIGHT
          
                              JOSH
                    So without further ado, I'd like to
                    propose a toast to Susan for making
                    my friend Scott complete.
          
          The audience whoop and clap. Scott gives his best man a hug.
          Pete stands...
          
                              PETE (MC)
                    And now ladies and Gentlemen. It is
                    the turn of the Father of the Bride
                    to say a few words.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                  71.
          
                              PETE (MC) (CONT'D)
                    And tonight that task will be
                    carried out by the very charming
                    and distinguished Brian.
          
          More clapping as Brian stands. Kate glances at Harvey, who
          blushes.
          
                              BRIAN
                    Well, that's quite some speech
                    Josh. Quite something to follow.
                    But I shall try...
          
          Harvey suddenly stands and clears his throat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Um... Excuse me...
          
          Nobody really hears. He picks up his glass and a spoon and
          begins to tap it. People stir and turn to Harvey. Brian comes
          to a stop. Jean looks on furious. Silence.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry Brian... Sorry to interrupt.
          
          Everyone stares at Harvey. Silence.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    But you see I can't just sit hear
                    and watch somebody else give my
                    baby girl away. Susan's my daughter
                    and I'm her father. Not the best,
                    by far, but her father all the
                    same.
          
          A waiter brings Harvey a microphone.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Thanks.
          
          It's arrival slightly throws him.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Um... I should have prepared
                    something but... I guess it reminds
                    me of a joke...
          
          Harvey continually knocks the mic against his chest, causing
          terrible feedback.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry. Um...
          
          Then Harvey drops the mic. Jean stands up.
          
                                                                  72.
          
          
          
                                JEAN
                      For God's sake Harvey, don't make a
                      scene.
          
          Silence. Harvey stares out at the party. They all stare back
          at him. He glances down at Kate who smiles back. Harvey lifts
          the microphone up off the table and raises it to his lips.
          
                                 HARVEY
                      No Jean. I want to make a scene.
                      You know. I'm tired of being
                      embarrassed.
                          (beat)
                      If we can't make a scene on the day
                      of our daughter's wedding, then
                      when can we? I want to make a
                      scene. I want to shout! I wanna
                      tell the world how lucky it is to
                      have our Suzie in it!
          
                                SOMEONE IN THE CROWD
                      Yeah!
          
                                HARVEY
                      I wanna tell Scott, how damn lucky
                      he is!
          
                                UNCLE FRED
                      Hear, hear!
          
          People start to clap.
          
                                HARVEY
                          (smiling)
                      And also if he ever hurts her, I
                      know people in north of London.
          
          Laughter.
          
                                HARVEY (CONT'D)
                      Seriously though. Scott, I swear
                      you have found in Susan a bright
                      and passionate person. And a loyal
                      friend.
          
                                CONGREGATION
                      Hear, hear!
          
                                 HARVEY
                      And I can see from the way she
                      looks at you. From the way she is
                      with you, that she is...
                          (beat)
                                 (MORE)
          
                                                                     73.
          
                               HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    ...happy.
                        (beat)
                    And I thank you and welcome you to
                    the family.
          
          Harvey and Scott share a look. The room applauds loudly.
          
                               HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    And finally, if I can linger a
                    moment longer. I would like to turn
                    it back over to Brian, with a note
                    of... gratitude.
                        (beat)
                    Thank you for being there for my
                    baby girl. Thank you for being
                    there, when I wasn't.
          
          Beat. Brian nods to Harvey, before standing and raising his
          glass.
          
                               BRIAN
                    If you would all please join Harvey
                    and I, in a toast.
                        (beat)
                    To Susan and Scott.
          
                              CONGREGATION
                    Susan and Scott!
          
          Everyone claps loudly. Susan shares a gentle smile with her
          Father. Harvey sits and looks at Kate anxiously. Kate smiles
          and nods.
          
                                 KATE
                    Well done.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Really?
          
          She indicates to the rest of the table. Harvey turns to their
          now animated young neighbours, who all sit clapping.
          
          
          INT. RECEPTION / BANDSTAND - NIGHT
          
                              PETE (MC)
                    Ladies and Gentlemen, the first
                    dance.
          
          The BAND strike up as Susan and Scott take to the dance
          floor. They dance a slow dance. Harvey and Kate sit watching.
          
                                                                     74.
          
          
          
          After a while Susan, looks over for her Father. Harvey
          hesitates, before Kate encourages him up. She plucks a flower
          from the table display and places it in his lapel.
          
          Harvey joins Susan and Scott on the dance-floor. Shaking
          Scott's hand, he leads Susan into a dance.
          
                              SUSAN
                    Thanks for coming back Dad.
          
          Beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Thanks for having me back.
          
          Kate looks on, as Harvey dances happily with his daughter.
          Feeling something, she turns to find the eight year old's
          head slumped against her shoulder as he sleeps soundly. Kate
          smiles at her lot.
          
          Back on the dance-floor, Harvey encourages Brian to take over
          the dance with Susan. Harvey turns away and is joined by
          Uncle Fred and gang. They all chat animatedly. Uncle Fred
          pushes Harvey into a dance with his wife. A `Boogie' strikes
          up.
          
          Kate looks on as Harvey dances and reunites with his extended
          family. She sees the delight in his face. She looks around at
          all the happy faces. It's time perhaps to let the family
          celebrate alone.
          
          Extricating herself from the sleeping boy, she pushes two
          chairs together and makes a bed for him. Covering him in a
          jacket, she glances back at the dance-floor before turning to
          leave.
          
          Back on the dance-floor, a `Boogie' is in full swing. Harvey
          caught up in the fun, energetically swings Aunt Maddie
          around. He suddenly catches himself and turns to his table to
          look for Kate, but finds it empty save for a row of dozing
          children.
          
          Harvey makes his excuses and turns away, looking for Kate
          amongst the crowded room.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          Kate retrieves her coat and makes her way down the hall
          towards the bank of elevators.
          
                                                                     75.
          
          
          
          
          INT. RECEPTION - NIGHT
          
          Harvey hurries to the exit.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          On turning into the hall, he sees Kate standing in the
          distance. Just then, she steps forward and out of sight.
          Harvey runs.
          
          
          INT. ELEVATOR / CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kate stands in the empty elevator, waiting for the doors to
          close. She stares at her feet. Just then we hear a burst of a
          piano being played. It stops. Kate looks up to see, across
          the hallway, in an empty conference room, Harvey seated at a
          grand piano. He smiles a showman's smile before giving it
          another `old school' burst.
          
          He stops again. Kate smiles. Just then the doors begin to
          close. Kate reaches forward and presses a button - opening
          them.
          
          Harvey starts up again - but this time he plays something
          sincere - beautiful. Kate listens before slowly stepping out
          of the elevator. She walks towards him, joining him at the
          piano.
          
          
          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Harvey slides along the seat and indicates for Kate to join
          him. She does so and listens as Harvey plays beautifully.
          He's good.
          
          He finally brings the piece to an end.
          
                                 KATE
                    Wow.
          
          Harvey blushes.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    One of yours?
          
          Harvey smiles at Kate.
          
                                                         76.
          
          
          
                               HARVEY
                    You are very kind. But...no.
                        (beat)
                    Shearing doing Rogers.
          
                              KATE
                    Ah.

                    Well...you play it very well.

                        (bows his head a
                         little/with a smile)
                    Well, thank you Ms. Walker.
          
                              KATE
                    You're most welcome, Mr Shine.
          
          They share a little smile. Beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Me thinks you were leaving?
          
                              KATE
                    Indeed I was, Sire.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Why?
          
          Beat.
          
                              KATE
                    Because you looked happy.
          
          Harvey looks quizzically at Kate. Beat.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    You should be with your family,
                    Harvey.
          
                              HARVEY
                    But, you know, maybe I want to be
                    with you.
                        (beat/sings)
                    You make me happy - when skies are
                    grey.
          
          Kate smiles.
          
                              KATE
                    Careful, Harvey. I'm blushing.
          
          Beat.
          
                                                                  77.
          
          
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Thank you.
          
                                 KATE
                    For what?
          
                              HARVEY
                    For making me come here.
          
          Beat.
          
                              KATE
                    You're welcome.
          
          They share a look, before both looking away. Beat.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Can I?
          
                                 KATE
                    What?
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Can I...?
          
          Just then a vacuum cleaner sounds. They both look up - as a
          cleaning lady vacuums the floor nearby. Beat.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Hey kid, they're playing our song.
          
          Kate smiles.
          
                                 KATE
                    Yes.
          
          In the background we hear clapping and cheering coming from
          the reception. A funky number starts up. Harvey takes Kate's
          hand.
          
                              HARVEY
                        (excited)
                    Come on. I want you to meet people.
                    I want them to meet you.
          
          Harvey leads a slightly reluctant Kate back down the hall
          towards the reception.
          
          
          INT. RECEPTION - NIGHT
          
          The band let rip on a funky tune. The congregation fill the
          dance-floor.
          
                                                                  78.
          
          
          Harvey leads Kate back into the room and heads straight for
          the dance-floor. As they pass relatives along the way, Harvey
          introduces them to Kate. Much hugging and kissing ensues.
          
          Harvey and Kate dance a boogie. Uncle Fred and Aunt Maddie
          join them. Uncle Fred steals Kate from Harvey and twirls her
          off.
          
          MONTAGE: Fun and Frolics on the dance-floor. Harvey is at the
          center of it all. He initiates a Horah. A Congo line. Russian
          dancing! Kate's face says it all - she's having a ball. The
          sleeping kid, sleeps.
          
          
          INT. RECEPTION / BANDSTAND - NIGHT
          
          Close up on the M.C.
          
                              PETE (MC)
                    Ladies and Gentlemen. The bride and
                    groom are about to leave. Please
                    join me outside to send them off in
                    style.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL STEPS - NIGHT
          
          Harvey and Kate join the rest of the congregation outside on
          the steps of the hotel. Harvey looks on as his daughter and
          son-in-law head to an awaiting car. Susan stops and throws
          the bouquet behind her. It is caught by Aunt Maddie, who in
          turn throws it and it is caught by Harvey's `all grown up'
          niece. She blushes profusely revealing an impressive set of
          braces on her teenage teeth.
          
          Susan kisses her mother and Brian goodbye. And is about to
          get into the car when she stops and hurries over to Harvey.
          
                                 SUSAN
                    Bye Dad.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Bye Suz... Bye Susan.
          
          She hugs him tightly. Pulling away she turns to Kate.
          
                              SUSAN
                    Be gentle with him.
          
          Kate nods as Susan turns to leave.
          
                              HARVEY
                        (to Kate)
                    Sorry.
          
                                                                    79.
          
          
          
          Kate smiles. As the car pulls away, everyone   cheers. Harvey
          looks on. His eyes momentarily lock onto his   ex-wife's. They
          share a conciliatory look. As Harvey watches   his daughter's
          car disappear down the street, Kate looks at   him. He turns
          back. Beat.
          
                              KATE
                    You Ok?
          
                              HARVEY
                    Yes. Yes, I am.
          
          Beat. Harvey looks around.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    You wanna get out of here?
          
                              KATE
                    Sure.
          
          
          EXT. MEWS STREET - NIGHT/DAWN
          
          Harvey and Kate walk. The streets are quiet. There is already
          a hint of dawn in the sky. Rubbish trucks manoeuvre.
          
          
          EXT. SOMMERSET HOUSE - DAWN
          
          They turn into the courtyard of Sommerset House and take a
          seat on some chairs. The sky lightens.
          
                              KATE
                    I don't think I've stayed up all
                    night since I was a student.
          
          They stare out over the courtyard. Silence. Harvey looks at
          Kate for a beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    You got sad. Why?
          
          Kate looks back at Harvey and tries to read him. She looks
          down at her lap, then up, out over the courtyard.
          
                              KATE
                    Oh, I don't know. My uniform's
                    green?
          
          The sun begins to creep above the buildings. Harvey and Kate
          look out across the courtyard.
          
                                                                  80.
          
          
          
                               KATE (CONT'D)
                    I was pregnant once.
                        (beat)
                    I didn't have it. Didn't give it a
                    moment's thought.
                        (beat)
                    That's what smart girls did.
          
          Beat.
          
                               KATE (CONT'D)
                    I do sometimes wonder what they'd
                    be like today.
                        (beat)
                    Whether they'd be smart. Funny.
                    Serious.
                        (beat)
                    I don't know, it's silly.
          
          Harvey looks at Kate in the morning light. Kate blushes and
          looks away.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    I don't know why i just told you
                    that.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    No.
                        (beat)
                    I'm glad.
          
          Harvey looks away, then back.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Meet me here, tomorrow.
          
                                 KATE
                    What?
          
                              HARVEY
                    Exactly here, at these chairs. At
                    noon.
          
          Kate smiles, determinedly trying to keep it light.
          
                              KATE
                    What about your flight, Harvey?
          
                               HARVEY
                    I don't want to leave.
                        (beat)
                    Guess why.
          
                                                                     81.
          
          
          
                                 KATE
                    Why?
          
                              HARVEY
                    I wanna be with you.
          
          Kate's blush deepens, she looks away and laughs.
          
                              KATE
                    Shut up, Harvey.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    It's true.
          
          Kate glances at Harvey, trying see the truth in his eyes.
          
                              KATE
                    You say that now, but wait until
                    tomorrow.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Today is tomorrow.
          
                              KATE
                    Harvey we know nothing about each
                    other. You're...
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Old?
          
                               KATE
                    A bit older, yes.
                        (beat)
                    I can be mean. Really mean.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    So can I.
          
                              KATE
                    No. Truly cantankerous.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    So can I.
          
          Kate can't help but smile. Beat. She glances towards the
          street.
          
                              KATE
                        (standing)
                    I should be going.
          
                                                                   82.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                    I know enough to know, I'll be
                    here. Waiting, at this chair.
          
          Kate looks at Harvey, then again towards the street.
          
                              KATE
                    Sure, Harvey.
          
                               HARVEY
                    Noon. I mean it.
                        (beat)
                    I'll be here.
          
          Kate smiles a little smile. She suddenly believes him.
          
                                 KATE
                    Ok.
          
          She steps backwards.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Wait.
          
          Harvey gets up and joins her. They look at each other. Harvey
          suddenly leans in and kisses Kate.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                        (pulling away/can't help
                         smiling)
                    Sorry.
          
          Kate smiles.
          
                              KATE
                    Harvey Shine.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Can I have something until
                    tomorrow.
          
          Kate reaches for her purse and pulls out a photo. She gives
          it to Harvey.
          
                               KATE
                        (stepping backwards)
                    I must go.
          
          She turns and leaves, hurrying to catch a bus.
          
          Harvey stands holding an old library card. He looks down. On
          it is a faded photo of toothy young girl, no older than
          eleven. Harvey looks up and smiles.
          
                                                                    83.
          
          
          
          
          INT. BUS - EARLY MORNING
          
          Kate takes a seat on the top deck of a bus. Taking a moment
          to catch her breath, she looks out the window. Turning back,
          she allows herself a smile...
          
                                                     FADE TO BLACK.
          
                                                           FADE IN:
          
          
          EXT. LONDON STREET - EARLY MORNING
          
          Harvey, with a croissant lodged in his mouth and a cup of
          coffee in hand, buys a morning paper. He turns and crosses
          the road, skipping up the steps of his hotel.
          
          
          INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EARLY MORNING
          
          Harvey enters, and waving to a slightly bemused concierge,
          heads to the bank of elevators.
          
                               HARVEY
                    Morning.
          
                              CONCIERGE
                    I'm afraid they're both out of
                    order, Sir.
          
          Harvey glances at the sign, then over to the stairwell.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I guess i'll walk, then.
          
          
          INT. STAIRWELL - MORNING
          
          Harvey, a man, seemingly impatient to start a `new life',
          runs up the steps. Surprised at first by his agility, he
          begins to slow. He stops to catch his breath. Suddenly his
          spare hand holds tight onto the bannister. Unsteady Harvey
          sits down. Close up on Harvey's face, confused. He tries to
          stand but again is forced back down. He begins to place his
          coffee on the stair next to him, but suddenly shudders,
          grabbing his shoulder. The coffee topples, spilling down the
          steps.
          
                               HARVEY
                    Shit.
          
          Frightened and confused, Harvey sits alone in the stairwell.
          
                                                                  84.
          
          
          
          Just then, a door opens and the African porter from before,
          comes through, carrying a tray. He sees Harvey.
          
                              PORTER
                    Sir, are you Ok?
          
          Harvey looks up in a daze, then shakes his head.
          
          
          EXT. LONDON STREET - MORNING
          
          Kate, with a skip in her step, walks through the bustling mid-
          day streets of London. She stops off and buys a bag of
          cherries from a `Fruit & Veg' vendor.
          
          
          EXT. HOTEL - MORNING
          
          As the porter and concierge talk to a medic, Harvey sits in
          the back of an ambulance. The door is closed.
          
          
          EXT. SOMMERSET HOUSE - DAY
          
          Kate sits waiting, expectantly, on the same chairs they had
          sat on earlier. She applies some lipstick.
          
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Harvey sits attached to various monitors and such, surrounded
          by doctors and nurses. He looks agitated and confused.
          
                               HARVEY
                    I've got to go. I've got to be
                    somewhere.
          
                              DOCTOR
                    Sir, I need you to stay calm. It
                    looks to me like Arrhythmia - an
                    irregular heart-beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Yes, S.V.T'S, that's what I've been
                    trying to tell the nurse. I've had
                    it since I was a kid. I take
                    Primax. I guess i've been
                    forgetting to take it recently.
                    I've been under alot of stress,
                    that's all.
          
                                                                    85.
          
          
          
                              DOCTOR
                    Well Ok, then we probably know
                    where we're at. But I need to check
                    all possibilities.
          
          
          EXT. SOMMERSET HOUSE - DAY
          
          As time passes, we watch as Kate's expression slowly turns
          from expectant to resigned.
          
          
          INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
          
                               HARVEY
                    I know it's Arrhythmia! Please, I
                    have to be there.
          
                               DOCTOR
                    Sir, I'm 99% sure it is. But my job
                    is to make sure it's not that 1%. I
                    wouldn't be doing my job if I
                    didn't check out absolutely
                    everything.
                        (beat)
                    Nurse, we'll do an EKG, followed by
                    Bloods. And can you arranfe a
                    monitored bed for him for tonight.
          
          As another pad is attached to his chest, Harvey looks beaten.
          
          
          EXT. SOMMERSET HOUSE - DAY
          
          Kate looks on as some kids play in the fountain nearby. She
          self-consciously smooths a fold in her skirt, then looks at
          her watch. Beat. She looks down at the brown paper bag of
          cherries. Suddenly a resigned smile flashes across her face -
          she's been here before ­ nothing new.
          
          Kate gets up and leaves. We watch her walk away.
          
                                                        FADE TO BLACK.
          
          Sound of a vacuum cleaner.
          
                                                              FADE IN:
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Open on a close up of Kate's face - it says it all. Kate
          vacuums her mother's floor. She turns it off and unplugs it.
          
                                                                     86.
          
          
          Coiling up the cord, Kate puts the vacuum cleaner into a
          cupboard under the stairs.
          
                              KATE
                        (calling out)
                    Ok mum, that's me, I'm done.
          
          Maggie comes out of the kitchen.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    Why don't you stay and have some
                    lunch?
          
                               KATE
                    I can't, I've got to go.
                        (beat)
                    Not to pry or anything but why is
                    there a large smoked ham under the
                    stairs?
          
                              MAGGIE
                    Oh, that, yes...It's, um...The
                    neighbour gave it to me.
          
                               KATE
                    The polish neighbour?
                        (beat)
                    So probably not a mass murderer.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    Probably not.
          
          Kate smiles.
          
                              MAGGIE (CONT'D)
                    Are you sure you're going to be
                    alright?
          
                              KATE
                    Of course I will. I'll be fine.
          
                              MAGGIE
                    Men, who needs them. Remember we've
                    got Greece to look forward to.
          
          Resigned, Kate hugs her mum.
          
                              KATE
                    Yeah.
          
          Kate leaves.
          
                                                                  87.
          
          
          
          
          EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY
          
          Kate exits her mother's house and passes Paddy the Postman.
          
                              PADDY
                    Morning Kate.
          
                              KATE
                    Morning Paddy.
          
                              PADDY
                    Looking lovely as ever.
          
                               KATE
                        (resigned)
                    Thank you.
          
          Kate walks off down the street.
          
          
          INT. HOSPITAL / RECEPTION AREA - DAY
          
          Harvey stands at a counter in a busy reception area. He has
          his phone lodged in the crook of his neck. In front of him,
          lies an open phone directory.
          
                              HARVEY
                    It's some sort of Statistics
                    Agency.
                        (listens)
                    Yes. That sounds right. Yes, based
                    out at Heathrow.
                        (listens)
                    Thank you. Hold on.
                        (turns to a receptionist)
                    Miss, could I borrow, your pen.
          
          The receptionist obliges as Harvey scribbles down a number on
          an old envelope.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Thanks, thanks alot.
          
          
          INT. HEATHROW / O.N.S. BOOTH - DAY
          
          A phone rings behind the counter. Oonagh picks up.
          
                               OONAGH
                    O.N.S., Heathrow branch.
                        (beat)
                    Hold on.

                                                                    88.
          
                              OONAGH (CONT'D)
                        (calling out)
                    Kate it's for you. Some guy called
                    Harvey.
          
          Kate, stands nearby, holding a clipboard, about to head out
          onto the floor. She looks at Oonagh. She thinks for a beat,
          then shakes her head, silently gesturing she not there.
          Oonagh, a little perplexed goes back on the phone.
          
                              OONAGH (CONT'D)
                    Um, I'm sorry. She's not here.
          
          
          INT. HOSPITAL / RECEPTION AREA - DAY
          
          Harvey, phone to ear, thinks for a beat. He knows she's
          there.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Please. It's important.
          
          Beat.
          
                                 OONAGH
                    Hold on.
          
          
          INT. BOOTH - DAY
          
          Oonagh pulls the phone away and gestures again to Kate. Kate
          shakes her head. Beat. Oonagh reluctantly lifts the phone to
          her ear.
          
                               OONAGH
                    I'm sorry, she's busy.
                        (beat)
                    She won't come.
          
          Oonagh hangs up, looking at Kate. Kate shrugs defensively
          before turning to go. We hold on Kate's `confused' face as
          she walks away.
          
          
          INT. HOSPITAL / RECEPTION AREA - DAY
          
          Harvey, having hung up, lowers the phone from his ear. He
          looks around the room. Seated across the way an old man
          stares back at him. A receptionist arrives with some forms.
          
                              RECEPTIONIST
                    If I could just get you to sign
                    these, you'll be all done.
          
          Harvey signs a form.
          
                                                                  89.
          
          
          
                               RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
                    And there.
                        (beat)
                    And that's it.
          
          Harvey glances at the receptionist - she is roughly Kate's
          age. Just then his phone rings. He picks up hopefully.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Hello?
          
                              MARVIN
                    Hey Harvey, it's Marvin. Where are
                    you?
          
                              HARVEY
                        (turns from the counter)
                    Oh, I'm still in London, Marvin.
          
                               MARVIN
                    Well you get yourself back here my
                    friend. I've got some great news.
                    You were right. The Samuelson
                    account. None of the kids could
                    handle it. They couldn't nail it.
                    They ended up picking one of your
                    old tunes. They want you to come
                    back and update it.
                        (beat)
                    We need you back, Harvey. Your old
                    room's here waiting for you.
                        (beat)
                    Harvey?
          
          Harvey looks around the room at the lonely figures, waiting.
          A young boy fidgets. Next to him sits a young man, lost in
          thought.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Well, that's great Marvin.
          
                               MARVIN
                    Yeah. Yeah, `it's great'. I mean,
                    look, I know when to eat humble
                    pie. So look, hey, when can you get
                    back here?
                        (beat)
                    Harvey?
          
          Harvey glances back at the old man. The old man continues to
          stare back. Beat. Something changes in Harvey.
          
                                                                  90.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                    I...I'm not coming back.
          
                                MARVIN
                    What?
          
                              HARVEY
                    I'm quitting Marvin.
          
                              MARVIN
                    What you mean you quit? Harvey,
                    fuck you man, you need us.
          
                               HARVEY
                    No, you know, I don't. As you said,
                    it's my `last chance'.
                        (beat)
                    Look, I gotta go.
          
          Harvey hangs up. A smile breaks across his face.
          
          
          EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Harvey exits the Hospital.
          
                              HARVEY
                        (calling out)
                    Taxi!
          
          A taxi pulls up.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Heathrow please. As quick as you
                    can.
          
          Harvey gets in as the Taxi speeds away.
          
          
          INT. HEATHROW / O.N.S. BOOTH - DAY
          
          Aggie, manning the booth, attends to some passengers.
          
          
          EXT. HEATHROW - DAY
          
          A Taxi pulls up. Harvey hurries out.
          
          
          INT. HEATHROW / O.N.S. BOOTH - DAY
          
          Harvey approaches the booth.
          
                                                                  91.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                    Excuse me, I'm looking for a Kate.
                    Kate Walker.
          
          Aggie eyes Harvey, a little warily.
          
                              AGGIE
                    Who wants to know?
          
                               HARVEY
                    A friend.
                        (beat)
                    More than a friend.
          
          Aggie tuts and calls behind her.
          
                              AGGIE
                    There's a man here looking for
                    Kate, says he's `more than a
                    friend.'
          
                              OONAGH (O.S.)
                    More than a friend?!
          
          Oonagh comes out from the office, eyeing Harvey suspiciously.
          
                               OONAGH (CONT'D)
                    You're the American.
                        (long beat)
                    She likes you. I can tell.
                        (beat)
                    Now, don't you go messing her
                    around. Don't you hurt her.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I wouldn't. I won't.
          
          Beat. Oonagh continues to eye Harvey. Finally...
          
                              OONAGH
                    She's not here.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Oh.
          
                               OONAGH
                    She's left for the day.
                        (beat)
                    But you might find her at her
                    class.
                        (looks at her watch)
                    I think it starts around now. Down
                    on the Southbank. At the National.
          
                                                                    92.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY
                    Yes, I know.
          
                               OONAGH
                    Oh you do, do you?
                        (beat)
                    Well, go on. Go get her.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Thank you.
          
          Harvey turns and hurries away. Oonagh and Aggie share a
          smile.
          
          
          INT. WRITING CLASS - DAY
          
                              MIKE
                    The blood oozes from his wound like
                    dark chocolate on a warm summer's
                    day.
          
          Kate sits listening in a daze, as `mild-mannered Mike'
          unleashes his latest.
          
          
          EXT. WATERLOO BRIDGE - DAY
          
          Harvey alights from the Taxi, paying the driver. He runs.
          
          
          INT. CLASS - DAY
          
          Everyone gathers their things as the class wraps.
          
          
          EXT. WATERLOO BRIDGE - DAY
          
          Harvey hurries towards the Southbank.
          
          
          EXT. SOUTHBANK - DAY
          
          Kate comes down from the upper terrace of the National,
          saying her good-byes to her classmates. In her hand she holds
          a book. As she turns she sees Harvey coming to a stop in the
          distance. She momentarily falters before approaching.
          
                                 KATE
                    Hey.
          
                                 HARVEY
                    Hey.
          
                                                           93.
          
          
          
                              KATE
                    You're still here - still in
                    London...
          
                               HARVEY
                    Yeah.
                        (beat)
                    Kate, I just wanted to apologise
                    and explain...
          
                              KATE
                    No, you don't have to - explain -
                    it's fine -
          
                              HARVEY
                    No, but I do -
          
                               KATE
                    I don't need to hear - it's fine,
                    seriously.
          
                              HARVEY
                    But I want to...
                        (comes out)
                    I had to go to Hospital.
          
                              KATE
                    Oh, God! Why?!
          
                              HARVEY
                    No, it's nothing, I'm fine, I just
                    forgot to take my pills. I have
                    this condition, I've had it since I
                    was a kid - it's an irregular heart-
                    beat sort of thing.
          
                                 KATE
                    Arrythmia.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Yes! How do you know what it is?
          
                              KATE
                        (smiling a little
                         sheepish)
                    My...My father has it.
          
                              HARVEY
                        (smiling)
                    Well, young men get it too.
          
          Kate can't help but smile. Beat.
          
                                                                   94.
          
          
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D (CONT'D)
                    Kate, I'm so sorry I wasn't there.
          
          Beat. Kate takes a breath, and gives him the practical
          response she's gone over in her head.
          
                                KATE
                    Harvey, I like you, I really do.
                    And I had a lovely time - it was
                    great. But, you know, I don't
                    really do fountains at noon.
                         (beat)
                    I live in Willesden. And you live -
                    in -
          
                              HARVEY
                    White Plains.
          
                              KATE
                    Exactly. And we're not teenagers,
                    so - you know, monday morning and
                    life kicks in, all that jobs and
                    family and brown envelopes with
                    bills in - it was a lovely day and
                    I won't forget it, but it's not
                    exactly real life...
          
                              HARVEY
                    It is. It can be.
          
                              KATE
                    No, Harvey, it's not.
          
          Beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Kate, I want this. I want you.
          
          A button is pushed in Kate.
          
                               KATE
                    But it's not just about you, is it?
                        (beat)
                    You don't know anything about me.
                    Look at me. It's pathetic. I
                    expected you not to show for God's
                    sake. I think I even wanted you not
                    to be there, it's easier that way.
                        (beat)
                    You - you just dive in wherever,
                    deep end, whoosh. But, I'm not your
                    bloody swimming pool Harvey.

                                                                  95.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    And I am not going to do it, I'm
                    not going to do it because it will
                    hurt. Not right now, maybe, but
                    soon - there will be a "it's not
                    quite working is it" or a "I need
                    some space" or whatever it is and
                    it'll end and it'll hurt and I
                    won't do it, I won't and...I...Oh
                    fuck, I don't want to cry. I don't
                    want this...
          
          Kate turns and walks away, standing by the balustrade,
          looking down at the river below. Harvey watches. She takes a
          seat on a bench. Harvey gives her, her space. Then slowly he
          approaches, leaning against a tree nearby. Long beat.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    I think it's actually easier for me
                    to be disappointed. I think I'm
                    actually angry at you for trying to
                    take that away.
          
          Long beat. Just then Kate's phone rings. She reaches into her
          bag and takes it out. She stares at the phone, thinking for a
          beat, before answering.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                        (firmly)
                    Mum, I love you, but not now.
          
          She hangs up. Long beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    Should I take that as a hopeful
                    sign?
          
          Kate can't help but smile.
          
                              HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    If you just give me a little wider
                    smile.
          
                              KATE
                        (smiling/laughing)
                    Oh, shut up, Harvey.
          
          Beat. Kate collecting herself, looks up at Harvey.
          
                              KATE (CONT'D)
                    So how's this going to work, Mr
                    Shine?
          
          Beat.
          
                                                                  96.
          
          
          
                               HARVEY
                    I have absolutely no idea...
                        (beat)
                    But it will.
                        (beat)
                    I promise you that.
          
          Kate stares at Harvey for the longest while. Then...
          
                              KATE
                    Shall we walk?
          
          Beat. Harvey nods.
          
                               HARVEY
                    Yes.
          
          Kate gathers up her things, stands and joins Harvey. They
          begin to walk.
          
          After a short while Kate stops, puts her hand on Harvey's
          shoulder and takes off her shoes.
          
                              KATE
                    That's better.
          
          Harvey glances down at Kate's feet, then up at her.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I think you're my kinda girl.
          
          Harvey and Kate smile. And as they walk away from us we hear.
          
                               HARVEY (CONT'D)
                    Why don't you ask me those
                    questions?
          
                              KATE
                    Which ones?
          
                              HARVEY
                    You know, from the airport. When I
                    wouldn't stop.
          
                               KATE
                    Oh, the questionnaire.
                        (beat)
                    Ok. Name?
          
                              HARVEY
                    Harvey Shine.
          
                                                                  97.
          
          
          
                              KATE
                    Place of residence?
          
          Beat.
          
                              HARVEY
                    I'm in transition.
          
          We watch as Harvey and Kate disappear into the sea of
          London...
          
          
          
                              THE END
