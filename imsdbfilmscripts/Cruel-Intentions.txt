1    EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAY                               1

     We circle around the island of Manhattan moving closer and
     closer till we're looking down on Fifth Avenue. As the
     melody continues to play we MOVE towards a building and ZOOM
     into a window.

2    INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY                              2

     A fifty-year old female therapist (DR. GREENBAUM) sits at
     her desk, frowning as she takes notes. Books of Jung and
     Freud line the shelves.

     A young man (SEBASTIAN VALMONT) sits in a chair in front
     of her looking impatient.

     The therapist continues to write notes.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Jesus. We've been at this for six
               months.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I know.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               And you haven't made an ounce of
               progress.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I know.

     Sebastian takes out a cigarette.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
                    (not looking up)
               There's no smoking in my office.

     Sebastian sneers at her then puts the cigarette away. Dr.
     Greenbaum finishes her notes and looks up at him, shaking
     her head.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What do you want me to say? That I'm
               supposed to feel remorse because I act
               the way I do? The truth is I don't.

     Dr. Greenbaum shakes her head and takes notes.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Look, I'm not like all the other kids
               in high school. I don't care about book
               reports and extra-credit. Teachers
               are idiots anyway. The only challenge
               out there for me is women. You see a
               girl you like. You pursue them. You
               conquer. You move on. It's exciting.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               But you said you have the worst
               reputation.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I do.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Don't you want to change that?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Let me tell you something, doctor.
               Chicks love a guy with a bad rap.
               They say they don't, but they don't
               mean it. They all think that they're
               the ones that are going to "save me."
               The trick is to let them think it's
               true.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               I think that's all the time we have
               for today.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Same time next week?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               No. This is going to be our last
               session.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why? I like spending time with you.
               You know, you're quite attractive for
               a woman your age. You have killer legs.
               Killer.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a
               lot of money to send you here. I'm
               trying to help you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big
               help.

     Sebastian picks up a book of Freud.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               He was a coke addict, you know.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               You think you can come in here with that
               cute little smirk on your face and try
               and flirt with me. It doesn't work,
               Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It works a little.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               No it doesn't. I see right through you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You do?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               I hope for your sake you grow out of
               this immature phase. It's going to get
               you into trouble.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, you don't have to get nasty about
               it.

     Sebastian approaches a photo on her desk and picks it up.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               My daughter, Rachel.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yummy.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Don't even think about it. Rachel is an
               exceptionally well rounded young
               woman, who happens to be attending
               Princeton this fall. She's way too
               smart to fall for your line of b.s.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Really? Care to make a wager on that?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Good luck, Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What, nervous I'm going to win?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Would you please leave.

     Sebastian puts on his glasses and leaves.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               Asshole.

     The doctor stews for a moment, then reaches into her
     desk, sifts through some papers where she finds a pack of
     Benson & Hedges and lights one up. She looks at the photo
     of her daughter, then hits the speaker phone and dials.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               Rachel, it's mom.

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

3    INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - DAY                                3

     RACHEL, Doctor Greenbaum's daughter sits at her desk,
     crying while holding the phone.

                              RACHEL
               Hi, mom.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Honey, is something wrong?

     Rachel cries for a moment.

                              RACHEL
               He told me he loved me and I believed
               him.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Who told you?

                              RACHEL
               You don't know him. I'm so stupid.

     She continues to cry.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep
               breath, and step out of the circle.

                              RACHEL
               Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit,
               mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.

     WE PAN OVER TO HER COMPUTER CONSOLE. CLOSE ON: COMPUTER
     MONITOR - A nudie web-sight. The title reads "Ivy League
     Bound." Beneath the caption is a photo of Rachel tied to
     a bed and smiling with a Princeton banner covering her
     privates.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               What kind of pictures?

                              RACHEL
               Nudie pictures, what do you think?

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               Jesus Christ, how can you be so
               stupid?

                              RACHEL
               I don't know. He was just so charming.
               All he did was talk about how I had
               killer legs and how we wanted to
               photograph them. Things just got out
               of hand from there.
                    (she hears the phone drop)
               Mom? Are you there? Mom?
                    (screaming)
               Mother!!!!

4    INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY           4

     Doctor Greenbaum bolts out of her office and spots
     Sebastian standing in the elevator.

                              DR. GREENBAUM
               You son of a bitch.

     Doctor Greenbaum races down the hall pushing several
     people out of her way. Sebastian stares at her
     expressionless as the elevator doors close.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               You're gonna pay for this you little
               shit. You hear me.

     A DENTIST peers outside of his office to see what's
     going on. He exchanges looks with Doctor Greenbaum.

                              DR. GREENBAUM (cont'd)
               Fuck off, Harold.

     He gasps.

5    EXT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - DAY                               5

     A METER MAID is writing a ticket on a car when a Porsche
     pulls up in front of the townhouse and parks in a red
     zone. Sebastian steps out of the car and walks up the
     steps to the townhouse.

                              METER MAID
               You can't park there.

     Sebastian turns to her and sneers. He takes out a wad of
     money and shoves it in her breast pocket before entering
     the townhouse.

6    INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                     6

     A SERIES OF SHOTS

     CLOSE ON:  A tuna on a chopping board. WHACK! A butcher
     knife comes down on the tuna cutting it's head off.

     CLOSE ON: Two hands ripping open the fish.

     CLOSE ON: Two hands rolling a chunk of tuna into a rice
     roll.

7    INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                     7

     CLOSE ON: Two hands which carry a lavish tray of sushi
     through several doors until we enter the final door
     leading into -

8    INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 8

     A enormous living room by Manhattan standards, with a
     view that overlooks the park. Eclectic art from around
     the world emphasize the Valmont's passion for travel.

     SOOK-HEE, the Valmont's housekeeper sets a tray of sushi
     in front of -

     KATHRYN MERTEUIL, a seventeen year old porcelain
     skinned WASP with all the grooming you could want in an
     East Coast child. She sits with a forced smile on her
     face and listens attentively as -

     BUNNY CALDWELL, a forty year old nouveau-riche socialite
     talks incessantly. CECILE CALDWELL, her beautiful
     teenage daughter, sits by her side. She wears a T-shirt
     with a Koala Bear on it.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I can't tell you how happy we are that
               Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you
               this fall. You've always been an
               inspiration to Beau and I on raising
               her. We just hope she can rise to the
               high standards which you've set for
               her.

                              KATHRYN
               I'll do my best.

     Sook-Hee pours a dish of soy sauce in front of Kathryn.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
                    (to Sook-Hee, in Vietnamese)
               Thank you, Sook-Hee. That will be
               all.

     Sook-Hee leaves.

                              CECILE
               What was that?

                              KATHRYN
               I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a
               beautiful language.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Kathryn is a straight A student at
               Oakwood as well as being President of
               the French Club. Listen to whatever
               she has to say and you'll go far.

                              KATHRYN
                    (in French)
               You're too kind.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring
               that goes on in high school. Where
               do you get your strength?

                              KATHRYN
               I know this sounds corny, but whenever
               I feel temptations of peer pressure,
               I...
                    (takes out her crucifix)
               turn to God and he helps me through the
               problem. Call me an anachronism, but
               it works.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               That's beautiful.

                              CECILE
               What are the boys like?

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Cecile, is that the best you can do?
                    (to Kathryn)
               You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never
               been in a co-educational atmosphere before.

                              KATHRYN
               Don't worry, it's totally understandable.
               Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood
               are very upstanding gentleman, however
               there are the occasional bad apples.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't
               believe they didn't expel him after what he
               did to the school nurse.

                              SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
               I hear she's recovering quite well.

     Mrs. Caldwell turns to see Sebastian standing in the
     doorway. He walks over and takes a seat.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Nice to see you again, Mrs. Caldwell.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               You remember my daughter, Cecile.

                              SEBASTIAN
               My, what an adorable shirt you're
               wearing.

                              CECILE
               My father just took me on a trip to Australia.

                              SEBASTIAN
               How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Outstanding.

                              CECILE
               What year are you in?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.

                              CECILE
               But I thought high school is only four years.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.

     He winks at Cecile.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I think we'll be going now.
                    (to Kathryn)
               Thanks for all your help.

     Kathryn stands and approaches Cecile.

                              KATHRYN
               I'll call you later and we'll get together
               and plan your curriculum.

                              CECILE
               Thanks.
                    (to Sebastian)
               Nice meeting you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ciao.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Let's go, Cecile. Now!

     Cecile follows Mrs. Caldwell out the door. Kathryn
     closes the door behind them.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash
               and her stupid daughter are doing in my
               house?

                              KATHRYN
               I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.

     Kathryn sits on the sofa next to Sebastian. She unscrews
     her crucifix. The top part becomes a small spoon and the
     bottom part a small vial of coke.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               The parental units called while you were out.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a
               mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my
               inheritance per usual?

                              KATHRYN
               Hopefully, though she suspects that your
               decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the
               maid.

     Kathryn uses her crucifix as a coke-spoon and snorts a
     bump.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               What's wrong with you today? Therapy not
               going well?

                              SEBASTIAN
               It was fine.

     He leaps off the sofa and starts to pace.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I'm sick of sleeping with these insipid
               Manhattan Debutantes.

     He walks over to the wall where nude Botticelli hangs.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Nothing shocks them anymore.

     He scratches the nude's pubic area.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I'm beginning to feel like I'm losing my
               touch.

     He kisses it.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have
               a mission for you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What?

9    EXT. PARK - DAY                                            9

     COURT REYNOLDS, an Aryan seventeen year old preppy, wears
     a Polo sweater with an American Flag.

                              KATHRYN (V.O.)
               You know Court Reynolds, son of Garret
               Reynolds?

     Kathryn steps into frame and embraces him. She is wearing
     the same sweater. He kisses her forehead and messes
     up her hair.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               You mean the Nazi who dumped you over Fourth
               Of July Weekend?

10   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 10

     Kathryn throws a sushi at him. Sebastian catches it.

                              KATHRYN
               He didn't dump me. We had a parting of
               the ways.

     Sebastian stares her down.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Alright he dumped me.

     He smiles, then swallows the sushi.

11   EXT. PUBLIC PARKING GARAGE/INT. COURT' S CAR - NIGHT       11

     A drunk Court sits in the driver's side and takes a final
     swig from his flask. He quickly passes out.

                              KATMRYN (V.O.)
               I went to great lengths to please Court.
               Huge sacrifices were made on my part to
               keep him happy.

     Kathryn rises up INTO FRAME, looks at Court and scowls.

                              SEBASTIAN(V.O.)
               Swallow?

     She spits on him, then wipes her mouth.

                              KATHRYN (V.O.)
               What do you think?

     Kathryn sprays her mouth with Binaca.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               Sorry.

12   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 12

                              KATHRYN
               In any event, my feelings were hurt when I
               learned that he had fallen for someone else.
               Someone chaste... pure... innocent.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You don't mean?

13   EXT. PARK - DAY                                            13

     Cecile turns toward the camera, while eating a double scoop
     ice cream cone and wearing a Mickey Mouse Club hat.

                              KATHRYN (V.O.)
               None other than Cecile Caldwell.

     She takes a lick of the ice cream, which falls off the cone.
     She mouths the word "shoot" and stomps her feet

14   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 14

     Sebastian snickers.

                              KATHRYN
               I don't find this very funny,

                              SEBASTIAN
               So that's what this is all about.
                    (imitating Kathryn)
               We'll get together and plan your
               curriculum.

                              KATHRYN
               Keep your friends close and your
               enemies closer. When I get through
               with her, she'll be the premier Blow
               Job Queen of the Tri-State area and
               poor little Court's heart will be
               shattered.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why go through Cecile? Why not just
               attack Court?

                              KATHRYN
               Because if there's an attack made on
               Court it could be traced back to me.
               I can't allow that to happen.
               Everybody loves me and I intend to
               keep it that way.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I see your point... though why should
               I care?

                              KATHRYN
               I need you to seduce our young Cecile.
               Introduce her to your world of
               decadence and debauchery.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sounds intriguing.

                              KATHRYN
               She's quite cute you know. Young
               supple breasts, a tight firm ass and
               an uncharted pootie.

     Sebastian watches Kathryn rub herself. He licks his
     lips.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Be her Captain Picard, Valmont.
               Boldly go where no man has gone
               before.

     Sebastian places his hand over Kathryn's as she continues
     to rub herself. He thinks for a moment, then:

                              SEBASTIAN
               I can't.

     Kathryn throws his hand off of hers.

                              KATHRYN
               Why not?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy.
               "But I thought high school was only
               four years." I mean, please. She knows
               nothing. She's seen nothing. I could
               have her under the table at Au Bar
               sucking me off before the appetizer
               arrived. Go get one of those moron
               friends of yours to do it. I have a
               reputation to uphold.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh but diddling the therapist's
               daughter is a challenge?

                              SEBASTIAN
               That was just simple revenge. What I
               have planned requires sheer genius.

     He takes a magazine and throws it on the table. Kathryn
     picks it up. It's the latest issue of "Seventeen."

                              KATHRYN
               I'm not interested in the latest dating
               tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shut up and turn to page 64.

     She turns to the page. INSERT MAGAZINE ARTICLE: The title
     reads: A VIRGIN'S MANIFESTO. "Why I Plan To Wait
     Until Marriage," by Annette Harrison. Age 17. Kansas
     City, Missouri.

                              KATHRYN
               Jesus Christ, is she for real?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh yes. I've read it over and over again.
               This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little
               angel. A paradigm of chastity and
               virtue.

                              KATHRYN
               B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to
               Kansas and woo little Dorothy.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It just so happens we're not in Kansas
               anymore. Our little angel's father has
               accepted the new headmaster position at
               Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up
               in Connecticut while Daddy sells his
               house. Can you imagine what this would
               do for my reputation? Screwing the new
               headmaster's virginal daughter before
               school starts? It will be my greatest
               victory.

                              KATHRYN
               You don't stand a chance. Even this is
               out of your league.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Care to make a wager on that?

                              KATHRYN
               I'll think about it...

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another
               chapter to my work of art.

     He holds up a leather bound JOURNAL.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more
               queer?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Could you be more desperate to read it?

     Sebastian stands to leave and heads to the door.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh Sebastian. About that little wager
               of yours.

     He stops.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Count me in.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What are the terms?

                              KATHRYN
               If you lose, then that hot little Porsche
               of yours is mine.

                              SEBASTIAN
               And if I win?

     She approaches him.

                              KATHRYN
               I'll give you something you've been
               jerking off about ever since our parents
               got married.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Be more specific.

                              KATHRYN
               In English.
                    (whispers in his ear)
               I'll fuck your brains out.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What makes you think I'd go for that
               bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar
               car.

                              KATHRYN
               Because I'm the only person you can't
               control and it kills you.

     Sebastian sneers at her.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Do we have a deal?

                              SEBASTIAN
               No way, that car means everything to
               me.

     She kisses him and licks her tongue over his lips.

                              KATHRYN
                    (whispering)
               You can put it anywhere.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Even there?

                              KATHRYN
                    (baby talk)
               It would feel so yummy.

     Sebastian hesitates, then shakes her hand.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Happy hunting.

15   EXT. ROSEMOND ESTATE - AERIAL SHOT - DAY                   15

     WE MOVE across the sky looking down at lush greens and
     stately mansions till WE PASS over the ROSEMOND ESTATE.
     Enormous in size. WE SEE two riders on horseback.

16   EXT. ESTATE - MEADOW - DAY                                 16

     ANGLE ON: The two horseback riders. One, a woman of
     seventy. This is HELEN ROSEMOND, Sebastian's aunt.
     The other rider is a beautiful seventeen year old girl.
     The one and only ANNETTE HARRISON.

                              ANNETTE
               It's a beautiful home you have here
               Mrs. Rosemond.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been
               with my family for over sixty years.
               Does your family do much riding?

                              ANNETTE
               My mother and I used to ride a lot,
               before she got sick.

                              AUNT HELEN
               I'm sorry about that.

                              ANNETTE
               My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his
               farm so I would come over and ride all
               the time.

                              AUNT HELEN
               I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in
               the mid-west. What's his name?

                              ANNETTE
               Ben Schwarz.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Schwarz. Jewish?

                              ANNETTE
               German.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Doesn't ring a bell.

     Annette throws her a concerned look.

                              AUNT HELEN (cont'd)
               In any event, I want you to consider
               this your home for the time being.

                              ANNETTE
               Thank you. It's so peaceful and quiet
               around here.

     BANG! A shotgun sounds in the distance.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               What was that?

                              AUNT HELEN
               Sebastian must be here.

     Aunt Helen gallops down the ridge followed by Annette.

17   EXT. ESTATE - GARDEN - DAY                                 17

     Sebastian stands holding a shotgun. A groundskeeper,
     FRANKLIN stands by the trap.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Pull!

     The TARGET soars into the air,

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Die motherfucker!

     He fires the gun, missing the target.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Shit, shit, shit.

     Franklin shakes his head. WE HEAR a cat MEOW. Sebastian
     perks up.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Kitty. Kitty.

     He quietly reloads his rifle. WE HEAR the cat MEOW
     again. Sebastian searches for the cat.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Puss Puss Puss Puss Puss.

     He raises his rifle and takes aim.

                              AUNT HELEN (O.S.)
               Sebastian!

     He lowers his rifle and turns to SEE Aunt Helen and
     Annette riding over to him. He waves.

     Aunt Helen dismounts from her horse and they hug.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I've been looking all over for you.
               God, I've missed you.

                              AUNT HELEN
               I've missed you too. How are your
               parents?

                              SEBASTIAN
               They're coming back next week. I write
               them everyday.

     She strokes his cheek, lovingly.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Sebastian, this is Annette Harrison.
               She's going to be staying with me for
               a few weeks.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I guess that makes two of us. Welcome.

     He extends his hand and they shake.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
                    (to Aunt Helen)
               Why don't you head in and whip us up
               some of that ice tea of yours? We'll
               take care of the horses.

                              AUNT HELEN
               Anything for you, my dear.

     Sebastian climbs on Aunt Helen's horse.

                              AUNT HELEN (cont'd)
               Stay out of trouble you two.

                              SEBASTIAN & ANNETTE
               We will.

     He smiles at Annette and beckons her to follow.

18   INT. ESTATE - STABLE - DAY                                 18

     Sebastian and Annette put the riding gear away.

                              SEBASTIAN
               So what year are you going into?

                              ANNETTE
               Junior.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Got a boyfriend back home?

                              ANNETTE
               No.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why not?

                              ANNETTE
               I don't know. Relationships seem too
               distracting. I'd rather concentrate on
               my studies.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You a lesbo?

                              ANNETTE
                    (annoyed)
               No.

     She bends over to pick up the saddle.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Nice.

     She sighs, disgusted, then turns toward him.

                              ANNETTE
               Are you often this offensive on a first
               encounter?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I was just being honest. You happen to
               have a nice ass. Sorry.

     She shakes her head and continues with her chore.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I read your teen beat manifesto.

                              ANNETTE
               You did?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I must say I found it rather appalling.

                              ANNETTE
               That's a first. Most people praised me
               for it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Most people are morons. I mean who are
               you to knock what you've never experienced?

                              ANNETTE
               I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my
               belief that people shouldn't actually
               experience the act of love until they are
               in love and that people our age are too
               immature to be in touch with those
               emotions.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh really?

                              ANNETTE
               Take yourself. You've slept with several
               women. Are you happier because of it?

                              SEBASTIAN
               How do you know I've been with several
               women?

                              ANNETTE
               A friend wrote me.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (pissed)
               Well maybe you should get to know the
               person before you judge them instead of
               listening to some bullshit gossip.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you...
               but you still didn't answer the question.

     An uncomfortable silence falls between them,

                              SEBASTIAN
               Who the hell is taking the time to write
               letters, spreading this shit about me?

                              ANNETTE
               It's not really important.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're
               not going to be friends.

                              ANNETTE
               Why are you being so dramatic?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm
               trying to deal with them and the last
               thing I need is people spreading shit
               about me.

                              ANNETTE
               Alright, I said I was sorry.
                    (beat)
               Can we start over again? I think we've
               gotten off on the wrong foot.

     She approaches him and they shake.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               Annette Harrison.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sebastian Valmont.

     She smiles, but before he releases her hand:

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               So tell me, Annette. I'm curious, since
               you've never had sex do you touch
               yourself?

     She whisks her hand away and storms out of the stable.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What did I say?

19   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - STUDY - DAY                      19

     CLOSE ON: A hand stroking the bridge of a cello.

                              RONALD (O.S.)
               That's good, that's good.

     WE PULL BACK

     Cecile sits in front Of a cello. Next to her sits RONALD
     CLIFFORD, a well-mannered fifteen year old African
     American. Holding his own cello, he is giving her a
     music lesson.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Now let's try the A minor scale.

     Cecile attempts the A minor scale, fucking up badly.

     Kathryn enters and shudders in silence.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Once more, and remember the third note
               is flat.

     Cecile tries again and once again screws up.

                              CECILE
               Oh, I suck. I suck.

                              RONALD
               Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.

     Cecile takes a deep breath

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               You're concentrating too much on your
               bowing. Let it flow.

     He stands and sits behind her.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Here, let me help you.

     He places his hand over hers.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Now close your eyes and let's try again.

     She closes her eyes and they repeat the scale. It sounds
     much better. Ronald takes the moment to study Cecile's
     face. It's obvious he's smitten with her.

     ON KATHRYN: who watches from the door. A grin crosses
     her face.

     Ronald replaces her other hand and plays a beautiful Bach
     Sonata, with he and Cecile sharing the bowing. He closes
     his eyes as the music takes over him. Now Cecile opens
     her eyes and gazes into his. The feeling is mutual.

     ON KATHRYN: She accidentally bangs her hand onto a table
     which causes a metal tray to fall to the ground.

     Ronald and Cecile look up as Kathryn replaces the tray

                              KATHRYN
               I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
               Your playing was beautiful.

     Ronald quickly stands and moves away from Cecile

                              CECILE
               Kathryn, this is Ronald Clifford. He's
               giving me music lessons over the
               summer.

     Ronald approaches and shakes Kathryn's hand.

                              RONALD
               Pleased to meet you.

                              KATHRYN
               Likewise I'm sure.

                              CECILE
               Ronald is one of the few high school
               students attending Juliard. He's
               composing his first opera.

                              RONALD
               It's based on the life of Doctor
               Martin Luther King.

                              CECILE
               Doctor King is my favorite.

     Ronald shakes his head, but laughs. Cecile looks at him
     and smiles. Kathryn rolls her eyes.

                              RONALD
               I guess our hour's up. Same time
               tomorrow?

     Cecile nods.

20   EXT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - DAY                                  20

     Another nice home in Connecticut. Sebastian's Porsche is
     parked outside.

21   INT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY                        21

     A typical teenagers bedroom, expect this one is a shrine
     to Herb Ritts homo-erotic art.

     BLAINE TUTTLE, Oakwood Prep's resident drug-dealer and
     open homosexual, sits at his desk separating pot seeds
     from his stash.

     Sebastian paces behind him.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -

                              BLAINE
               - none taken -

                              SEBASTIAN
               - wrote a letter to this chick and saying
               shit about me.

                              BLAINE
               Any ideas who it could be?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Blaine, if I knew who it was that person
               wouldn't be alive right now.

                              BLAINE
               Where did you say she's from?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?

                              BLAINE
               Greg McConnell.

                              SEBASTIAN
               The football stud?

                              BLAINE
               He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be
               surprised if he was your rat.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It would make sense. McConnell hates me.
               I fingered his girlfriend at the game
               last year.

                              BLAINE
               I don't think that bothered him.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What do you mean?

                              BLAINE
               Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight
               ends on and off the field.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Are you shitting me?

                              BLAINE
               I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak
               in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd
               go at it for a while, then as soon as
               he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You
               know -
                    (imitating Greg)
               "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag.
               I'll kick your ass if you say anything."
                    (beat)
               It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're
               gay, deal with it. The only reason why
               I let him continue with his charade is
               because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.

                              BLAINE
               Not anymore. Football team started
               practice last week. He's already called
               me to hook up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Really. You think you could arrange a
               little get together with him tonight on
               my behalf?

                              BLAINE
               Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing
               Spartacus on television tonight.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Outstanding.

                              BLAINE
               Don't think it's not going to cost you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               No problem. Just make sure your front
               door is unlocked. Shall we say the
               "stroke of midnight" no pun intended?

     Sebastian hands Blaine two hundred dollar bills.

22   EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY                                    22

     Kathryn and Cecile sit on a blanket. A lavish picnic lies
     around them. Kathryn wears large sunglasses, a scarf and
     a hat to protect her from the sunlight. She sits behind
     Cecile and braids her hair.

                              KATHRYN
               So, rumor has it that you went on a date
               with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very
               nice.

                              CECILE
               He's alright.
                    (giggles)
               He kept talking about this bulimic
               headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.

                              KATHRYN
               Really? Bulimic headcase.

                              CECILE
               What a loser she must be.
                    (beat)
               Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons
               for Labor Day Weekend.

                              KATHRYN
               That's great.

                              CECILE
               You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm
               just scared.

                              KATHRYN
               What are you scared of?

                              CECILE
               Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to
               first base with a guy. What do I do?

                              KATHRYN
               Haven't you ever practiced with one of
               your girlfriends?

                              CECILE
               Eww. No. That's gross.

                              KATHRYN
               It's not gross. How else do you think
               girls learn? Here turn around and
               face me.

     Cecile turns and faces Kathryn, who removes her glasses.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Now close your eyes and wet your lips.

                              CECILE
               Are you for real?

                              KATHRYN
               Do you want to learn or not?

                              CECILE
               I guess. It still sounds gross.

     Cecile does as instructed. Kathryn leans in and kisses
     her on the mouth.

                              KATHRYN
               See that wasn't so bad.

                              CECILE
               It was nothing.

                              KATHRYN
               Let's try it again, only this time I'm
               going to stick my tongue in your
               mouth. When I do that I want you to
               massage my tongue with yours. That's
               what first base is.

                              CECILE
                    (reluctant)
               Okay.

                              KATHRYN
               Eyes closed.

     Cecile closes her eyes. Kathryn leans in and kisses her
     again, only this time longer. She continues to kiss her
     then gently pushes her tongue into Cecile's. Cecile does
     as instructed and they start to make out.

     Kathryn eyes look towards the ground where Cecile's hands
     are now clutching the grass. Kathryn smiles and
     continues her seduction.

     She places her hand on Cecile's thigh and moves it under
     her dress. Cecile lets out a soft sigh.

     Kathryn breaks from the kiss. They look at each other
     and smile.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Not bad.

                              CECILE
               That was cool.

                              KATHRYN
               Maybe you should try it on your friend
               Ronald sometime.

                              CECILE
               What are you saying?

                              KATHRYN
               Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about
               you.

                              CECILE
               Is it that obvious?

     Kathryn nods.

                              CECILE (cont'd)
               He sends me letters you know. Love
               letters.

                              KATHRYN
               That's so romantic. Have you
               responded?

                              CECILE
               No.

                              KATHRYN
               Well do you like him?

                              CECILE
               I don't know.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, we just made out in the middle
               of Central Park. You can trust me.

                              CECILE
                    (beat)
               I do like him. I can't stop thinking
               about him.

     Cecile starts to cry. Kathryn hugs her.

                              CECILE (cont'd)
               What am I going to do? If my mother
               found out about Ronald she would kill
               me.

     Kathryn grabs her and looks her straight in the eye.

                              KATHRYN
               Listen to me. Your mother must never
               know. Never.

                              CECILE
               Okay.

                              KATHRYN
               Did you hide the letters?

                              CECILE
               Yes. They're in this antique doll house
               in my room.

                              KATHRYN
               I want you to make me copies of his
               letters and bring them to me.

                              CECILE
               Why?

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile if there's one thing I'm great
               at it's love letters. With my help,
               he'll be eating out of the palm of
               your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a
               little get together for the two of you
               at my house.

                              CECILE
               You'd do that for me?

                              KATHRYN
               Of course I would. We're friends,
               right?

                              CECILE
               Best friends.

     Cecile kisses her on the cheek and hugs Kathryn.

23   INT. ESTATE - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT                 23

     Little touches of Annette's life (photo of dead mother)
     adorn the room. Annette is reading The Fountainhead when
     she HEARS singing coming from outside. Unable to
     concentrate, she walks out onto the balcony.

24   EXT. ESTATE - ANNETTE'S BALCONY - NIGHT                    24

     Annette steps onto the balcony.

     HER P.O.V. - Sebastian lies in a floating pool chair
     sipping a cocktail and listening to his Walkman and
     singing Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" in German.

                              ANNETTE
                    (calling out)
               Excuse me. Excuse me!

                              SEBASTIAN
               You talking to me?

                              ANNETTE
               Look, I know this is your house and all,
               but do you think you couid keep it down?
               I'm trying to read.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What'cha reading?

                              ANNETTE
               The Fountainhead.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Great book.

                              ANNETTE
                    (skeptical)
               You've read The Fountainhead?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act,
               you know. When Howard Roark makes love
               to Dominique Francon... most romantic
               scene in all of literature.

                              ANNETTE
               Romantic? He rapes her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               That's a matter of opinion.

                              ANNETTE
               You need help.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why don't you come join me for a swim
               and we'll discuss it.

                              ANNETTE
               At this hour? I don't think so.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh come on. Quit acting like a
               geriatric and get in the pool.

                              ANNETTE
               Gee, with an invitation like that how
               could a girl refuse.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Please.

                              ANNETTE
               Give me a minute. I'll be right down.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Thank you.

     She re-enters the guest room. Sebastian's cell phone
     RINGS. He answers it.

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

25   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT         25

     Kathryn sits in her bathrobe. One foot soaks in a small
     tub of water while Sook-Hee tends to her other foot.

                              KATHRYN
               Fuck her yet?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm working on it.

                              KATHRYN
               Loser.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Blow me.

                              KATHRYN
               Call me later.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Okay.

     She hangs up and lights a cigarette. Sook-Hee accidently
     jabs her toe.

                              KATHRYN
               Ow. That hurt you stupid bitch.

                              SOOK-HEE
               Sorry.

     Kathryn kicks some water in her face.

                              KATHRYN
               Oops.

26   EXT. ESTATE - SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT                        26

     Annette comes down, wearing a bathrobe. She sits by the
     pool as Sebastian treads water away from her.

                              ANNETTE
                    (holding out the letter)
               You know it amazes me that someone as
               bright as you can be so horrible.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What? Another letter from your friend?

                              ANNETTE
               This is my favorite part.
                    (reading the letter)
               Even more treacherous and dangerous than
               he is charming and fascinating. He has
               never taken a single step or spoken a
               single word without some dishonorable
               or criminal intention. Every young girl
               he has successfully pursued has
               regretted it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You know you could at least have the
               decency of telling me who's badmouthing
               me so I might have the opportunity to
               confront them face to face. How do you
               know it's not some girl who's pissed
               off at me for breaking up with her?

                              ANNETTE
               I sincerely doubt it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Give me the fucking letter.

     Annette smiles and tears the letter up.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Why did you do that?

                              ANNETTE
               The last thing I need is you going into
               my room searching for this while I'm
               away.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (mocking)
               Is that the last thing you need? My
               your clever.

     She takes pieces of paper and sticks it in her bathrobe. She
     then stands and takes off the robe, revealing a one piece
     bathing suit underneath.

                              ANNETTE
               How's the water?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Refreshing.

     She dives in the pool and surfaces.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               You're right you know.

                              ANNETTE
               About what?

                              SEBASTIAN
               About what you said today in the stable.
               I'm not a happy person.

                              ANNETTE
               I never said that.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You implied it.

                              ANNETTE
               Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard
               time.

                              SEBASTIAN
               No, it's okay. I mean I look at you
               with all your morals and values and
               well, YOU seem to be happy in your
               choices. I envy you. No bullshit.

                              ANNETTE
                    (caught off guard)
               Thank you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Seriously, you're amazing. You have
               everything going for you.
                    (counts with his fingers)
               You're smart, you're beautiful, you're
               determined. You're everything I want
               in a girlfriend.

                              ANNETTE
                    (jokingly)
               Shut up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you
               out.

                              ANNETTE
               Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it
               could never work.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why not?

                              ANNETTE
               Because you act like a pig.

     He swims towards her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you deny that there's an attraction
               between us?

                              ANNETTE
               I don't... I don't want to answer that...
               look we're friends.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You don't find me cute? Come on, look
               at these muscles.

     He flexes for her. She laughs.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm sorry, but you're not my type.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Fine. Friends it is. I can live with
               that.

     He extends his arms out for a hug. She moves in and hugs
     him. Her smile turns to a look of horror.

                              ANNETTE
               You're naked.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's my house.

     She pushes him off her.

                              ANNETTE
               That's repulsive.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What's the big deal? We're friends.
               Haven't you ever seen your friends
               naked before?

     Annette climbs out of the pool.

                              ANNETTE
               Get some manners.

     She walks into the house.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sorry, I didn't know you were peenaphobic.

     She flips him the bird as she heads into the house.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Oooooo, naughty naughty. Ten Hail
               Mary's for you.
                    (beat)
               Good night.

27   EXT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                27

     Sebastian's Porsche is parked outside.

28   INT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT                      28

     Sebastian presses his ear to the door.

                              GREG (O.S.)
                    (moaning)
               Oh baby... oh baby...

                              SEBASTIAN
               Baby?
                    (checks his watch)
               Right on time.

29   INT. BLAINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                      29

     GREG McCONNELL, All-American star football player for
     Oakwood prep is busy getting his cock sucked by Blaine,
     who lies under the covers.

                              GREG
                    (near orgasm)
               Oh God... Oh God, I'm gonna cum. I'm
               gonna cum... I'm gonna...

     The door swings open and Sebastian enters.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy
               shit.

                              GREG
               Jesus!

     Greg throws the covers over his face. Sebastian smiles
     and sits. He lights a cigarette. No movement from under
     the covers.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Greg, is that you under the covers?

                              GREG
                    (from under the covers)
               Get out of here.

     Sebastian stands YANKS the covers off the bed, revealing
     Greg and Blaine.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Whoa!

                              GREG
               I told you to lock the door.

                              BLAINE
               I thought I did.

                              GREG
               Look Valmont. This was the first time
               I've ever done something like this. I
               was --

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (apathetic)
               -- really drunk and blah blah blah
               blah blah.

                              GREG
               Please don't tell anyone. This could
               ruin my career.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Your career? What about your family?
               Can you imagine the humiliation your
               father's going to feel when he finds
               out his pride and joy is a fudge-
               packer.

                              BLAINE
               Hey hey hey. Careful Valmont, he's
               not a fudge packer. Cum chugger yes
               but not a fudge packer.

                              GREG
                    (to Sebastian)
               Please. I'm begging you. I'll do
               anything. Let's just forget the whole
               thing.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hmmmmmmm... nah. I can't help you
               there. It's too good to pass up.

     Greg starts to cry.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               After all, it is you who's bad-
               mouthing me to Annette Harrison.

                              GREG
               Annette Harrison? I don't know what
               you're talking about.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Come on Greg. You're the only one who
               knows her. The truth will save you.

                              GREG
                    (sobbing)
               I swear on my life, I never said a
               word to her about you.

                              BLAINE
               I think he's telling the truth
               Valmont. Greg couldn't write a
               grocery list let alone a letter.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Alright, I believe you. Stop crying.
               Your secret's safe with me.

     Greg wipes his eyes.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               However, this whole incident's kind of
               turned me on.

     Sebastian unzips his fly.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               You get my point.

     Greg, completely defeated, crawls off the bed and over to
     Sebastian. Blaine shakes his head and smiles.

     Greg places his hand on Sebastian's thigh when -

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Jesus Christ, I was only kidding.
               What do you think, I'm gay? My God,
               haven't you had enough for tonight.

                              BLAINE
               Our boy just can't get enough dick.

                              GREG
               You sick son of a bitch.

     Blaine and Sebastian laugh.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'll leave you guys alone.
                    (macho voice)
               Score one for the team, Greg.

     Sebastian leaves the room, then re-enters.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Come to think of it, there is
               something you can do for me.

30   EXT. ESTATE - ROAD - DAY                                   30

     Annette jogs up a dirt road on her morning run. THIRTY
     YARDS BEHIND HER - a golf cart drives off a meadow and
     lands on the road. Sebastian is driving.

     Annette looks back and scowls. Sebastian catches up to
     her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Need a lift?

                              ANNETTE
               No thank you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               How are you today?

                              ANNETTE
               Give it up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh right, last night. I guess I owe
               you an apology.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm not going to speak to you till you
               realize that you can't intimidate me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I said I was sorry.

     She continues her jog. Sebastian follows alongside.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Have a nice sleep last night?

                              ANNETTE
               It was fine.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I wish I could say the same for
               myself. I was up thinking about you
               all night.

                              ANNETTE
               I thought we agreed that we were going
               to be friends.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes, well unfortunately I can't just
               switch the "on" button to "off." The
               sad fact of the matter is that you've
               unintentionally rubbed off on me.

     Annette stops running and turns to him.

                              ANNETTE
               And that's a bad thing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm trying to better myself, but the
               one person who can help me is the same
               one pushing me away.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your
               savior.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well try this one on for size. I think
               I'm falling in love with you.

                              ANNETTE
               You don't even know me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Don't you believe in love at first sight?

                              ANNETTE
               Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this
               is far from mutual.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ouch. Do you think we could spend some
               time together this morning?

                              ANNETTE
               I can't. I'm seeing a friend.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Who?

                              ANNETTE
               That's none of your business.

                              SEBASTIAN
               How about tonight?

                              ANNETTE
               I'm busy.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Doing what?

                              ANNETTE
               That's also none of your business.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I
               win your heart. I'll do anything. I
               can't get you out of my mind.

                              ANNETTE
               You truly want to do something to make
               me happy?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes.

                              ANNETTE
               And you promise to abide by it?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Without question.

                              ANNETTE
               Alright.
                    (beat)
               I want you to leave and go back to
               New York.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What?

                              ANNETTE
               If that's a problem, then I'll make
               arrangements to stay with some friends.

     Sebastian thinks for a moment. He's pissed.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?

                              ANNETTE
               It's not about being happy. You and I
               can't -

     He shifts the cart into reverse and backs away.

31   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                           31

     Annette and Greg walk along the beach and gaze out at the
     ocean.

                              GREG
               He told you he's failing in love
               with you? I've never known him to
               say those words before.

                              ANNETTE
               Really? I thought he said it all
               the time.

                              GREG
               That's not his style. one thing I can
               say about Valmont. He always speaks
               the truth.

     Annette looks lost.

                              GREG (cont'd)
               What's wrong?

                              ANNETTE
               Nothing.

                              GREG
               Is there a mutual feeling between you
               two?

                              ANNETTE
               No. I mean. I don't know.
                    (beat)
               What else do you know about him?

                              GREG
               Not a whole lot. We take some classes
               together. He's got a bad rep, but it's
               mostly bullshit.

                              ANNETTE
               What do you mean?

                              GREG
               Well, a lot of people are jealous cause
               he's loaded.

                              ANNETTE
                    (sighs)
               I don't know. I've been hearing some
               awful things about him.

                              GREG
               From who?

                              ANNETTE
               I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.

     Greg takes her hand.

                              GREG
               Annette, how long have we known each
               other?

                              ANNETTE
               Forever.

                              GREG
               Now it's my job to look out for you.
               You're like a kid sister to me. Do I
               look like some kind of gossip queen?

     Annette laughs.

                              ANNETTE
               You promise not to say anything?

               On my mother's life.

                              ANNETTE
                    (beat)
               Okay...

     Sebastian drives down the highway towards Manhattan. He holds
     his cell phone in one ear.

                              SEBASTIAN
               That nosey bitch. Are you sure?

     Greg talks on a pay phone, out of Annette's sight.

                              GREG
               Positive.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Did you do everything I asked you to?

                              GREG
               Yes.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You told her I never said I love you
               before?

                              GREG
               Yes!

                              SEBASTIAN
               You told her that people are jealous
               cause I'm loaded?

                              GREG
               Yes!

                              SEBASTIAN
               And you think she bought it?

                              GREG
               I'm pretty sure she did.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Pretty sure or sure sure?

                              GREG
               She bought it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'll be in touch.

     Click. The line goes dead.

34   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 34

     Kathryn is sitting in front of the television, scowling.

     ON TV - A HIDDEN VIDEO OF RONALD AND CECILE IN THE
     VALMONT LIVING ROOM.

     Ronald plays Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata" at the piano
     while Cecile listens and sways to the music.

     ANGLE ON: LIVING ROOM -

                              KATHRYN
               Enough with the music. Fuck her
               already.

     She throws a magazine at the television. Sebastian bursts
     into the living room.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You would not believe what--

                              KATHRYN
               Shhh.

     ON TELEVISION - RONALD FINISHES THE SONG. CECILE STANDS
     AND APPLAUDS. RONALD TAKES A BOW.

                              CECILE (ON VIDEO)
               That was beautiful.

                              RONALD (ON VIDEO)
               Almost as beautiful as you.

     Cecile blushes. Ronald checks his watch.

                              RONALD (ON VIDEO)
               Well, I guess it's getting late.
               Please thank Kathryn for the use of
               her Steinway.

                              CECILE (ON VIDEO)
               I'll see you tomorrow.

                              RONALD (ON VIDEO)
               Absolutely.

     He approaches her, awkwardly then shakes her hand.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               Idiot!

     ANGLE ON: LIVING ROOM - Kathryn FREEZE FRAMES the image.

                              KATHRYN
               What's wrong with you?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You ready for this? I've recently
               discovered that our good friend Mrs.
               Caldwell is the one who sent the
               letter to Annette urging her to stay
               away from me.

                              KATHRYN
               Interesting.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I now plan to devote all my energies to
               destroying the douche bag. Any luck
               corrupting her daughter?

                              KATHRYN
               No.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Call Cecile up and get her to come over.
               I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.

     She walks over to the "freeze frame" image of Ronald and
     Cecile on the television.

                              KATHRYN
               The plot thickens. It appears that
               Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love
               that.

                              KATHRYN
               Not to mention Court Reynolds.
               Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the
               speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What's your plan of attack?

                              KATHRYN
               I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes
               ballistic and ends their relationship.
               Boo hoo.

                              SEBASTIAN
               But who will they turn to for help?

     Kathryn smiles and sits on Sebastian's lap.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile is planning to go away with Court
               next week. I'll need you to speed
               up her sexual awakenings.

     Sebastian rubs her shoulders.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm at your service.

                              KATHRYN
               Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh sis. You're so tense.

     Sebastian moves his hand down her shirt and under her bra.
     He's met with no resistance.

                              KATHRYN
               I hate when things don't go my way. It
               makes me so horny.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I hate it too.

     He takes his hand out from her shirt and slides it under her
     skirt.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
                    (baby talk)
               Oh baby, your soaking.

                              KATHRYN
               I know.

     She closes her eyes and rubs his crotch. She unzips his fly.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
                    (seductively)
               Any luck with your girl?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Moving along quite well.

                              KATHRYN
               Have you succeeded in your task?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Any day now.

                              KATHRYN
               Well, let me know when you do. Until
               then.

     She takes his hand out from under her pants.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               No pootie.

     Kathryn smiles.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Sorry.

     A meter maid writes a ticket on Sebastian's car when she
     grabs her neck in pain.

36   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       36

     Sebastian closes his window and sets down a bb rifle with
     an infrared scope.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Goodbye Mister Bond.

     He picks up the phone and dials.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Hi, it's Sebastian. I didn't wake you
               did I?

     Annette sits in bed talking on the other end of the
     phone.

                              ANNETTE
               No, not at all.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, I was just calling to see how
               you're doing.

                              ANNETTE
               I'm... I'm alright.

                              SEBASTIAN
               How was your date?

                              ANNETTE
               It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.

     There's a moment of uncomfortable silence.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, I was just calling to tell you
               I was thinking about you and I miss
               you. I'll let you go.

                              ANNETTE
               Wait, don't hang up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Okay?

                              ANNETTE
               What are you doing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Reading.

     He crosses over to his circular bed where two scantily clad
     twins (GRETCHEN & MORA) are licking popsicles.

                              ANNETTE
               What are you reading?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Of Human Bondage.

                              ANNETTE
               Somerset Maugham.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering
               my situation.

                              ANNETTE
               You're not gonna start that again.

     He takes out a bottle of baby oil and pours it on the
     girls' butts.

                              SEBASTIAN
               No. I'm through with my childish
               games when it comes to you. Hold on,
               that's my other line.
                    (to the girls)
               Rub.

     They rub the oil on each other then turn to him and
     smile. He clicks the phone back on.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Annette that's my mom calling. Can I
               call you tomorrow?

                              ANNETTE
               Sure. Have a good night.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I will.

                              GRETCHEN
               Of Human Bondage. You're such a
               bullshit artist.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shut up, Gretchen. You don't even
               know what it is.

                              GRETCHEN
               Duh, it's a book.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you know what it's about?

                              MORA
               Who cares. Books are for fags.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Books are for fags. I weep for the
               future.

     Establishing shot.

40   INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY                                        40

     A SALESWOMAN approaches Kathryn who's checking out an
     assortment of fur coats. The saleswoman holds up a
     beautiful dress.

                              SALESWOMAN
               Here's something you might like.

     Kathryn examines the label.

                              KATHRYN
               Do you carry any real fur?

                              SALESWOMAN
               No. All our fur is faux.

                              KATHRYN
               Of course. The animals. How silly of
               me.

     The saleswoman smiles, then walks away. Kathryn sneers
     then looks over at a small child, staring at her.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
                    (mouthing the words)
               Fuck off.

     She "shoos" the child away, when Mrs. Caldwell
     approaches.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I got your message and came as quick
               as I could.

                              KATHRYN
               I hope I didn't keep you from
               something.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Not at all. What's wrong?

                              KATHRYN
               It's Cecile.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               What about her?

                              KATHRYN
               Well... you promise you won't say
               anything to her. We've developed a
               friendship and...

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't
               drugs is it?

                              KATHRYN
               It's worse. I think there's something
               going on between Cecile and her music
               teacher.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Ronald? That's crazy.

                              KATHRYN
               I know. She's so young and he's so -

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Black.

     Kathryn reacts to her remark.

                              KATHRYN
               He's been sending her love letters that
               she hides under her doll house. I
               questioned whether or not to tell you,
               but something like this could destroy
               her reputation at Oakwood and I don't
               want to see her get hurt.

     Kathryn picks out an expensive suit and approaches the sales
     counter.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               I hope I did the right thing in telling
               you. I'd hate to see Cecile ruin things
               with Court.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I can't thank you enough.

                              KATHRYN
               You will be discreet about this?

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Absolutely.

                              SALESWOMAN
               Will that be cash or charge?

     Kathryn looks through her purse.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh poo. I left my credit cards at home.

     Mrs. Caldwell takes out her purse.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Let me get that for you.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh please. I can't have you do that.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               It's the least I can do.

     Mrs. Caldwell hands the credit card to the saleswoman.
     Kathryn turns to Mrs. Caldwell.

                              KATHRYN
               Thank you.

41   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - STUDY - DAY                      41

     Ronald gives Cecile a cello lesson when Mrs. Caldwell
     bursts into the room.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Who the hell do you think you are?!

                              RONALD
               Excuse me.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I'm paying you to give cello lessons.
               Not to pervert my child.

                              RONALD
               Mrs. Caldwell I think you're
               misunderstanding something.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Is that so?

     Mrs. Caldwell holds up Ronald's letters.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               You care to explain this then?

     Ronald and Cecile exchange looks of worry.

                              CECILE
               Where did you find those?

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Margarita found them while cleaning
               your room.

                              CECILE
               Those are my letters!

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Don't you raise your voice at me. Go
               to your room, now.

     Cecile turns to Ronald.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Now!

     Ronald nods and Cecile runs out of the room. Mrs.
     Caldwell turns to Ronald.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               How dare you treat me with such
               disrespect. I got you off the streets
               and this is how you repay me?

                              RONALD
               Got me off the streets? I live on
               59th and Park.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Whatever. You are never to set foot
               in this house again and you are never
               and I mean never to see my daughter
               again. Is that understood?!

     Ronald packs up his sheet music, while Mrs. Caldwell
     waits.

                              RONALD
               First of all, maam, I never touched
               your daughter and second, I would like
               to think that in these times someone
               of your status could look beyond
               racial lines.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Oh don't give me any of that racist
               crap. My husband and I gave money to
               Colin Powell.

                              RONALD
                    (sarcastic)
               I guess that puts me in my place.
               Thank you for the hospitality Mrs.
               Caldwell. It was a true awakening.

     He storms off.

42   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - ELEVATOR - DAY                   42

     Ronald rides down in the elevator.

                              RONALD
                    (angry)
               Took me off the streets?

     The elevator stops and the doors open. Sebastian and
     Kathryn stand in the doorway, wearing shades. Kathryn
     hands Cecile's letter.

43   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         43

     Ronald sits in a chair and reads Cecile's letter.
     Sebastian and Kathryn watch.

                              RONALD
               Wow. I never knew she had these kind
               of feelings.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You're a lucky guy.

                              RONALD
                    (eyes tear up)
               She really loves me.

     Sebastian and Kathryn roll their eyes.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               What do I do?

                              KATHRYN
               What do you do? Tell her you love
               her.

                              RONALD
               But I can't even see her. She doesn't
               have her own phone, I don't even know
               her e-mail address.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and
               pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her
               another letter.

                              RONALD
               How will I get to her?

                              SEBASTIAN & KATHRYN
               We'll make sure she gets it.

                              RONALD
               Why are you being so good to me?

                              KATHRYN
               Because we want to see Cecile happy
               and we know you make her happy.

     She hands Ronald a pen and paper.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Now you just march yourself into the
               study and start writing. We'll be there
               to check on you in a minute.

     Ronald leaves the room. Sebastian closes the door while
     Kathryn picks up the phone and dials.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Who are you calling?

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile.

     Sebastian hangs up the phone.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               What are you doing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Before we go through with this, I just
               want you to be aware of the damage we're
               going to cause.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm aware.

     She picks up the phone and he hangs it up again.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Are you really? I mean, we've done some
               pretty fucked up shit in our time but
               this... I mean, we're destroying an
               innocent girl. You do realize that.

                              KATHRYN
               What is that? Oh my God, it's your
               conscience.

     She reaches out toward his temple, plucks a handful
     of something, throws it to the ground and STOMPS on
     it.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Court Renolds is going down and if you're
               not going to help me, someone else will.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You amaze me.

                              KATHRYN
               Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you
               to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl
               it's wrong. Well let me tell you
               something, I didn't ask to be a girl.
               Do you think I relish the fact that I
               have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty
               four seven, so I can be considered a
               "laaaady." Do you think I take great
               delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so
               wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child."
               "Kathryn is going to make an excellent
               wife one day."
                    (beat)
               I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the
               upper East Side and sometimes I want to
               kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy
               being a part of the weaker sex and for
               that reason everyone around me is going
               to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis
               Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you
               out?

     Sebastian says nothing. Kathryn picks up the phone and
     dials.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Hello, Cecile. It's Kathryn. Alright,
               stop crying. I understand. Hold on for
               Sebastian.

     She hands the phone to Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Cecile. Now I need you to listen to me
               very carefully. I have a letter from
               Ronald that he asked me to give to
               you. Now I can't exactly bring it to
               your house, since your mother
               despises me so here's what we're going
               to do.

44   CALDWELL APARTMENT - CECILE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT              44

     The clock reads 1:30. A large collection of antiques
     and stuffed animals line the room and walls. Cecile
     lies in bed, eyes wide open. She crawls out of it,
     dressed in sweats.

45   MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT                                   45

     Cecile exits a building and steps into a waiting
     taxi.

46   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       46

     Cecile lies on Sebastian's bed. She finishes the letter
     while Sebastian fiddles with a camera.

                              CECILE
               Finished.

     She hands the letter to Sebastian, who looks it over.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Excellent.

                              CECILE
               You think he'll like it?

                              SEBASTIAN
               He'll love it.

     He points the camera at Cecile and snaps a photo.

                              CECILE
               What are you doing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Just taking your photo.

                              CECILE
               I look terrible.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes
               don't do you justice. Why don't you
               take them off.

     Cecile gasps.

                              CECILE
               I'm getting out of here.

     She stands to leave. Sebastian blocks her path.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm sorry that was out of line.

                              CECILE
                    (scared)
               I want to go home.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I was just kidding.

                              CECILE
                    (eyes watering)
               I want to go home.

     He moves toward the phone

                              SEBASTIAN
               Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom
               and have her come pick you up.

                              CECILE
               My mom? Don't call my mom.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't 
               know you're here. In fact, you're
               grounded. Jesus, you could get in a
               shitload of trouble for this.
               I think I should call her anyway.

     Cecile runs over to him, sobbing, and wraps her arms
     around his legs.

                              CECILE
               Please please please. I'll do
               anything. Just don't call my mom.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Cecile, all I want to do is give you a
               kiss.

                              CECILE
               And then I can go home?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Of course. I'm not a monster.

     Cecile breathes a sigh of relief. He pulls her up to her
     feet.

                              CECILE
               Just a kiss, right?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I swear.

     She closes her eyes, then puckers up. Sebastian takes the
     string holding up her sweats and pulls it open.

     Cecile bolts up.

                              CECILE
               What are you doing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You promised to let me kiss you.

                              CECILE
               But -

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (pointing at her lips)
               I don't want to kiss you here. I want
               to kiss you there.

     Sebastian points to her crotch. She moves her hands to
     her sweats and looks up at him. Sebastian shrugs.

     Cecile pulls the string to her sweats. They fall to the
     floor.

47   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - CECILE'S BEDROOM - DAY           47

     Mrs. Caldwell enters the room.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Cecile are you up yet? We're gonna to
               be late for the -

     She notices the bed is empty.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Cecile?

     She walks over the bathroom door and knocks.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Cecile?

                              CECILE (O.S.)
               I'm in the bath, mom.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs.
               Rosemond's before lunch.

                              CECILE (O.S.)
               Okay.

48   INT. CALDWELL APARTMENT - CECILE'S BATHROOM - DAY          48

     Cecile stands in front of her mirror, crying. She applies
     make-up to several hickeys on her neck. She XXX down
     her shirt and grimaces. She sticks her finger the make-
     up bottle, then puts her hand down her shirt.

49   EXT. ESTATE - TERRACE - DAY                                49

     Aunt Helen, Annette, Mrs. Caldwell and Cecile are having
     lunch. Cecile is wearing a turtle neck.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               It was nice of you to invite us up
               for the weekend, Helen.

                              AUNT HELEN
               More the merrier.
                    (to Cecile)
               Is everything alright my dear?

                              CECILE
               I'm just not feeling well.

     Sebastian enters carrying his tennis racket.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Afternoon ladies.

     Cecile is stunned that he's there. Sebastian takes a
     seat at the table.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               I didn't know you'd be here,
               Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I wasn't planning on it, but being
               such a lovely day, why waste it in the
               city. Anyone for tennis?

     He looks at Cecile and strokes the shaft of his racket.

     Cecile stands and rushes into the house.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What's wrong with her?

     No one knows.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (cont'd)
               Would you excuse me for a minute?

     Mrs. Caldwell follows her into the house.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (concerned)
               I hope she's alright.

                              AUNT HELEN
               I better go check on them.

     Aunt Helen stands and enters the house.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Alone again.
                    (beat)
               What are you up to today?

                              ANNETTE
               I'm doing some volunteer work.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Need any company?

                              ANNETTE
               You? Volunteer? I don't think so.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm
               trying to change here. You could be
               supportive.

                              ANNETTE
                    (smiling)
               Okay.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Babe, you're looking at the next Mother
               Teresa.

     Annette shakes her head and laughs.

50   INT. ESTATE - CECILE'S GUEST ROOM - DAY                    50

     Cecile talks on the phone.

                              CECILE
               Please. I need you. I don't know what
               to do. You're the only one I can talk
               to.

51   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 51

     Kathryn listens on the other end of the conversation.

                              KATHRYN
               I'll be there in a few hours.

     She hangs up the phone and smiles.

52   EXT. RETIREMENT HOME - DAY                                 52

     Establishing shot.

53   INT. RETIREMENT HOME - HALLWAY - DAY                       53

     A NURSE escorts Sebastian and Annette down the hall.

                              NURSE
               It's really nice when the young people
               help out. Most of our patients don't
               have any family nearby.

     They stop at a door and open it. An OLD MAN sits in his
     hospital bed.

                              NURSE (cont'd)
               Mister Gottlieb, we have a visitor for
               you.

     Sebastian starts to enter the room, when the nurse stops
     him.

                              NURSE (cont'd)
               Actually Sebastian, you're going to be
               spending the hour with Mrs. Sugarman.

     The Nurse escorts an unhappy Sebastian down the
     hall. Annette waves "bye bye" to him.

54   INT. RETIREMENT HOME - MR. GOTTLIEB'S ROOM - DAY           54

     Annette sits by Mister Gottlieb's bed and reads from a book
     of poetry.

55   INT. RETIREMENT HOME - MRS. SUGARMAN'S ROOM - DAY          55

     A senile MRS. SUGARMAN sits in bed, while Sebastian does
     a newspaper crossword puzzle and ignores her. He smokes
     a cigarette and flicks the ash into her bedpan which lies
     next to her on the bed.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               Did I ever tell you the time when my
               late husband sent me -

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes, you already did.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               I did?

     Sebastian never takes his eyes off the paper.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Right after we played backgammon.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               We played backgammon?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Uh huh. You beat me three times.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               I did?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               Excuse me?

     He turns to her and extinguishes his cigarette.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I said, do you want some water?

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               Oh... no thank you...

     There's a knock at the door.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Come in.

     Annette and the nurse enter.

                              NURSE
               How we doing in here?

                              MRS. SUGERMAN
               I won three games of backgammon.

     Sebastian smiles at Annette, who smiles back.

56   INT. PORSCHE - DAY                                         56

     Sebastian and Annette drive towards the estate.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's weird. I actually feel good about
               myself. Can we do this again next week?

                              ANNETTE
               Oh please.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What?

                              ANNETTE
               "I actually feel good about myself?"

                              SEBASTIAN
               I do.

                              ANNETTE
               You must take me for a real idiot.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I don't.

                              ANNETTE
               You're going to tell me that you had a
               good time with the old lady.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I did. We played three games of backgammon
               and...

     She throws him a look.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Alright. I was bored out of my fucking
               mind. I hate doing charity.

                              ANNETTE
               That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad
               person.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes it does.

                              ANNETTE
               No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being
               honest with me.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (sighs)
               I can't win with you.

                              ANNETTE
               It's not about winning. You know what
               your problem is? You take yourself way
               too seriously.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I do not.

                              ANNETTE
               Lighten up.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I am lighten. Can we drop this?

                              ANNETTE
               Fine.

     They drive on in silence. A smile comes over Annette's
     face. She turns to him, crosses her eyes and makes a
     face. Sebastian looks over.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What are you doing? Stop it, it's
               distracting.

     She holds the face. Sebastian starts to laugh.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Cut it out.

     He continues to laugh. She stops making the face.

                              ANNETTE
               Oh dear, are you actually laughing?

                              SEBASTIAN
               No.

                              ANNETTE
               No?

     She makes the face again. He laughs.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Stop that.

     She laughs with him.

                              ANNETTE
               There's hope for you, yet.

     She reaches out and holds his hand. He squeezes it.

57   INT. ESTATE - CECILE'S GUEST ROOM - DAY                    57

     Cecile lies in the bed. There's a knock on the door.

                              CECILE
               Who is it?

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               It's Kathryn.

     Cecile bolts up and unlocks the door. Kathryn stands
     there with a worried look on her face.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Are you okay?

                              CECILE
               No.

     Kathryn enters and locks the door behind her. Cecile is
     crying.

                              KATHRYN
               Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.

                              CECILE
               Something awful happened last night.

                              KATHRYN
               What do you mean?!

                              CECILE
               I... I don't think you want to know.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, you have to tell me.

                              CECILE
               It involves your brother. He... took
               advantage of me.

                              KATHRYN
               Does your mother know?

                              CECILE
               If she knew, she'd kill me. It
               happened at your house last night.

                              KATHRYN
               Why didn't you do something?

                              CECILE
               I don't know.

                              KATHRYN
               So, let me get this straight. You
               came over to our house late last night
               and he forced intercourse on you.

                              CECILE
               Well... not exactly.

                              KATHRYN
               He made you give him a blow job.

                              CECILE
               No.

                              KATHRYN
               Well what then?

     Cecile waits a moment, then whispers in her ear.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               He ate you out?

                              CECILE
               If that's what you call it.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, I think you're going to have
               a hard time crying rape if that's all
               he did.

                              CECILE
               What do I do then?

                              KATHRYN
               Well did you like it?

                              CECILE
               Well... I don't know - it was weird.
               At first it felt icky, then it felt
               kind of okay. Then, I started getting
               really hot and then I started shaking
               and then like, I don't t know... it
               felt like an explosion, but a good one.

     Kathryn laughs.

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, you had an orgasm.

                              CECILE
               I did?

                              KATHRYN
               I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a
               woman.

                              CECILE
               I am?

     Kathryn nods. Cecile embraces her, happy.

                              KATHRYN
               Now listen. Now that you're on your
               way, it would be stupid of you to stop.
               Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him
               instruct you.

                              CECILE
               I don't love him. I love Ronald.

                              KATHRYN
               So? Don't you want to make Ronald a
               happy pappy? Practice makes perfect,
               Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as
               many people as possible.

                              CECILE
               But that would make me a slut.
                    (beat)
               Wouldn't it?

                              KATHRYN
               Cecile, everybody does it. It's just
               that nobody talks about it.

     Cecile takes the information in.

                              CECILE
               It's like a secret society.

                              KATHRYN
               That's one way of looking at it.

                              CECILE
               Cool.

58   EXT. ESTATE - GARDEN - DAY                                 58

     Annette sits on the grass reading Gabriel Garcia
     Marquez's Love In The Time Of Cholera. She puts the book
     down and wipes a tear from her eye.

59   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - DAY                       59

     Sebastian peers out his window with a pair of binoculars.
     Kathryn enters his room.

                              KATHRYN
               I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I
               don't think she'll be giving you
               anymore problems.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yippy.

                              KATHRYN
               Who are you spying on?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Take a look for yourself.

     He hands the binoculars to Kathryn, who looks out the
     window.

                              KATHRYN
               That her?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yeah.

                              KATHRYN
               Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley.
                    (sarcastic)
               Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset
               by the big bad book.

     Sebastian grabs the binoculars from her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shut up.

                              KATHRYN
               What's your problem?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Nothing.

                              KATHRYN
               She's really getting to you, isn't
               she?

                              SEBASTIAN
               If you must know, yes. I don't know
               what to do. I can't stand that holier
               than thou bullshit and yet, I'm
               completely infatuated with her.
                    (beat)
               She made me laugh.

                              KATHRYN
               And that's why you're losing your bet?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm not losing the bet. It's just
               taking longer than I expected.

                              KATHRYN
               Do you mind if I take my new Porsche
               for a ride?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Kathryn, the only thing you're going to
               be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse
               me, I have some work to do.

     He storms out of the room.

60   EXT. ESTATE - GARDEN - DAY                                 60

     Sebastian walks over to Annette, who continues to read her
     book. She notices him and sets the book down.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Am I bothering you?

                              ANNETTE
               Not at all. Have a seat.

     He sits down next to her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Don't tell me you finished The
               Fountainhead already?

     She nods. He points to her book.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Great book. What's the guy's name,
               Florentino...

                              ANNETTE
               Florentino Ariza.

     Sebastian sticks his hand in his pocket and fiddles
     around.

                              SEBASTIAN
               My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend
               of Florentino.

                              ANNETTE
               Who's Monsieur Philipe?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You don't know Monsieur Philipe?

     Sebastian takes out a SOCK PUPPET.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
                    (low voice)
               Bonjour mademoiselle.

                              ANNETTE
                    (laughs)
               Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (Monsieur Philipe voice)
               You are very pretty. I would like to
               kiss you.

     The puppet kisses her on the cheek.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
                    (Monsieur Philipe voice)
               Oooo, that felt good.

                              ANNETTE
               Thank you.

     He kisses her on the cheek.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (Monsieur Philipe voice)
               That felt good too. I will kiss you
               all over.

     The puppet attacks a laughing Annette. She playfully
     grabs Sebastian and starts to tickle him. Sebastian
     tickles her back.

     They roll around on the ground until Sebastian lands on
     top of her. A moment of tense silence passes and
     Sebastian kisses her. The kissing intensifies until she
     pushes him off her.

     Sebastian stands.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I'm sorry about that.

                              ANNETTE
               I am too.

     He paces for a moment and his mood turns to anger.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You know what? I don't take it back.

                              ANNETTE
               Why are you doing this?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Because I'm in love with you.

                              ANNETTE
               I thought you said we were going to be
               friends.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I can't handle it. I can't keep my
               feelings bottled up like you. Can you
               honestly tell me that you feel nothing
               for me? ... Tell me!

                              ANNETTE
               I have feelings for you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Then what's wrong? I love you Annette.
               It's not like you have a husband,
               unless your married to Jesus.

                              ANNETTE
               That's not fair.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why can't we be together?

     Annette's eyes well up with tears.

                              ANNETTE
               You really want to know?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Yes.

                              ANNETTE
               It's because I don't trust myself with
               you.
                    (beat)
               I took a vow and because of you I'm
               tempted to break it. Don't destroy that
               for me. Please.

     She hurries off.

61   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - DAY                       61

     Sebastian enters the room and slams the door behind him.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (frustrated)
               Shit.

     He hears the shower running from the bathroom.

62   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S BATHROOM - DAY                   62

     Sebastian enters the room. Cecile sticks her head out
     from the shower curtain.

                              CECILE
               Want to join me?

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (indifferent)
               Some other time, Cecile.

     He leaves the room. Cecile looks confused. A moment
     passes and Sebastian re-enters taking off his clothes.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What am I, an idiot?

     Cecile smiles.

63   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - NIGHT                     63

     Sebastian and Cecile lie in bed. Sebastian smokes a
     cigarette and writes in his journal.

                              CECILE
               Am I suppose to be this sore?

                              SEBASTIAN
               For the first time, yes. It'll pass.

     A moment of silence.

                              CECILE
               I like it better when I'm on top.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Cecile. This is what I like to call
               quiet time. This is time when we
               reflect on what we've done.

                              CECILE
               I'm sorry.

     She looks at the troubled expression on Sebastian's face.

                              CECILE (cont'd)
               Something's bothering you?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You think?

                              CECILE
               Is it me?

                              SEBASTIAN
               No, you were fine.

     SEBASTIAN'S P.O.V. - He looks out on the balcony, where
     Kathryn is eavesdropping. They make eye contact and she
     waves.

                              CECILE
               It's that girl, Annette.

     He stands and walks over to the balcony, where he closes
     the blinds.

                              CECILE (cont'd)
               You love her, don't you? It's okay.
               I don't love you either. I love Ronald.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm getting out of here.

     Sebastian heads to the bathroom.

                              CECILE
               Where are you going?

                              SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
               I'm taking a shower.

                              CECILE
               Need any company?

                              SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
               No.

                              CECILE
               Want a blow job?

                              SEBASTIAN (O.S.)
               Good night Cecile.

                              CECILE
                    (under her breath)
               Prude.

64   INT. ESTATE - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT                 64

     Annette is reading in bed. There's a knock on the door.

                              ANNETTE
               Come in.

     Sebastian enters the room.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I just came to say goodbye.

                              ANNETTE
               Where are you going?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Back to the city. I may take off to
               Europe for the rest of the summer. I
               just can't handle it around here.

                              ANNETTE
               I think that's for the best.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Good for you.

                              ANNETTE
               Sebastian, please. I don't want us to
               end on bad terms.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, I'm afraid you don't have a
               choice in the matter. You make me
               sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't
               associate with hypocrites.

     Annette's eyes well up with tears.

                              ANNETTE
               How am I a hypocrite?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh please Annette. You spend all your
               time preaching about waiting for love.
               Well here it is. Right in front of you,
               but you're going to turn your back on
               it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age
               where we can get married. If we were,
               I'd propose, but that's not going to
               happen. So I guess we're just fucked.
               I'll move on, but you... you're going
               to have to live with yourself knowing
               you've turned your back on love. And
               that makes you a hypocrite.

     Sebastian heads to the door.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Have a nice life.

     Annette races toward him and throws her arms around him.

                              ANNETTE
                    (sobbing)
               Please don't go.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Get off me.

     She kisses him passionately.

                              ANNETTE
               I... I want you.

     Sebastian embraces her and draws her over to the bed.

     She lies down and starts to unbutton her dress. Sebastian
     stands over her watches her. Her crying does not let up
     as she continues to undress.

     Sebastian stands, stunned and watches her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm sorry, I can't.

     A pained look crosses her face. Sebastian leaves the
     room and closes the door.

65   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - NIGHT                     65

     Sebastian closes the door and leans against it.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shit.

     He wipes his eyes, which are starting to water. He goes
     over to a mirror at looks at himself.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Get it together you pussy.

     A stern look comes over his face. He smiles, then walks
     away.

66   EXT. ESTATE - FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY                         66

     A cab pulls up to the house. The front door opens and a
     crying Annette quickly leaves the house and climbs into
     the cab. She closes the door and the cab pulls away from
     the house. WE PAN up to a second story window where
     Kathryn is looking down and smiling.

67   INT. ESTATE - SEBASTIAN'S ROOM - DAY                       67

     Sebastian lies sleeping in his bed. His journal lies
     beside him. A FEATHER tickles his nose. He stirs awake
     and looks up to see Kathryn staring down at him.

                              KATHRYN
               Morning!

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (sarcastic)
               Morning.

                              KATHRYN
               So? How'd it go last night?

                              SEBASTIAN
               With who?

                              KATHRYN
               Well I know how it went with Cecile.
               She won't shut up about it. How'd it
               go with Mrs. Jesus?

     Sebastian sits up in bed.

                              SEBASTIAN
               If your asking if I nailed her the
               answer is no.

                              KATHRYN
               She shot you down.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Exactly the opposite.

                              KATHRYN
               So what went wrong?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I don't know. She was lying on the bed,
               ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I
               was... I just didn't feel right about
               it.

                              KATHRYN
               You're telling me you had the chance to
               fuck her and you didn't. God are you a
               chump.

                              SEBASTIAN
               A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to
               be rectified.

     He climbs out of bed and puts on his robe. He starts out
     the door, when -

                              KATHRYN
               If you're heading towards her room, you
               won't find her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Where is she?

                              KATHRYN
               You don't know?
                    (big smile)
               She left thirty minutes ago.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Where'd she go?

                              KATHRYN
               She wouldn't say. She apologized to
               your aunt and told her she was going
               to stay with some friends.
                    (beat)
               You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has
               come to her senses and she will never
               go near you again.

     Sebastian throws off the robe and starts to dress.

                              SEBASTIAN
               We'll see about that.

68   INT. GREG'S DORM ROOM - DAY                                68

     A shrine to hot babes, who's posters adorn the walls. Greg
     is busy dumping muscle magazines, several issues of Teen
     Beat and some Musical Theater CDs into a trash bag when the
     phone rings. He answers it.

                              GREG
               Hello.

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

69   EXT. HIGHWAY/INT. PORSCHE - DAY                            69

     Sebastian is talking on his cell phone.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Is she with you?

                              GREG
               Who is this?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?

                              GREG
               No.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Where is she?!

                              GREG
               I don't know. Why don't you leave her
               alone.

                              SEBASTIAN
               McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in
               two seconds if you don't tell me where
               she is.

                              GREG
               I told you I don't know.

                              SEBASTIAN
               One.

                              GREG
               Alright. She's staying with some
               friends of her parents. The O'Sheas.
               She caught the train twenty minutes ago
               into Grand Central.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Grand Central. You better not be
               fucking with me cause it's your ass on
               the line.

     Sebastian clicks off his cell phone.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Motherfucker.

     He bangs on his dashboard.

70   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY                                         70

     The Porsche weaves in and out of traffic on it's way to
     the city.

71   INT. TRAIN CONCOURSE - DAY                                 71

     A group of passengers exit the train. Annette is among
     them. She stops when she SEES -

     Sebastian, standing in the distance.

     Annette stops in her tracks. She drops her bag, rushes
     over to him and embraces him. Sebastian's cruel demeanor
     drops, when he realizes how happy she is to see him. He
     looks her in the eyes and smiles. They kiss.

72   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         72

     Sebastian carries a laughing Annette into the room. They
     continue to kiss and he carries her over to the table.

     He sets her down and accidentally knocks over a lamp.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ooops.

     They both laugh. They kiss some more, then start to
     unbutton each other's clothes. Sebastian struggles with
     her pants' button.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Fuck this.

     He picks her up again and moves to the bed. They
     collapse on the bed and he accidently falls off it.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Suave.

     Annette cracks up. Sebastian reaches up and YANKS her
     down on top of him. They both laugh, then kiss.

     Establishing shot

74   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       74

     Annette sits on the windowsill watching Sebastian as he
     sleeps. He slowly starts to wake and looks at her.

                              ANNETTE
               Hi.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hi.

     She walks over to him and kisses him.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               You alright?

                              ANNETTE
               I'm fine. I have to get going to my
               friends' house.
                    (beat)
               Was it --

                              SEBASTIAN
               It was perfect.

     She smiles and holds her hand out. He takes her hand in
     his.

75   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT                   75

     Annette closes the door to the bedroom and walks down the
     hall passing a mirror on the wall. In the mirror's
     REFLECTION is Kathryn, looking very angry.

     Establishing shot.

77   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                     77

     Sook-Hee carries a bundle of folded laundry down the
     hall. Sebastian enters the hallway from his bedroom. He
     grabs her.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You work way to hard. Here.
                    (hands her a wad of money)
               Take the day off. Merry Christmas.

     Sook-Hee smiles and moves on. Sebastian continues down
     the hall. He passes Kathryn's door and hear noises.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               Slower.

     Sebastian leans against the door.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               A little to the left. Look, pretend
               like you're writing the alphabet.
               A... B... mmm, stay on B.

     Sebastian knocks on the door.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               One second.

     Sebastian hears some fumbling then a door close from
     inside the bedroom.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               Come in.

78   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - DAY           78

     Sebastian enters the room, to find Kathryn lying in bed,
     wearing only her bathrobe.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Bad time?

                              KATHRYN
               Kind of.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well, you obviously wanted me to
               witness your little adventure or else
               you wouldn't have invited me in.

     Sebastian walks toward the closet.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Who is our little friend so
               inexperienced that you have to resort
               to the alphabet game?

     He throws open the closet door. Ronald stands there
     covering his genitals with his hands.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Well, well, well.

                              RONALD
               It's not what it seems like.

     Ronald picks up his clothes. As he leaves:

                              SEBASTIAN
               Say hi to Cecile.

     Ronald's head drops as he closes the door behind him.

                              KATHRYN
                    (calling out)
               Call me.

     Sebastian throws Kathryn a look.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               You can't have all the fun.

     Sebastian sits on the bed.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               You seem to be in a good mood.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I am.

     A big grin appears on Sebastian's face

                              KATHRYN
               You didn't?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh yes.

                              KATHRYN
               Tell me all the details.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It was... Fantastic.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh come on. For her first time?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I know. That's the amazing part of
               it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du
               Soleil acrobatics, just standard
               missionary stuff, but it was... ah
               forget it. I'm going to sound like a
               Hallmark card.

                              KATHRYN
               No, tell me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It was... it was like the emotional
               part outweighed the physical part.

                              KATHRYN
               Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear
               the birds chirping.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Mock, mock, mock.

     She places her hand on his crotch.

                              KATHRYN
               So I assume you've come here to make
               some arrangements.

     Sebastian stands.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Some other time.

                              KATHRYN
               Excuse me?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm not in the mood.

                              KATHRYN
               And that's why you're leaving?

                              SEBASTIAN
               It clearly is why.

                              KATHRYN
               I want to fuck.

                              SEBASTIAN
               And I don't.

     He leaves and slams the door behind him.

79   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         79

     Sebastian talks on the phone.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'll pick you up in an hour. I love
               you too.

     He hangs up the phone. Kathryn stands in the doorway.

                              KATHRYN
               Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.

                              SEBASTIAN
               No, I'm not.

                              KATHRYN
               P-whipped, p-whipped.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What's wrong with you? Why are you
               acting this way?

     Kathryn starts to cry.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're
               in love with her. You don't love me
               anymore.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a
               contest.

                              KATHRYN
               At first it was, but now it's become
               something bigger.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Kathryn, you know I love you. I've
               always loved you.

                              KATHRYN
               Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I can't believe you're reacting this
               way. You're just saying this because
               you lost the bet.

                              KATHRYN
               Is that what you think?

     He nods. Kathryn sits down on his bed. She slips her
     underwear off from under her bathrobe and tosses it
     aside, spreading her legs.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Alright, come on, let's get it over
               with. But mark my words, this is the
               only time it'll happen.

     She picks up the phone.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Whenever you're ready. Just stick it in
               me. While you're doing that I'm gonna
               make some phone calls.

                              SEBASTIAN
               That's not fair. You're taking all the
               fun out of it.

                              KATHRYN
               Then do me a favor and get rid of her.
               If not for me, then do it for you.
               Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's
               turned you into jelly. What do you want
               to be, one of those losers who walk
               down the halls holding hands and
               smiling. People used to respect you.
               They feared you and now you're going to
               throw that all away.

     Sebastian stares at her, lost in thought.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Poor Sebastian. He used to be cool, but
               now he's just another love-struck
               faggot. One of the many.

80   EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY                                80

     A taxi drives down the street.

81   INT. TAXI - DAY                                            81

     Kathryn and Sebastian sit in the back seat. Her arm is
     around his. Sebastian looks nervous.

                              KATHRYN
               Why so nervous?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I've never done this before.

                              KATHRYN
               How have you dumped girls in the past?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Screening calls. Any suggestions?

                              KATHRYN
               I knew this guy last summer in the
               Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the
               time were madly in love with each
               other. But she had this huge weight
               problem. His friends taunted him
               mercilessly about it. You know, "How
               do you breathe when she sits on your
               face?" "It's embarrassing for you to
               be seen with her." Finally he couldn't
               take it anymore and decided to dump
               her. She flipped and he went on the
               defensive. I distinctly remember him
               saying the same thing over and over
               again. "I'm completely fucked up."
               "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm
               completely fucked up."
                    (beat)
               Poor fatty never had a chance.

82   EXT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                       82

     The cab pulls up to the curb. Sebastian gets out and
     heads into the building. Kathryn leans out the window.

                              KATHRYN
               Don't be weak.

     The cab drives off.

83   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY             83

     Sebastian rings the doorbell. A woman (MRS. O'SHEA)
     answers the door.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hi. Is Annette at home?

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               You must be Sebastian. I've heard such
               nice things about you.

     He smiles.

                              MRS. O'SHEA (cont'd)
                    (calling out)
               Annette.
                    (to Sebastian)
               Come on in.

84   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - FOYER - DAY                        84

     Sebastian closes the door behind him. Annette enters the
     room.

                              ANNETTE
               Hi.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Hi.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               Well, I'm going to head back to the
               kitchen. You two have fun.

     Mrs. O'Shea mouths "He's cute" to Annette. Annette
     smiles and nods. Mrs. O'Shea leaves the room.

                              ANNETTE
               Would you like a tour?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sure.

     She takes his hand and leads him down the hall.

85   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - DAY         85

     They enter a guest room.

                              ANNETTE
               And this is my room.

     She closes the door behind them. She smiles and kisses
     him.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               You think we can be quiet?

     She embraces him. Sebastian remains lifeless.

                              SEBASTIAN
               This isn't working out for me anymore.

                              ANNETTE
                    (smiling)
               Yeah, me neither.

     She looks him in the eye and can tell he's not joking.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               What's wrong?

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's not you, it's me. I'm completely
               fucked up.

                              ANNETTE
               What are you saying?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Why aren't you understanding?

                              ANNETTE
               I love you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I know. I wish I felt the same.
               Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think
               it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm
               completely fucked up.

     Annette bursts into tears.

                              ANNETTE
               Why are you trying to hurt me?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm just being honest. I just wanted to
               see what you were like in bed.

     She attacks him but he grabs her hands and fends her off.
     He pushes her against the wall and covers her mouth with
     his hand.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Shh! Shh! I don't think Mrs. O'Shea
               would appreciate you acting like a
               total psychopath.

     She slinks to the ground and continues to sob.

                              ANNETTE
               You don't know how to love.

                              SEBASTIAN
               You don't even know me. The fact of the
               matter is there is some one I love.
               She's smarter, prettier... you don't
               even compare to her. The only reason I
               am here is because she wants us to be
               exclusive.

                              ANNETTE
               But you knew this was important to me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What, your virginity? Well that's over
               now.

     Annette clutches her stomach and continues to sob. He moves
     towards her.

                              ANNETTE
               Please go.

     He opens the door.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Sorry. I'm completely fucked up.

     He leaves and closes the door behind him. Annette
     continues to sob.

86   EXT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - DAY                               86

     A cab driver carries several shopping bags out of a cab.

87   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                     87

     Kathryn walks down the hallway and enters her room.

88   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - DAY           88

     The room is dark. Kathryn flips on the light.

                              KATHRYN
               Jesus.

     Sebastian is sitting in a chair, wearing his shades,
     journal in hand.

                              KATHRYN
               A little melodramatic, don't you think.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I have a flair for drama.

                              KATHRYN
               Mind if I ask what you're doing in my
               room?

                              SEBASTIAN
               You wanted an answer to your question.

                              KATHRYN
               Annette?

     He takes off his glasses. We can tell he has been
     crying.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Devastated beyond repair. I doubt
               she'll ever trust a man again.

                              KATHRYN
               Well done.

     He holds up a bottle of champagne.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I thought we should celebrate.

                              KATHRYN
               I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm
               expecting some company.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ronald?

                              KATHRYN
               Not that it's any of your business but
               yes.

     Sebastian holds up a letter.

                              SEBASTIAN
               From Ronald.

     Kathryn takes the letter.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I haven't had a chance to read it, but
               I'm sure it goes something like "yahdah
               yahdah yahdah you mean a lot to me.
               Yahdah yahdah yahdah I hope we can be
               friends. Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera."
               You see, I expected your sort of
               bullshit so I took the liberty of
               phoning Ronald and Cecile. Right now
               they're having a little get together
               in my love shack at the Grand Central
               Hyatt. I'm so sorry he chose Cecile
               over you, but I promised him I would
               see you through your crisis.

                              KATHRYN
               Well done.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Thank you. Now, where were we?

     POP goes the champagne cork.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Oh yeah, the celebration.

     He reaches down and picks up two glasses. He fills them
     and hands one to Kathryn.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What shall we toast to?

                              KATHRYN
               To my triumph, of course.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Not my choice of toast, but it's your
               call. To your triumph over Annette.

     Kathryn giggles.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What's so funny?

                              KATHRYN
               Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her.
               It's over you.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Come again?

                              KATHRYN
               You were very much in love with her and
               you're still in love with her. But it
               amused me to make you ashamed of it.
               You gave up on the first person you
               ever loved because I called you names.
               Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that
               you chose me over her, but please
               understand, I never loved you,
               Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little
               toy I play with. And now you've
               completely blown it with her. I think
               that's the saddest thing I've ever
               heard.
                    (smiles)
               Cheers.

     She clicks his glass and drinks. Sebastian doesn't
     drink. He looks ill.

                              SEBASTIAN
               In any event, you still owe me my
               reward.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't
               fuck losers.

     Sebastian slaps her across the face.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               You motherfucker!

     She grabs him and starts throwing wild punches. They
     fall to the ground.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               Nobody hits me.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Calm down.

     He rolls on top of her and pins her to the ground.

                              KATHRYN
               Get off me!

                              SEBASTIAN
               Will you calm down?

                              KATHRYN
               Fine! Get off me!

     He stands and gives her a hand up. They both catch their
     breaths.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.

                              KATHRYN
               I accept. Now get out.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Get out? We had an arrangement.

                              KATHRYN
               Didn't you hear what I said?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I don't care what you said, we had an
               agreement. You've slept with half of
               the borough so don't tell me you're
               being choosy.

                              KATHRYN
                    (screaming)
               Get out!

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm giving you to the count of three to
               plop your ass down on the bed.

                              KATHRYN
               And if I don't?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Then I will consider it a declaration
               of war. One. Two... three.

                              KATHRYN
               I think you have your answer.

                              SEBASTIAN
               War it is.

     He grabs his journal, leaves and SLAMS the door behind
     him.

89   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         89

     Sebastian paces while talking on the phone.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's desperate that I talk to her.

                              MRS. O'SHEA (O.S.)
               I've already told you, she's not home.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Well please leave a message that I
               called.

                              MRS. O'SHEA (O.S.)
               I'll do that.

     He hangs up the phone and THROWS it into a mirror, which
     SMASHES.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Shit.

     He collapses on his bed and buries his face in his hands.
     Exhausted he looks up and sees his journal lying on the
     floor. He picks it up and flips through it.

90   EXT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                     90

     Sebastian walks down the street carrying a small package.
     He enters an apartment building.

91   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT           91

     Sebastian rings the doorbell. Mrs. O'Shea answers the
     door.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               What do you want?

                              SEBASTIAN
               I need to talk to Annette.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               She's not here.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you know where she is?

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               She's out.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you know when she'll be back?

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               Later. Listen, we're entertaining
               some guests so -

                              SEBASTIAN
               Annette! Annette!

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               Young man, I already told you she's
               not here.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Fine. Could you please see that she
               gets this.

     He hands her the package.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               I'll do that.

                              SEBASTIAN
               It's really important.

                              MRS. O'SHEA
               I understand. Good night.

     She closes the door.

92   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - FOYER - NIGHT                      92

     Mrs O'Shea turns away from the door towards Annette,
     who stands in the hallway.

93   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT         93

     Kathryn sits in a chair doing her nails. She checks her
     watch, takes a moment and makes herself upset. She picks
     up the phone and dials.

                                                  INTERCUT WITH:

94   INT. RONALD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              94

     Ronald is sleeping. The phone rings. He awakens and
     answers it.

                              RONALD
               Hello.

                              KATHRYN
                    (voice cracking)
               Ronald?

                              RONALD
               Yeah?

                              KATHRYN
               It's Kathryn.

     Ronald sits up, nervous.

                              RONALD
               Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?

                              KATHRYN
               No.

     She cries.

                              RONALD
               What's wrong?

                              KATHRYN
               It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.

                              RONALD
               What do you mean?

                              KATHRYN
               I think he's high on drugs. He hit me,
               then took off. I'm afraid to be alone.
               Please come over.

                              RONALD
               I'll be right there.

     He hangs up the phone and grabs his pants

                                                       BACK TO:

95   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - DAY           95

     Kathryn hangs up the phone. She instantly becomes calm and
     returns to doing her nails.

96   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT       96

     Annette sits and stares at Sebastian's package.

     She picks it up and opens it. She takes out a journal
     and a letter. She opens the letter and reads it.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               Dear Annette. Thank you for reading
               this letter. I don't know what I can
               possibly say to rectify the harm I have
               caused you. For once in my life I'm at
               a loss for words.

97   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT       97

     Sebastian sits at his desk, writing the letter.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               The truth of the matter is that being
               with you was the only time I have ever
               been happy. My whole life has been a
               joke. I prided myself on taking joy in
               others' misery.

98   INT. MANHATTAN STREET - NIGHT (MONTAGE)                    98

     Sebastian walks the streets of New York. He seems sad
     and lonely.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               Well, it finally backfired. I succeeded
               in hurting the first person I loved. I
               wish more than anything I could take it
               back, but I guess that's not possible.

99   INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT - ANNETTE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT       99

     Annette continues to read the letter.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               Enclosed is my most prized possession...
               my journal. For a long time I
               considered it my trophy. A sordid
               collection of my conquests. If you
               really want to know the truth, then
               please read it. No more lies.

100  EXT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                     100

     We PAN down the side of the building to the ground.
     Sebastian lies against the building waiting for Annette
     to return.

                              SEBASTIAN (V.O.)
               A car is picking me up tomorrow and
               taking me to Martha's Vineyard, where
               we have a summer home. Nothing would
               make me happier than if you joined me.
               I'm a fucking wreck without you. If
               you're interested please meet me
               outside my building at nine. If not, I
               understand. Love, Sebastian.

101  INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT               101

     Ronald sits and listens as a grieving Kathryn tells her
     story.

                              KATHRYN
               And when I confronted him about his
               affair with Cecile he told me it was
               none of my business. Then when I said
               "Well what about Ronald," he said you
               were nothing more than a stupid... the
               n word and that you deserved what you
               got...

                              RONALD
               And this happened before you and I
               hooked up?

                              KATHRYN
               It's been going on for a while.
                    (beat)
               Then he called me a disgrace to our
               family and that's when he hit me.

                              RONALD
               Racist piece of shit.

                              KATHRYN
               I'd be careful if I were you. God knows
               what he's up to.

                              RONALD
               He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass
               in.

                              KATHRYN
               Will you stay here for the night? You
               can leave in the morning. That's when
               my parents get back and --

                              RONALD
               Don't worry about it. I'll stay.

     Kathryn hugs him.

                              KATHRYN
               Thanks Ronald. You're a good friend.

102  EXT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                       102

     A STREET CLEANING MACHINE drives past the apartment

103  INT. O'SHEA APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY               103

     Sebastian lies sleeping on a sofa in the lobby. The
     NIGHT DOORMAN taps him awake.

                              SEBASTIAN
               What time is it?

                              NIGHT DOORMAN
               Eight o'clock. You got to go.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Did she show up?

                              NIGHT DOORMAN
               Nope.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Do you mind if I check upstairs?

                              NIGHT DOORMAN
               I can't have you do that, nor can I
               have you hanging around the lobby all
               day.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I understand. Thanks for letting me
               crash here.

                              NIGHT DOORMAN
               Don't worry about it.

     Sebastian stands and staggers out of the building.

104  EXT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - DAY                               104

     Ronald walks out of the building and heads toward the
     corner.

     He stops when he SEES - Sebastian crossing the street.

                              RONALD
                    (under his breath)
               Son of a bitch.

     Sebastian walks toward Ronald, who blocks his path.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               Sebastian!

     Sebastian looks up at Ronald.

                              SEBASTIAN
                    (tired)
               Hey Ronald.

                              RONALD
               It seems that you and I have some
               talking to do.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Can we do it later. I've had a really
               bad night and -

     Ronald SHOVES Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               What's your problem?

                              RONALD
               Where the hell do you come off hitting
               women?

                              SEBASTIAN
               What are you talking about?

                              RONALD
               Kathryn. Did you hit her?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?

                              RONALD
               Did you hit her?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ronald, you don't know what you're
               talking about.

                              RONALD
               Don't know what I'm talking about? I
               know that you fucked Cecile.

     Sebastian says nothing.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               It's true, isn't it?

                              SEBASTIAN
               Ronald, I'm sorry.

                              RONALD
               You bastard!

     Ronald TACKLES Sebastian to the ground. Ronald lands on
     top of him and hits in the mouth.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               I trusted you!

     Ronald hits him again. Blood pours out of Sebastian's
     mouth. Sebastian is dazed. Ronald grabs him by the
     collar.

                              RONALD (cont'd)
               I trusted you!

     Sebastian takes a moment to catch his breath.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Fuck you.

     He knees Ronald in the groin. Ronald screams in pain and
     falls over. Sebastian climbs to his feet.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Why don't you give me a chance to
               explain.

     Sebastian kicks him in the ass. Ronald falls over.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Don't you get it? We were all part of
               her game.

     Sebastian pins him to the ground. Ronald struggles.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               I'm gonna let you up, but you have to
               give me a chance to explain. Understood?

     Ronald nods. Sebastian releases him and Ronald catches
     his breath. Sebastian looks up and SEES -

     Annette, standing across the street, witnessing the
     event.

                              SEBASTIAN (cont'd)
               Annette!

     Sebastian stands and races over to her, blindly crossing
     the street.

     Annette notices a speeding cab and -

                              ANNETTE
                    (pointing)
               Sebastian!

     Sebastian looks up just as -- WHAM! The taxi HITS him
     dead on, sending him flying over the car and onto the
     street.

     Annette SCREAMS. The cab SKIDS to a stop. Annette runs
     into the street and over to Sebastian, who lies in shock,
     He sees her and grabs her hand. She starts to cry.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm okay. I'm okay.

     Ronald and the Cab driver run over to them.

                              ANNETTE
               Get an ambulance!

     The cab driver races back to his car. Sebastian looks up
     at Annette.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               We're getting you to a hospital.

     Sebastian nods.

                              SEBASTIAN
               Holy shit.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               You're gonna be fine.

     Sebastian nods.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm sorry.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               It's alright.

                              SEBASTIAN
               I'm okay. Everything's good.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

105  INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                 105

     Blaine, twenty high-school girls and several friends of
     the family are dressed in black, making polite conversation
     and consoling Sebastian's parents and his Aunt Helen.

     Mrs. Caldwell stands in the corner with Cecile and her
     husband, MR. CALDWELL.

                              MRS. CALDWELL
               Sad, sad, sad. To think of the
               opportunities that boy had. This should
               be a lesson to us all that our children
               need constant supervision.

     She puts her arm around Cecile.

                              MRS. CALDWELL (CONT'D)
               It's all about quality time.

106  INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY         106

     Annette enters Sebastian's room, now cleaned up. She
     walks around the room, taking it in, then approaches the
     window. She stares out of it for a moment.

                              KATHRYN (O.S.)
               He loved that view.

     Annette turns and sees Kathryn at the door. She enters
     the room.

                              ANNETTE
               I can see why.

     Kathryn extends her hand.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm Kathryn.

                              ANNETTE
               Annette Harrison.

     They shake.

                              KATHRYN
               Have we met?

                              ANNETTE
               I don't think so.

                              KATHRYN
               Did you know Sebastian well?

                              ANNETTE
               You might say that.

                              KATHRYN
               Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your
               father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.

                              ANNETTE
               That's right.

                              KATHRYN
               I'm sure you're going to love it there.

     Annette nods.

                              KATHRYN
               Are you okay?

                              ANNETTE
               I'll be fine.

                              KATHRYN
                    (beat)
               Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just
               came in here to get something of mine.

     Kathryn walks over to Sebastian's desk and takes the keys
     to his Porsche. She goes to leave, when she turns back to
     Annette.

                              KATHRYN (cont'd)
               You sure you're going to be alright?
               I'm here if you need a friend.

                              ANNETTE
               Thank you.

                              KATHRYN
               Look, I know this sounds corny, but
               whenever I feel like I can't go on I...
                    (takes out her crucifix)
               turn to Jesus and he helps me through
               the problem. Call me an anachronism,
               but -

                              ANNETTE
               Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.

                              KATHRYN
               Excuse me?

                              ANNETTE
               You heard me.

                              KATHRYN
               Who the hell do you think you are
               coming into my house and saying those
               things to me. My brother is dead, have
               some respect.

                              ANNETTE
               Kathryn, I know all about you and
               Sebastian.

                              KATHRYN
               Sebastian was a pathological liar. I
               wouldn't believe a word he -

                              ANNETTE
               I have his journal.

                              KATHRYN
               You what?

                              ANNETTE
               His journal. He sent it to me the day
               before he died. Everything about you is
               in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs,
               the menages, your bout with bulimia,
               the affair you had with your guidance
               counselor and how he gave you... eww.
               Let's see, then there's your coke
               problem... You still keep it in your
               crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.

                              KATHRYN
               You didn't show it to anybody?

                              ANNETTE
               Actually, I was planning on running
               down to Kinkos. Do you think you could
               give me ride?

                              KATHRYN
               You can't do this to me. It could ruin
               me.

                              ANNETTE
                    (smiling)
               I know.

     Kathryn starts to cry.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               Kathryn, please. Crying? Didn't you
               once say that crying is a sign of
               weakness? I'm very disappointed in you.

     Kathryn continues to sob.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               Alright, stop crying. There's a bright
               side to this you know.

     Annette puts a comforting arm around her.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               You're going to be my pet project next
               year. You're going to do what I tell
               you to do, wear what I tell you to
               wear. You're going to befriend the
               unpopular, sleep with the insecure.
               Think of the social ramifications it
               will cause. You and I are going to turn
               this school around. And do you know why
               you're going to do it?
                    (beat)
               Cause your ass is mine.

     Annette grabs Kathryn by the face, KISSES her forcefully
     on the mouth, then shoves her back. Kathryn looks at her
     in horror.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               We'll be in touch.

     She winks at Kathryn then leaves.

     CLOSE ON: Kathryn. She sits down on Sebastian's bed,
     utterly defeated.

                              ANNETTE (cont'd)
               Forgot something.

     Annette steps back into frame and takes the car keys out
     of Kathryn's hands.

107  INT. PORSCHE - DAY                                         107

     Annette races down the highway. She opens up the glove
     compartment and rifles through some cassettes. She takes
     out The Carpenter's Greatest Hits and inserts it.

     CUE UP: The Carpenter's singing "Goodbye To Love."

     Annette reaches down and takes out Sebastian's
     sunglasses. She puts them on and checks herself out in
     the rear-view mirror. A grin crosses her face.

108  EXT. WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - AERIAL POV. - DAY                  108

     We MOVE off the Porsche and ascend into the air. The
     Porsche weaves through traffic as it disappears into a
     sea of cars. WE SEE the Manhattan skyline in the background
     as WE -

                                                       FADE OUT.

                              THE END
