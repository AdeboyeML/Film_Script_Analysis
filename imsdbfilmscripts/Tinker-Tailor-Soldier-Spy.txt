1   EXT. HUNGARY - BUDAPEST - 1973 - DAY                          1

    Budapest skyline, looking towards the Parliament building.
    From here the world looks serene, peaceful. Then, as we
    begin to PULL BACK, we hear a faint whine, increasing in
    volume, until it's the roar of two MiG jet fighters,
    cutting across the skyline. The PULL BACK reveals a YOUNG
    BOY watching the jets, exclaiming excitedly in Hungarian.


2   EXT. BUDAPEST STREET - DAY                                    2

    LATERALLY TRACKING down a bustling street, as the jets
    scream by overhead. Pedestrians look up. All except one man
    who continues walking. This is JIM PRIDEAUX.

    ACROSS THE STREET: More pedestrians. We're not sure who
    we're supposed to be looking at - the short stocky man? The
    girl in the mini skirt? The man in the checked jacket?

    A car driving beside Prideaux accelerates out of the frame.
    Across the street the girl in the mini-skirt peels off into
    a shop. The stocky man turns and waves to us. But it isn't
    Prideaux he's greeting but another passerby, who walks
    over, shakes hands.

    Now we're left with Prideaux and the Magyar in the checked
    shirt, neither paying any attention to each other.

    Just as we are wondering if there is any connection, the
    two reach a corner and the Magyar, pausing to cross the
    road, collides with another passerby. He looks over and
    sees Prideaux has caught the moment of slight clumsiness
    and gives the smallest of rueful smiles. A tiny moment of
    contact between the two. Then both men walk on around the
    corner, just two strangers headed in the same direction...


3   EXT. SUBWAY EXIT - DAY                                        3

    Shooting up the steps of the exit to the imposing GALERIA
    building on the corner ahead. Prideaux and the Magyar walk
    up the steps, still paying no attention to each other, and
    head towards...


4   INT. BUDAPEST - GALERIA - DAY                                 4

    A formerly grand arcade. Many of the shops are now closed,
    the one's that are open don't have much to sell. A CAFE
    occupies the middle space under the high vaulted ceiling. A
    JAZZ ROCK band rehearses in one of the nearby disused
    shops, incongruous in the window, music muffled by the
    glass. Customers sit around tables playing chess, drinking
    coffee, a mother breast-feeding, the hum of chatter. The
    ordinary world.
                                                               2.



We find Prideaux and the Magyar sitting at one of the
tables.

                    MAGYAR
              (Hungarian, subtitled)
          And porkolts. You know porkolts?

                    JIM PRIDEAUX
              (Hungarian, subtitled)
          Yes, I've had it.

                    MAGYAR
          It's very good. Better than
          goulash. But you won't get it in
          Budapest now.

                    JIM PRIDEAUX
          Why's that?

                    MAGYAR
          All the pigs have gone to Moscow.

He gives a sly laugh. Prideaux smiles, draws   on his
cigarette, nonchalantly examining the people   at the tables
around them. A WAITER arrives, belly bulging   out of his
grubby shirt, hair plastered to his head. He   puts two
wizened-looking sandwiches in front of them.

PRIDEAUX'S P.O.V. - A DROP OF SWEAT trickles from the
Waiter's face, drips onto the table top.

The Magyar catches Jim looking at the droplet and gives a
wry smile - "nice service." Jim smiles back but a bell has
begun to ring inside him.

                    JIM PRIDEAUX
          When do I get to meet your
          friend?

The Magyar chews on his sandwich, notices Prideaux is
ignoring his.

                    MAGYAR
          I'll take you to him. Not eating?

Prideaux pushes his sandwich across the table, his manner
still easy, but his eyes flick after the Waiter, who stands
at the entrance to the coffee shop, arguing with another
man. He looks around the Galeria again, looking low -
checking the feet of the other customers? Then raising his
gaze, he checks the windows of the apartments above which
look down into the arcade.

PRIDEAUX'S P.O.V. - An OLD WOMAN stands in the shadows by a
window above. She is watching him. Catching his gaze she
shrinks back into the darkness and disappears.
                                                                3.



Prideaux's expression doesn't change but he sets his coffee
cup down and casually stands. The Magyar looks up in
surprise.

                    JIM PRIDEAUX
          Would you excuse me a moment?

He starts to walk towards the exit of the Galeria. Behind
him his chair teeters for a moment, then slowly falls back
and lands with a CRASH, sending pigeons fluttering up to
the domed ceiling.

The WAITER starts, turns, sees Prideaux leaving. Panic
flashes across his face, he draws a GUN from the back of
his belt, aims after Prideaux and FIRES - the shot echoing
in the cavernous space.

The shot misses, RICOCHETING off the tiled wall and
Prideaux keeps walking, fighting down the impulse to run,
as behind him, out of focus - an image from a surreal
NIGHTMARE: the other CUSTOMERS stop what they are doing,
like actors at the end of a scene, and begin to rise, some
drawing guns. We hear a muffled voice shouting distantly in
Russian.

                       KGB MAN
          No firing!

Ahead of Prideaux   more figures appear, blocking the exit.
He looks over his   shoulder just as another SHOT rings out -
this one catching   him above the shoulder blade and sending
him flying out of   frame.

From around a corner a tall, over-coated man - KGB -
strides towards the scene, still bellowing in Russian.

                    KGB MAN (CONT'D)
          Who told you to fire? Who told
          you to fucking fire?

THE JAZZ BAND have stopped playing and are staring at the
ground, arms at their sides, anxious not to see anything.

In the TOP WINDOW - the OLD WOMAN slips back into sight.

HER P.O.V. - Prideaux lies face down in the arcade below.
As we watch one of his arms slides out, leaving a slick of
blood. Then he's still.

BELOW - The KGB Man has grabbed the Waiter and started to
beat him.

                    KGB MAN (CONT'D)
          Fucking Hungarian amateur! We
          wanted him alive!
                                                                       4.



     Behind him we can see the breast-feeding MOTHER. She's
     dead, a bullet hole in the centre of her forehead from the
     ricochet. The baby continues to suckle on, undisturbed.

     Through the cafe window we can see a MAN, partly obscured
     by the crowd in front of us, the only man still seated. He
     lights a cigarette.

     CLOSE ON THE LIGHTER as he replaces it. We can make out an
     inscription: "To George, from Ann. All my love."

     In the Galeria the KGB Man continues to bellow at the
     Waiter. The baby begins to WAIL.

                                               FADE TO BLACK.

4A   EXT. HQ OF BRITISH INTELLIGENCE - "THE CIRCUS" - DAY         4A

     A bird's eye view of the Circus.


4B   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR -   - "MOTHERS" OFFICE - DAY       4B

     A woman, CONNIE SACHS, a face that's seen it all, leans
     against a wall, smoking. A middle-aged woman, one of the
     secretaries or "MOTHERS" walks past, pushing a trolley of
     documents. She nods at Connie mournfully. Connie looks
     stricken. The Mother walks on into...


5    INT. CIRCUS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                           5

     A long conference table. We are looking at an ELDERLY MAN
     at the head of the table. He's sitting on a rather ornate
     carving chair - a little like a throne - and he looks ill.
     He is signing documents, his signature a simple "C,"
     scrawled in GREEN INK, aware all eyes are on him. A
     cigarette burns away in an already loaded ashtray.

     This is the head of the Circus - known as CONTROL.

     Around him are four lieutenants - the inner circle of the
     intelligence service - PERCY ALLELINE, TOBY ESTERHASE, ROY
     BLAND and BILL HAYDON.

     Beside him, his right-hand man - GEORGE SMILEY.

     From the thick and embarrassed atmosphere we might guess we
     are at the end of a coup, the final ousting of a King. All
     we hear is the ticking of a loud clock and the scratch of
     the pen.

     Smiley looks up to find Alleline's gaze fixed on him.
     Alleline quickly looks down at his hands.
                                                                      5.



    CLOSE ON SMILEY - as he examines the others, gauging the
    SHIFT OF POWER occurring in the room.

    - Bill Haydon - handsome, urbane, frowning with tension,
    pulls on his cigarette.

     - Roy Bland - heavy set and moustached, flicking a guilty
    look up at Smiley and away.

     - Toby Esterhase - immaculate hair and suit, eyes on
    Alleline, watching for a cue, like a dog told to `stay'.

    No-one will look at him.

    ON SMILEY - realising there is no hope.

    Control finishes, puts the pen back in his pocket. He hands
    the file to the MOTHER who, red-eyed, walks with it out of
    the room.

                        PERCY ALLELINE
                  (Scottish accent)
              I wish I could have done more,
              Control.

                        CONTROL
                  (Coolly)
              You did all you could, Percy.
              (Beat) Well, a man should know
              when to leave the party.

    Beat. The clock suddenly gives a discordant chime as it
    sounds the hour. A hint of bitter amusement on Control's
    face, as though he's been waiting for this wrong little
    note to make his move. He grinds his cigarette out.

    Toby can't wait any longer.

                        TOBY ESTERHASE
              What about Smiley?

    Control looks at Smiley. His gaze impersonal...

    ON SMILEY - the faintest flicker in his eyes as he tries to
    prepare himself for the shock of dismissal.

                        CONTROL
              Smiley is leaving with me.

    PUSHING Control and Smiley as they walk down the corridor.
                                                                       6.



     Alleline and the Lieutenants are waiting for them. A
     horribly awkward moment. Toby pulls open the cage lift
     doors for them, as if to hasten the eviction. Haydon looks
     at him with contempt.

                         BILL HAYDON
               You little prick Esterhase.

     Control sweeps past them and the lift, determined to walk
     every step of the way. Smiley follows.


8    INT. CIRCUS - STAIRCASE - DAY                                 8

     Control and Smiley, begin their descent through the rigid
     hierarchy of the Circus. As we TRACK with them, we see that
     each floor is its own WORLD. The two men walk past the
     fourth floor REGISTRY - the vast archive of intelligence,
     staffed by RESEARCHERS.

     Smiley and Control pass down another flight and along the
     third floor - INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS - heads poking out of
     offices, amongst them JERRY WESTERBY.

     Down to the second floor - SCALPHUNTERS - the muscle of the
     Circus. The boredom of an air-port lounge, a sunken sofa
     and pool-table. The Scalphunters watching them go in
     respectful silence.

     On down to the first floor TYPING POOL - staffed by pretty
     young society girls - the DEBS - who watch open-mouthed, as
     their Chief passes them for the last time. And finally
     down to...


9    INT. CIRCUS - GROUND-FLOOR LOBBY - DAY                        9

     An ancient doorman - BRYANT - feeling the moment must be
     marked in some way - leaves his sentry box and opens the
     main door for Control. Control acknowledges the salute with
     a flick of his eyes and we push through the doors...


10   EXT. CIRCUS - ROOF OF THE CIRCUS - DAY                       10

     Alleline and Bland stand smoking, watching Control and
     Smiley emerge onto the pavement.


11   EXT. CIRCUS - DAY                                            11

     CONTROL and SMILEY stand on the street. They stare at each
     other for a moment. This is goodbye. They shake hands.
     Perhaps there's a little reserve in Control's manner, a
     lack of warmth. From the expression on Smiley's face we see
     that he is pained by this.
                                                                       7.



     Control puts his collar up and walks away. Smiley stands
     forlornly as Control disappears into the crowd.

     TITLES OVER A MONTAGE


12   EXT. HAMPSTEAD POND - AUTUMN DAY                             12

     THE WATER OF THE POND - still, glassy.

     A MAN'S head breaks the surface - Smiley swimming through
     his retirement.

     He takes a breath and submerges again. Beyond him we see a
     straggled diagonal line of elderly heads, bobbing through
     the water.


13   EXT. HAMPSTEAD POND - DAY                                    13

     Smiley dries himself under the trees, pink and raw in the
     cold fresh air. He smooths his hair down, feeling a little
     less ridiculous. He looks over to where a VERY ELDERLY
     SWIMMER is being helped into the water - little more than
     trembling bones.

     Is this his world now?


14   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - DAY                              14

     A MOTHER unloads a stack of files from a LIFT shaft and
     places them into her wheeled safe. A piece of CHRISTMAS
     TINSEL is wound along the trolley. We track with her
     through the HIVE-LIKE atmosphere of the fifth floor, behind
     her the conference room - a glimpse of Alleline in
     Control's chair, surrounded by his lieutenants - smoke and
     whiskey - engaged in the business of the world.

     She pushes on into Alleline's OFFICE - loads the new files
     into the LARGE SAFE there, locks and spins the combination.


15   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - WINTER DAY                             15

     Smiley stands frying an egg in his small kitchen.


16   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    16

     Smiley sits eating his solitary lunch, reading a volume of
     Grimmelshausen. He turns a page, examines the illustration
     of a knight and a dragon - holds it at arms length, trying
     to focus on it.
                                                                        8.

      to him. He leans over and turns the light out.


17    INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - ALLELINE'S OFFICE - NIGHT        17

      A HAND removes files from the LARGE SAFE.

      slipped inside.


18    INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - EVENING                          18

      P.O.V. MYSTERY MAN

      ... TRACKING through the near-empty offices. All the
      drawers of the desks are OPEN. BINS on the tables. A few
      mothers working late, illuminated by their desk lamps. One
      of them is applying lipstick, prior to leaving. She doesn't
      react as we track by.


19    EXT. OPTICIANS - SPRING DAY                                  19

      We are looking at large blurred LETTERS. A lens is slotted
      into our frame and the letters leap into BOLD.

      Smiley is in a chair, being fitted for spectacles.


20    INT. OPTICIANS - DAY                                         20

      Smiley is selecting frames from a display. He tries on a
      pair, watched by a bored shop assistant, used to the
      pedantic ways of the retired.


21    INT. CIRCUS - GROUND-FLOOR LOBBY - EVENING                   21

      TRACKING with the BRIEFCASE as the mystery man walks
      towards the main entrance. The ELDERLY PORTER- BRYANT -
      nods respectfully.


22    INT. LONDON UNDERGROUND - EVENING                            22

      A packed train - Businessmen in bowler hats, long-haired
      seventies youth - the old and the new bumping underneath
      the city. We track low level until we find our MYSTERY MAN,
      the BRIEFCASE clutched in his hand.
                                                                      9.

24   INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                      24

     An elderly lady - MRS McCRAIG - stands at the sink. Through
     the window she catches a glimpse of the Mystery Man's legs
     passing, the briefcase in his hand as he walks up the steps
     towards the front door. Calmly she dries her hands as the
     doorbell rings and her DOG begins to bark furiously.


25   INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                      25

     Mrs McCraig opens the door and the figure passes her and
     the barking dog without a word and begins to walk up the
     stairs...


26   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY                    26

     Smiley adds a LETTER to a pile on the mantelpiece. We see
     the letters are all addressed to ANN SMILEY.

     He straightens up, finds himself staring at a PAINTING on
     the wall - a muddy abstract.


27   INT. SAFE HOUSE - MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                      27

     The room is almost bare - two chairs at a small table on
     which stands two desk lamps and a CAMERA. The Mystery Man
     has crossed to the wall by the window and opens the GRILL
     on an AIR DUCT.


28   EXT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT                                     28

     From across the street a tall good-looking man - POLYAKOV -
     watches as the opened duct spills a star pattern of light
     out into the night air. He walks towards the house...


29   INT. SAFE HOUSE - MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                      29

     The Mystery man settles at the table, sorting through the

      Lights glowing in the early morning gloom, an ultra-modern
      cube of a building sits in rather traditional grounds. This
      is the unlikely home of Oliver Lacon, Permanent under-
      secretary.


30A   INT./EXT. LACON'S HOUSE - MORNING                           30A

      As we watch a young girl - JACKIE LACON - appears at the
      living room window in her night-dress, playing with a toy. As
      we watch her we hear stealthy footsteps approach. Then a MAN
      steps into frame, his back to us, watching the girl through
      the window. He taps on the glass with one hand. Jackie looks
      up, surprised.

      As we pull back a little we see the man has his other hand
      behind his back.

      And in it is a long, bone-handled KNIFE.

      Behind Jackie we see a string bean of a man, OLIVER LACON,
      tying his silk dressing gown as he cautiously approaches the
      window. On the other side, the intruder stands, smoking.

      He takes in the man before him - filthy and bearded, you
      could mistake him for a tramp. But beneath the grime he's
      tanned and his eyes have a dangerous, feral edge. This is
      RICKI TARR.

      PETER GUILLAM walks down a corridor. Handsome, boyish,
      bored. He hears a TRING behind him. It's Haydon, one foot
      up on his pedal, scootering along the corridor. Guillam
      waits for him. He likes this man.

                safer in here, with you bunch of
                cut-throats.

      They arrive at a half-paned office cubicle. Inside is a
      very pretty GIRL, a new DEB, being shown the ropes by an
      older woman.

                          HAYDON
                Thought I'd get a glimpse of the
                new girl. Before Bland gets to
                her. He seen her yet?

      ... as Haydon and Guillam pass, staring in at her, cropped
      above the waist. Haydon appears to be gliding
      supernaturally by. He gives a little wave.


      BACK ON HAYDON:

                          HAYDON
                You may fuck me, Belinda, but you
                still have to call me sir in the
                morning.

      Guillam grins. Haydon glides off, hand raised in farewell
      as Guillam turns into the Scalphunters arena.
                                                                        12.

      falling asleep.

      BANG! A pool ball thwacks the window, cracking it. At the
      same moment the PHONE begins to ring. Guillam jerks
      upright, looks over at the pool players, too bored to be
      angry.

                          POOL PLAYER (O.S.)

      this is not a social call.

                Have I time to change?

      Guillam nods, following Smiley into the house. He glances at
      a painting on the wall - a muddy ABSTRACT. He crosses to
      examine it and then notices the bundle of Ann's unopened
      letters.

      dinner. It dawns on him that he really has invaded Smiley's
      privacy.

      Smiley appears in a coat behind him, taking in Guillam's
      awkwardness. He gives a thin smile.

      Lacon's daughter.

               list for a year. Last job was
               Istanbul, bit of coat-trailing for
               a Russian convention.

     They reach a large room, minimalist apart from a grand piano
     framed by vast glass windows. A tall, well built young man -
     FAWN - stands on guard. Lacon gestures to him and Fawn opens
     the french windows and he and Guillam walk out onto the
     terrace beyond.

               He said he had some intelligence
               for Control. Had no idea he was
               dead. The news obviously hadn't
               reached Wonga Wonga land. Then he
               said he would only tell it to
               someone outside the Circus. If he
               couldn't have a Minister, he would
               settle for the Under-secretary.
               Lucky me.

     Lacon lights a cigarette, smokes a moment, building up to
     something. Smiley waits him out. The room has become very
     still.

               He said there's a mole. Right at
               the top of the Circus. And that
               he's been there for years.

     Smiley absorbs this. The moment is suddenly broken by a few
     stray notes from the piano. The two jump slightly and turn to
     where Jackie sits at the keyboard, smiling triumphantly.

much damage he's caused.

     a melody on the grand piano.

     CLOSE ON A COLONY OF BEES

     GLOVED HANDS loading a COLONY OF BEES into a new HIVE.

     An APIARIST, in protective hat and gloves, turns to examine
     the MAN who has appeared in his back yard - GEORGE SMILEY.
     Smiley raises a hand.

     The Apiarist steps away from the hive and removes his hat
     to reveal a long thin face, keen eyes - INSPECTOR MENDEL.


46   EXT. MENDEL'S HOUSE - DAY                                    46

     Mendel, now in an overcoat and carrying a battered
     briefcase, climbs into the back of the car with a nod to
     Smiley and Guillam in the front. He begins to roll a
     cigarette as Guillam drives away.
                                                                       18.



     A stow-away BEE appears from somewhere and begins to buzz
     around the car. Guillam and Mendel swat at it clumsily.
     Smiley stares ahead in silence. He winds down the window
     and the bee flies to safety.


47   EXT. HOTEL ISLAY - DAY                                       47

48   INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - DAY                       48

     A large, faded floral monstrosity of a room. TWO single
     beds, a large leather CHAIR, a WIRELESS.

     Smiley's new landlady MRS POPE GRAHAM is supervising a
     gormless teenager - NORMAN - who is struggling into the
     room with a rickety card table. Mendel and Guillam take it
     from him and set it into the room. From the next room comes
     the unmistakable sounds of someone having sex.

                         MRS POPE GRAHAM
                   (re the table)
               It's Georgian, I shouldn't lend
               it to you but since Mister Mendel
               recommends you...

     She gives the table a sentimental tap, raising her voice a
     little to drown out the excesses from the room next door.

                         MRS POPE GRAHAM (CONT'D)
               You will love it for me won't
               you? It belonged to Mister Pope-
               Graham.

     She glances at Smiley who has his back to her looking out
     into the London street.


     SMILEY'S P.O.V.

     ... looking out at rooftops opposite and a travel agents
     sign which reads THE WIDE WORLD.

                         MENDEL (O.S.)

               Norman, can't he, Norman?

     And they leave. A small silence...
                                                              19.

          Her real name is plain Graham.
          Added the Pope for a touch of
          class.

Guillam gives a grunt of amusement.

                    MENDEL (CONT'D)
          Best informant I ever had.

LATER:

Smiley has turned his attention to the bed. He examines the
stained sheets with distaste. As he speaks he strips off
the soiled sheet and replaces it with a clean one from his
bag.

                     SMILEY
          Control lived with his sister
          didn't he?

He straightens up from the bed, smooths the pristine sheet.

Mendel flips his notebook back. He's already there.

Guillam is lying on the bed. Smiley stands at the window,
Mendel slumped in an armchair.

     block of flats in West London.


50   INT. CONTROL'S FLAT - HALLWAY - DAY                         50

     Smiley and Guillam reach a flat near the shadowy top of the
     building. Smiley studies the door. He runs his fingers over
     the door-frame and there it is - a little WEDGE at the top.


51   INT. CONTROL'S FLAT - DAY                                   51

     Guillam, followed by Smiley, pushes in against a mound of
     dead mail.

     They advance cautiously into the dirty flat, the windows
     fogged out with Windowlene.


     THEIR P.O.V. - TRACKING TOWARDS THE DOOR

     Guillam has reached the DOOR and disappears into the room
     beyond...


52   INT. CONTROL'S FLAT - DAY                                   52

     A green velvet armchair sits at the centre of a room.
     Beside it an ashtray over-loaded with stubs.
                                                                       21.



     The rest of the room is mounded with PILES AND PILES OF
     PAPERS - files, document boxes, maps and charts, something
     insane in the sprawl of it all.

     Guillam stands with his back to us staring at a CHESS SET
     laid out before the chair, as if in mid-game. Four of the
     chess pieces have had PHOTOGRAPHS of FACES added to them -
     ROY BLAND. TOBY ESTERHASE. PERCY ALLELINE. BILL HAYDON -
     all wearing paper PARTY HATS. The effect is ridiculous and
     a little disturbing, like some Surrealist objet d'art.

     Guillam hears Smiley and turns, almost guiltily, and as he
     moves we see there is a FIFTH PHOTOGRAPH on a piece - and
     it is of Smiley himself.

     Smiley stares at his image.


53   INT. CIRCUS - TOBY ESTERHASE'S OFFICE - DAY                  53

     Toby Esterhase is on the telephone, speaking softly in
     Hungarian. A look crosses his face. He suddenly notices
     Haydon in the doorway, cup of tea in hand. Esterhase asks the
     caller to hold and places the handset on the desk.

                         TOBY ESTERHASE

54   EXT. ROOF OF THE CIRCUS - DAY                                54

     Alleline stands on the rooftop, staring out over the London
     skyline, his expression ambiguous - perhaps obscurely
     troubled to have found himself at the top. He becomes aware
     of Roy Bland standing behind him.

     Alleline continues to stare out over the world, but allows
     himself a small smile of triumph - and relief.

                         ALLELINE
               Of course they do. We have
               Witchcraft. And they don't.


55   INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - DAY                       55

     Mendel and Guillam carry in boxes, each overflowing with
     files and bundles of yellowing papers.

                         SMILEY
               Thank you. Anywhere will do.

     They dump the files and Smiley turns to survey his room. In
     his hand he is toying with a black chess piece labelled
     "KARLA".

     The far wall is now stacked to the ceiling with the
     contents of Control's room - thousands of files and
     documents, piled in no logical order. The three survey the
     mountain of information in silence.

56   INT. CIRCUS - SCALPHUNTERS - DAY                             56

     The "Scalphunters" floor. Guillam is in his office, painted
     out panels below the waist, glass above. He sits, hands on
     the desk, steeling himself for what he has to do.

     Abruptly he stands and walks out.

     We TRACK with him as he walks through the Scalphunters
     "quad" area - a worn out sofa, the old pool table.

     One of the Scalphunters - KASPAR - stands flirting with a
     pretty SECRETARY - BELINDA - the "Deb" we saw earlier.
     Guillam acknowledges them casually as he passes. The girl
     gives a little wave. She LIKES him.

     Kaspar stares after Guillam. He doesn't.

     We continue tracking with Guillam as he leaves the
     Scalphunters area, walks down the corridor, turns left
     into...
                                                                       23.



57   INT. CIRCUS - MEN'S ROOM - DAY                               57

     He stands at the basins, checking the room is clear.
     Examines his watch, then crosses to the door and opens it a
     crack, peering out.

     GUILLAM'S P.O.V.

     We're looking though a glass panelled door at the PERSONNEL
     OFFICE. A dapper little man in a club tie - FAWLEY - sits
     behind his desk, idly tapping a desk toy - a Newton's
     Cradle. He too checks his watch. Lunch time. Gets up and
     walks out of his office.

     Guillam counts to ten under his breath and then abruptly,
     walks out of the men's room, across the corridor and
     into...


58   INT. CIRCUS - FAWLEY'S OFFICE - DAY                          58

     The Cradle is still swinging - steel balls clacking softly.
     Guillam is opening a safe, pulling out documents,
     photographing them with a SUBMINIATURE CAMERA.

     Close on the documents as Guillam silently photographs
     them.

     his pocket.


59   INT. CIRCUS - FAWLEY'S OFFICE - DAY                          59

     Kaspar opens the door and walks in, finding... the office
     empty.

     Then a faint noise. He works his way around the desk, finds
     Guillam crouched down, his back to him.

     a cut.

     suddenly and steps in beside him.

     Silence for a moment as they descend...

his hand heading for the pocket that holds the SUBMINIATURE
CAMERA.

He pushes his cigarettes into Bland's hand before he can
fish in the coat. Bland smokes for a moment.

              (Suddenly)

          What?

                    ROY BLAND
          Datsuns. Just got one. Wife made
          me. Hatchback. Caught sight of
          myself in it, driving past a shop
          window and I thought to myself
          "Who's that old fucker?"

He stares at Guillam with faint smile, but his eyes are
cold and watchful.

                    ROY BLAND (CONT'D)
          What are you driving?

      He continues to stare at Guillam with the faint smile, and
      Guillam feels a sickening wave of paranoia.

                Drink up and I'll drop you back.

62    INT. GUILLAM'S FLAT - NIGHT                                  62

      Guillam sits alone at the table reading a newspaper. After
      a moment, a man, his lover - RICHARD - a decade or so
      older - walks behind him, stroking his hair tenderly, and
      joins him at the table. Guillam automatically checks the
      window - the flat opposite, a lit window - could someone
      see them? He gets up and closes the curtains, settles back
      at the table, passing Richard a section of the paper. The
      two sit in domestic contentment, reading.

      A ministerial car pulls up and Lacon climbs out.


63    INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - NIGHT                     63

      The music - a CHARLIE RICH track - plays on a TRANSISTOR
      RADIO. Smiley sits at the window listening to the MUSIC.

      Guillam dictates from a photograph of the documents he took
      at the circus.

      Smiley becomes aware that the others are watching him. He
      turns away, tunes the radio into a DIFFERENT STATION,
      cutting the Charlie Rich tune.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                Jerry Westerby, dismissed
                December 4th. And... Connie
                Sachs, retired November 28th.
                That's just two weeks after you
                and Control were forced out.

      Smiley considers this, turns back to the CHESS SET. He
      writes Connie's name on a slip of paper, pastes it to a
      chess piece.

      There is a knock at the door. Mendel lets LACON into the
      room excluding a very excited MRS. POPE GRAHAM. Lacon's
      wearing a tux, looking extremely uncomfortable, almost
      offended at the role he finds himself playing.
                                                             27.

                    LACON
          On our way to La Bohème. The
          Minister wondered if there was
          anything to report?

                    SMILEY
          Not much, I'm afraid. We were
          just discussing the departure of
          Connie Sachs. I wonder how
          Research manages without her.

                    PETER GUILLAM
          Probably relieved. She always
          struck me as unhinged.

                    SMILEY
          That was one of her talents.

LACON looks around him, dripping disdain.

He turns to him.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
          Yes, I suppose I am. Perhaps
          that's what we have to become? A
          little paranoid?

He turns back to the chess board.

              (To Lacon)

          behind that sweep? What if each
          of us, whether we knew it or not,
          represented a threat to the Mole?

Lacon looks at a pile of files, distractedly picks one up.
He starts to leaf through one...

                    LACON
              (Unconvinced)

      He looks to Guillam for the name.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                Jim Prideaux.

      Smiley nods thoughtfully.

                          SMILEY
                Yes. Yes, he did.

      He writes PRIDEAUX on a slip of paper, pastes it to a chess
      piece. Lacon picks up another file, Something catches his
      eye: a letter head of FLAMES. He looks up shocked.

                          LACON
                How did you get this? This is
                Witchcraft material.

      He grabs the piece of paper, stuffing it in his pocket.

      Smiley looks at him. Lacon reads something implacable in
      Smiley's gaze...

      Smiley turns back to the chess set.

                          SMILEY
                Control was out. And Alleline was
                in. Thanks to...

      He writes the name "WITCHCRAFT" and places it on a chess
      piece.

      He climbs into the waiting car. We catch a glimpse of the
      MINISTER in the back.

                          SMILEY (V.O.)

64    INT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY                      64

      A third-rate English preparatory school. The string
      orchestra practice - rows of twelve-year old boys sawing
      away at their instruments. A teacher winces as he hacks at
      the air above their heads with a ruler.
                                                                       29.



     Near the back of the class we find BILL ROACH. He's plump,
     asthmatic, the last to be chosen for everything. He looks
     out of the window.


65   EXT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - DAY                                  65

     Roach stares out at us as the rain lashes against the
     window pane. As we watch an old blue Alvis, towing a
     battered, second hand CARAVAN, appears - reflected in the
     window - driving past.

     Roach watches, thrilled to realise he is the sole witness
     of this MYSTERIOUS NEW ARRIVAL.


66   EXT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - DAY             66

     We're looking down into the dip, at the DRIVER of the blue
     Alvis, setting up his caravan on bricks, in the gloom and
     rain. He's wearing a waterproof cape and hood, obscuring
     his face, giving him something of an air of mystery and
     menace. There's something odd about the way he moves,
     something about his back, as if it's been knocked out of
     true...

     The Driver rocks the caravan from side to side, loading
     bricks underneath, trying to get the thing level.

     He senses something and turns to find Roach behind him.
     Roach instinctively takes a step back from the hooded
     figure. Then, gathering his courage, he holds out his hand.

     In his palm, a MARBLE.

     LATER:

     Roach stands in the caravan, watching the MARBLE as it
     rolls backwards and forwards on the windowsill - an
     improvised spirit level. THE MARBLE comes to rest at the
     centre of the sill, a temporary equilibrium.

     Roach turns excitedly to the camera, about to call to the
     Driver, but sees something that stops him in his tracks...

     The Driver has stopped, his back to us, breathing hard,
     perhaps from the exercise or perhaps fighting down some
     pain. The wind catches at his cape and it flutters to one
     side, revealing the sweat-soaked shirt beneath. As we watch
     a DARK STAIN appears at his shoulder blade and begins to
     spread. It's BLOOD.

     Through the window we see Smiley buying a bottle.

     A large dilapidated Victorian house. We hear the faint
     sound of voices and pop music coming from the garden.

     Smiley pushes open the gate, walks down the path, past over-
     grown shrubbery until he reaches the door with a bell marked
     "SACHS."

     Glancing sideways he is caught, entranced, by the sight of a
     young couple kissing in the window. They turn, suddenly aware
     of his presence and Smiley, embarrassed, continues walking
     round the house.


     SMILEY'S P.O.V.

     A group of students in togas are rehearsing a musical version
     of Lysistrata. A young woman, holding her script, is miming
     to the song `Don't' by Doris.

     An older woman wearing rather too much make-up is carrying a
     prop. This is CONNIE SACHS - former Queen of Intelligence at
     the Circus. She examines Smiley for a moment, and then breaks
     into a charming smile.

     in front of him. Connie appears carrying a tray of tea.

     fingers and drinks. They sit, both staring at the students
     in the garden, caught up in memories of their youth.

               but I feel seriously under-

     They look at each other a moment. Connie's smile fades.
     She looks at him almost sorrowfully.

                         CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D)
               She doesn't deserve you, George.

          something, George.

Connie slows the images down, concentrating... OFFICIALS in
suits are walking into their designated places. We see
POLYAKOV amongst them.

One of the old SOVIET VETERANS, in dress uniform, a chest
full of medals, possibly a touch senile, LOOKS at him. Just
before he is obscured by another official we see what the old
veteran does.

He salutes Polyakov.

Connie's smile of triumph is reflected on the screen. She
lights a cigarette.

                    CONNIE SACHS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          I saw it, George.

Connie rewinds the tape and we see the salute - backwards.
And again - forwards.

          Why would a distinguished soldier,
          four medals for gallantry, salute
          our cultural attache Polly? Unless
          Polly was a war veteran himself?
          And if he was, why hide the fact?

                I went straight to Esterhase and
                Alleline. I said - "Polyakov is a
                Karla-trained Hood if ever I saw

85   INT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY                      85

     A fire burns in the little grate.

     ROACH sits near the back of the class. The BOY behind slaps
     the back of his neck with a ruler. Roach flinches but
     doesn't say anything. The Boy does it again.

     Prideaux drops a pile of books onto the desk of a boy -
     SPIKELY.

                         PRIDEAUX
               Hand those out.

     He crosses to the board begins to write on it - JE
     M'APPELLE MONSIEUR ELL...

     Behind him Spikely hands out the books, continuing to walk
     like a HUNCHBACK.

     The class snigger. Prideaux hears but doesn't turn,
     continues writing.

     Then from the CHIMNEY comes an unnerving SCRABBLING sound.
     A little soot falls...

     The sniggering fades out as all eyes turn nervously to the
     fire... what is that noise?

     Then, with a terrifying SCREECH, an OWL drops down into the
     grate, thrashes in the flames before flapping out into the
     class, its wings now ON FIRE, shrieking hideously, headed
     straight for Spikely who stands frozen in shock as the bird
     swoops towards his face.

     Then...

     ... somehow, Prideaux is THERE and grabs the burning bird
     from the air and in a second has it folded in on itself,
     NECK SNAPPED, and strides out of the room with it.

     The boys stare after their new teacher in SHOCKED SILENCE.
                                                                       42.



86   EXT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - DAY             86

     Roach is hiding, spying down on the caravan below, where
     Prideaux sits in the doorway, massaging his raised
     shoulder, and drinking something from a green beaker.

                         PRIDEAUX
                   (After a moment)
               Come down here.

     Frightened, Roach obeys, sliding down the dip to him.
     Prideaux examines him fiercely. Finally his face relaxes a
     little.

                         PRIDEAUX (CONT'D)

               Yes sir.

                         PRIDEAUX
               Gave me a turn up there, parked
               on the horizon. Thought you were
               a Juju man. What's your name?

                         BILL ROACH
               Sir, Roach, sir. Bill. I'm a new
               boy.

                         PRIDEAUX
               New arrival, eh? Middle of year?
               What's the story?

     Roach hesitates.

               My mother and father... my
               father's left, so...

     He doesn't know how to explain his misery any further.
     Prideaux pretends not to notice.

                         PRIDEAUX
               Bill? The unpaid Bill. Anyone
               ever call you that?

                          BILL ROACH
               No sir.

                         PRIDEAUX
               Known a lot of Bills. They've all
               been good `uns. What you good at?

     Roach tries desperately to think of something.
                                                                       43.



                         BILL ROACH
               Nothing sir.

     The boy's eyes start to MIST UP. Prideaux looks down,
     busies himself with brushing at something on his shirt.

                         PRIDEAUX
               You're a good watcher though eh?
               Us loners always are. No one else
               spotted me when I turned up here.
               Best watcher in the unit,
               Bill Roach is, I'll bet. Long as
               he's got his specs on. Right?

                         BILL ROACH
                   (Gratefully)
               Yes sir.

     Prideaux finishes his drink, nods to Roach.

                         PRIDEAUX
               Free period, isn't it? Don't
               waste it down here.

     Roach sets off up the dip. He looks back and sees Prideaux
     has walked into the caravan and stands with his back to
     him, rubbing his aching shoulder.


87   EXT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    87

     Smiley walks up to the steps of his home, stops, examining
     the door, his absent-minded air hardening into something
     more ALERT. He scans the step and stoops to pick something
     up. A WEDGE.

     Smiley walks into the hallway senses alert. He pads towards
     the drawing room, wipes sweat from his hands on his
     trousers, steels himself. Is it finally Them, come for him?
     He walks in and finds...

     lap.

          Losing my touch.

Smiley watches him closely, very aware of the knife. Tarr
rubs his beard.

                    RICKI TARR (CONT'D)
          I know what I must look like. Rip
          Van Winkle. Feel like him. I
          could sleep for a year. Two
          years.

          the way. Within reason. (Beat)
          You going to find him then? The
          Mole?

Smiley crosses to another chair. As he does so he's
scanning the room - automatically noting the changes - the
remains of a meal on a table...

                    SMILEY
          I'm going to try. How long have
          you been here?

                    RICKI TARR
          Few days. Needed somewhere to
          hide.

Smiley notices the pile of letters for his wife Ann -
they've been disturbed.

          I wouldn't use my home as a safe
          house. There's every chance

                turn up here sooner or later.

                trade for her. Get her back from
                Karla.

      Tarr finishes his cigarette, lights another.

90    EXT. ISTANBUL - AIRPORT - DAY - PAST                         90

      Ricki Tarr emerges blinking into the white sunshine.
      Groomed, smart, that same restless energy. A car pulls up
      across the road TUFTY THESINGER - a boiled-looking British
      spy, not over-bright, signals to him. Tarr pulls his shades
      down and saunters over to his ride.

                          RICKI TARR (O.S.)
                I met her in Istanbul. They'd
                found some Russian trade
                delegate, name of Boris. He was
                spending high and wide in the
                nightclubs and some idiot thought
                we could turn him.

      Tarr opens the back seat and gets in. Tufty's slightly
      foolish smile slips a little.

      Nineteenth century European grandeur. But the apartment
      we're in is deserted and in a state of disrepair. Tarr
      stands at tripod mounted BINOCULARS set back from the
      window, idly playing with a knife with a distinctive white
      BONE handle.
                                                                       46.



92   EXT. ISTANBUL - IRINA'S HOTEL - NIGHT                        92

     TARR'S P.O.V. - the HOTEL opposite - a Brutalist concrete
     slab, the rooms have floor to ceiling windows. In the
     bedroom a heavy set man - BORIS - is having sex with a
     MAID.

                         RICKI TARR (V.O.)
               I took one look and saw that he
               was a hood, Moscow trained.

     We TRACK to one side, and see the "drawing room" of the
     hotel suite, where Boris' two MINDERS, SERGEI and IVAN,
     wait, smirking at the sounds coming from the bedroom.

                         RICKI TARR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               Probably coat trailing, trying to
               draw one of our men out into the
               open.

     We TRACK further along again and see the CORRIDOR outside
     the hotel room, where a YOUNG WOMAN has just arrived. This
     is IRINA.

                         RICKI TARR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               He had a wife with him. Common-
               law.

     Irina opens the door and walks into the drawing room, where
     the Minders stare fixedly at the floor, trying not to
     laugh. She walks on past and into the bedroom. The Maid
     jumps out of the bed, grabs her clothes and flees. Boris
     lies, unconcerned, reaches for his cigarettes.

     Irina walks past him and we track with her as she enters a
     BATHROOM. The glass window here is two-thirds frosted and
     we lose her as she bends over a basin.

     Something about her has caught Tarr's attention and he
     leaves the binoculars, walking closer to the window.

     Suddenly IRINA straightens up, her head above the frosted
     glass and stares straight at us...

     HER P.O.V. -

     RICKI TARR standing at the window opposite, knowing he
     should turn away, but somehow snagged by that look.

     A moment between the two. Then a car sweeps past on the
     road below and there's a flash of light behind Ricki's head
     - the headlights reflected in the lenses of the now visible
     BINOCULARS. Irina absorbs this. Above everything else,
     anger at her humiliation being observed.
                                                                        47.

      As Irina walks back out of the bathroom, picks up a vase
      and hurls it at Boris, just missing him. He stubs out his
      cigarette and calmly climbs out of the bed. As we watch he
      draws the curtains along the length of the room, obscuring
      our view. Seconds later the curtains billow as Irina is
      thrown against them. We watch as her shape is rolled along
      the window by the force of Boris' blows. Finally the
      billowing fabric settles. Moments later Boris opens the
      curtains again and starts to dress. Irina lies on the bed.

      Tufty Thesinger at a table. He crosses towards him,

       Irina and Tarr laughing, flirting. They move closer to one
       another.

       Tarr feels he is the master of this situation.

       Suddenly Irina withdraws. She stares at him.

      lies on the floor, in a pool of blood. He's been tortured,
      one eye gouged out. The other manages to convey a rather
      touching amazement at the violence worked on him. His throat
      has been slit wide open. Tarr absorbs this, looks at the
      knife in his own hand, turns and runs.

      BUTCHERED REMAINS of BORIS hanging from the shower rail, a
      garroting wire around his neck. He's been tortured, the
      shower curtain used to catch the pooling blood.

      of bloody footprints on the pale carpet.

      She turns to the door, looks out of the SPY HOLE.

                arms.

      The Minister considers this with some excitement, takes a
      drag on his cigarette.

                          MINISTER
                You think they'll take us back
                into bed?

                          PERCY ALLELINE
                I'm not interested in a one-off
                trade. I want on-going access to
                American intelligence.

      This stops the Minister. He turns to face Alleline.

                          MINISTER
                Do you think we can get it?

      Alleline senses he has just risen several rungs. He slashes
      inexpertly with his racquet.
                                                                       57.

      Smiley swims in the placid water. We hear music. The tinkle
      of glasses from a happy Christmas party...

                Percy. Did you do this?

      A Christmas Party of the past. Control, at the height of
      his powers, a punch glass in hand. Noise and music: the
      normally earnest atmosphere of the Circus released in an
      unexpectedly boisterous gathering.

                          CONTROL (CONT'D)
                You penny pinching Scot. Can you
                not take a bloody order. No one
                is to tamper with the recipe.
                It's going to take us five hours
                to get drunk on this piss water.

      Alleline tries to smile.

                I followed the recipe.

      He glances nervously at his wife, a vivacious alcoholic,
      just beginning to make a show of herself. She puts a CROWN-
      SHAPED party hat from the cracker onto Alleline's head. He
      brushes it off, anxious not to appear the fool.

      dancers. Alleline relieved, crisis averted.

       We find Smiley trapped in a conversation with an earnestly
       drunk deb. Control raises his arm above the melee. He's
       still at the punch bowl.

                           CONTROL
                 Smiley? Where's Ann? Get me a
                 lady of taste? Ann will sort it
                 out.

                      from the deb)
                 I'll go find her.

       Smiley threads his way through the party, walking amongst
       his colleagues, enjoying himself... Jerry Westerby and
       Connie Sachs are arm in arm, singing along to a song - "The
       Second Worst Spy in the World." They link Smiley to them
       for a verse, others joining in around them. The song segues
       into the Russian National Anthem. The crowd sing lustily,
       many of them Russian-speaking, enjoying the chance to sing
       with vigour.

       Smiley walks on. Behind him the song ends to be replaced by
       the CHARLIE RICH song we heard earlier.

       His P.O.V. -

       - One of the larger Mothers doubled up with laughter,
       pulling a cracker with a flushed TOBY ESTERHASE, hopelessly
       outweighed, but competitive to the finish.

        - ROY BLAND with his plain wife, eyeing one of the pretty
       debs as she dances by. A mother takes Smiley by the hand
       and leads him briefly into the dance. Smiley takes a turn
       with her, and extricates himself. Still smiling...

       ... he walks down a dark corridor, the noise of the party
       fading away behind him.

       He stops seeing something in the shadows of an office. For
       a moment he doesn't understand what he's seen.

       REVERSE

       Two shapes locked in an embrace.

       Smiley stands, nakedly absorbing the body blow. Then he
       turns and walks back to the heat and noise of the party.
                                                                        59.

      Smiley and Guillam sit on a bench. Smiley has his towel,
      hair wet from his swim.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                You look tired.

      Smiley considers telling Guillam about Tarr's visit, but an
      instinct for secrecy wins out.

      Guillam nods. He gets up and walks quickly away. After a
      moment a MAN rises from a nearby bench and saunters over.
      It's Mendel.

                          MENDEL
                You're clean. Nothing on your

      A LORRY roars past, wiping frame and revealing Guillam
      arriving at the circus, carrying his briefcase. He springs
      up the four steps.


133   INT. CIRCUS - GROUND-FLOOR LOBBY - DAY                      133

      Guillam is at the security gate at the dingy lobby. The
      security guard, Bryant, steps from his box. Beyond him is
      the row of lifts.

                          BRYANT
                Mister Guillam? How's the family?
                                                              60.



                    PETER GUILLAM
          Fine, Bryant. Up to Registry
          today.

                    BRYANT
          Okay sir. Yellow one for the bag
          sir.

Bryant stamps a PINK chit and hands it to Guillam, pulling
open the lift cage. He gives him a yellow slip for the bag.

Guillam climbs inside and begins to ascend, rattlingly
slowly. As Bryant's head disappears...

                    PETER GUILLAM
          Time you oiled this thing, isn't
          it?

                    BRYANT (O.S.)
          We keep asking...

Guillam examines the chit. He wipes his hands. For the
first time we realize how NERVOUS he is.

Polished shoes appear as they reach the floor, then the
uniform trousers of a short man. A self-important JANITOR.

Guillam steps out and the Janitor checks Guillam's pink and
yellow chit and motions him through a turnstile. Then he
stops him short. He gestures for Guillam to raise his arms.

                    PETER GUILLAM
          You're kidding?

                       JANITOR PETE
          New rules.

Guillam is briskly frisked.

          Mind the jewels.

                    JANITOR PETE
          Pen and watch sir.

He holds up a box and Guillam hands him his fountain pen
and watch.

The search over Guillam sets off down the corridor,
unnerved by the task ahead - betraying his own kind.

                    BILL HAYDON (O.S.)
          What the hell are you doing up
          here?

Guillam freezes. Then he turns. It's Bill Haydon standing
in a doorway, frowning at him over his spectacles. A
moment.
                                                                       61.

                Why would I be? You bloody
                pariah.

      Then Bill grins, the grin transforming his face. Guillam
      smiles back, relief mixing with real warmth.

                          BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)
                We like the Scalp-hunters to know

                Heard it was quiet down there.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                As the grave. When're you going
                to give us something to do?

                          BILL HAYDON
                Haven't you heard? Technology's
                the future. No need for you apes
                anymore. I can get you a posting
                to Northern Ireland if that helps
                get the blood racing.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                Thanks anyway. Stick to sitting
                on my arse.

      They've reached the end of the corridor. Haydon peels away,
      a hand raised in farewell.


134   INT. CIRCUS - READING ROOM - DAY                           134

      Guillam arrives at a counter which serves to block entry to
      the vast archive of files beyond. A Janitor appears in the
      entrance. He pushes a book towards Guillam to sign.

                          JANITOR ALWYN
                    (re: Guillam's bag)

                          PETER GUILLAM
                So, chit me.

      The Janitor grins, slaps a chit on the bag, raises the
      counter and Guillam enters.

      A few researchers sit amongst stacks of files. Guillam is
      filling out requisition slips. Behind the desk, a woman -
      SAL - watches him.

                          SAL

      Mendel sits in his car, watching the garage fore-court. He
      looks at his watch.


137   INT. CIRCUS - ARCHIVE - DAY                                 137

      The LIFT CAGE we saw earlier is being raised from the floor
      by a Janitor at the winch. Another janitor is removing
      files from it.

      Radiating out from the lift cage are the shelves of files
      that make up the reading room.
                                                                        63.



      We find Guillam moving along the shelves reading the
      fluorescent number cards. He takes a file out, leaving his
      green slip in the brackets provided by each file. Guillam
      looks across at his real objective...

      A row of anonymous looking files on the next aisle - the
      archived DUTY OFFICER'S LOG-BOOKS, spines bearing the year
      and month they cover.

      And in his way - a GIRL perched on a ladder, a MAN mending
      a radiator. The Man turns round and stares straight at
      Guillam. Suddenly he POINTS STRAIGHT AT HIM. For a moment
      Guillam freezes, unnerved. Then he glances over his
      shoulder and realises the Man is communicating with another
      WORKMAN behind him.

      Abruptly, Guillam walks over to the file and swaps it,
      keeping the title close to his chest. He goes back to his
      desk, a light film of sweat on his forehead.

      He sits, a pencil clamped between his teeth, waiting...
      From somewhere nearby comes the sound of a PHONE RINGING,
      then being answered. Moments later...

      Guillam walks over to the counter, the stolen file hugged
      to his chest.

      A LOCKED BOX on a trolley is wheeled towards him and is
      opened to reveal the OUTSIDE LINE TELEPHONE.

      Alwyn gets Guillam's bag and brings it over to him.

                Thanks.

      Alwyn goes back to his post. Guillam, still hugging the
      phone, takes out a BEIGE file from his bag and switches it
      with the one against his chest. He takes an address book
      from the bag and finds a number.

      Guillam retraces his steps, placing his dummy file in the
      pink stack, replacing the one he placed there in its
      original shelf, remembering to take the green slip from the
      bracket. It's done.

      Guillam takes the green slip and hands it to Sal, who signs
      it and puts it on its spike. Guillam turns.
                                                                     65.

                so kind.

                             PETER GUILLAM
                Of course.

      Esterhase turns and Guillam, mind whirring, follows him
      back out through the counter.

      Alleline sits in the baronial chair, Bland at his left.
      Haydon on his right. Esterhase trots over to his seat.
      Guillam takes in the REPORT they all seem to have spread
      out in front of them.

                What are you getting up to down
                there these days, apart from
                chasing our virgins...

      Guillam catches a smirk from Esterhase - mocking him?

                          PETER GUILLAM
                Couple of Arab ploys look quite
                promising. Other than that,

          consorting with an enemy agent
          behind my back! Don't damn well
          shrug at me! How'd you like a
          term in prison?

Guillam's own temper comes to his rescue.

          But I haven't been seeing him! So
          get your facts straight and get
          OFF MY BACK!

A moment, while the room digests this. A relaxation of the
tension, as if he's passed some kind of test.

This DOES shock Guillam, but he manages to hold on to his
sullen expression.

      Guillam is walking to the lifts, we note he is now carrying
      his BAG. Behind him ROY BLAND is walking down the corridor.
      He peels off, turning left, humming a tune to himself - the
      same POP SONG that was playing at the garage in the
      background of Guillam's call. Guillam reacts as he keeps on
      walking, trying to work out if this MEANS SOMETHING. We
      track with him as his anger and PARANOIA grow.

      Guillam drives down an alleyway full speed, screeches to a
      halt as he reaches a group of children playing, edges past
      them and on into the car body repair shop. He gets and
      strides past the elderly GERMAN MECHANIC we saw earlier.

      Guillam strides on, nerves at snapping point, to the other

      Behind him the Mechanic and his SON are already beginning
      to strip the plates off Guillam's car.

      There's a large tape recorder on the table behind him. We
      hear the door to the flat opening.

Guillam hurries into the room, stops, seeing Tarr. Tarr
gives his sunny grin but he's sweating, his eyes full of
tension.

                    TARR
          Hello, Mister Guillam, sorry I
          took so long to come back.

Guillam punches him in the face, drags him from the chair,
the two struggling.

Behind them Smiley and Fawn appear. Smiley watches coolly
for a moment then signals Fawn, who drags Guillam off Tarr,
expertly pinning his arm.

                    FAWN

Guillam pulls free angrily.

          no telegram! The whole thing...

          November 20th. It would have been
          November 20th. Evening.

Smiley has found the right month. He flicks through the
dated pages - 18th November, 19th November...

He holds up the book - the next page has been cut out.

          November 20th is missing. (Beat)
          Someone is covering their tracks
          Peter. Unless you think that's
          just a coincidence?

Guillam looks thrown.

                    PETER GUILLAM
          What about the money?

                    SMILEY
          Thirty thousand isn't so much for
          Karla to pay if it protects his
          Mole. I'm afraid someone in the
          Circus knows all about Mister
          Tarr and is doing everything they
          can to discredit him.

Guillam takes the log book from Smiley, runs a thumb down
the razored edge of the missing page. He notices some
writing on the next page.

      Smiley and Guillam pull up in front of the hotel. They sit,
      in weary silence, staring up at the unprepossessing
      building.

                Why didn't you tell me? That you
                had Tarr?

      Smiley looks at him. Guillam reads the look correctly.

      The two men are finishing off a bottle of Scotch.
      Unusually, Smiley is drunk - a result of the alcohol and
      the lack of sleep.

      Guillam lies on one of the single beds, staring at the
      PHOTOGRAPHS of the four suspects Smiley has pinned on his
      chessmen.

                a sham. Karla won years ago and

      Smiley watches Guillam, estimating how badly all of this is
      affecting him.

          In fifty-five. Moscow Centre was
          in pieces. Purge after purge.
          Half their Agents were jumping
          ship and I travelled around
          signing them up. Hundreds of
          them.

Guillam raises himself up on an elbow, listening.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
          One of them was calling himself
          Gerstmann. He was on his way back
          to Russia, and we were pretty
          sure he was going to be executed.
          Plane had a twenty-four lay over
          at Delhi, and that's how long I
          had to convince him to come over
          to us instead of going home to
          die.

Smiley stares at the room around, projecting his memory of
the Delhi cell onto their present surroundings.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
          Little room...I'm sitting
          here...he's sitting there...

He points to an EMPTY CHAIR in front of him.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
          The Americans have had him
          tortured.

He holds up his right hand.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
          No fingernails. It's incredibly
          hot. I'm very tired and all I
          want to do is get this over with
          and get back home. Things weren't
          going well with Ann.

Guillam flinches a little, but Smiley doesn't notice, lost
now in the past.

                     SMILEY (CONT'D)
          I give him the usual pitch...
          Come to the West and we can give
          you a comfortable life. After
          questioning. Or you can catch
          your plane and fly home and be
          shot, like Bykov, Shur,
          Muranov...

He stares at the CHAIR as if expecting an answer, and
slightly drunkenly Guillam finds himself turning to the
CHAIR for a response.
                                                             73.

          What did he say?

Smiley doesn't answer - STARES AT THE CHAIR - the silence
stretching - it's all becoming a little surreal.

                    SMILEY
              (To the chair)
          Think of your wife. You have a
          wife, don't you? I brought you
          some cigarettes, by the way.

He mimes placing cigarettes on an invisible table, between
him and the chair.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
          Use my lighter.

He mimes placing the lighter beside the cigarettes.

          "We could arrange for her to join
          you, we have a lot of stock to

          ostracised. Think of her. Think

He breaks off in sudden impatience with himself.

          of course, but for some reason...
          it seemed important to save this
          one. (Beat) So I go on. "Know
          you're a chain-smoker, help

He makes a vague "Etcetera" gesture, stares at...

acquiring the GHOSTLY PRESENCE OF KARLA.

                          SMILEY (CONT'D)
                Never said a word. Not one word.
                Next morning he got back on his
                plane, gave the pack of
                cigarettes back to me, untouched -
                this was a chain-smoker, mind -
                and flew off to what he presumed
                would be his death. He kept my
                lighter. It was a gift - "To
                George, from Ann. All my love."

      Guillam is still staring at the chair, a little awe-struck.

                          PETER GUILLAM
                That was Karla? And he flew back
                to die rather than give in?

                          SMILEY
                Yes. (Beat) And that's how I know
                he can be beaten. Because he's a
                fanatic. And the fanatic is
                always concealing a secret doubt.

                That's the thing. (Beat) I can't
                remember.

      He stands up, crosses to the window, embarrassed by what he
      has to say next.

                          SMILEY (CONT'D)
                After today, Peter you have to

      KASPAR has Guillam pinned against the wall and is punching
      him. Guillam accepts the blows with a bloody grin. Something
      of the school yard fight about it, as the other Scalphunters
      gather around, ostensibly to break it, up but clearly
      enjoying the distraction. One of them is trying to pull
      Kaspar off and, caught by a blow, joins in - the fight
      escalating as others join in the struggle.

                yelling about Hungarian tank
                movements on the border, Lacon
                and the Minister baying at the
                door. Thank Christ Bill Haydon
                turned up when he did.

      PUSHING BILL HAYDON as he walks up the corridor towards the
      duty room, cutting a swathe through the people gathered
      outside.

                Get out.

      The room clears.

      Bill sits down. He pulls out all the phone lines, decisive,
      taking charge. Kicks the door shut.

                           BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)

      LATER:

      Haydon is on the phones.

                          BILL HAYDON
                You go and tell your Masters what
                will happen if one hair on Jim
                Prideaux's head is damaged...

      He covers the receiver, turns to Westerby.

                          BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)
                Get Esterhase on the phone. Tell
                him to pull in the Hungarian
                agents, anyone we're onto. Tell him
                to get down to the London School of
                Economics, sandbag some bloody
                students and put them on ice at
                Sarratt.

      LATER:

      Westerby watches Haydon on the phone from the door. Haydon
      listens to a voice for a moment, then hangs up. He stands,
      his back to Westerby.

                          JERRY WESTERBY
                Any more news on him?

      Haydon doesn't turn around, head bowed.

                Bill? (Beat) Oh God, is he...?

      For a moment it looks like Haydon won't answer but then he
      seems to master his emotions.

                          BILL HAYDON
                We need to go to his flat. Clear

      Haydon walks around the neat rooms. A bike up on the wall,
      a pair of muddy climbing boots on a newspaper, waiting to
      be cleaned. Haydon walks past a shelf - photographs and
      books. He stops, picks up an unframed black and white snap
      from the shelf. It's a picture of HIMSELF.
                                                                        81.



      Haydon stands with his back to us, possibly crying. Westerby
      turns thoughtfully away.

      Smiley and Guillam sit eating side by side at a bar, Smiley
      examining the hamburger - his first - doubtfully. Guillam
      is thinking about what he's just been told.

      awkward silence.

       The phone on the nightstand starts to ring. A woman's hand
       reaches into frame and picks it up.

       A black Cab pulls up at the lights. Another black cab pulls
       alongside it. The two drivers acknowledge each other,
       chatting as the lights change to RED, but in no hurry to
       move.

       An impatient woman passenger flicks a look at the passenger
       in the opposite cab, wanting to share this moment of
       passenger outrage.

       We see ALLELINE'S profile staring stonily ahead.

       We follow his cab as it peels off into a FAMILIAR street,
       driving towards the house where we met Polyakov.

       Smiley slips into the water. It's late afternoon. Very
       still and calm. Very few swimmers. Smiley's head breaks the
       surface, dips in, breaks the surface...


170    EXT. HAMPSTEAD PONDS - DAY                                  170

       Smiley sits on a platform with his back to us, drying off
       from his swim, looking out over the water. A MAN'S HEAD
       appears, swimming up to the platform through the reeds. An
       old QUEEN, his face almost purple with the cold. He clings
       to the edge of the platform for a moment.

                           OLD MAN
                 Just in case it's of interest,
                 dear. We are observed. Old Filth
                 in the bushes. Not very subtle
                 but there you are...

      He swims away. The wind lifts up a little, rustling the
      trees and bushes around the pond. We stay on Smiley,
      watched and alone.

      Smiley walks into his hallway, picks up the MAIL piled on
      the floor. He crosses to the drawing room, still looking at
      the mail.

      The door is a little ajar and through the opening we catch
      a FLASH of movement in the room beyond - a COUPLE in a
      passionate embrace, glimpsed for a moment before they
      disappear out of sight. We can hear what may be their love-
      making. And a RECORD IS PLAYING. The same CHARLIE RICH
      track Smiley reacted to in the Islay Hotel.

      Smiley stares at the mail in his hand as if unwilling to
      look up.

      He pushes open the door and moves into...

      some letters.

      A FIGURE walks past Smiley abruptly. Smiley doesn't look
      up.

                          BILL HAYDON (O.S.)
                Good flight?

      Smiley looks up.

      BILL HAYDON sits in the armchair opposite in shirt and
      trousers, SOCKS, NO SHOES. He sips a cup of tea. No sense
      of having been caught in an act of adultery.

                  call in. Ann was in bed but she
                  insisted on getting up. She said
                  she'll be down in a minute.

       Smiley glances at a half-wrapped oil painting lying against
       a chair.

       WHISPERED CONFERENCE in the hall between Haydon and Ann.

      There is a FAINT SOUND - SOMEONE ON THE STEPS OUTSIDE.

      hiding place, still trailing tape, and rolls to face the

Prideaux's face doesn't change, but he's wondering if the
rumours could be true and Control really has gone mad.

      Prideaux sits with his visitor - Smiley -      recalling the
      meeting. He's drinking vodka.

                          SMILEY

      Smiley nods. Just a flicker of the eyes shows us that this
      is painful for him to hear.

                          SMILEY
                What did you make of it, Jim?

      Smiley is watching him intently - sure he's hiding
      something.

                          SMILEY
                But still you went? Risking your
                life for a mission you thought
                was absurd? Why?

      Prideaux doesn't answer.

                          SMILEY (CONT'D)
                Perhaps some part of you wanted to
                know if Control was right? Wanted
                to know if there was a Mole, who it
                might be?

      Prideaux shoots him a dangerous look.

183   INT. BUDAPEST - TRAIN STATION - DAY - PAST                  183

      Prideaux climbs off his train and walks down the platform
      towards us. He pauses for a moment, drawing a Hungarian
      newspaper from his pocket. As he does so he glances at the
      other passengers walking past him. TWO WOMEN and a MAN, all
      apparently travelling alone, the SHOES they're wearing -
      BROWN SUEDE BOOTS, FUR LINED BLACK PLASTIC BOOTS and the
      man - a pair of BLACK GALOSHES.

      Prideaux walks on, tapping the paper against his leg.

      The scene from the opening of the film. The Waiter puts
      down Prideaux's plate, a drop of sweat from his forehead
      hitting the table. He looks at the droplet, fakes a smile
      for the Magyar, looks after the Waiter, scans the floor
      around him...

      HIS P.O.V. - There it is - one of the women is wearing the
      BLACK PLASTIC BOOTS. Her coat is different and she's
      wearing a fur hat now - but the shoes are the one thing the
      surveillance agents don't have time to change.

      Prideaux glances up at the apartment windows above, sees
      the old woman, starts to rise... as we CUT TO:

      The SHOT -

      ... punching into his back, Prideaux falling forward... as
      we CUT TO:


      PRIDEAUX'S P.O.V.

      Those shoes again, stepping in the water and blood on the
      floor, passing us at eye-level. Grouping and regrouping as
      the operation comes to an end. The noise in the background
      comes to us muted and very faint. Faintly, a baby is
      crying, an ambulance siren is wailing.

      Hands appear and we are rolled onto a stretcher and lifted
      up to chest level where we seem to FLOAT past the faces of
      the MAGYAR and the other Officers, smoking cigarettes by
      the doors, and out towards the open doors of a waiting
      ambulance.
                                                                        89.

      We are looking at the back of Prideaux's head, hair damp
      with sweat, shoulders trembling.

      We PULL OUT and find Prideaux, a filthy dressing covering
      the wound on his back. The cell he is in has filthy,
      heavily padded walls, like a straitjacket. From a speaker
      in the ceiling comes a maddening jagged drone. Lights blaze
      down...

      brightly lit corridor towards an INTERROGATION ROOM at the
      far end.

      He is taken inside, the door closed behind him.

      Smiley stands staring at the OWL Prideaux killed, which is
      now stuffed, keeping guard from the top of a bookshelf.
      Prideaux sits at a desk drinking the vodka.

                          PRIDEAUX

                they?

      Smiley seems to have been thinking about something else,
      looks at him, puzzled.

                No. They were blown. The story is

Prideaux nods, makes an odd gesture as if he's about to
rise, but doesn't move. His expression hasn't changed, but
inside him something has just been decided.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
          What was your last line of
          defence?

          they'd never get it out of me.

          Why?

                    PRIDEAUX
          Because they already knew. They
          wanted to know how far Control
          had got in his investigation.

          What else?

          Circus gossip. Was Percy's wife
          still drinking, who was Bland

          of thing.

          He had a cigarette lighter. Kept
          flashing it round for me to see.
          Showed me the inscription.
          "To George, from Ann. All my
          love." He reckoned after Bill's

      A concrete bunker of a room. Prideaux is standing in a slab
      of watery sunshine that falls from a sky-light above. He's
      smoking, trying to control the tremble in his hand.

      PRIDEAUX P.O.V. - The patch of sunshine only extends a few
      yards in front of him. The rest of the room is in granite
      shadow. The sense of other people watching from the
      shadows. The sound of a door opening and someone being led
      in.

      A woman walks across the dark room and into the slab of
      light, blinking as she does so.

      It's IRINA.

      Her hair is loose and dishevelled about her face. A man's
      voice comes from further back in the darkness...

                Perfectly, Minister. (Beat) There
                is a house, somewhere in this
                city, where Alleline and the
                others meet Witchcraft's London
                representative. I need the
                address of that house.

                          MINISTER
                I don't know what you're talking
                about.

      Smiley stares at him.

                          MINISTER (CONT'D (CONT'D)
                I don't know the address. And I
                fail to see the... I thought
                Lacon had made it clear to you,
                keep your nose bloody-well out of
                Witchcraft's business!

                          SMILEY
                    (Calmly)
                It's Lacon's advice I'm
                following. (To Lacon) You told me
                to follow in Control's footsteps.
                                                            95.



                    MINISTER
              (Snapping)
          Well, I wouldn't consider that
          sound advice, after the bloody
          mess Control left us with. It's
          taken Alleline - and, if I may
          say so, myself - this long to get
          us back into the race.

                    SMILEY
          I'm glad you take some of the
          credit.

Lacon glances sharply at Smiley - there's something
different about him, his tone...

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
          The man Alleline and the others
          meet is called Polyakov. You
          believe his role is to bring
          information from Witchcraft to
          you. His real role is to receive
          information from the Mole to take
          back to Karla.

He has the Minister's full attention now. A long silence.

                    MINISTER
          That's... that's not possible.

                    SMILEY
          Made possible. By you. When he
          steals our secrets he does it
          under the very nose of the
          Circus, in the house which you
          persuaded the treasury to pay
          for. I'm sure you'll be able to
          take full credit for that.

                    MINISTER
              (Appalled)
          Witchcraft's intelligence is
          genuine! It's been gold!

                    SMILEY
          Just enough glitter, amongst the
          chicken-feed. Control didn't
          believe in miracles and he didn't
          believe in Witchcraft. But you
          were lazy and you were greedy and
          so you hounded him out of the
          Circus and you let Karla in.

His voice is still calm, but it's clear what's different
now. There's a quiet fury in him. The Minister is ashen.
                                                                  96.



                          MINISTER
                Oh God... We can't be made to
                look like fucking fools again!
                Forget Europe, if we have the
                black men getting to hear about
                this on Walla-Wallah News! What
                if we find the Mole and we move
                him sideways, some department
                where he can't do any harm? Is
                the Kremlin likely to boast about
                this?

                          LACON
                Not in their interests sir. They
                need the Enemy to look like a
                threat...

                          MINISTER
                Well, tell them to play the game.
                We don't go crowing about their
                fuck-ups!

      In their panic, both men are addressing each other,
      momentarily forgetting Smiley.

                          SMILEY
                    (Suddenly)
                We are not the prize. We're the
                bait.

      They turn to him.

                          SMILEY (CONT'D)
                You've opened negotiations to
                exchange intelligence with the
                Americans. What they tell the
                Circus, they'll be telling the
                Kremlin. Witchcraft's
                information, the "gold" Karla let
                you have? It wasn't to lure you.
                It was to lure the Americans.
                Now, do you want to take credit
                for that?

      Lacon and the Minister stare at Smiley.

                          MINISTER
                What can we do?

                Don't wanna end up like you
                lot...

      He looks at Smiley, then he gives Guillam a knowing look,
      as though deliberately provoking him.

      Guillam absorbs the slur but his eyes are hard.

      Nobody speaks. Esterhase sits stiff, mind-whirring,
      uncomfortably aware of Fawn's unsettling presence behind
      him.

                I want to talk about loyalty
                Toby. Control recruited you when
                you were trying to escape from
                Hungary didn't he? A wanted man.
                Saved you from a KGB bullet,
                didn't he? And yet, when the time
                came, when it came to picking
                sides between him and Alleline,
                you didn't hesitate?
                Understandable perhaps, with your
                war experience. You've survived
                this long, I suppose, because of
                your ability to change sides,
                serve any Master?

      Faintly we hear the low drone of an approaching engine.
      Esterhase scans the horizon, locks on the black speck in the
      sky - an aircraft flying towards them. Esterhase watches the

      Smiley watches him cry for a moment, his face impassive.

      MRS McCRAIG - not at all happy with the invasion.

      A squat Yorkshireman - MACKELVORE - walks out of a nearby

      Out of nowhere Tarr suddenly appears, climbing into the
      passenger side, ramming a gun into his side.

      from his evening meal as the two pass.

      Mackelvore frowns. They reach a door which he opens to
      reveal a STEEL DOOR beyond. He presses a bell and a hatch
      in the door slides open and a young man's face appears.

      Some of the dummies are draped in clothes, some just shapes
      in the darkness. As though we are moving through A ROOM
      FULL OF SPIES.

      By a great domed window, occasionally washed with yellow
      from the traffic outside, we find MENDEL, his back to us
      staring out.

                   coercion.

      Haydon waves it away. Smiley hands him a clean handkerchief.
                                                           110.



                    BILL HAYDON
          It's almost funny George. I know
          the Inquisitors little bag of
          tricks. I taught most of them.
          Don't mind the tears. Just a
          reaction. An over-reaction, if you
          like. Craddox says I'll be off in a
          few days. I keep thinking how I'm
          going to miss the cricket in
          Moscow.

He weeps again.

                    BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)
          I rather hoped you would do a
          little light house-keeping for me.

                       SMILEY
          If I can.

                    BILL HAYDON
          There's a girl...Would you give her
          some money for me? Give her a good
          cover story. If it helps tell her I
          love her. It's all here.

                       SMILEY
          Of course.

                    BILL HAYDON
          There's a boy too. Bung him a few
          quid to shut him up. Take it out of
          the reptile fund.

                    SMILEY
          I did have one or two questions.
          About Prideaux.

                    BILL HAYDON
          Damn it! I got him back, didn't
          I?

                    SMILEY
          Yes, yes you did. That was good
          of you. (Beat) I'm surprised
          Karla didn't shoot him. Or do you
          think he held back out of
          delicacy towards you?

No response. Smiley looks carefully at Haydon's profile.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
          Did Prideaux come and see you
          before he left on his Hungarian
          mission?

                    BILL HAYDON
          Yes, as a matter of fact he did.
                                                               111.



                    SMILEY
          To say what?

Haydon stares at him. For the first time the tears seem
real. Guilt and grief. He looks down. A long pause.

                    SMILEY (CONT'D)
              (almost to himself)
          To warn you. Because he knew,
          deep down, it was you all along.

                    BILL HAYDON
          So did you.

Haydon stares out, lost in thought.

                    BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)
          I had to pick a side George. It was
          an aesthetic choice as much as a
          moral one. The West has grown so
          very ugly, don't you think?

Smiley doesn't answer. A moment of silence.

                    SMILEY
          Did Karla ever consider having you
          take over the Circus?

For a moment Haydon looks rattled.

                    BILL HAYDON
          I'm not his bloody office boy.

                    SMILEY
          What are you then?

Haydon turns to Smiley, a flash of hauteur.

                    BILL HAYDON
          I'm someone who made his mark.

Smiley watches him, feeling him shrink in stature before his
eyes. Haydon lights a cigarette.

                    SMILEY
              (Quietly)
          Is there anything you want me to
          pass on to Ann?

For a moment Haydon looks genuinely puzzled.

                    BILL HAYDON
          Oh, that was nothing personal,
          George, I hope you understand that?
          Karla said you were good, the one
          we had to worry about. But you do
          have a blind spot.

                          BILL HAYDON (CONT'D)
                He reckoned if I was known to be
                Ann's lover you wouldn't be able
                to see me straight. And he was
                right, up to a point.

                          SMILEY
                Up to a point.


246   INT. CONTROL'S FLAT - DAY                                   246

      The flat is now empty, cleared of Control's possessions.
      Smiley looks around, places a CHESS PIECE on the piano. We
      see the piece bears the name HAYDON.

                          SMILEY
                    (Quietly)

      He walks away.


247   EXT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   247

      George comes up his path, looking old and tired.


248   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   248

      He stops still inside his doorway. The little figure on the
      console table is in the wrong position. Smiley puts his
      hand on it, but doesn't right it, listening to something
      from somewhere inside the house. A faint movement.

      Through the HALF OPEN KITCHEN DOOR we catch a glimpse of a
      WOMAN beyond. ANN is back.

      Smiley stands with his back to us, still in his coat,
      staring through the door at his wife beyond. Something of a
      Vermeer in the image.

      He's absorbing the different atmosphere - home. Deciding
      whether to go in. Or not.

      Suddenly we hear MUSIC - JULIO IGLESIAS, singing a disco
      version of LA MER - very seventies.

      CUT TO:


249   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR PARTY - NIGHT - PAST              249

      The same lively Christmas PARTY at the Circus we saw
      earlier. BILL HAYDON, a little drunk and happy, works his
      way through the packed room, dancing to the Iglesias'
      track, a drink in each hand, a little tongue-in-cheek,
      singing along.
                                                                      113.

      ... other members of the Circus glimpsed as we pass them -
      CONNIE SACHS, WESTERBY, BLAND, drunk, grinning at us. TOBY
      ESTERHASE talking to one of the SECRETARIES...

      The MUSIC continues as we find...

      CONTROL and SMILEY

      ...sitting a little apart, talking. Haydon is still working
      his way through the party...

      We PASS PERCY ALLELINE and his DRUNK WIFE. Alleline looking
      fretful and hoping no-one is noticing the scene she is
      making...

      Haydon grins at all his comrades, feeling fond of everyone,
      but heads on to his destination...

      PRIDEAUX sits watching him come with a drink towards him,
      shakes his head, but can't help but smile fondly at the idiot
      Haydon is prepared to make of himself...

254   EXT. SARRATT - EVENING - PRESENT                         254

      The music continues as we see two cadets are running on the
      circuit, their white t-shirts only just visible in the
      dark.

      Haydon sits on his bench, smoking, watching them flit by.
      He smiles to himself, remembering. He senses something,
      turns and looks back. Prideaux stands in the shadows behind
      him, some fifteen foot away. The two men stare at each
      other, then Haydon turns back to watch the runners.

      We HOLD CLOSE on his face as Prideaux approaches, the only
      sound the soft wind and his hushed footsteps growing loser.

      Finally...

        A rifle is placed on the side of his head - the same
        execution shot that we saw used on Irina - the force
        blowing him sideways out of the frame.

        As the music continues we...

        Frost on the grass. We find a CADET staring down at the
        corpse of Haydon leaning against the back of the bench,
        outlined in silver frost.

        Prideaux sits on his bed. From outside - the sound of a
        football game. Someone taps on the door. Low. Taps again.
        Prideaux, coiled with grief and anger, suddenly gets up.


257     EXT. PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - DAY                               257

        Roach stands in the doorway, carrying a gift - a boot-
        scrape made in woodwork.

                            ROACH
                  I made you something.

        Prideaux stares at the boot scrape.

                            PRIDEAUX
                  I don't want you hanging around
                  here. Keep away from me from now
                  on. Go and join the others.

        He watches Roach walk to the edge of the field and stand
        mutely at the side. A ball rolls towards him. Roach goes to
        kick it. Misses. He tries again, RUNNING OUT OF SHOT.

        Tarr is walking through a busy street. He stops to light a
        cigarette. A woman in a YELLOW dress appears, reflected in
        the glass. She's holding the hands of two children. For a
        moment it looks like Irina.
                                                                         115.

       George takes his place at the baronial chair. He examines
       the CHESS PIECE in his hand. We see it is labelled KARLA.
       He toys with it for a moment, then places it on the table
       in front of him, clears his throat.
