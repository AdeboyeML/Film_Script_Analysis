                                                       FADE IN:


1   EXT. ALBUQUERQUE - DAY                                            1

    ROSE LORKOWSKI, 30, drives through Albuquerque. She passes
    small adobe houses, the Air force base, parched earth
    playgrounds, University cafes and other distinctive sights.

    On the   highway she passes under the freeway interchange, a
    tangle   of rust and turquoise ramps. The Sandia mountains rise
    in the   distance as Rose heads up to the nicer neighborhoods
    of the   foothills.


2   EXT. SEVEN FIGURE HOUSE - DAY                                     2

    Rose pulls up to an expensive looking Spanish style house and
    parks. She gets out of the car, pops the hatch and pulls out
    a vacuum cleaner and assorted cleaning supplies.


3   INT. SEVEN FIGURE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                       3

    Rose drags a vacuum cleaner into a room where expensive decor
    collides with the debris of a recent party.

    She collects beer bottles from end tables, book shelves and
    house plants. Cigarette butts float in cocktail glasses.

    Rose plugs in the vacuum cord and glances out the sliding
    glass doors. A group of twenty somethings frolic in the pool.

    A lanky trust funder slides open the door and drips water
    onto the carpet as he makes his way to retrieve a cold beer.

    He brushes past Rose on his way back out. Rose turns on the
    vacuum and wonders if he even saw her.


4   INT. FAIR N SQUARE MARKET - DAY                                   4

    The space is packed with every kind of snack imaginable. JOE
    LORKOWSKI, 53, talks as the OWNER stocks shelves.

                          OWNER
                I've got the five stores here and
                then two in Rio Rancho.

                           JOE
                 That's fantastic. See, if we're
                 talking that kind of volume I can
                 absolutely massage the numbers a
                 little. Seriously, you're not gonna
                 be able to keep it on the shelf.

    Joe pulls out some order forms.

                           OWNER
                 Yeah, I'd need to look at some
                 things before I can place an order.

    The owner looks at Joe's business card.

                           OWNER
                 How about I give you a call if I
                 decide to--

                           JOE
                 I'll call you. Not a problem. No
                 problem at all. Even better, I'll
                 swing by. You're on my route. How
                 `bout that? I'll swing by tomorrow.

                           OWNER
                 Yeah, tomorrow's not good.

                           JOE
                 Thursday then. That's better
                 anyway. That'll give you a chance
                 to take a look see on those other
                 stores. We'll put everything on one
                 order and get you a good price
                 break.

    The owner seems to consider the offer. Joe scans the shelves.

                           JOE
                 My advice to you - weed out some of
                 this weaker product to make more
                 space for the corn. Like this...

    Joe reaches over and grabs a packet of organic fruit bar.

                           JOE
                 Apricot Fruit Leather. Whose bright
                 idea was it to stock that? I mean
                 come on, what self respecting kid
                 asks his mom for apricot fruit
                 leather?

    The owner is not amused.


5   EXT. FAIR N SQUARE MARKET - DAY                                 5

    Joe pulls a hand cart stacked high with Fancy Corn canisters
    to his rusted Monte Carlo.


6   EXT. LUCKY BOY RESTAURANT - DAY                                 6

    Through the glass pane we see disgruntled waitress, NORAH
    LORKOWSKI (25). She appears to be in a heated argument with
    MR. KIM, the restaurant owner. A customer watches the
    exchange with amusement.

    Norah takes off her apron, throws it at Mr. Kim. Norah exits
    the restaurant. Mr. Kim trails her. Then MRS. KIM notices and
    joins the fray.

                        MR. KIM
              You are fired.

                        NORAH
              I so don't care.

    Norah flips him off and walk down the street. As she
    continues to walk she realizes that quitting her job might
    not have been the best decision ever.

                        NORAH
              Fuck.

7    INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BATHROOM - DAY                          7

     A banana floats in the toilet. OSCAR LORKOWSKI, 7, smiles and
     kicks the flush lever. Whoosh... the banana is sucked down
     the drain. Gone.

     Well, not quite. Oscar watches water fill the basin and spill
     onto the floor. Oscar turns and walks out.


8    INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                           8

     Oscar steps from the bathroom and walks quickly down the
     empty hall.


9    INT. BUSINESSMAN'S CAR -   SPORTING GOODS STORE LOT - DAY        9

     A BUSINESSMAN removes a single shotgun shell from the glove
     compartment. He drops it in his shirt pocket, sprays breath
     freshener in his mouth and gets out of his car.


10   INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE - DAY                                  10

     The businessman approaches the gun display and points to a
     shotgun. An employee hands him the gun and turns his
     attention to another customer.

     The businessman reaches into his pocket and pulls out the
     shotgun shell. Loads it. Draws the barrel up under his chin.

     A Bubba pricing camouflaged vests nearby notices the
     businessman. His expression shifts from concern to alarm to
     horrible anticipation. He braces for the...

                                                        CUT TO:


11   INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE - LATER                                11

     Police mill about and question people. CARL SWANSON, a 40ish
     man sporting a crew cut and a `Above and Beyond' polo shirt,
     talks to the STORE OWNER.

                         CARL
               Yep, these shotgun cases are a real
               pain in the ass. What we call a
               wide field of contamination.

                            CARL (cont'd)
                  Guy's all over the place and every
                  little glob of him's a biohazard.

     The owner rubs his temples.

                            CARL
                  Gonna lose some inventory.

                            OWNER
                  Selfish bastard.

                            CARL
                  Trust me, you do not want some lady
                  suing you cuz she found this guy's
                  tooth in her brand new fanny pack.

     A ABOVE AND BEYOND WORKER in a polo shirt waves his arm to
     get Carl's attention.

                            CLEAN SWEEP WORKER
                  He's over here in fishing too.

                            CARL
                  Yep, a real pain in the ass.

     Carl walks over to his assistant. Detective, `MAC' MACDOWELL,
     approaches the owner.

                            MAC
                  We're wrapping it up.

                            OWNER
                  Three grand just to have the
                  asshole wiped up off the floor. Can
                  you believe that?

     Mac and another DETECTIVE walk toward the entrance.

                            MAC
                  Hey, can you handle the report
                  tonight? I gotta thing I gotta do.

                            DETECTIVE
                  A blonde thing or a brunette thing?


12   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT                              12

     Rose steps from the shower. She is attractive with sharp
     features and eyes that hint at future crow's feet. Her
     confidence has grown brittle by the gnawing fear that life
     peaked as the captain of the high school cheerleading squad.

     A note taped to the bathroom mirror reads: `You are strong.
     You are powerful. You can do anything. You are a winner.'

     Rose wipes condensation from the mirror to reveal her face.

                            ROSE
                  I am strong. I am powerful. I can
                  do anything. I am a winner.

     She doesn't look like she believes it.


13   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - NORAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                       13

     Norah lounges on her bed and loads weed onto a jerry-rigged
     pop-can-pipe.

                            NORAH
                  The fact that we have sex, real
                  coitus sex, means I'm under no
                  obligation to blow you.

     Norah fires up the bud, inhales deeply and passes the can to
     RANDY, a good-looking redneck in his early 20's.

                            RANDY
                  I think you're scared of it.

     The phone RINGS.

     Norah opens a book about sign language and starts practicing
     the sign alphabet. A-B-C-D-E-F. F is a hard one.

                            NORAH
                      (Holding in the smoke)
                  I'm not scared of it.

                            RANDY
                  Uncomfortable then. You just need
                  to get better acquainted.

     Norah exhales. Randy stands and takes off his pants. The
     phone RINGS again.

                            NORAH
                      (yelling)
                  Dad, get the phone.

                            RANDY
                  There's absolutely no pressure
                  here.

     Randy lies next to Norah naked from the waist down. Norah
     ignores him and continues forming letters with her fingers.
     She jots a note and sticks the pencil behind her ear.

     The phone RINGS again. Norah reaches across Randy and picks
     up the receiver.

                            RANDY
                  You can touch it if you want.

                            NORAH
                      (into phone)
                  Hello.

                            ROSE (O.S.)
                      (through receiver)
                  You haven't left yet? Damn it
                  Norah, my class starts in fifteen
                  minutes.

                            NORAH
                      (into phone)
                  I know, I know.

     As Norah holds the phone her eyes slide from Randy's face to
     his off screen penis. She takes the pencil from behind her
     ear and, in the way you'd poke a hamster to see if it is dead
     or merely sleeping, prods Randy's off screen penis.

15   EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                       15

     Randy pulls up to a small house and stops. Norah gets out,
     collects the canister from back and heads inside.


16   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                       16

     Norah enters the tidy two bedroom house with a barrel of
     Fancy Corn under her arm.

                          NORAH
               Sorry.

                         ROSE
               I'm gonna be so late.

     Oscar runs from the bedroom and flings himself onto Norah.
     Pale and skinny, Oscar is the kind of kid easily picked off
     in slaughter-ball.

                         NORAH
               I brought fancy corn!

                         ROSE
                   (Looking for her purse)
               How can you eat that stuff?

     Norah and Oscar both jam a handful into their mouths.

                         ROSE
               He'll be hyper all night.

     Rose finds her purse and quickly puts on lipstick. She leans
     down and gives Oscar a kiss on the forehead.

                          ROSE
               Be good.

     She turns to Norah.

                            ROSE
                  And no lobsterman stories. He had
                  nightmares all week.
                      (opening the door)
                  Just use some common sense.

                            NORAH
                  You're welcome.

     Rose lies on her back being fucked. Her head nearly hits the
     headboard with each thrust.

                            ROSE
                  You want me?

     Rose closes her eyes. Her head starts to thump the headboard.

                              MAC
                      (Rhythmically)
                  Yeah... baby... I want... Oh...

     Mac comes.


18   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - OSCAR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              18

     Oscar and Norah lie in Oscar's little bed. Oscar holds the
     covers tight under his chin. Norah drinks a beer. There's a
     half eaten canister of `Fancy Corn' between them.

                            NORAH
                  He's slowly freezing to death and
                  he knows lobsterman is out there...
                  somewhere... coming for him. And
                  he's totally screwed because his
                  tongue is stuck to the mailbox.

                            OSCAR
                  Why did he lick the mailbox?

                             NORAH
                  I don't know. Maybe he had OCD and
                  he was obsessed with licking
                  mailboxes.

                            OSCAR
                  Why wasn't he in school?


                                                                (CONTINUED)

                  Are you gonna let me tell the
                  story?

     Oscar nods.

                            NORAH
                  An then, he hears a horrible sound.
                  Snap, snap, drag. Snap, snap, drag.
                  Lobsterman is coming.

                            OSCAR
                  Maybe he didn't go to school
                  because he had the ACD.

     Norah looks at Oscar.

                            OSCAR
                  Sorry.

     Norah downs the last swig of beer and sets the bottle down
     next to another empty.

                            NORAH
                  He's trapped. If he doesn't rip the
                  skin off his tongue and make a run
                  for it lobsterman will tear him to
                  pieces with his razor sharp claws.


19   INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                           19

     Curtains drawn in the cheap hotel room. Rose gets out of bed
     and pulls on her clothes. Mac watches for a moment, then
     rolls out of bed. He stops. Grimaces.

                            ROSE
                  Still sore?

     Mac shakes his head and pretends not to be.

                            ROSE
                  I don't know why you did that.

                            MAC
                  You should hear the way he goes on
                  about his lean body mass index
                  bullshit. Drinking that
                  antioxidant, protein powder, enzyme
                  crap all the time.

     Mac limps over to his clothes hanging over a chair.

                  When was the last time you even
                  played basketball?

                            MAC
                  He needed to be brought down a peg
                  or two.

                            ROSE
                  I'm sure you pulling a groin muscle
                  humbled him.

     Rose smiles and Mac pretends to be offended.

                            MAC
                  I should introduce him to your
                  sister.

                            ROSE
                  Norah and a cop? That would happen.

     Mac shrugs and steps into his slacks.

                            MAC
                  We were working a scene today where
                  this guy offs himself in a sporting
                  goods store. So they had this
                  cleaning crew out there, right?
                  You would not believe how much
                  money they charge for that shit.
                  It's ridiculous.

                            ROSE
                  With the dead body there?

                            MAC
                  Naw, the body's gone, it's just the
                  blood and stuff.

                            ROSE
                  Sounds horrible.

     Rose peels the backing off a nicotine patch and carefully
     sticks it on her arm.

                            MAC
                  You ask me it's a racket. You
                  should get into that.

     Rose slips on her blouse looks at Mac.

20   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                          20

     Norah holds a lit joint out the window and watches a cheesy
     TV movie circa 1982. Big hair and leg warmers. Norah leans
     out the window and exhales, takes another toke.

     The sound of a key at the door prompts Norah to quickly stub
     out the joint and close the window. Rose opens the door.

                         NORAH
               It's about time. I thought your
               class got over at 9:30.

     Rose looks at Oscar sprawled out asleep on the couch.

                         ROSE
               Why isn't he in bed?

                         NORAH
               Said he was scared. I think he was
               fakin' it though.

     Rose fumbles in her purse and pulls out a ten-dollar bill.

                         NORAH
               I'm not taking money.

                         ROSE
               It's just ten bucks, take it. Dad
               told me about you getting fired.

                            ROSE
                  What, were you stoned or something?

     Norah waves her hand dismissively.

                            NORAH
                  It was just Mr. Kim being a dick

                  I thought you liked Mr. Kim.

                  Yeah, before Mrs. Kim started
                  working there. Now he's a full on

     cleaner in tow.

                         ROSE
               We're all finished. Since it's our
               first visit we did the blinds and
               appliances but normally we'll
               alternate those weekly. Nobody
               mentioned anything to us about
               laundry so we didn't bother with
               that but if you want laundry
               included there is an extra...

                         PAULA
               Rose? Rose Lorkowski?

     Startled, Rose looks the woman in the eye for the first time.

               It's Paula Datzman... cheerleading

                            PAULA
                  Wow. Well it's so good to see you.
                  Let me get your info so I can send
                  you an invite to the baby shower.

     Paula gets a piece of paper and a pen and hands it to Rose.

                            PAULA
                  It'll be like a big reunion. The
                  whole gang from high school will be
                  there.

     Rose writes her number and address on the scrap of paper.

                            PAULA
                  So what are you doing now?

     Woops. Paula immediately regrets the question.

                              ROSE
                  I... I've just gotten my real estate
                  license, and so...

               Real estate?

                         ROSE
               Yeah, this... this is just kind of a
               temporary thing and I'm about to
               just really phase over into the
               real estate full time.

                         PAULA
               You're kidding, I'm in real estate!

     Paula pulls a business card from her purse and hands it to
     Rose. The card has a picture of Paula's smiling face.

                         PAULA
               With Long and Foster. Who are you
               with?

                         ROSE
               Me? Um. You know, I haven't really
               decided yet. I might check out Long
               and Foster.

     Paula nods. Uncomfortable.

                         PAULA
               Maybe you'll just be independent.

                         ROSE
               Yeah. Maybe.

     They grasp for something to say. They fail.

23   EXT. DATZMAN-MEAD HOUSE - DAY                                         23

     Rose caries a vacuum cleaner and bucket of cleaning supplies
     out to a rusted Nissan Sentra with a Molly Maid door magnet.
     She throws the vacuum and bucket in the back hatch, starts to
     close it, then stops.

     Rose walks to the side of the car, peels off the Molly Maid
     magnet and throws that in as well. She looks at the Datzman-
     Mead house with a mixture of resentment and shame.

     She gets into the car and cries. Her cell phone rings. She
     digs the phone out of her bag and tries to steady her voice.

                  Hello.


24   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - OUTSIDE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY              24

     Oscar sits outside the counselor's office on a bench. He
     cranes his neck to watch the secretary typing forms.


25   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY                      25

     Rose sits nervously across from the school COUNSELOR, a
     serious man in his mid forties and a TEACHER with cotton
     candy hair. The man speaks first.

                            COUNSELOR
                  It's not just this incident. There
                  have been several episodes over the
                  past year where Oscar has... has
                  engaged in disruptive behavior.

     Rose shifts her eyes from the counselor to the teacher and
     back to the counselor.

                            COUNSELOR
                  There was the incident in gym
                  class.

                            ROSE
                  I did pay the damages for that.

                            COUNSELOR
                  And the chalk thing.

     Rose bites a fingernail.

                            COUNSELOR
                  And the time he locked Jeremy
                  Johnston in the--

                            ROSE
                  Okay. What did he do this time?

                              COUNSELOR
                  Now it's... licking.

     Rose looks confused.

                  I will not tolerate it. I will not
                  tolerate that behavior in my
                  classroom.

                            COUNSELOR
                  Oscar has started licking things in
                  the classroom.

     Rose looks even more confused.

                            TEACHER
                  First it was the pencil sharpener.
                  Then the aquarium.


26   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - OUTSIDE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY       26

     The secretary stops typing and offers a sympathetic glance to
     Oscar. He capitalizes on the moment by licking the wall.

                            COUNSELOR (O.S.)
                  It's unsanitary. And it's
                  disturbing to the other children.

     The secretary recoils and returns to her typing.


27   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY               27

     The counselor leans forward with genuine concern.

                            COUNSELOR
                  We think Oscar might benefit from
                  an environment where he could
                  receive more specialized attention.

                            TEACHER
                  He licked my leg.

28   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                              28

     Oscar finds Joe asleep on the Lazy Boy. He snores in that
     scary sleep apnea way ­ holding his breath between snores.

     Oscar notices a leather strap hanging down from the top shelf
     of a book case. He pulls up a chair to investigate.

     The strap leads to an old pair of binoculars. Behind it,
     dusty books about birds. Oscar grabs the binoculars and
     climbs down.

     Oscar holds the binoculars to his face but the lenses are too
     far apart. Oscar compensates by closing one eye and looking
     through only one lens. He focuses on his grandpa's nose hair.

     Joe wakes.

                            JOE
                  Where'd you get those?

                               OSCAR
                  Up there.

     Oscar points to the book shelf. Something sad stirs in Joe.

                               JOE
                  Come here.

     Oscar steps closer. Joe twists something on the binoculars
     and pushes the lenses closer together to accommodate Oscar's
     small face. Better.

                            JOE
                  Those were your grandma's. She'd
                  watch birds with those.

     Oscar walks around the room examining various objects and
     clunks them against a lamp in the process.

                            JOE
                  Hey, hey. Careful.

     Joe holds out his hand to retrieve the binoculars.

                            JOE
                  Why don't we put those away.

     Oscar doesn't want to. He hesitates. Joe raises an eyebrow.
     Oscar shuffles back to his grampa and hands them over.

                  Why can't I play with them?

                            JOE
                  Because it's not a toy. It's a
                  scientific instrument.

     Oscar's disappointed.

                            JOE
                  You can play with them when I'm
                  around to supervise.

                            OSCAR
                  You're around now.

                            JOE
                  I'm tired now.

     Joe studies the binoculars for a moment and then sets them
     back on the shelf.

     Rose shakes her head and hands Norah another dish.

                  Well I'm not putting him in special
                  ed. I'll figure out a way to put
                  him in private school before I do

                  bullet completely shot off his ring
                  finger. How long you gals been
                  doin' this kind a work?

                   (Checking out Rose)
               You know Mac pretty well?

     Norah shoots Rose a look. Rose doesn't answer. They arrive at
     the door of the apartment. The super unlocks the door.

                         SUPER
               Just swing by the office when
               you're done and we'll settle up.


33   INT. DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE APARTMENT - DAY                           33

     Rose and Norah step into the apartment littered with dirty
     dishes and clothes.

     Rose walks down the hall while Norah examines a plastic bird
     with top hat. It tips down and drinks from the glass.

                           ROSE (O.S.)
               Found it.


34   INT. DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY                34

     Norah and Rose stand frozen at the threshold. They are awe
     struck by the horrible scene in front of them.

     Blooms of splattered blood dry on tile walls. It gathers in
     sticky brown lines around grout. The mirror is broken. The
     shower curtain hangs half torn.

                         NORAH
               Think they loved each other?

                           ROSE
               Yeah.


35   INT. DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE APARTMENT - BATHROOM - LATER              35

     Hands pull on yellow cleaning gloves.

     Pinkish foam slides down Norah's glove as she scrubs bloody
     grout with a toothbrush.

     Metal shower rings CLINK against the metal bar as Rose pulls
     down the shower curtain.

     A rag is wrung out in a bucket of reddish water.

     Rose and Norah clean in silence. Reverent but detached. The
     way you would act at a stranger's funeral.


36   INT. DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY                   36

     Norah puts blood spattered towels into a washing machine.

     She spots a dish on the dryer filled with pennies and buttons
     and other odds and ends. She fishes out a PINK CANDY HEART.
     It reads, `Luv U 4 ever'.

     Norah pockets the candy.


37   INT. DOMESTIC DISTURBANCE APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY                  37

     Rose and Norah gather their cleaning supplies and stand back
     to admire their handiwork.


38   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                                         38

     Norah hangs back while the super hands Rose a check.

                            SUPER
                  You gals did a real nice job.

     As Rose turns to leave she flashes the check to Norah. Five
     hundred bucks. Rose raises an eyebrow. Cha-ching.


39   EXT. BAR - DAY                                                        39

     Joe walks though a low rent part of town carrying a barrel of
     Fancy Corn. He ducks into the neighborhood bar.


40   INT. BAR - DAY                                                        40

     Joe enters a dingy little corner bar where everyone's a
     regular. A couple of old guys slump over the bar. The
     BARTENDER smiles.

                            BARTENDER
                  Hey Joe, what you got for me?

                            JOE
                  World's finest corn snack.

     Joe hands the canister to the bartender and sits down on a
     stool. The bartender pours him a beer.

                  See where old Miller's house sold?

     Joe nods. A grizzled REGULAR nearby looks over at Joe.

                            REGULAR
                  Bet you could get a chunk of change
                  for your place. You should cash out
                  now before the market turns sour.

     Joe shakes his head.

                            JOE
                  I'm not selling my house. No way. I
                  don't care how much those idiots
                  would shell out for it. I got
                  history in that house. You think
                  they understand about history?

                            REGULAR
                  Still... How much commission you
                  get on that popcorn? Bet you gotta
                  sell a lot of corn to-

                            JOE
                  Hey, the corn's good. Really good.
                  Not like the pet food but that was
                  a phenomenon.

     The bartender sets a basket of cheddar popcorn in the space
     between Joe and the grizzled regular.

                            JOE
                  It'll get there. Takes time to get
                  to know the market. Develop a
                  relationship with the buyers. But
                  it'll get there. Who doesn't like
                  popcorn for Christ's sake.

                            REGULAR
                  My brother-in-law's in sales.

     The regular scoops up a handful of powdery orange popcorn.

                            REGULAR
                  Last year he buys a cow.

                            JOE
                  Why would you buy a cow?

               Not a live cow. A whole butchered
               cow from a rancher. On the hoof
               they call it.

                         JOE
               Mm hmm.

     Joe looks at him with renewed interest.

                         REGULAR
               He sells off the parts of this cow
               to a bunch of restaurants. Direct.
               Made a killing.

     The grizzled man licks orange powder from his fingers.

                         JOE
               What'd he do with the brains and
               intestines?

     Regular shrugs. Joe's wheels are turning.

                         JOE
               So he cuts out the middle man. Not
               a bad idea.

     Joe takes a drink of his beer while he mulls it over.

                         JOE
               Course it'd be smarter to do that
               with something that didn't have bad
               parts. Like... shrimp.


41   EXT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - SIX DAYS LATER - MORNING                    41

     Another day in paradise.


42   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - NORAH'S BEDROOM - MORNING                   42

     Norah sleeps in her clothes and makeup from the previous
     night. Knocking wakes her.

                   (though the door)
               Rose is on the phone. Norah?

                  She says it's important.

                  What do you want?

                            ROSE

     Rose sips her 7-11 coffee. Norah stares blank and blood-shot.

                              NORAH
                  You suck.

                              ROSE
                  Money.

                            NORAH
                  You still suck.

                            ROSE
                  Apparently some crazy bag lady
                  squatter person died and--

45   EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY                                               45

     Rose turns into the trailer park, heads past a row of
     trailers, and parks.

     Rose and Norah get out of the car and approach a particularly
     run down trailer.

                            NORAH
                  How long is this gonna take?

                            ROSE
                  All we have to do is go in and
                  throw everything away. Cake.


46   INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY                                               46

     Rose and Norah open the door and the rancid sweet smell of
     decayed flesh splashes them in the face. They lift their T-
     shirts up over their noses and walk inside.

     Old newspapers stacked to the ceiling. Piles of trash lean
     like snowdrifts against the wall. Cat food encrusted plates.

     Norah opens the bedroom door and peeks in. Flies BUZZ. She
     darts to another room and retches.

                            ROSE
                  Great, now we're gonna have to
                  clean that up too.

     Rose walks into the bedroom, blanches and stifles a gag
     reflex. Norah storms past Rose and out the door.


47   EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY                                               47

     Rose chases after Norah and grabs her arm.

                            ROSE
                  Where are you going?

                            NORAH

     Norah shakes off Rose and walks down the row of trailers.

48    INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY                                               48

      Rose pulls her shirt off and wraps it around her head so that
      only her eyes are exposed.

      She strains to open a window that's been painted shut. She
      bangs and pulls but it doesn't budge.

      Rose finds a can of beans and whacks them against the base of
      the window in an attempt to break the seal. Rose grows more
      desperate with each failed effort.


49    EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY                                               49

      Norah watches Rose struggle with the window.

      Pigeons gather at her feet and she gives a little kick.
      Birdseed tumbles on to her shoe. She turns.

      A weathered man sits outside his small rectangular castle and
      tosses birdseed to the pigeons.

                          NORAH
                I'm standing here.

      Norah looks back up to Rose still struggling with the window.
      Finally, Rose muscles it open and throws Norah an angry look
      of triumph. There!


49A   EXT. ALBUQUERQUE STREET - DAY                                      49A

      Joe and Oscar drive to a potential sale.

      Norah ties a shirt around her face as she enters.

      They turn their attention to the discolored mattress
      attracting flies in the corner.

                          NORAH
                What do we do with that?

      Rose shrugs. Looks around.

     Rose and Norah struggle to transport the stinking mattress to
     the dumpster. It is a clumsy process. The thing tips and
     falls on Norah.


52   INT. MALL - CANDY STORE - DAY                                         52

     Tucked inside a mall, the candy store does brisk business.
     Pimple-faced clerks ring up clumps of overweight families.

     Oscar pretends to look at hard candies while he listens to
     Joe and the MANAGER.

                         MANAGER
               You're telling me this Fancy Corn
               stuff is some kind of health food?

                         JOE
               Well, it's a candy... and a health
               food. Absolutely. Absolutely.

                         MANAGER
               Yeah, I don't know. We don't have
               much more shelf space.

     Oscar spots a GIRL perusing wax lips. She looks to be about
     five or six. Joe ignores the manager and reads ingredients
     off a Twizzler package.

                         JOE
               Glycerol monostearate? What is
               that? I can't even read that.

     Joe spins a can of Fancy Corn around and points to the
     ingredients.

                            JOE
               Read that.

     The manager leans close.

                         MANAGER
               High fructose--

                         JOE
               No. The first thing listed. The
               number one ingredient.

                             MANAGER
                  Corn.

                            JOE
                  Exactly. Corn. Can you think of
                  anything more wholesome? It's all
                  American for Christ's sake.

     The manager's not buying it. Oscar takes action. He positions
     himself next to the girl.

                            OSCAR
                  Do you know if they sell fancy corn
                  here?

     The girl looks at him suspiciously.

                            OSCAR
                  Do you even know what fancy corn
                  is?

                             GIRL
                  Yes.

                            OSCAR
                  Well, do they sell it here?

                             GIRL
                  I dunno.

     She looks back to the lips and tries to ignore Oscar.

                            OSCAR
                  I heard that the strawberry fancy
                  corn gives you bionic strength.

                            GIRL
                  That's stupid.

                            OSCAR
                  It's true. Some kind of chemical in
                  the strawberry flavoring. If you
                  eat a whole lot of it, it gives you
                  bionic strength.

     The girl gives Oscar a long stare.

                            GIRL
                  I don't believe you.

                            OSCAR
                  I don't care if you do or not.

     The girl watches him for a moment and then walks over and
     tugs her mother's shirt.

                          JOE
               I read where these chemicals are
               getting into the streams, making
               hermaphrodidic frogs! You think
               mothers want to expose their kids
               to that stuff? No way. More and
               more people are looking for healthy
               alternatives which is why the
               demand for this product is so huge
               right now.

                         MANAGER
               Like I said, I already put in all
               the orders I want for this year.

     Just then, the GIRL'S MOTHER walks up to the manager.

                         GIRL'S MOTHER
               Excuse me. Do you carry something
               called fancy corn?

     Joe looks at Oscar. Oscar smiles.

53   INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY                                         53

     Much progress has been made on the trailer. Rose and Norah
     work on the last remaining piles of trash.

                         NORAH
               It seems wrong though doesn't it...
               to throw everything away.

     Rose tosses a tattered fanny pack onto the heap in the
     garbage can. Norah plucks it out and opens it.

     Norah pulls out a PHOTO ID. She holds it up. The woman on the
     ID looks street-worn and crazy.

                         NORAH
               I bet this is her.

     Rose sweeps. Norah digs deeper into the fanny pack and pulls
     out a small packet wrapped in satin ribbon.

     Norah unties the ribbon and finds a stack of old school
     photos. Each photo is of a different grade. Norah flips
     through the stack and the girl appears to grow up.

                         NORAH
               Wow, look at this.

     Norah holds the senior photo next to the ID. The resemblance
     between the two is clear.

                         NORAH
               Think it's her daughter?

     Rose looks. Shrugs.

                         NORAH
               Shouldn't we do something? Try to
               find her or something?

                         ROSE
               That's none of your business,
               Norah.

     Rose picks up a bag stuffed with cans and fast food wrappers.
     She screams and drops the bag. A giant ball of maggots
     writhes at her feet.

                            ROSE
                      (pointing)
                  Hand me that.

     Norah grabs the dust pan and hands it to Rose.

                            NORAH
                  What if she doesn't know? Wouldn't
                  you want to know if this was mom?

     Norah looks closely at the I.D. as Rose deposits trash and
     maggots into the garbage bin. The comparison angers Rose.

                            ROSE
                  Mom was never like this. Mom would
                  never have been like this.

     Norah thinks about that and looks back at the I.D.

                            NORAH
                  I wonder how she died?

                            ROSE
                  Damnit Norah, we still have a lot
                  of shit to do here. Are you just
                  gonna talk?


54   EXT. CANDY STORE - DAY                                               54

     Joe and Oscar roll a handcart strapped with Fancy Corn
     canisters through the parking lot to the car.

                            JOE
                  That was real good. You're a
                  natural. You got the timing, you
                  got the nerve. You're a real sharp
                  cookie, you know that?

                            OSCAR
                  No I'm not. I'm stupid.

                            JOE
                  Don't say that.

                               OSCAR
                  What?

                            JOE
                  It's those teachers who are
                  retarded. You're probably just too
                  advanced for those classes. You're
                  bored. Do you get bored in class?

                               OSCAR

                            JOE
                  See. You're too smart! And those
                  teachers just don't know how to
                  handle you. You're probably a
                  goddamn genius.

                            OSCAR

56   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - NORAH'S BEDROOM - DAY                    56

     Norah empties the contents of the fanny pack onto her bed.
     She examines the photos and picks up what appears to be a
     senior photo. She turns it over and sees, written on the
     back, LYNN WISEMAN - 1998.

58   INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                             58

     Same room as before. Same curtains drawn. Mac unzips Rose's
     skirt and kisses her neck.

                         ROSE
               It was so disgusting. I mean the
               smell, you would not believe.

     Mac's in the sex zone. He unbuttons his shirt and tunes out
     all those distracting words tumbling from Rose's mouth.

     Rose, animated, slips her skirt off and tosses it aside.

                         ROSE
               There were flies everywhere and,
               really, the smell. I can't even
               describe it.

     Mac's shoes hit the floor with a thud. He sets his belt and
     gun on the dresser.

                         MAC
               Shhhh.

     Rose pulls her shirt over her head. Mac kisses her belly.

                           ROSE
               But, after we finished... you woulda
               never even known. We took all that
               away... made it right.

     Mac pulls off his pants. Rose hangs her bra on the back of
     the chair and slips off her undies.

                         MAC
               I can't believe you... I mean, I feel
               like I got you into this mess.

     Her sense of pride wilts. Her hand instinctively reaches up
     to massage the nicotine patch on her arm.

                         ROSE
               No, I--

                         MAC
               Listen, I'm gonna pay for new real
               estate classes. Okay?

                  We'll get you your license and then
                  get you a little photo in the real
                  estate section. You can drive

                      (Suddenly very serious)
                  Crown molding?

     Rose smiles. Apparently it's some private joke.

                            ROSE
                  Oh yeah, definitely talk about
                  crown molding.

     The phrase seems to send a ripple of pleasure through Mac.

                            ROSE
                  Property easements, square footage,
                  appliances...

     Mac reacts to each word as if it were some filthy sex talk.
     He looks at Rose and raises an eyebrow.

                            MAC
                  You're holding out on me.

     Rose rolls her eyes and laughs.

                            ROSE
                  Freak.

                            MAC
                  Say it. Come on. One time.

     She smiles and shakes her head. Mac waits. Rose relents.

                            ROSE
                  Curb appeal.

     Mac growls and pounces on Rose. It's fun and light. Rose
     laughs while Mac makes a show of mauling her neck.

     He falls on the bed and reaches out. Rose takes his hand.
     It's rough against hers. There's a circular indentation where
     his wedding ring isn't.

     Rose stops laughing. She touches the invisible ring.

                            ROSE
                  Why'd you pick her?

     Mac looks up. Buzz kill. The residue of a smile fades.

                         MAC
               You know it wasn't like that.

                         ROSE
               How was it like?

     He takes a step back.

                         MAC
               Are you going to do that?

                          ROSE
               No.

                         MAC
               If this is going to get all heavy--

                          ROSE
               No.

     Rose turns around and kisses Mac. One of those soft, teasing
     kisses that ends with a look that kicks things in gear.


59   EXT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - TWO DAYS LATER - DAY                  59

     Rose pulls her car up to one of many warehouses in the area

     Rose and Norah enter this no frills operation. Cinder block
     walls and concrete floors. A small TV on the front counter
     offers up a not-so-classic afternoon movie line up.

     As they approach, the clerk drops out of sight behind the
     counter. Rose leans over to see the clerk on his knees
     searching for something small and lost.

                          ROSE
               Winston?

     WINSTON, 35, crudely handsome with dark unkempt hair and full
     lips, looks up.

                         ROSE
               I spoke with you on the phone. I'm
               Rose Lorkowski.

     Rose sticks out her right hand.

     Winston stands to reveal he is missing his right arm. He
     clumsily shakes her hand with his left.

                            ROSE
                  So, our situation is...

     On the TV, a waitress enters the frame. Rose stops. She and
     Norah both turn and look at the TV.

     The waitress pours coffee and exits the frame without a word.
     Rose and Norah turn back to Winston. Rose continues.

                              ROSE
                  We're doing some postmortem kind of
                  um... specialized cleaning stuff and
                  we had this really difficult...

                              NORAH
                  Smelly.

     Rose looks at Norah and nods.

                            ROSE
                  Really smelly job where the lady
                  had died and they didn't find her
                  for a while and it was really...

                              NORAH
                  Stinky.

                            ROSE
                  The odor was really strong.

                              WINSTON
                  A decomp.

     Rose smiles a little too enthusiastically.

                            ROSE
                  Yeah, a decomp!

     Winston motions them to follow him through the store. He
     indicates points of interest with a flat monotone voice.

                            WINSTON

               Steamers, buffers, foggers, that

               purchase. Quick absorbing sawdust,
               good for vomit.

     The tour ends at the back corner where respirators, safety
     glasses, gloves and Tyvec coveralls crowd the shelves.

                         WINSTON
               And you've got your personal
               protective gear back here.

     The door BEEPS as it opens. CARL SWANSON walks in wearing his
     `Above and Beyond' polo shirt. Winston returns to the
     counter.


61   INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - FRONT COUNTER - DAY                   61

     Carl grabs a case of disinfectant and sets it on the counter.
     Winston pulls out some paperwork.

                         CARL
               You hear there're a couple of
               amateurs poaching jobs?

     Winston shakes his head.

     Rose and Norah make their way to the counter with arms full
     of supplies and stand within earshot of Carl and Winston.

                         CARL
               Bruce said they took a decomp for
               five hundred bucks. What do you
               wanna bet they threw all that shit
               right in the dumpster.

     Norah nudges Rose. Carl pays and Rose and Norah watch him
     leave. They step up and set their supplies on the counter.

     As Winston rings them up, Rose notices the shellacked puzzle
     picture of a big white cat on the wall.

                         ROSE
               Hey, I have that puzzle. It's a
               hard one. I think I got lost in the
               white and gave up.

     Rose flashes a `captain of the cheerleading squad' smile.

                         WINSTON

                            ROSE
                  You like cats?

     Winston looks squarely at Rose and steps into the back room.

                            NORAH
                  Great. You freaked him out.

                            ROSE
                  I asked him if he liked cats.

     Winston returns with several books and pamphlets. Hazmat
     Guidelines, Biohazard Recovery and Disposal, etc.

                            WINSTON
                  Bring these back.

     Rose drives while Norah scans one of the books.

                            NORAH
                  Turns out it's against the law to
                  throw bio hazards in the dumpster.
                  Who knew?

     Rose processes the visit.

                            NORAH
                  How perfect was he with the one
                  arm?

                  Hmm?

                            NORAH
                  The creepy guy. Do you think he was
                  born like that?

                            ROSE
                  I didn't think he was creepy.

                            NORAH
                  Dude, he has one arm.

                            ROSE
                  They think we're just a couple of
                  hacks.

                            NORAH
                  We are a couple of hacks.

     Norah looks out the window.

                               NORAH
                  Stop here.

                               ROSE
                  Why?

                            NORAH
                  I gotta thing. Just drop me off
                  here.

     Rose looks confused but pulls over.


63   EXT. LYNN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                            63

     Norah opens the door and slides out.

                            ROSE
                  I'll drop Oscar by around seven.

                            NORAH
                      (sarcastically)
                  You have class tonight?

     Rose smiles uncomfortably.

                            ROSE

     Norah shakes her head in disgust.

                             NORAH
                  Heather's pregnant again. Did you
                  know that? He's never going to
                  leave her.

     Rose clenches her jaw and picks at a crack in the steering
     wheel. Norah gets out of the car.

                            NORAH
                  God, you're pathetic.

     Norah slams the door and watches Rose drive off.

     Norah stands at the door well and scans the apartment number
     listings. She sees the name she's looking for, LYNN WISEMAN.

     Just then, LYNN, the woman from the photos, opens the door
     and walks past. Caught off guard, Norah follows her.

     They walk several blocks, Norah keeping a safe distance
     behind Lynn.


65   EXT. ALBUQUERQUE BLOOD SERVICES BUILDING - DAY                     65

     Lynn opens the door to the building and disappears inside.
     Norah follows.


66   INT. ALBUQUERQUE BLOOD SERVICES BUILDING - DAY                     66

     Lynn steps into an elevator. Norah does too.


67   INT. ALBUQUERQUE BLOOD SERVICES BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY          67

     The doors close. Lynn slaps the `stop elevator' button.
     Norah emits a small yelp.

                         LYNN
               Who are you?

                         NORAH
               What?

                         LYNN
               Why are you following me?

                         NORAH
               I'm not following you.

                         LYNN
               You are following me!

     Lynn freezes for a moment. It seems she isn't even breathing.
     Her anger twists into fear.

                         LYNN
               Aren't you?

     Norah remains silent. Lynn paces back and forth.

                         LYNN
               Oh no.

                  Shit! This is not happening.

     Norah is uncomfortable. Lynn spins around to face Norah.

                            LYNN
                  Listen, I'm sorry. I thought... I
                  thought you were following me.

                            NORAH
                  That's all right.

     Lynn steps closer.

                            LYNN
                  You think I'm crazy.

                            NORAH
                  No. No I don't.

                            LYNN
                  I'm not crazy.

                            NORAH
                  It was a mistake. No big deal.

     Lynn smiles. Norah releases the stop button. Nothing happens.

                            LYNN
                  It's not moving.

                            NORAH
                  Let's press the alarm button.

     Lynn shrugs. Norah presses the alarm button. There's a loud
     quick ring. They wait for something to happen.

     An awkward silence hangs in the air. Norah gives it another
     quick punch for good measure. Smiles. They look at the
     ceiling. They look at the floor. Norah makes little noises.

     Norah takes out her sign language book. She steals a quick
     sideways look at Lynn before settling on the series of small,
     illustrated hands before her.

                            LYNN
                  Go to the university?

                            NORAH

     Lynn leans close and checks out the book.

     Lynn sizes Norah up.

                         NORAH
               There's this gorilla who knows sign
               language and I've always thought
               that would have to be the most
               amazing thing ever. You know? To
               actually talk to a gorilla.

                         LYNN
               I think I've seen something on--

     Norah nods.

                            NORAH
               KoKo.

                         LYNN
               Yeah, yeah, with the kitten.

     Norah offers a sad nod.

                         NORAH
               Kitten died. It wasn't KoKo's
               fault. She was heartbroken.

     A KNOCKING sound reverberates through the elevator.

                         LYNN
               Kind of weird, don't you think?
               Teaching a gorilla to talk.
               Probably, gorillas aren't supposed
               to talk.

                         NORAH
               That's what's so cool about it.

     Lynn takes a long bold look at Norah. Norah sweats. The
     elevator moves.

                         LYNN
               I'm sorry again about the...

                           NORAH
               No, don't... it's fine.

     Lynn lightly touches the crook of Norah's arm.

               You've got nice veins.

     Norah smiles self consciously. She's flustered. Not a
     familiar sensation. The doors open to the "Albuquerque Blood
     Services."

                         LYNN
               You should give blood.

     Lynn steps off the elevator and grabs a white coat from a
     rack. She glances back with a smile just as the doors close.


68   EXT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - NIGHT                                         68

     The house is dark except for a TV in the living room and a
     light in Norah's bedroom window.

     Norah pulls the photos from her bag and sets them on a shelf
     next to the candy heart. Then, she drops to the floor and
     pulls the LUNCH BOX from under her bed.

     She surveys the contents: lipstick tipped cigarette butts, an
     eyelash curler, a Blue Jay feather, an old photo.

     In the photo two girls, twelve and five, stand with their
     mom. A cigarette dangles from the mother's ruby red mouth.

     This time Rose's Sentra sits alone. No blue Camry in sight.

     She checks her watch, picks up the phone and dials.

               Hi. Could you tell me what time you
               have? Okay. Thanks.

     Rose hangs up and falls back onto the bed, feet dangling off
     the edge. She stares at the ceiling and whispers.

      the world go by.

      Joe clears the dinner table while Oscar occupies himself with
      markers, construction paper, and a creative impulse.

      Rose walks in defeated.

                             JOE
                   You're back early.

                             ROSE
                   I'm quitting real estate.

                             JOE
                   What are you talking about? You
                   can't quit real estate. You're
                   gonna be great at real estate. You
                   got the whole look and besides,
                   that's where everything's headed.
                   Hell, it's what I should have done
                   forty years ago.

                              ROSE
                   Shut up.

      Rose sits at the table next to Oscar. She looks miserable.
      Oscar looks at his mom.

                             OSCAR
                   Want me to make you something
                   happy?

      Rose can't help but smile.

                             ROSE
                   Yeah. I'd like that.

                             JOE
                   Make me something happy too.

73   INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - THREE DAYS LATER - DAY               73

     Rose hands Winston a canister of Fancy Corn and a business
     card. Rays of the sun dart off the edges of the card in a
     style of a child's drawing. It reads, "Sunshine Cleaning."

                         WINSTON
               Sunshine Cleaning. Nice.

                         ROSE
               Thought we'd put a positive spin on
               things. My son drew the design.

     Oscar stares at Winston's empty sleeve.

                            WINSTON
                  That's a nice job you did there.

                            OSCAR
                  Where's your arm?

                               ROSE
                  Oscar!

                            WINSTON
                  That's all right.

                            ROSE
                  I was thinking maybe I could set a
                  few out by the register?

                               WINSTON
                  Yeah sure.

     Rose hands Winston a stack of cards. He places them in an owl
     business card holder in front of several Clean Sweep business
     cards.

                            WINSTON
                  This is great but you guys should
                  really get out there and market
                  yourselves.

     Oscar plays with an extraction cleaner and accidently turns
     it on. Winston gives him a nod that indicates that he should
     turn it off. He does.

                               ROSE

                  So, marketing? Like...?

                            WINSTON
                  Funeral Homes, property managers...
                  What you really want is to get in
                  with the insurance companies. They
                  can throw you a ton of work.

     Oscar walks into the back room.

     Winston puffs up a bit with `manly know how'.

                            WINSTON
                  Do you guys have your B.B.P.

     Winston smiles.

     Rose, Norah, Oscar and Joe follow SHERM LAWSON across the car
     lot. Rose shoots an irritated look to her dad.

                            ROSE
                      (whispering to Norah)
                  Did you ask him to come.

                            NORAH
                  Not exactly.

     Joe positions himself next to Rose.

                            JOE
                      (Quietly to Rose)
                  Now Sherm's gonna say he's against
                  the wall but don't you believe him.
                  There's always some wiggle room.

                            ROSE
                  I can handle it.

     The troop comes to a stop in front of a large blue van.

                             SHERM
                  I think you're gonna like this
                  Econoline.

     heads inside. Rose nods.

               We gotta take any contaminated
               materials to the incinerators. So
               we'll need lots of space back here.

                         OSCAR
               For the bloody stuff.

                         ROSE
               So, how much is this?

                         SHERM
               Nineteen Ninety-nine.

                         JOE
               What's the play on that?

                         SHERM
               Oh, that's the floor right there.
               I'm actually taking a loss on this
               to make room for some new product.

                         ROSE
               Well, I could pay cash.

                         SHERM
               Cash is good.

     Sherm walks around and unlocks the driver's side door.

                         JOE
                   (whispering to Rose)
               Ask him about the bumper.

                         ROSE
               What?

                         JOE
               The dented bumper.

     Rose approaches Sherm with a smile.

                          ROSE
               I noticed the bumper's kind of
               banged up.

     Sherm smiles.

                 We were over at Motor Mart on Lomas
                 earlier. They got a nice looking
                 Chevy G series for eighteen.

                 Power steering?

     Joe nods.

     Oscar crawls into the passenger seat for a closer look. He
     sees the CB mounted on the ceiling and tugs Norah's sleeve.

                           OSCAR
                 What's that?

                 God, do people even use those

                           OSCAR
                 What is it?

     Sherm grabs the handset to demonstrate.

                           SHERM
                 It's a CB. You talk into this thing
                 and hold this thing down and it
                 turns your voice into radio waves
                 and sends it into the heavens.

     Rose drives. Norah sits shotgun and sings the baseline to a
     70s era porno. Oscar kneels between them staring at the CB.

                         NORAH
               Bow-chicka-bow-bow. Can I drive?

                         ROSE
               No.

                         OSCAR
               Try the CB!

     Rose reaches up and clicks the CB on. Nothing but static. She
     adjusts the frequency dial until she lands on the faintest
     hint of a voice buried beneath the crush of static.

     Oscar's face lights up with amazement. Rose is under-whelmed.
     She clicks the CB off.

                         ROSE
               Antenna's probably broke.

     Norah points out the window.

                         NORAH
               Ice Cream Hut!


79   EXT. ICE CREAM HUT - DAY                                             79

     Rose pays for three soft serve cones and makes her way to the
     picnic table where Norah and Oscar wait.

     Norah points to an `apartment for rent' sign on the building
     across the street. A big bosomed woman sits on the porch with
     a rabbit in her lap.

                         NORAH
               How cool to live across from the
               Ice Cream Hut.

     Rose distributes the melty goods.

                         ROSE
               You should rent it. Seriously,
               you're making money now.

     Norah assesses the building. The RABBIT LADY sees them
     staring. She waves. Rose and Norah turn around amused.

                  Oh please, Dad would survive just
                  fine. You should do it.

     As Norah thinks about a possible move glistening rivulets of
     chocolate ice cream drip down Oscar's cone, over his hand and
     on to Norah's leg.

                            NORAH
                  Ahh! Lick around the base. Secure
                  the perimeter.
                      (To Rose)
                  Don't you teach this kid anything?

     Norah demonstrates proper technique. She extends her tongue
     out to the bottom edge of the dripping glob, then twirls the
     cone to lick away the troublesome chocolate.

                            LYNN (O.S.)
                  It's the gorilla girl.

     Norah looks up to see Lynn with a milk shake in hand. An
     involuntary smile breaks across Norah.

                            LYNN
                  You never came to donate.

                               NORAH
                  Yeah.

     Lynn looks at Rose. An awkward moment passes.

                               NORAH
                  My sister.

     Rose smiles, nods a hi. Something familiar about the girl
     nags at Rose. She searches to connect a face out of context.

     Lynn eyes Norah. Chemistry.

                            LYNN
                  We have snacks you know. Juice
                  boxes.

                            NORAH
                  Had I known about the juice
                  boxes...

     Rose makes the connection - her smile drops. Lynn picks up on
     the tension between the two.

                         LYNN
               Okay. Well, see you around.

     Lynn leaves. Rose slaps Norah with an accusing look.


80   EXT. LAWSON'S USED CAR LOT - DAY                                   80

     Joe stands with Sherm and waits for the girls to return. He
     looks at his watch.

                         SHERM
               You still selling that luggage?

                         JOE
               No, no. That was a whole big mess.

                         SHERM
               Crappy zippers. Wasn't that it?

     Sherm smiles. Joe's smile disappears.

                         JOE
               Yeah, that's been a while now.
               Dropped the luggage around the time
               your other lot when out of
               business.

     Touche. Sherm's smile dissolves.

                         SHERM
               I could maybe drop it to nineteen
               even.

     Joe holds out for more.

                         SHERM
               And toss in some wiper fluid.

     Joe smiles.


81   EXT. ICE CREAM HUT - DAY                                           81

     Rose, Norah and Oscar walk back to the van. Everyone's
     slightly stickier. Rose clenches her jaw.

                         ROSE
               What the hell?

                  I just wanted to give her the
                  pictures.

                            ROSE
                  You took the pictures? Why would
                  you do that? We could get in a lot
                  of trouble for that.

                            NORAH
                  Relax, I didn't give them to her.


82   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - ONE WEEK LATER -               82
     EVENING

     Joe sits in his Lazy Boy as Norah hauls a box from her room.

                            NORAH
                  It's just three blocks away.

                            JOE
                  I know.

                            JOE
                  Hey, I think you should have done
                  this a long time ago.

     Joe strains to be cavalier but he can't look at Norah.


83   EXT. HOTEL - NEXT DAY - DAY                                          83

     A marquee welcomes the conference attendees.


84   INT. HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM ­ DAY                                     84

     Rose sits on a folding chair and takes notes. The thirty or
     so people listening to the SPEAKER appear to be mostly
     hospital staff and EMT workers. A placard near the door
     reads: SEMINAR FOR BLOOD BORNE PATHOGENS.

     CARL SWANSON leans forward from his chair and looks down the
     row to Rose.

                            SPEAKER
                  OK. Let's take a quick break before
                  we move on to potential pathogens
                  suspended in excrement.


85   INT. HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM ­ FOOD TABLE - DAY                        85

     Rose stands by a display of medical waste pamphlets and
     munches on a sandwich. As she takes a bite, Carl walks up.

                            CARL
                  Food's better at the bar.
                      (holding out his hand)
                  Carl Swanson, Above and Beyond.

     Flustered, Rose brushes crumbs off her face and inadvertently
     deposits a blob of mustard on her cheek. They shake hands.

                            ROSE
                  Rose-

                            ROSE
                  We're hardly competition for you.

                            CARL
                      (smiles)
                  I'm glad to see you're doing a
                  little homework. A lot of people,
                  you know, they think they can just
                  jump in to this, make lots of
                  money. But, they don't know what
                  they're doing. No idea. They're not
                  professional and that makes us all
                  look bad.

                            ROSE
                  Well, we're not like that. I just
                  have to complete this seminar and
                  we're certified.

                            CARL
                  You're not certified?

                            ROSE
                  Not yet. Probably by the end of the
                  month.

     Carl smiles, dips a napkin in his cup of water and wipes the
     smudge of mustard from Rose's cheek.

                            CARL
                  You had a...

     Attendees file back to their chairs.

                            ROSE
                  I think it's starting.

                            CARL
                  Sure I can't buy you a drink?


86   INT. HOTEL BAR - DAY                                                 86

     Rose and Carl sit at the bar nursing drinks.

                            CARL
                  If you spray the enzyme at that
                  point it'll just turn back to
                  liquid which is a pain in the ass.
                  The key is to bag it when it's kind
                  of Jell-o-ee.

                  That makes total sense. Why didn't
                  I think of that?

                            CARL
                  You just figure all this shit out
                  as you go. Experience.

     Rose chews on her cocktail straw.

                            ROSE
                  It's not how I thought it'd be. I
                  thought it'd be gross.

     Rose stops. Reflects. Turns to Carl.

                            ROSE
                  Sometimes it's gross. The maggots
                  are gross. The maggots kind of
                  freak me.

                            CARL
                  Yeah.

                            ROSE
                  The sound. The munching sound.

                            CARL
                  And it's so hard to kill the little
                  fuckers.

                            ROSE
                  Tell me about it. You pour
                  industrial bleach right on
                  `em...nothing.

     Carl offers a knowing nod.

                            CARL
                  Just roll their eyes and call you a
                  pussy.

     Rose laughs and takes another sip of her drink.

     The door to the bathroom is open. Carl hums a happy tune in
     the shower.

     Rose shimmies back into her clothes with an expression of
     self-loathing.

88   INT. VAN - THREE DAYS LATER - DAY                                      88

     Rose drives and Norah holds a long list of funeral homes and
     other establishments. They're all crossed off. Oscar sits
     bored in the back.

                            OSCAR
                  What's a bastard?

     Rose looks at Norah with concern.

                            OSCAR
                  Jeremy said I was a bastard. What
                  does that mean?

     Rose has no idea how to respond. Norah turns to face Oscar.

                            NORAH
                  It just means your mom wasn't
                  married when she had you. It's no
                  big deal. In a couple of years
                  you're gonna find it's a free pass
                  to cool. You'll probably start a
                  band called Bastard Son. Use it to
                  impress the chicks. Trust me, the
                  whole bastard thing... it's working
                  for you.

     Oscar looks to Rose and then back to Norah.

     Rose's phone rings. She answers it, relieved for the
     distraction

                            ROSE
                  Hello, Sunshine Cleaning... Well,
                  I'm glad you liked the Fancy
                  Corn....Okay, yeah, yeah.

     Rose grabs a pen, hands it to Norah and motions for her to
     write something down.

                            ROSE
                  Okay... 2327 Grove Avenue. Got
                  it... Sure. Yeah. Thank you.

     Rose hangs up.

89   EXT. BRICK RANCHER - DAY                                               89

     Rose pulls the van up to the house and sees the old lady
     sitting out front. MRS. DAVIS.

                               ROSE
                  Oh, man.

     Rose and Norah exchange a look and then Rose turns to Oscar.

                            ROSE
                  OK. Stay in the van. You want a
                  soda or anything?

     Oscar shakes his head.

                            ROSE
                  We won't be long.

     As Rose and Norah get out and unload supplies the old lady
     stands to greet them. She's dressed up in the way old ladies
     are when they expect company.

                            ROSE
                  Mrs. Davis?

     The woman nods. She is dazed with grief.

                            ROSE
                  We're the cleaning service.

                            MRS. DAVIS
                  Yes, yes. I... I wanted to give you
                  the keys.

     The old woman holds out a shaky hand. Rose gently takes the
     keys. Norah hangs back.

                              MRS. DAVIS
                  In the sunroom. That's where my
                  husband... I had bridge and...

     She blinks twice, slowly, then snaps back.

                  Do you need me to show you?

                            ROSE
                  No, no. I think we can find it.

                            MRS. DAVIS
                  Oh. Okay. That's good then.

     Rose and Norah gather their things and head up the stairs.

                            MRS. DAVIS
                  My son-in-law's coming to take me
                  to lunch at the Howard Johnson's.
                  They have such nice rolls there.

     Rose hands Norah the key and motions for her to go ahead.

                            ROSE
                  Would you like to sit for a moment,
                  Mrs. Davis?

                            MRS. DAVIS
                  Yes dear, I think I would.

     Rose sits down on the steps with Mrs. Davis and Norah quietly
     enters the house.

     From the van Oscar watches Rose and the old woman sit side by
     side on the front step. Rose's hand rests lightly on the
     woman's bony shoulder. Words seem useless.


90   INT. BRICK RANCHER - LIVING ROOM - DAY                               90

     Norah looks around the room furnished modestly with a mixture
     of antiques and things that are simply old.

     Yellow sticky notes cling to doors, walls, light switches,
     etc. Each note contains a simple instruction such as `turn
     off light' or `watch news at 6:00'.

     Norah walks past family photos that line the hall.


91   INT. BRICK RANCHER - SUNROOM - DAY                                   91

     Norah enters the red splattered room. A walker lies on its
     side next to a blood-soaked rug. Golden sunlight pours
     through the windows.

     A yellow square sticks to a picture frame on the coffee
     table. The frame holds the image of a smiling young couple in
     a different era. The note reads `Edna plays bridge at 4:00'.

     Norah slips a Tyvec jumper on and looks out the window. A car
     pull up to the curb. Norah stops and watches her sister walk
     Mrs. Davis to the car before starting her work.


92   INT. BRICK RANCHER - SUNROOM - MOMENTS LATER                            92

     Rose enters quietly, in a fog. The stillness of grief is
     contagious.

                              NORAH
                  She okay?

     Rose nods and picks up the photo of a younger Mr and Mrs
     Davis. She then steps into her Tyvec coveralls and zips up.


93   INT. VAN - DUSK                                                         93

     Norah drives. Rose holds Oscar in her lap, arms clasped tight
     around him.

                            OSCAR
                  That lady seemed really sad.

                            ROSE
                  Her husband died.

     Oscar thinks about this a moment.

                            OSCAR
                  So he's in heaven?

     Rose nods.

                            OSCAR
                  Maybe we could let her use our CB
                  and she could talk to him.

     Rose looks confused. Oscar presses on.

                            OSCAR
                  Maybe he would hear her.

     Rose smiles. Doesn't seem like the moment to correct him.

                              ROSE
                  Maybe.

94   EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NEXT DAY - DAY                               94

     Joe's Monte Carlo sits out front.


95   INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY                                          95

     Oscar and Joe scratch game cards.

                            OSCAR
                  I won a million dollars!

                            JOE
                  Let me see that.

     Oscar hands the ticket over.

                            JOE
                  You gotta get two hydrants with a
                  matching amount. See? None of your
                  fire hydrants match.

     Oscar looks at the Lucky Dog card with defeat.

                            JOE
                  And three zeros is a thousand
                  dollars. You woulda won a thousand
                  dollars but it doesn't match
                  anything.

                            OSCAR
                  What happens if it doesn't match
                  anything?

                            JOE
                  You toss it and try the next one.

     Oscar moves on to his next ticket. He scratches the coating
     away and tentatively lifts his game card

                            OSCAR
                  I think I won five hundred dollars.

     Joe looks at the card. He looks at Oscar and grins.

                            OSCAR
                  I'm gonna buy a trampoline and a
                  karaoke player and some chocolate
                  honey dipped donuts.

                  That's not your money. That's my
                  money.

                            OSCAR
                  I scratched it.

                            JOE
                  Yes you did. You scratched the
                  ticket that I bought.

     Oscar follows his grampa over to the pay phone.

               money.

     Joe plunks in some quarters, dials, waits while it rings.

                         JOE
               See, that's the difference between
               a regular person and somebody with
               business acumen. That's a good word
               for you to know. A-cu-men. Means
               smarts.

     Oscar nods and sips his Coke.

                         JOE
                   (into the receiver)
               Bobby! Joe Lorkowski here.
                   (laughs)
               I told you I'd call.

               Yeah well, I got the money and
               we're in. But you gotta throw in
               twenty bags of ice.


96   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                                     96

     Rose pays bills at the kitchen table. Oscar bounces a super
     ball.

                         OSCAR
               We're gonna make the money grow
               because that's the smart way. It's
               capital and you don't spend that.
               You invest it. That way you can get
               the SP250 and have money left over.

                         ROSE
               What are you talking about?

     Oscar races out of the kitchen and then races back in with a
     pamphlet showcasing the amazingly sleek SP250 binoculars. He
     hands the pamphlet to Rose.

                         OSCAR
               The binoculars that grampa's gonna
               get me for my birthday.

               Oh honey, come here.

     Rose pulls out a chair for Oscar. Oscar sits down and crosses
     his arms in front of himself.

                         ROSE
               Sometimes your grampa promises
               things that he really wants to
               happen.

                         OSCAR
               No, he's really gonna get `em. He's
               got a plan.

                         ROSE
               Okay. If you say so.

     Rose goes back to the bills.


97   INT. ALBUQUERQUE BLOOD SERVICES ­ DAY                                97

     Lynn wears a white coat. Norah sits in one of the reclining
     chairs scattered about the room.

                         NORAH
               You made it seem so fun.

                         LYNN
               Oh it is fun. Would you like a
               refreshment?

     Norah smiles and shakes her head.

                         LYNN
               No?

     Norah watches Lynn's hands push up her sleeve. Lynn rubs
     iodine in expanding circles on the inside of Norah's arm.

     Lynn puts plastic gloves on and ties a tourniquet around
     Norah's arm. She puts a rubber ball in Norah's hand.

                         LYNN
               Can you squeeze that for me?

     Norah squeezes the ball and Lynn touches the plump vein.

                         LYNN
               That's good. One more time.

     Lynn takes the needle and draws it close to Norah's arm.

                            NORAH
                  Oh my God, is that the needle? It's
                  a fucking cocktail straw.

     Norah looks nervous. Lynn smiles reassuringly.

                  Trust me, I'm very good at this.
                  Squeeze again.

     Norah squeezes, Lynn touches the soft blue stripe of blood
     beneath Norah's skin and slides the needle into the vein.

                            LYNN
                  Wasn't that fun?

                            NORAH

     Lynn smiles.

                  Kind of twirl the ball around in
                  your hand. Good. It doesn't hurt,
                  does it?

                            LYNN
                  That's a good sign.

     Norah self-consciously nods and smiles. Lynn turns and
     jostles the bag of blood.

                            NORAH
                  My friend's having a thing tonight.

     Lynn switches her attention from the blood back to Norah.

     Norah and Lynn sit on a ratty couch in a crowded smoke filled
     room. Next to them, a flannel wearing burn-out rocks to
     headphones. Norah wears a candy necklace. Debauchery plays
     out around them.

               I knew you wouldn't have any fun
               here.

                         LYNN

     Norah takes a tug on the joint and passes it to Lynn.

               No thanks.

                         NORAH

     The burn-out tugs and passes it back to Lynn. Lynn waves it
     off a second time.

                  Sometimes I think that when you get
                  high or drink or alter your
                  consciousness like that--

                  You should just tell people you're
                  Mormon.

     Two women gnaw at Randy's neck. His necklace is almost empty.

                            NORAH
                  Yes. Yes, he is.

     Lynn lightly tugs on Norah's candy necklace. She leans in
     close and takes a bite of the candy. Norah catches her
     breath. Paralyzed.

     Lynn smiles, pleased by Norah's reaction.

      Norah snaps back.

                          NORAH
                I need more beer.

      Norah pulls herself off the couch and starts for the keg. She
      stops. Turns.

                          NORAH
                Um. Can I get you anything?

                            LYNN
                I'm good.

      Norah offers a nervous smile.


100   INT. NORAH'S APARTMENT ­ LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                       100

      Norah and Randy lie on a thread bare couch. Their bodies rock
      to the motion of sex. Norah's thoughts are elsewhere.

      A small TV sits next to Norah's growing collection of found
      trinkets. It spills blue light into the smoke tinged air.

      On the TV, a REPORTER stands outside Quicky Lube. Norah turns
      her attention to the TV while Randy pumps and grinds. She
      grabs the remote.

                          REPORTER
                    (on TV)
                Tragedy today when an out of

                a south side Quicky Lube killing
                one employee.

                          RANDY

                            NORAH
                Shh.

      Norah turns up the volume. Randy grinds to a halt.

      The phone rings. Randy glares at Norah. Norah answers.

      Randy steps out onto the porch where the big bosomed RABBIT
      LADY strokes her rabbit. He closes the door behind him.

                             RANDY
                   Hey.

                             RABBIT LADY
                   Hey.

      Randy starts down the steps feeling dejected.

                             RABBIT LADY
                   You like rabbits?

      Randy stops and turns.


103   EXT. QUICKY LUBE ­ NIGHT                                          103

      The large glass panel that made up the front of the store is
      shattered. Shards dangle from red tipped edges. Blood and
      glass mingle on the linoleum floor and plastic chairs.

      Outside, Mac motions a stunned crowd to disperse. Rose and
      Norah walk confidently past Mac into the lobby where a man
      wearing a Quick Lube shirt stands off to the side and cries.

                   Why don't you grab the wet-vac and
                   I'll start bagging the loose stuff.

      The officer walks past Mac who continues to stare at Rose.
      She looks beautiful and strong.

      themselves for the Quicky Lube job.

                          NORAH
                I thought you went to the thing.

                          ROSE
                I did. I mean, I went to part of
                it. Most of it.

                          NORAH
                What do you mean you went to part
                of it? It was a one day thing.

                          ROSE
                I got side tracked.

                          NORAH

                Oh my God, you humped Carl!

      Rose can't deny it. Norah shakes her head.

                I'm already registered for the next
                one.

      Joe and Oscar sit in the car pulled off to the side of a
      lonely highway intersection.

                   You figure you'll tip the delivery
                   guy a couple bucks but the
                   delivery guy turns out to be a
                   lady. Real sizzler. So you give her
                   a crisp five. How much do you have
                   left?

      Oscar thinks.

      Joe assumes there's no way the kid's getting this and turns
      his attention outside. A truck appear on the horizon.

                             OSCAR
                   Two dollars?

                             JOE
                   Hey, how'd you come up with that?

                   Math.

      The truck slows down as it reaches the intersection, pulls
      off the road, and stops. Joe gets out and walks over.

      Oscar watches the trucker hop down from the cab and shake
      Joe's hand like they're old friends.

                   The thing is Oscar...and this is
                   important to learn early...life is
                   sales. Buying and selling. It's the
                   core of social interaction. And
                   human beings are social beings.

      Smoke starts to seep out from under the hood. Joe eyes the

                   I'm sorry, I don't mean to bother
                   you. I just wanted to let you know
                   that we're all finished up and--

      The woman glares at Rose.

                             MIDDLE AGED WOMAN
                   Oh, you want to get paid.

                   We can come back later if that's

      Rose fills a cup at the soda fountain. Through the window she
      sees Mac and family pull up on the other side of the store.

      Mac gets out and pumps gas. The woman, HEATHER, laughs with
      the little girl in the back seat. They look happy.

      Rose's fountain drink overflows.

                          ROSE
                Dammit.

      Rose grabs for a napkin which clumps and tears.

      The door BEEPS. Rose jumps behind the candy rack and peeks
      around. All clear. She turns and smacks into Heather. Heather
      glares at Rose.

                          HEATHER
                You think I don't know?

      Heather trembles with anger. Rose stands frozen.

                          HEATHER
                You may have been hot shit in high
                school but what are you now?
                Nothing. A waste of space.

      Heather reaches out and gives Rose a little push. Ten years
      of anger culminating in this one anti climactic gesture.

      Rose watches Heather walk away and knows every word is true.


112   EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY                                           112

      A stream of water leaks from the trunk. Joe gets out cursing
      under his breath. He kicks the car and a hub cap falls off.
      It's an unbearable insult.

                          JOE
                Stupid shit heap!

      Fifty years of failures result in an explosion of
      frustration. Joe stomps on the hub cap, picks it up and
      throws it as far as he can.

      Joe gathers himself and leans in the window. He forces a
      smile at Oscar. Oscar looks nervous.

                   It's alright. Everything's okay.

      Joe opens the trunk and checks on the shrimp. A car zooms by.
      Joe tries to wave it down. No good. Another zooms by.

                             JOE
                   Come on, come on, come on, come on.

      Joe struggles to wave down a car. No luck. Joe has an idea.

                             JOE
                   Make like you're crying.

      Oscar turns on the tears. A car stops.


113   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING                         113

      Rose walks in. Oscar and Joe feign casualness.

      Joe looks at the bathroom door which stands open. Inside the
      tub brims with shrimp and ice.

                             ROSE
                   What did you guys do today?

                              OSCAR
                   Nothing.

      Rose turns to Joe who shrugs.

                             ROSE
                   How's it without Norah here?

                              JOE
                   Weird.

      Joe walks over and casually shuts the bathroom door.


114   EXT. DOGHOUSE WEINER HUT ­ NIGHT                                     114

      Randy stuffs his face with a hotdog while Norah glares,
      annoyed.

                             RANDY
                   I'm sorry. I know it was stupid.

                             NORAH
                   On so many levels.

                             RANDY
                   I'm really sorry. I swear it won't
                   happen again. It's just... you
                   weren't around and...

      Norah shakes her head. Randy doesn't know what to say.

                             NORAH
                   Listen, Randy I think we should
                   stop hanging out.

                             RANDY
                   You're breaking up with me over the
                   rabbit lady?

      Norah doesn't respond.

                              RANDY
                   I don't know, the way you act, I
                   didn't even think that you'd care
                   that much.

                               NORAH
                   Yeah, I don't. I should, but I
                   don't. And you're a really great
                   guy. But...I don't care if you have
                   sex with the rabbit lady... and I
                   mean, it seems like I should care
                   about that.


115   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                             115

      Rose opens a stack of neglected mail. She is interrupted by a
      light knock on the door. Rose peeks out the peep hole.

                             ROSE
                   Shit.

      Rose hesitates, then opens the door just a crack.

                             MAC
                   Rose.

                             ROSE
                   What are you doing here?

                             MAC
                   Can we talk a minute?

                             ROSE
                   Oscar's asleep.

      Rose stands her ground for a moment before stepping outside.

                             MAC
                   It was great seeing you last night.
                   You looked so professional and
                   confident. Your own business...

      Mac touches her lightly on the arm.

                             ROSE
                   How's the baby?

      Mac looks away.

                             MAC
                   I just wanted to congratulate you
                   on the business. Seems like things
                   are really going great for you.

      Rose and Mac's eyes meet.      Rose smiles.

                             ROSE
                   They are. If we keep going at this
                   rate I can hire a couple of
                   employees soon, put a little more
                   in marketing, give those Clean
                   Sweep guys a run for their money.

      Rose glows.

                             ROSE
                   I'm a business woman.

                             MAC
                       (nodding)
                   You're a business woman.


116   EXT. LYNN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                              116

      Norah stands disheveled, six pack in hand. Lynn opens the
      door wearing slippers.

                             NORAH
                   Ever been trestling?


117   EXT NOB HILL RESTAURANT ROW - NIGHT                                 117

      Shrimp jiggles in Joe's hand cart as he makes his way toward
      the row of upscale restaurants.

       A couple of upscale hipsters stare curiously at the hand cart
       as they pass Joe.


118    INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - OSCAR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                       118

       Sounds of sex seep through thin walls. Oscar sits up in bed.

       After a moment he crawls out of bed, he grabs a flashlight
       from his shelf and exits his room.


118A   INT. ROSE'S APARTMENT - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                    118A

       The mattress squeaks slightly as Mac and Rose have sex.


119    EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                         119

       In pajamas and bare feet, Oscar steps into the night. He
       flicks on the flashlight.

       Norah leads Lynn through a wooded area toward a train
       trestle. Norah carries the two remaining beers of a six pack.

                              LYNN
                    Are the bodies there?

                              NORAH
                    No. The person is gone. It's weird
                    `cuz we're connected to them in
                    this strangely intimate way... but
                    we never actually meet them. It's
                    just kind of weird.

       Norah steps over a discarded tire.

                              NORAH
                    I have seen a dead body once
                    though.

                              LYNN
                    Yeah?

                              NORAH
                    My mom.

       Lynn follows Norah, not knowing how to respond. It's awkward.
       Norah tries to lighten things.

      Norah nods.

                             NORAH
                   A bunch of Hollywood people were
                   filming down in Old Town. They
                   thought my mom was so beautiful and
                   so talented that they gave her a
                   speaking part. You want to hear it?

      Lynn nods.

                             NORAH
                   `I recommend the pecan pie.'

      Norah looks back at Lynn for applause.

                             LYNN
                   I recommend the pecan pie?

      Norah nods.

                             NORAH
                   That was her line. It was on TV and
                   everything.

                             LYNN
                   That's pretty cool.

                             NORAH
                   Me and Rose, we didn't actually see
                   it but Rose says mom talked about
                   it all the time. I don't remember.

      Norah shrugs.

                             NORAH
                   I don't remember her much at all. I
                   have this box of her stuff though,
                   little things she touched. When it
                   seems like she never even really
                   existed... it's proof.

      The two reach the bottom of a train trestle.

                             NORAH
                   All right. This is where we climb.

                               LYNN
                   What?

                          NORAH
                Up to that girder.

      Norah points to a rusted girder about eight feet from the
      underbelly of the track.

                          LYNN
                I'm not climbing up there.

                          NORAH
                Best place to be when it comes.

                          LYNN
                Uh-uh.

      Norah slips her hand through one of the plastic rings of the
      six pack and starts to climb.

                          NORAH
                You're gonna miss the best part.

                          LYNN
                I accept that.

      The two cans of beer dangle from Norah's arm like a giant
      charm bracelet and clank against girders as she climbs.

                            NORAH
                It's like... it's like this big
                pissed off God up in your face just
                screaming at you. So close you can
                smell the metal on his breath.

                          LYNN
                Sounds great.

                          NORAH
                It is. I'm telling you.

      Norah wedges her butt into the belly of a beam and taps her
      fingers against the rusted girder. After a moment she leans
      out and looks down toward Lynn.

                          NORAH
                I didn't mean to bum you out with
                the whole mom stuff. I just thought
                you would... I don't know, I guess
                I thought...

                          LYNN
                What?

      The trestle starts to shake.

                          NORAH
                He's coming.

      The thunder gets louder. Lynn covers her ears. Norah pops
      open a beer and laughs as the train approaches.


121   EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                         121

      Oscar walks along the sidewalk alone. He stops at the van,
      opens the door and gets in.

      He looks very small in the driver's seat. He lifts the
      handset to the CB.


      INTERCUT DIALOGUE WITH FOLLOWING SEQUENCE

                          OSCAR
                What was I before I was born? What
                happens when we die? Do animals go
                to the same place as we go after we
                die? Is heaven really crowded? When
                somebody gets an arm chopped off
                does it go to heaven? Is Jesus
                another name for you or are you two
                separate people? Were you born?
                Will you die? If you already live
                in heaven where do you go when you
                die?


122   EXT. TRAIN TRESTLE - NIGHT                                        122

      The train careens above Norah. Sparks fly from the blur of
      wheels. The sky flashes between each of the cars. Stars and
      grease and metal and night collide. Norah closes her eyes.

      The sound of the train merges with the loud static of a CB.


123   EXT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - FRONT YARD - 1987 - DAY                    123

      The sky is an electric blue. The kind that lives in memories
      and dreams. Rose (10) and Norah (5) play in a parked car.

      Rose pretends to drive and smoke a cigarette while Norah
      makes faces in the rearview mirror.

      Rose gets out of the car and races toward the house. Norah
      chases after.

      A giggling Rose stumbles in. She stops. The bathroom door is
      open slightly. She walks over peeks through the opening.

      There's a dress crumpled on the floor. A woman slumps
      motionless in the tub. Her delicate hand hangs over the edge.
      Scarlet fingerprints mar the white porcelain.

      Norah enters the front door. She smiles, unburdened by the
      knowledge. She runs towards Rose. Rose quickly pushes her
      back and closes the door.

      Norah senses something's wrong. She struggles to see what's

      The static mixes back into the roar of the train. The roar
      grows distant and is replaced by Norah's laughter.

      Still laughing, Norah takes a sip of her beer and sets it on
      a beam next to her. The beer falls. Norah tries to catch it,
      loses her balance and falls with a thud.

      Lynn catches her breath.

                             LYNN
                Oh, shit.

      Lynn runs over to find Norah on her back, eyes closed. Norah
      opens her eyes and laughs.

                             LYNN
                You idiot.

      Norah grabs the beer that she had been chasing. There's not
      much left but she downs the remainder.

                          NORAH
                Sneaky fucker.

                             LYNN
                   That was really stupid.

                             NORAH
                   I think I broke my hand.

                             LYNN
                   Really?

      Lynn leans close with real concern.

                             NORAH
                   No. But it hurts like a mother.

      Lynn pops the top on the remaining beer and takes a huge gulp
      before handing it to Norah.


126   EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - SIDEWALK - NIGHT                              126

      Oscar walks down the sidewalk alone. His flashlight provides
      small circle of light on the cement in front of him.


127   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                           127

      Rose stands in her T-shirt and undies. Mac shuts the door.
      Rose leans her head against the door and exhales deeply. She
      turns as if something is calling her.


128   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                               128

      Rose stands on tip toes and feels around on top of the
      refrigerator until she finds what she's looking for...
      emergency cigarettes.


129   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                           129

      Rose sits down on the couch and lights her cigarette. The
      nicotine patch is still clearly visible on her arm.

      Rose looks at the stack of unopened mail. Something grabs her
      attention. An envelope bearing the return address of Paula
      Datzman-Mead. Rose rips opens the envelope.

      Rose stares at an invitation to Paula's baby shower. A smile
      creeps across her face.

      The front door opens and Oscar walks in.

                              ROSE
                   Oscar?

      Brow furrowed, he walks past Rose without acknowledging her.
      He goes straight to his room and shuts the door.


130   INT. NORAH'S APARTMENT ­ LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                       130

      A bottle of wine sits empty on a box next to two nearly empty
      Styrofoam cups.

                             LYNN
                   How's the hand?

      Norah shakes the last few drops from her cup and starts
      gnawing on the side. Lynn takes Norah's hand and examines it.

                              NORAH
                   Ow!

                              LYNN
                   Sorry.

      Lynn draws Norah's hand close to her lips. Smiles. Looks at
      Norah. Norah's a deer in headlights. Lynn kisses Norah's
      hand. Everything is still and tense.

                              LYNN
                   Better?

      Norah   stares at her recently kissed hand and nods. She looks
      up to   Lynn. Lynn kisses Norah lightly on the lips. A tester
      kiss.   Then again. Softly. Norah doesn't move, eyes locked on
      Lynn.   All is good.

      Norah leans in and kisses Lynn's neck. Lynn's eyes are closed
      enjoying the moment.

      Lynn opens her eyes. The school photos of Lynn sit directly
      across from her on the shelf. Lynn stares at the pictures.
      Waves of recognition and confusion register in her eyes.

      Norah kisses Lynn's neck oblivious.

                              LYNN
                   Is that?

      Lynn pulls away.

                             LYNN
                   Are those...

      Lynn tries to suss it out, shakes her head, looks at Norah.

                             LYNN
                   How do you have my school pictures?

                             NORAH
                   I just... I found them. I was gonna
                   tell you.

      Lynn shakes her head disbelieving.

                             LYNN
                   Where would you find old pictures
                   of me?

                              NORAH
                   At work.

                              LYNN
                   What?

                             NORAH
                   We did this job a while back. This
                   woman...

      Lynn scans the other trinkets arranged neatly on the shelf.
      Her eyes focus on the photo ID. Her mother. Her face goes
      completely blank. Shock.

                              LYNN
                   My mom.

      Norah bites her lip and nods.

                             LYNN
                   My mom is dead.

      A hazy mix of shame, sadness and guilt seeps into the void.

                             NORAH
                   I wanted to tell you... that first
                   day. That's why I--

                             LYNN
                   You knew this whole time?

                             NORAH
                   I think... You know, I think
                   there's a reason that I found them.
                   The pictures. Because that lead me
                   to you, right?

                And I don't know exactly what went

                the situation was... but it just
                seems like... You know, of anybody,
                I would understand.

      Lynn's hazy emotional mix has hardened into something sharp.
      Anger. She looks at Norah with disgust.

                          LYNN
                You would understand?

      Lynn turns to leave.

                          NORAH
                Wait. Please. Don't...I--

      Lynn opens the door. Norah reaches out but Lynn stops her
      with an icy look.

                          LYNN
                You're sick, you know that? There's
                something wrong with you.

      Lynn shuts the door and it feels like a slap.

      Norah sinks down onto the couch. Just Norah now. The
      emptiness crowds around her.

      The baby shower invitation looms large on the makeup table.

      Rose wears a slip and unusually big hair. She grabs several
      outfits from her closet. Oscar watches.

                          ROSE
                The blue or the flowery?

                             ROSE
                Good call.

      Rose slips on the dress and sits to apply mascara. Oscar
      shuffles out of the bedroom.

      Rose's cell phone rings. She picks up the phone while

                   busy in Santa Fe today. Thought I'd
                   give you all a call.

      Rose knocks over a bottle of nail polish remover as she grabs
      a pen and writes down the info.

                             ROSE
                   Great. No problem.

      Rose hangs up.

                             ROSE
                   Shit, shit, shit.

      Rose pulls on some panty hose and wrestles with her shoes.

                             ROSE
                   Honey, call grampa.

                 It's an insurance company. They

       She fumbles for her keys to unlock the door and is hit with a
       horrible familiar smell. Oscar pinches his nose.

      Rose walks briskly through the house. Urgency mounts with
      each step.

                          ROSE
                Dad! Daddy!

      Rose throws the bathroom door open in a panic.

      Joe scoops rotten shrimp from the bathtub with an empty fancy
      corn canister and dumps them into a garbage can.

      Rose recoils at the intense smell.

      Sweat drips down Joe's face. He continues his labor and
      avoids looking at Rose.

                Those snotty restaurant fucks

                   Bastards completely shut me out.
                   They got their own little cartel.
                   Little restaurant mafia. I bet they
                   screwed with my car too. I wouldn't
                   put it past `em. Bunch of shady
                   mother fuckers.

      Rose leans against the door and watches her father. A wet
      slap punctuates each new deposit into the garbage.

                             ROSE
                   I need you to watch Oscar.

      Another load of slimy shrimp smacks the garbage.

                              JOE
                   I can't.

                             ROSE
                   What do you mean you can't?

                             JOE
                   I can't watch Oscar today Rose.

                             ROSE
                   I'm in a real bind here.

                             JOE
                   Yeah, well it's hard, isn't it?

      Rose and Oscar get out of the Sentra and march toward the
      store.

      Winston sees Rose and Oscar through the window and returns
      his attention to the model plane before him.

      Rose and Oscar enter.

                             WINSTON
                   You look nice.

      Winston finishes gluing the piece and looks up.

                          ROSE
                I was wondering if Oscar could hang
                out here for a little while.

      Winston looks nervous. He looks at Oscar.

                          ROSE
                I've got this baby shower to go to
                and Norah's working a job and my
                dad's incapacitated... Do you mind?

                          WINSTON
                I guess not.

                          ROSE
                You're a lifesaver.

                          WINSTON
                You did your hair different.

                          ROSE
                You like it?

      Winston nods.

                          ROSE
                All right. Be good. I'll pick him
                up in a few hours when I'm done.

      Rose leaves. Oscar and Winston are left on their own. Winston
      forces a smile. Oscar does not reciprocate. Winston turns and
      walks to the back room.


139   INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - BACK ROOM - DAY                     139

      Winston glues a tiny piece to the model plane. Oscar inches
      his way over.

                          OSCAR
                What's that?

                          WINSTON
                This is a World War Two Mitchell
                Cannon Nose Bomber.

      Oscar leans in closer to examine all the tiny pieces.

                          OSCAR
                You make all these models?

      Winston nods and points to a teeny plastic strut.

                              WINSTON
                    Dab the end of that in the glue.
                    Just a little bit.

       Oscar carefully dabs the plastic piece in the puddle of glue
       and hands it to Winston.

                              OSCAR
                    What's that piece for?

                              WINSTON
                    It's a strut.

       With delicate precision, Winston attaches the piece.

                              OSCAR
                    What's a strut?

                              WINSTON
                    Supports the wing.

       Oscar examines one of the many completed models.

                              OSCAR
                    Seems like it'd be hard to build
                    models with just one hand.

                              WINSTON
                    It is.

       Rose pulls the Nissan in. She checks her lipstick in the
       rearview mirror before getting out and heading to the door.


141    EXT. LAUGHING BUDDHA HOUSE - AFTERNOON                               141

       Norah pulls supplies from the van and lugs them to the house.

       Norah grabs a bottle of OJ from the fridge, checks the
       expiration and takes a slug. Cat bowls sit in the corner.



                                                                 (CONTINUED)

      Norah examines a snapshot on the fridge. A chubby middle-aged
      woman surrounded by cats. The woman is bald and smiling.

      Norah spots some incense. She holds a stick to her nose.


143   INT. LAUGHING BUDDHA HOUSE - BEDROOM - AFTERNOON                143

      Norah lights the incense stick and sets it on the dresser
      next to a little statue of the laughing Buddha. A collection
      of cat whiskers sits in the Buddha's lap.

      Evidence of death soils the bed. Books crowd the night stand.
      Living with Breast Cancer, Foods That Fight Cancer, and
      Coming to Terms With Death.

      Norah rolls out plastic sheeting and prepares the room.


144   INT. DATZMAN-MEAD HOUSE - GREAT ROOM - AFTERNOON                   144

      The room titters with wannabe country clubbers. They nibble
      appetizers around a pastel tower of gifts.

      Rose lifts a cheese puff to her mouth. She's flanked by Paula
      and a MOUSEY WOMAN in a pink dress and matching pink pumps.

                             MOUSEY
                   So Rose, what are you doing? Are
                   you still cleaning houses?

                             PAULA
                   Rose has gone into real estate.

                             MOUSEY
                   Really?

                             ROSE
                   Actually, I own my own business.

                             MOUSEY
                   A real estate business?

                             ROSE
                   No. It's a biohazard removal and
                   crime scene clean up service. It's
                   a growth niche industry right now ­
                   highly technical and competitive.

                             MOUSEY
                   What does that mean ­ biohazard
                   removal whatever?

                             ROSE
                   A lot of times, when somebody dies,
                   it can be kind of, you know, messy.
                   So, we go in and clean up all that
                   left over mess. Make sure that the
                   area is clean and sanitary.

      Paula and Mousy exchange a glance infused with disgust.

                             ROSE
                   People just don't understand the

                   Course, we have a whole arsenal of
                   disinfectants and um... professional
                   techniques. Like I said, it's a

                   operation with a whole complicated,
                   you know... methodology behind it.

      Pleased with herself, Rose grabs another cheese puff.

                   Real growth industry.

                             MOUSEY

                                ROSE
                   Yeah.

      Rose stops. She hadn't thought about whether she liked it.

                             ROSE
                   I do. We come into the lives of
                   people who have just experienced
                   something so sad and profound.
                   They've lost somebody. The
                   circumstances are different but
                   that's the same.

      As Rose talks, her whole demeanor changes. Relaxes. That
      brittle, self conscious edge dissipates.

                             ROSE
                   And we help them. In this one small
                   way... we help.

      Rose is lost in her thoughts. Something profound is shifting.

                             MOUSEY
                   Sounds horrible to me.

      Norah stuffs bedding in biohazard bags and wraps the mattress
      in plastic sheeting. A fan clanks at the window.

      Norah struggles to get the wrapped mattress though the door.
      It tips and Norah bangs her hand against the door frame.

                                NORAH
                   Shit.

      The incense falls from the dresser. Norah finally muscles the
      mattress through the doorway.


146   EXT. LAUGHING BUDDHA HOUSE - AFTERNOON                               146

      Norah drags the mattress to the driveway. A wisp of smoke
      curls from the window behind her.

      As Norah rubs her injured hand, she hears the teeniest MEOW
      rise from the bushes. She investigates.

      A little orange fluff ball at the base of some box hedges
      looks up with big startled eyes. Norah smiles.

                             NORAH
                   Oh my God, you're the cutest thing
                   ever. Did you get left behind?

      The kitten answers with a pitiful raspy sound that passes for
      a meow. Norah is powerless to resist.

                                NORAH
                   It's okay.

      As Norah leans down to pick up the kitten, it darts from the
      bushes and heads toward the road.

                             NORAH
                   No, no, no.

      Norah chases the frightened kitty across the street and
      disappears behind a house.

      After a moment, Norah emerges from behind the house. She coos
      at the small kitten cradled in her arms, then looks up. An
      expression of horror and disbelief sweep over her.

      Norah runs toward the house.

                   Okay, ladies. For our first game
                   we've taken five different kinds of
                   candy bars and melted them in these
                   diapers.

      Somewhere a cell phone rings. The peppy woman stops and looks
      at Rose. Rose digs into her purse and pulls out the offending
      phone. She checks caller ID. It's Norah. She cuts it off.

                             ROSE
                   Sorry.

      Rose forces a smile at Peppy who motions for someone to start
      distributing the diapers.

                             PEPPY
                   You can look, smell and taste. The
                   first to identify all five
                   correctly wins!

                   important to us so...

                             NORAH
                   FUCK!

      Norah snaps the phone shut and continues slapping back the
      flames.


149   INT. DATZMAN-MEAD HOUSE - GREAT ROOM - AFTERNOON                  149

      Rose watches with a detached expression as Floral clad women
      stick their noses in the brown goo of the diapers.

      It hits Rose that she does not belong here. And for the first
      time, she does not want to belong here. She turns to Paula.

                             ROSE
                   You know what? I... uh...Actually,
                   there's somewhere I need to be.

                             PAULA
                   Oh nooo! You can't leave now. We're
                   just starting the games.

                             ROSE
                   Yeah. Well...
                       (smiles and nods)
                   Yeah.

      Rose stands and weaves her way through the throng of Stepford
      moms. Relief sweeps across her face as she nears the door.


150   INT. ROSE'S CAR - EVENING                                         150

      Rose drives as the sun sinks into the desert landscape.


151   EXT. LAUGHING BUDDHA HOUSE - NIGHT                                151

      Rose pulls up near the fire trucks and still smoldering
      house. Rose steps from the car with an expression of horror.

      Fear grips her as she scans the area for her sister. Then she
      sees Norah, sitting in the van across the street. Headphones
      on. Kitten curled up in her lap.

      Rose marches over but Norah doesn't notice her until she raps
      on the window. Norah pulls off her headphones, opens the door
      and slides out of the van.

                             NORAH
                   It was an accident.

      Rose's mouth slackens as her mind stumbles over the probable
      consequences of the scene before her.

                             ROSE
                   Oh my God, what have you done?

                             NORAH
                   It was an accident.

                             ROSE
                   How does this happen? Huh? How do
                   you burn down a house, Norah? Jesus
                   fucking Christ!

                             NORAH
                   Jesus Rose, Calm down.

      Rose throws her keys at Norah.

      Norah turns to shield the kitten. The keys thump her arm.
      Norah eyes her sister. So that's how it's gonna be.

                             NORAH
                   Well, if you had been here to help
                   me but no, you're off desperately
                   trying to impress stupid high
                   school people who don't even
                   matter. Prove to your old
                   cheerleading squad that you're not
                   this huge loser. If you had been
                   here doing your job it wouldn't
                   have happened. So don't try to put
                   all this on me.

      Norah's denial of responsibility knocks the wind from Rose.

                             ROSE
                   This is on you. You did this. You
                   set a fucking house on fire! You.

                             NORAH
                   Oh, go ahead and play the martyr.
                   It's like your favorite thing.

                             ROSE
                   I can't believe I was so stupid to
                   think that you could handle a
                   little bit of responsibility.

                               NORAH
                   I am   so sick of all your holier
                   than   thou bullshit. Why don't you
                   take   a look at you're own life,
                   huh?   You're a real inspiration.

                             ROSE
                   Well maybe if I didn't have to take
                   care of everybody in this family.

                Fuck you. I'm done being your
                excuse.

      Norah, filthy with soot, turns and walks away from Rose, the
      fire and everything. The kitten clings to her shirt.

                          ROSE
                Oh that's great. Turn everything to
                shit and then walk away.

      Without turning or breaking her stride, Norah flips off Rose.

      Rose leans down and picks up her keys, then turns and watches
      the firemen hose down the house.


152   EXT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - NIGHT                                 152

      Rose, looking worse for wear, tries to open the door but the
      store is closed and the door is locked.

                           ROSE
                Great.

      She bangs on the glass doors.


153   INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - NIGHT                                 153

      Winston walks from the back room and opens the door.

                          WINSTON
                Long baby shower.

                          ROSE
                I'm sorry, I... everything's
                horrible.

      Rose is about to break.

                          WINSTON
                Oscar's asleep in back.

                          ROSE
                Norah's ruined everything. She
                burnt down a house. A client's
                house.

                                WINSTON
                   Yeah.

                                ROSE
                   You know?

                             WINSTON
                   Carl told me.

                             ROSE
                   How does he...?

      Realization slaps.

                             ROSE
                   That's just great. We burnt down a
                   client's house. How do you get
                   around that?

                                WINSTON
                   Insurance?

      Rose shrugs.

                             ROSE
                   I figured we'd wait and get the
                   better rate once I got certified.

                             WINSTON
                   Didn't you go to that?

      Rose doesn't respond. She slowly blinks and lets her new
      reality ooze over her.

                             ROSE
                   There's not a lot I'm really good
                   at, you know.

      Winston looks at Rose.




                                                                  (CONTINUED)

                          ROSE
                Really. I'm good at getting guys to
                want me. Not date or marry me. But
                want me. I've always been good at
                that.

      Winston looks away.

                          ROSE
                And cheering. I was pretty good at
                that too.

                          WINSTON
                Cheering is good.

                          ROSE
                Yeah. Not as marketable as you'd
                think.

      Winston smiles.


154   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                             154

      Smoke slinks from a cigarette on the makeshift ashtray.

      Rose looks up to see Oscar in his PJs, one arm tucked in his
      shirt, the sleeve dangling empty. Rose musters a smile.

                          ROSE
                You brush your teeth?

      Oscar nods, kisses her good night. Rose watches him walk to
      his room and takes a drag from her cigarette.

      There's a knock at the door.


155   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                         155

      Rose looks through the peep hole and sees Mac fidgeting
      outside. She takes a step from the door and freezes.

      Mac knocks again.


156   EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                       156

      Mac looks at the unresponsive door with irritation. He shifts
      his weight and jangles some change in his pocket.

157   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                             157

      Rose leans against the wall with eyes closed.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                   Rose?

      She takes a breath, opens her eyes, then opens the door.

                             MAC
                   Hey beautiful.

      Mac smiles for the both of them.

                             MAC
                   I was starting to think you were on
                   a date or something.

      Rose looks at him like he's speaking a foreign language.

                               MAC
                   You okay?

      Rose nods.

                               ROSE
                   Long day.

                             MAC
                   Can I come in?

                             ROSE
                   It's not really a good time.

      Mac sags a bit. Then rallies. Flexes an eyebrow.

                             MAC
                   I got you something.

      Mac pulls a small gold box from his pocket and presents it to
      Rose. The top is engraved with her initials.

                             MAC
                   It's for your business cards. You
                   put `em in there and, I don't
                   know... impress people.

      He laughs at the silliness of the whole concept.

                             ROSE
                   It's beautiful.

      Rose stares at the small shiny box. It seems to make her sad.

                             MAC
                   You don't like it?

                             ROSE
                   No, I like it very much.

      Rose looks up and Mac senses something bad is coming his way.

                             ROSE
                   It's just this thing we're doing.

                             MAC
                   Come on, let's not do that.

      But Rose is resolute. She looks Mac in the eye.

                             ROSE
                   I don't want this anymore.

      Disbelief gives way to the unpleasant understanding.

                             MAC
                   So that's it?

      Rose gives an almost imperceptible nod. Mac tries hard to
      ignore the rising slurry of hurt and anger.

                             MAC
                   That's it then.

      Mac hesitates, hoping for a last minute reprieve. Finally, he
      nods and Rose watches him walk away.


158   INT. ALBUQUERQUE BLOOD SERVICES ­ ONE WEEK LATER - DAY            158

      Norah steps off the elevator. People in white coats walk past
      her, bump into her. Norah spots Lynn.

      Lynn sees Norah and looks away.

                   I need to talk to Lynn.

      Lynn approaches.

                             LYNN
                   She can't donate. You can't donate.

      She points to a sign indicating how often people can donate.

                             LYNN
                   Forty-eight days. It's not been
                   forty-eight days.

                             NORAH
                   Why are you acting like this? Why
                   haven't you called me back.

                             LYNN
                   Listen, I just, don't think you're
                   the kind of person I need to be
                   hanging out with right now.

                             NORAH
                   What's that supposed to mean?

                             LYNN
                   Do I really need to spell it out?

      Norah stands stunned. Sad. Blank. She pulls the packet of
      photos out of her bag and holds them out to Lynn.

                             NORAH
                   Here.

      Lynn takes the packet. As she walks back to the reclining
      blood donors she tosses the photos in a trash can.

      A smiling Korean woman gives Norah a cup of juice and puts an
      `I gave blood today' sticker on her chest.


159   EXT. TINGLEY PARK- DAY                                            159

      Joe sits on a bench near the pond with his feet propped up on
      a canister of Fancy Corn. He reaches into the open canister
      next to him and pulls out a handful of gourmet corn.

      A few pieces land in his mouth, the remainder he tosses to a
      flotilla of ducks. Joe smiles as the greedy little bastards
      squabble over his offering.

160   EXT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - DAY                                160

      Rose and Oscar struggle to unload the super wet-vac from the
      van. Other equipment litters pavement around the van.

      Winston records serial numbers onto a clipboard.

                          WINSTON
                I'm sure I can turn this stuff
                around pretty quick.

                          ROSE
                Thanks. For everything.

                          OSCAR
                Are you coming to my party?

      Awkward moment. Rose looks from Oscar to Winston.

                          ROSE
                We're going to Hinkle's Saturday
                for Oscar's birthday. It'd be great
                if you came.

                          WINSTON
                Sounds like a blast.

      Rose smiles at the sincere enthusiasm in Winston's voice.


161   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT                            161

      Rose steps out of the shower and wraps her hair in a towel.
      As she walks past the mirror she plucks off the affirmation
      note and tosses it in the trash.


162   INT. HINKLE'S RESTAURANT - A FEW DAYS LATER - DAY               162

      Rose, Oscar, Joe and Winston sit in a carnival like
      restaurant. Oscar opens a gift in the shape of a binocular
      case. He beams with anticipation.

      Oscar snaps open the case and pulls out the old familiar pair
      of binoculars. Rose looks disappointed. Oscar looks confused.

                          JOE
                That other pair we looked at, full
                of gadgets and gimmicks.

                             JOE (cont'd)
                   They just didn't have the heft you
                   want in a pair of lenses. No
                   weight. No history.

      Oscar nods. Joe points to the old binoculars.

                             JOE
                   These here are the real deal. I
                   want you to have them.

      Oscar smiles. Rose shakes her head. It's not like she didn't
      see this coming. But still.

                             ROSE
                   Dad, you promised him those others.
                   From the store. He's been talking
                   about it for weeks.

      Joe looks at Rose with new found confidence.

                             JOE
                   No Rose, I want to him to have
                   these.

      Winston eyes the binoculars.

                             WINSTON
                   Wow, is that an old Zeiss?

      Joe nods.

                             WINSTON
                   Porro prism?

      Joe nods full of pride.

                             JOE
                   Eight by thirty Jenoptems. No marks
                   on the objectives. Perfect bloom.

      Winston looks at Oscar.

                             WINSTON
                   You got yourself some classic
                   binoculars there.

      Norah walks in.

                             NORAH
                   Sorry I'm late.

      Norah noogies Oscar and drops a gift in front of him.

      Norah kisses Joe on the cheek and ignores Rose. Rose gets up.

                          JOE
                Where are you going?

      Rose walks to the bathroom.


163   INT. HINKLE'S RESTAURANT - LADIES ROOM - DAY                       163

      Rose splashes water on her face. Norah walks in and leans
      against the counter. Rose makes no sign of acknowledgement.

      Norah grabs some paper towel and holds it out for her sister.

                          NORAH
                Winston cleans up pretty good.

      Rose isn't biting. She doesn't even look at Norah. She leans
      past Norah and gets her own paper towel. Norah tries again.

                             NORAH
                   I read somewhere that beauty is
                   really all about symmetry. Like
                   having eyes the same size and all
                   that.
                       (pause)
                   So, you know, when you factor that
                   in he's like, hot.

      Rose won't play. She dabs her face and ignores Norah. Norah
      walks to the door, starts to leave, then turns around.

                             NORAH
                   Listen, I know I fucked up, okay?
                   Like really huge and I know that
                   and I'm sorry, okay?

      It's a bullshit apology. More defensive than sincere. Just
      the thing that pushes Rose's buttons.

                             ROSE
                   God, that drives me crazy! That
                   whole `Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just a
                   big fuck up' routine. Like that's a
                   legitimate excuse.

      Norah's defensiveness loosens its grip. She steps towards
      Rose. This is hard for her. Sincerity is not her strong suit.

                             NORAH
                   I really am sorry. But it really
                   isn't all my fault, Rose.

                             ROSE
                   I think there's something wrong
                   with you. The way your brain works.
                   I mean, what the hell? It's like
                   you can't be trusted with anything.
                   You just screw around all the time
                   like it's all a big fucking game.
                   It wasn't a game, Norah. We're not
                   all just here for your amusement.
                   You should have been paying
                   attention. You should have been
                   focused on the job.

      Rose finally hears herself. It's all the same old stuff. She
      grinds to a stop. She knows it wasn't all Norah's fault.

                What are you going to do now?

                          ROSE
                I got some ideas. I was thinking
                maybe we could--

      Norah shakes her head.

                          NORAH
                I've got my own ideas.

      Rose nods. As they exit, she turns to Norah.

                          ROSE
                So, you really think he's hot?

                          NORAH
                Winston? No.


164   INT. HINKLE'S RESTAURANT - DAY                                 164

      Rose and Norah return from the bathroom. Joe eyeballs the
      girls in silent appraisal of the situation. Seems okay.

                          NORAH
                You gonna open my present?

      Oscar opens the package of fake tattoos.

                          OSCAR
                Cool.

                          NORAH
                The guy said that if you're careful
                they'll last a whole month. And
                these aren't stupid kiddie unicorns
                and shit. They're all based on
                classic biker designs.

      Oscar picks up one of the tattoos.

                             ROSE
                   Cool.

      Oscar slips his arm out of his sleeve and inside his shirt
      and stares at Winston admiringly. Rose whispers in Oscar's
      ear and he pulls his arm back into his sleeve.

                             NORAH
                   I'm thinking of taking a road trip.

      Shrug.

                             NORAH
                   Haven't worked it all out yet. I

                   I'm selling the van.

                             ROSE
                   Have to. Can't afford the payment.

                   No, listen... just don't sell the
                   van.

      Rose forces a smile and examines her pizza. She can't watch
      her father cling to another impotent dream.

      he lifts the binoculars to his face.

                Rose tells me you make models.

      Rose sizes up her stack of unopened bills. She opens one,
      sighs, sets it aside. She moves on to the next one.

      The TV flickers blue light into the room. Rose stops and
      looks at the TV.

      Norah clicks on the TV and watches slack-jawed as a WAITRESS
      hands menus to two hard nosed detectives. One of the TV
      DETECITVES looks up and smiles.

169   EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                       169

      Rose walks toward the van with a trash bag that swishes with
      each step. She takes one last look, then peels the Sunshine
      Cleaning door magnet off and drops it into the trash bag.

      She crawls into the front seat and tosses empty pop cans and
      candy bar wrappers into the trash bag. A faint sound nags at
      her. She looks up to see the CB on.

      Soft white static fills the van. Rose sits a long moment
      before taking the handset.

                             ROSE
                   Hello? Mom?

      Rose stops and looks around self-consciously before resuming.

                             ROSE
                   Oscar turned eight today. We had
                   this whole big thing at Hinkle's.
                   Winston came. After dinner Oscar
                   and Norah got a high score on
                   Centipede and put in ASS as their
                   initials and got in trouble by the
                   manager.
                       (Pause)
                   I don't know if you're in heaven or
                   what. But you're not here and
                   that's too bad for you `cuz you've
                   missed out. You've missed out on
                   some really great stuff.

170   EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - TWO MONTHS LATER - DAY                      170

      Rose pulls up in her Sentra. The Molly Maid magnet is back on
      the door and she's in her Molly Maid uniform. She gets out
      and sees Joe sitting on the steps to her house.

                          ROSE
                Dad?

                          JOE
                There's something I wanted to talk
                to you about.

      Rose pulls a vacuum cleaner from her car.

                          ROSE
                Okay.

                          JOE
                Well, I was wondering if I could
                move in with you and Oscar.

                          ROSE
                What?

                          JOE
                Just temporarily - until I find a
                place.

                          ROSE
                You lost the house. Oh my god, you
                lost the house. Dad how could you
                lose the house?

                          JOE
                I didn't lose the house. I sold the
                house. There's this business
                opportunity--

                          ROSE
                Not shrimp I hope.

                             JOE
                   It's not just some get rich quick
                   scheme. And I got a partner who has
                   experience. I'd learn from her.

      Rose's edge softens slightly. She's listening now. Joe points
      to where the newly painted Econo van is parked.

      In bold cursive: LORKOWSKI CLEANING. Underneath in smaller
      letters: SPECIALIZING IN BIOHAZARD REMOVAL SINCE 1963.

                             ROSE
                   Nineteen sixty-three?

                             JOE
                   Don't make a big deal out of it.

                                ROSE
                   Dad.

                             JOE
                   It's a business lie, not a real
                   lie.

                             ROSE
                   I can live with that.

                             JOE
                   And you'd be the boss.

                                ROSE
                   Thank you.


171   EXT. OPEN ROAD - MONTE CARLO - DAY                                  171

      With windows down, Norah drives across an open landscape. She
      glances at a wind battered map. A highlighted route cuts
      across the country. Destination - California.

      Norah bobs her head to the radio, sucks on a slurpee. She
      holds her arm out the window and lets her hand surf the wind.


172   OMITTED                                                             172


173   EXT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL - SCHOOL YARD - DAY                            173

      Oscar, in a Catholic school uniform, holds binoculars to his
      face. He watches a scrawny girl across the school yard.


                                                               (CONTINUED)

      The girl ties a strand of hair to her pigtail then loops the
      invisible strand over a pencil. She glances over to Oscar.
      Oscar doesn't flinch.

      With school girl slight of hand, the pigtail rises and falls.
      It is a magical, flirtatious pigtail greeting.

      Oscar lowers the binoculars and pulls his sleeve up to reveal
      the Lil' Bastard tattoo. The girl smiles. Oscar smiles.


174   INT. GORILLA FOUNDATION - ONE MONTH LATER - DAY                 174

      Norah walks down a corridor. The kitten clings to her. She
      turns the corner and walks though a set of doors to what
      looks to be a play room.

      Blocks and brightly colored plastic toys litter the ground.
      Sitting in the middle of the play area is an enormous black
      gorilla. KOKO. She turns her massive head and looks at Norah.

                             KOKO
                       (captions)
                   I have a tooth ache.

      KoKo responds with thick hands.

                             NORAH
                       (captions)
                   Me too.

      Norah smiles.


175   EXT. ALBUQUERQUE - DAY                                          175

      The Lorkowski Cleaning van merges on the freeway interchange
      and spirals up the tangle of rust and turquoise ramps.



                                                         FADE OUT.
