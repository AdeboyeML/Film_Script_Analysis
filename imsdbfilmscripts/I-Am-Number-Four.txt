          sleeping jungle. A fingernail moon silvers the whispering
          canopy while gentle tendrils of steam rise.

          EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

          CAMERA DRIFTS ACROSS the eternity of treetops until it FINDS

          A BUNGALOW.
          It's 20x20 square, with a wraparound porch and simple wooden
          shutters. The structure is hidden in a clearing that's been
          crudely hacked out of the sweaty wilderness.

          INT. HUT - NIGHT

          Two beds draped in mosquito nets sit on opposite sides of the
          space. A TEEN BOY sleeps in one and a MIDDLE-AGED MAN lies
          in the other. Their ebony skin glistens in the swampy heat.
          The numbing THROB OF INSECTS fills the silence until

          THE DOOR SOFTLY RATTLES.
          The Teen's eyes fly open. Fear grips his face as he looks
          over at the Man, who is now upright and awake. They hold
          their breath, listening over the DRUMMING CHORUS.

          ANOTHER RATTLE.
          It's louder this time. Unmistakable. The Teen watches as
          the Man pulls a crystal-handled dagger from under his pillow
          and stealthily creeps to the door. The Man cautiously leans
          in and peers through the bamboo slats.
          WHAT HE SEES: The empty porch. No sign of life.
          Relieved, he turns back, opens his mouth to speak when his
          face contorts. He looks down and sees the tip of

          A SERRATED METAL BLADE
          protruding from his chest. As the sword is viciously
          protracted through the door, the Man meets the Teen's haunted
          eyes and whispers his last, desperate word...

          EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

          The Teen's naked feet pound the hot, wet earth as he sprints
          through the maze of trees. Flecks of moonlight ricochet off
          the crystal pendant that dangles around his neck. He moves
          impossibly fast. Faster than any human could.

          A MONSTROUS HOWL
          ECHOES as something otherworldly catches his scent and begins
          thrashing in pursuit. The Teen's face tightens with dread
          and the SHOUTS of his pursuers hammer his ears.
          He doesn't look back, willing himself to survive. He races
          up a verge and fearlessly launches himself off the edge of

          A 100-FOOT-WIDE RAVINE!
          GOD SHOT LOOKING DOWN as the Teen leaps across the abyss. He
          kicks air as he arcs and finally touches down on the opposite
          lip. Chest heaving, he sees the hideous silhouette of

          A HULKING BEAST.
          It's called a Piken and skitters to a stop on the other side.
          It utters a chilling BANSHEE WAIL of frustration. Relieved,
          the Teen turns to make his escape when

                         A HAND
          wraps around his throat. He is effortlessly hoisted by a
          TOWERING MAN with skin as cold and pale as alabaster.

          THIS IS A MOGADORIAN.
          He wears the long red coat of a Commander. We catch the
          briefest glimpse of his cruel magenta eyes as they scan the
          geometric symbol engraved on the Teen's pendant. Silhouetted
          against the giant jungle moon, he triumphantly raises

          A SWORD.
          Its serrated blade ignites with silver flame as it sweeps
          towards the Teen. The boy's DEATH CRY echoes as the CAMERA
          ZEROES IN ON the pendant that glows brilliant-bright.

          FORM CUT TO:

          THE SAME SYMBOL.
          It glimmers to life on the ankle of another TEEN 10,000 miles
          away. His name's DANIEL and he's in the middle of a wild jet-
          ski race with TWO BUDDIES.

          3.
          The trio crisscrosses the turquoise sea while a party rages
          on the beach.
          Daniel makes a kamikaze move, whips his jet ski past his
          opponents and victoriously pumps his fist. But his moment of
          triumph is cut short. His face contorts in agony as he feels

                         THE SYMBOL
          searing into his skin. As he leans forward to grip his
          ankle, he cartwheels off the jet ski and viciously body-slams
          across the water.

          EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

          LOOKING UP as Daniel crashes into view. Needles of light
          flicker from the symbol. It's cauterizing into his flesh
          like a brand.

          EXT. BEACH - DAY

          Daniel stumbles through the surf and collapses onto the sand,
          clutching his ankle. He rolls onto his side as a CROWD OF
          PARTYING TEENS gathers. A BLONDE GIRL leans down to help.

                         BLONDE GIRL
          Daniel, what's wrong? Did you
          break your ankle?
          But as she turns him over, she sees the light leaking from
          between his fingers and reels back.

                         BLONDE GIRL
          Oh my God.
          He stares up into the crowd's fearful faces, then staggers to
          his feet and takes off running.

          EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY

          The busy road runs parallel to an expanse of ancient pines.
          Through the trees, we CATCH THE SHUTTER IMAGE of a figure
          outrunning the hurtling vehicles.

          EXT. COASTAL FOREST - DAY

          Trees whip past as Daniel sprints down a sandy track. The
          pendant that knocks against his chest was carved by the same
          hand as the African Teen's, but the symbol is unique. He
          peels off to the right and bursts out onto a long drive.

          A STILT HOUSE
          sits at the end. It's cake-frosting pink and is built right
          on the edge of a coral-white beach.

          The door flies open and Daniel stands on the threshold.
          HENRI looks up from his bank of laptops that scroll with news
          feeds. He is decades older than his suntanned face betrays
          and you'd be way off if you guessed his accent was French.

                         DANIEL
          Number 3 is dead.
          Henri's eyes narrow with urgency. He is immediately on his
          feet, he kneels at Daniel's side and studies the symbol on
          the teen's ankle. It has stopped glowing but is painfully
          raw. Directly below this fresh wound are

          TWO OTHER GEOMETRIC BRANDS.
          They are the same size, but each symbol is subtly different.
          Time has transformed them into raised, snake-smooth scars.
          Henri's penetrating eyes look up at the shell-shocked teen.

                         HENRI
          Did anybody else see this?
          OFF Daniel's panicked nod...

                         A GECKO
          skitters across the ceiling, its glossy black eyes watch as
          Daniel frantically stuffs his clothes into a duffel bag. The
          walls are bare. No photos, no posters, no personality.
          Henri enters, holding a crate of computer cables.

          TIGHT ON A BOX. It's exquisitely carved and inlaid with an
          intricate geometric design.
          Henri carefully hides it under the driver's seat of an old
          Jeep Wagoneer. It's the kind with wooden trim. He looks at
          Daniel who feeds homework assignments into a roaring FIRE.

                         HENRI
          Time to go.

          Daniel clicks the SIM card from his cell phone, snaps it in
          two and drops it into the fire. Bitter, he takes one last
          look at the glittering azure sea, then climbs into the Jeep.
          As the engine HUMS to life, CAMERA FOLLOWS

          THE GECKO.
          It darts up the fender, squeezes into the jamb of the trunk,
          and Houdinis into the vehicle with a flick of its tail.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. CAUSEWAY - DUSK

          The Jeep powers across the long elevated bridge. The dying
          sun tints the clouds and the sky in violent apocalyptic hues.

          DANIEL (V.O.)
          This is the part I hate the most.
          The running. But it's the only
          thing in my life that's real. The
          rest is a lie. My name. My
          birthday. Even Henri. People
          think he's my father. He's not.
          His job is to keep me alive.

          INT. JEEP - NIGHT - MOVING

          Henri's eyes scan the rear view, on constant vigil. The
          speedometer never brushes past 60. Daniel has his head
          against the window, brooding, listening to an iPod.

          DANIEL (V.O.)
          We are hiding from the Mogadorians.
          A brutal race that wiped out our
          entire planet, Lorien.

          EXT. USED-CAR LOT - DAY

          Plastic flags whip overhead. Daniel leans against a silver
          SUV and watches Henri negotiate with the DEALER.

          DANIEL (V.O.)
          Only nine children escaped the
          genocide. We were each given a
          number and sent here to hide. I
          don't know where the others are. I
          only know when one of them is
          murdered.

          INT. BATHROOM - MOTEL - NIGHT

          Daniel sits on the edge of a bathtub. He gently unwraps the
          bandage that covers his ankle and fearfully inspects the neat
          scab that has formed over the wound.

          DANIEL (V.O.)
          I got the first scar when I was
          eight. I woke up screaming. We
          lived in Vermont. The second was
          on a Tilt-a-Whirl at a fair in
          Michigan. I was 12. Yesterday was
          the third.
          His finger traces the lines of the other two scars.

          EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY

          The lush tropical landscape has browned into flat, dormant
          farmland. The silver SUV charges through the bleak monotony.

          DANIEL (V.O.)
          Because of the spell our Elders
          cast, the Mogs can only kill us in
          order. That's the reason I've
          survived this long. But our enemy
          is relentless.

          INT. SUV - NIGHT - MOVING

          Daniel is asleep with his earphones on. Henri glances over,
          his mask of certainty momentarily slips. He looks like a
          soldier heading into a battle he knows cannot be won.

          DANIEL (V.O.)
          Now their hunt has turned to me. I

          Daniel sullenly stares at a stack of untouched pancakes.
          Henri slides into the booth, all business.

                         HENRI
          Florida's clear. I sent a letter
          to the school and there's nothing

                         DANIEL
          Just when I think you can't get any
          less original, you lower the bar.

                         HENRI
          I'm not interested in originality.
          I'm interested in untraceable.
          There are 335,321 John Smiths in
          the United States.
          (Note: from this point on, Daniel will be called John.)
          John looks at him, then abruptly gets up and storms away.
          Henri drops $20 on the table and calmly heads after him.

          INT. ARCADE - REST STOP - NIGHT

          A row of ancient arcade games blinks. John angrily stabs the
          buttons of a Space Invaders machine as Henri approaches.
          They are alone. John's eyes never leave the video screen.

                         JOHN
          It's been so long since the last
          scar.

                         HENRI
          You got lulled into a false sense
          of security. That's my fault.
          John struggles to keep his temper in check.

                         JOHN
          I liked Florida. I liked having
          friends. I liked feeling normal.
          Henri's face softens with paternal compassion.

                         HENRI
          I wish that you could have a normal
          life -- but you can't.
          Only now does John turn and face him. His eyes blaze with
          frustration.

                         JOHN
          Then why fake it? Why not just go
          hole up in the wilderness.

                         HENRI
          That's exactly what Number 3 did.

          John looks at him, confused. Henri pulls up an article on
          his iPhone and hands it to John.

                         HENRI
          It's from an African news site. A
          man and his son went missing two
          nights ago. The locals think they
          were taken by strange beasts.
          John understands the implication.

          Piken.

                         HENRI
          The Mogadorians are natural-born
          hunters. Blending in is our best
          protection.

                         JOHN
          So we just keep moving from town to
          town?

                         HENRI
          Until I say otherwise -- yes.
          John waits as a TRUCKER passes through the room. His voice
          softens but never loses its intensity.

                         JOHN
          I want to be from someplace, Henri.

          You are.

          Lorien's your home, I don't even
          remember it.
          John's tone rubs Henri the wrong way.

                         HENRI
          Like it or not, it's your home too.
          You have a responsibility to those
          who died.

          INT. SUV - NIGHT

          Henri and John climb in.

                         JOHN
          I want a say in where we live.

          Cheer up, you're going to be living
          in Paradise.

                         CUT TO:
          A frigid sheet of RAIN POUNDS the sign that's planted on the
          side of this narrow stretch of rural blacktop:

          âWELCOME TO PARADISE, OHIO. POP. 5,243â
          The silver SUV streaks past, its wipers working overtime. It
          kicks up a spray as it speeds down Main Street. The dinky
          storefronts are garishly decorated for Halloween.

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          The leaves are washed in a thousand shades of gold. The SUV
          barrels along the drive that twists through the woods.

          INT. SUV - DAY - DRIVING

          Henri pulls up in front of a small house. It sits by itself,
          surrounded by trees. Water sluices off the weather-worn
          garage in the yard behind it. A WOMAN steps out of a minivan
          to greet them.

                         JOHN
          She looks even perkier than the
          realtor in Florida.
          A warm smile graces her round face and she's clutching a
          fruit basket. For the record, she is called ANNIE.

          Henri nods and smiles wryly.

          INT. HOUSE - DAY

          The front door swings open and Annie proudly escorts Henri
          and John inside.

                         ANNIE
          Here we are. Home sweet home.
          They scan the faded interior. The place is in desperate need
          of a makeover. A grandfather clock pensively TICKS at the
          end of the hall. Annie remains relentlessly optimistic.

                         ANNIE
          First impressions?

                         HENRI
          It's perfect.
          Annie places the fruit basket on the dining table and begins
          turning on the lights.

                         JOHN
          That's one word for it.
          Stewing, John exits into the hall with his duffel bag. Annie
          reads the strained dynamic.

                         ANNIE
          I feel your pain. I have a
          daughter his age. Apparently, I
          ruin her life on a daily basis.
          John steps back in, holding a sun-faded poster featuring NFL
          great Bernie Kosar.

                         JOHN
          This guy was covering a hole in my

          Annie's cheeks blush with annoyance.

          I told the handyman to patch that

          Don't you worry about it.
          She nods, grateful.

          We'll knock it off the rent. Keep

          good luck here in the Buckeye

          The rain has stopped. The wind RUSTLES the trees. John
          lifts out the last box. As he closes the trunk, he doesn't
          notice the hitchhiking gecko hotfoot it out.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT

          Henri is busy setting up his computer station. John dumps
          the box on the floor.

                         JOHN
          That's the last of them. I'm
          hitting the sack.

                         HENRI

          John crosses and stands against the wall.

                         HENRI
          Say Paradise.
          John gives him a withering look. Henri flashes off a shot.
          The camera is cabled to one of the laptops.
          TIGHT ON LAPTOP: The image of John pixelates onto a digital
          grid and a face-recognition program begins to map his facial
          structure.

          If there's a story or picture of
          you on the internet, this program
          will find it. Our enemy doesn't
          know who you are -- I want to keep
          it that way.
          John nods, knows he's being a jerk.

          Sand Dollar Beach, that's where we
          were jet skiing.
          Henri types it in when something SCRATCHES at the door.
          Their heads instantly turn towards the sound. Tense SILENCE.
          SLOW PUSH IN ON THE DOOR as another SCRATCH echoes.
          Henri is on his feet. He flicks off the lights and silently
          signals John to retreat down the hall. With the cool air of
          an assassin, Henri unzips a duffel bag and pulls out a sleek
          crystal-handled dagger. As he steps to the door...

          INT. CLOSET - JOHN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          ... John crouches in the dark, clutching a baseball bat.
          Suddenly, the light in the bedroom buzzes back on. He holds
          his breath as the door swings open. He looks up and is
          relieved to see Henri.

                         HENRI
          I found our intruder -- he's a

          At that moment,

          a bad thing.

          the dog's head.

          What are you going to call him?

          INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - MORNING

          John enters, dressed in black, ready for his first day of
          school. He dumps his backpack on a chair. Henri places a
          plate with an omelette and perfectly browned hash browns in
          front of him.

                         JOHN
          Wow. You outdid yourself. What's
          up?
          Henri lifts a red backpack into view. John stares at it.

                         JOHN
          I already have a backpack.

                         HENRI
          This one has five days of rations,
          spare clothes, cash and a handheld
          GPS. Keep it with you at all
          times.

          Game's changed. You're in the
          crosshairs now. You have to be
          ready to leave at a moment's
          notice. With or without me.
          John stares at the backpack, takes in this new reality. He
          pushes the plate away, snatches the backpack and heads out
          the door. Henri stares at the omelette, tastes a pinch of
          hash browns, then puts the plate on the floor on his way out.
          It takes Bernie 2.5 seconds to race over and start to eat.

          away. John slides the red backpack onto his shoulder when he
          hears a FAMILIAR BARK. He turns and is surprised to find

          BERNIE KOSAR.
          The little dog is sitting by the flagpole wagging his white-
          tipped tail. John crosses to him, baffled.

          Bernie, what the hell... were you
          hiding in the car?

          SARAH HARTE.
          She's his age and is holding an old 35mm Nikon. There is
          something about her unforced beauty that is instantly
          enchanting. John shuffles, uncharacteristically nervous.

          He's really well-trained. How long

          My mom said she rented it to a guy
          with a son my age. Since I know
          every other face on this quad, that

                         JOHN

          As he heads away, Sarah watches, intrigued. CAMERA TRACKS TO
          REVEAL MARK JAYNE monitoring the encounter. He's the star
          quarterback and his chiselled jaw tenses with jealousy.

          INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

          Loaded with textbooks, John instinctively bows his head as he
          passes the black eye of a hall security camera and steps to a
          locker. He reaches for the combination lock when

                         A BACKPACK
          viciously sideswipes him. The textbooks scatter across the
          checkerboard linoleum. John sees the culprit is Mark Jayne,
          who offers him a taunting grin. John fights his urge to
          react and watches as Mark struts over to his POSSE OF JOCKS.

          Junior gym class jogs around the track. John hangs in the
          middle of the pack, with his hoodie up, blending in.
          They pass the GIRLS who are stretching on the pristine field.

          John steps onto the court and waits for the ball to come his
          way. He steals a glance and sees Sarah and Mark arguing. A
          blur of orange. John swings back and catches the ball.
          Just as he shoots, he's distracted by Sarah's upset voice.

          The curtains are drawn. Bernie Kosar dozes on the couch

          âpetalsâ fanned across the opposite side.

                         THE DISCS
          momentarily glow and a SHARP CLICK echoes from within. John
          and Henri pull their hands away and watch as the Box
          miraculously comes to life. Fissures of light sweep across
          the lines of inlaid stone, dividing the lid into sections
          that begin to twist and reform like high-tech origami.

          PUSH IN ON Bernie as he sits up and watches the Box unfold.
          Like an intricate jigsaw, the sections finally regroup,
          creating a new pattern on the lid. It's a familiar geometric
          symbol. John touches the crystal pendant that hangs from his
          neck -- the symbols are an exact match.

          sized crystal floats up from the Box. It slowly begins to
          spin and project

          That's what Lorien looked like
          thousands of years ago. We had all
          the problems that Earth has today.
          The planet was dying until our
          people made a collective decision
          to change and slowly Lorien began
          to heal itself -- that's when the
          Legacies started.
          John watches as the spinning planet transforms before his
          eyes. Its oceans turn a vibrant chroma-key blue and the land
          masses become a lush emerald green.

          them and face the Mogadorians

          Here's a tip. If you're going to
          lie, don't leave a big red backpack
          at the scene of the crime.
          She swings his backpack into view. John is mortified. He
          struggles to find a plausible answer and silently tries to
          quell the feeling welling in his chest.

          He watches as she angrily heads down the steps and climbs

          A RED INK PACK EXPLODES.
          It's the kind banks use to foil heists. In a shocking
          instant, Sam and the contents of his locker are splattered.
          It bears a gruesome resemblance to arterial spray.

          has his door halfway open and ducks back a second before the
          ink pack planted in his locker ERUPTS. The spray misses his
          face but violently spits across his chest and arms. LAUGHTER
          echoes behind them. John spins and finds Mark and his posse.

          Henri yanks Young John by the hand. They take off in one
          direction while John's grandfather heads off in the other.

          A MOGADORIAN TRANSPORT CRAFT
          suddenly swoops between them. The HOWLS of its occupants
          ricochet through the night. The heat from its engines washes
          the ground, warping the destruction like a ghastly mirage as
          two bay doors open. Young John looks back through the heat-
          haze and catches a impressionistic view as

                         TWO PIKEN
          leap out. Their reptilian bodies ripple with muscle and
          their oversize heads glint with raptor-like jaws. The Piken
          mercilessly rip into John's grandfather. Young John races to
          help, but Henri wrenches him back. CAMERA PUSHES IN TIGHT ON
          YOUNG JOHN'S FACE as he screams...

          He drops the crystal and stumbles back. The experience has
          left him traumatized. Henri steps towards him, but John is
          too overwhelmed and runs out.

          EXT. STREAM - WOODS - DAY

          A stone angrily SKIPS across the water. John is about to
          toss another when Bernie Kosar trots into view. He ruffles
          the dog's fur but doesn't turn when Henri steps out of the
          woods and crosses to his side.

                         JOHN
          I saw my grandfather. I saw what
          you did to the Mogadorians -- you
          saved my life.

                         HENRI
          A lot of Lorics sacrificed their

          He said I must survive.

                         HENRI
          The Elders had a plan. You weren't
          on that ship by chance. The nine
          of you were chosen for a reason.
          Even if only two of you live,
          together you'll pose a grave threat
          to our enemy.
          Consumed by bitterness, John hurls another stone.

                         JOHN
          You saw what they did to Lorien.
          How can nine or six or two of us
          take on that army? It's hopeless.
          Henri knows he has to pull him out of this mournful funk.

                         HENRI
          I never thought we'd get off Lorien
          alive -- but we did. I didn't know
          how we could survive on a strange
          planet -- but we have. I gave us
          six months before the Mogs found us
          -- it's been 10 years. Don't give
          up now.
          Henri grips John's shoulders.

                         HENRI
          You have the potential to do great
          things. Even if you don't see it --
          I do.

          How can you put so much faith in
          me?

                         HENRI
          Because your life is my life. If
          you quit, then everything I've
          worked for and sacrificed is
          meaningless.

          No... go.
          John looks at him, surprised by this paternal gesture.

          A Halloween parade drifts past the CROWDS packing the
          sidewalks. Icicle lights twinkle in the trees. EXCITED KIDS
          in costume zigzag past John. It's small-town Americana at
          its best. ET waddles by holding a JEDI's hand.

          A SLAP ON GLASS.
          John turns and is amused to find Sam standing among the
          mannequins in the display window of a sporting goods store.

          INT. ED'S SPORTING GOODS STORE - NIGHT

          An annoying CHIME plays as the door opens and John enters.
          The store is deserted. The stock needs to be updated and the
          shelves could use a dust. Sam approaches wearing an apron.

          He steps to the door and twists the closed sign into view.

          What about your stepdad?

                         SAM
          He hit the tavern at 6:00. He's
          already hammered by now. I'll
          probably find him passed out on the
          doorstep. Every night is trick âr

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          John and Sam wander past the parade floats lined up along the
          road bordering the woods. Stalls sell hot dogs and cotton
          candy. John subtly scans the crowd.

                         SAM
          She's over there.
          John follows Sam's gaze and finds Sarah taking shots of some
          KIDS dunking for apples. She pulls the camera from her eye,
          sees John and smiles as he approaches.

          get on tractor-pulled hay wagons. The wagons lurch through
          the mouth of a giant cutout devil and into the woods.

                         SARAH
          Give me a sec.
          She steps to the face-painting booth. It's sponsored by the
          local realtor who is Sarah's mom, Annie. Sarah hands Annie
          her camera. Sam whispers to John.

                         SAM
          I'm impressed.
          Before John can respond, Sarah steps back.

          other side.
          He gives John a not-so-subtle wink of encouragement. John
          and Sarah join the end of the line and watch Sam head away.

          Sarah?
          She doesn't answer. He hesitates a moment, then charges into
          the woods.

          Sam turns in the direction of JOHN'S VOICE. He's about to
          head towards it when

          TWO ZOMBIE JOCKS
          trudge into view. Sam darts behind a tree. Suddenly, the
          area is flooded with preternatural white light. He can hear
          the sounds of a SCUFFLE and one of the Jocks flies past and
          CRASHES in a heap while the other SCREAMS.

          JOCK (O.S.)
          You're blinding me! Stop!
          Sam cautiously sneaks a peek, shields his eyes with a hand.
          WHAT HE SEES: John pins the Jock to a tree and holds a
          luminous palm up to the lenses of the teen's goggles.

          A rocky promontory overlooks a crescent-shaped waterfall
          which drops into a swimming hole below. The Zombie Jocks
          carry Sarah into view and dump her in front of Mark. She's
          wild-cat angry when she sees him.

                         SARAH

          Mark nods the Zombie Jocks away.

          Don't walk away from me!
          Mark grabs her. Sarah wrenches free, but loses her balance
          and falls back on the ground. Mark's rage is transplanted by
          concern. He steps towards her to help when --

          Mark watches John step out. Blood trickles from a cut above

                         MARK
          I'm going to kill you!
          With lightning speed, John grabs Mark's arm, spins him,
          pinning him to a tree. Blinded by rage, John jerks Mark's
          arm up behind his back.

                         SARAH
          John! Stop!
          Mark is in real pain. Transfixed with anger, John keeps
          twisting. Sarah looks at him, pleading.

                         SARAH
          That's his throwing arm!
          But he doesn't stop until she finally steps forward and slaps
          him across the face. Startled, John lets go.

          Football's all he's got.
          John stumbles back, ashamed, and heads into the woods. Sarah

          It's a picture-book perfect neighborhood. Most of the houses
          are festively decorated with front-yard graveyards and cobweb-
          festooned trees. John walks with Sarah. They come to the
          prettiest house on the block.

                         SARAH
          This is me.
          John stares at the dozen jack-o'-lanterns arranged on the
          porch. They glare back with flickering bucktooth grins.

          I know. Wait until the Christmas
          decorations go up. My mom decks
          the halls with so many lights, you
          can see our house from space.
          Stray TRICK-OR-TREATERS race past. She motions to the cut
          above his eye, concerned.

          You should see a doctor.

          The air is charged.

          Sarah swings open the white picket gate.

                         JOHN
          Wait.
          As she turns back, John steps forward and kisses her.
          Although taken by surprise, Sarah quickly succumbs to his
          passion. However, as their kiss intensifies,

          THE JACK-O'-LANTERNS
          rise and hover in midair. Sarah has her back to them, but
          when John's eyes momentarily flicker open, he sees the orbs
          grinning back. Startled, he pulls away from her.

                         THE PUMPKINS
          instantly drop and SMASH onto the porch, their candles
          blowing out on impact. Sarah spins and stares at the jack-o'-
          lanterns, pulp oozes through their cracked shells.
          Suspicious, she slowly turns, looks at John for an
          explanation. He does his best to cover his stunned reaction.
          Fat drops of RAIN begin to fall. John puts up his hood.

          The cops found it abandoned in the
          middle of Route 20, just south of
          White Sands, New Mexico. It was my
          dad's. He went missing six years

          It proves he wasn't crazy. I'm

          She's wearing a funky-cool vintage dress.

          INT. DINING ROOM - SARAH'S HOUSE - DAY

          The table is decorated with garlands of autumn leaves and an
          elaborate pine cone centerpiece. Sarah places the last
          turkey-shaped gravy boat onto the table. She smiles at John.

                         SARAH
          You look dazed.

                         JOHN
          Just taking it all in.
          She crosses.

                         SARAH
          I'm glad you came.
          They tenderly kiss until Annie bustles in carrying a steaming
          bowl of mashed potatoes.

                         ANNIE
          Don't mind me.
          She puts the bowl on the table and grabs Sarah's camera.

                         ANNIE
          Let's get a picture of you two
          lovebirds.
          Sarah cringes as Annie lifts the camera to her eye.

          Mom. No. John really doesn't like

          It's okay. Let her take it.
          The gesture means the world to Sarah. He puts his arm around
          her. Sarah nestles her face against his. As the flash WIPES

          Red candles flicker. Sarah's DAD is expertly carving the
          turkey. Everybody is at the table. John sits next to Sarah.
          She holds his hand under the table. It's Hallmark worthy
          until the carriage clock on the mantel CHIMES.

          John looks at his phone. No messages. His brow creases with

          I need to check in with Henri.
          He exits.

          John speed dials as he steps out into the cold. He holds the
          phone to his ear. It rings three times and then is answered.

          CLICK. John jerks the phone from his ear and stares at it,
          panicked. He paces, desperate and unsure, then gets an idea
          and punches another number.

          The food is getting cold. Everybody is waiting for John.
          Sarah catches her mother's disapproving look.

          I'll see what's taking him so long.

          Sarah steps out just in time to see John climb into a pickup

          Sam is behind the wheel.

          Anything to get out of Thanksgiving

          John pulls up his khakis, shows Sam the trio of scars.

          Death scars.

          It's a dilapidated Victorian. Mist shrouds the yard which is
          littered with junked cars and trash. The pickup crawls to a
          stop in the shadows across the street.

          It's graveyard quiet. John nervously sneaks down the side of

          He squats in front of the door. He holds up a luminescent
          palm and uses it like a flashlight to sweep the interior.
          WHAT HE SEES: Take-out boxes litter the filthy counter. The
          sink is swamped with dirty dishes. The light washes across a
          semiautomatic sitting by a packet of Lucky Strikes.

          SAM (O.S.)

          Annoyed, John spins and finds Sam creeping towards him.

          John realizes Sam is determined. He sweeps his hand back
          over the kitchen door. His palm illuminates a familiar

          CRYSTAL-HANDLED DAGGER.
          It's lying on the counter by the fridge.

                         JOHN
          Henri's here.
          John âturns offâ his palm and reaches for the door handle.
          Sam anxiously swats his arm away.

                         SAM
          Wait! Other than strength, speed

          Okay. I'm ready. Let's do it.
          But as John reaches for the door handle, the kitchen light
          suddenly turns on and a MAN enters. He's built like a
          wrestler and goes by the name of FRANK.

          With a Lucky Strike clenched between his lips, Frank picks up
          the packet on the table and is pissed to discover it's empty.
          He crushes it in his fist and crosses to the door.

          John and Sam are gone. Frank steps out and locks the door.
          He flicks away his cigarette as he heads down the stairs.
          CAMERA FOLLOWS the butt as it cartwheels into

          SAM'S LAP.
          He's crouched next to John at the side of the porch. He
          frantically begins trying to extinguish the stub. John
          clamps his hand over Sam's mouth and snuffs the cigarette
          between his fingers. Once Frank's safely around the corner,
          John releases his hand.
          The duo silently climbs onto the porch. John squats in front
          of the door. His hand shakes as he holds it out towards the
          lock and concentrates.

                         SAM

          He retrieves Henri's dagger and tentatively heads into...

          Everything is filmed with dust. It's freezing and John's

          floorboards CREAK. Fear bites as John scans the lifeless

          His breath catches in his throat. He âturns offâ his hand.
          His heart thumps as he waits for something to react to the
          noise. But nothing does. As his eyes adjust to the dark, he
          notices a rectangle of light faintly leaking from the door
          that leads down into...

          INT. BASEMENT - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          The ancient stairs sag as John slowly descends. The space is
          illuminated by a single naked bulb. The sound of DRIPPING
          WATER hammers the silence. John scans the rabbit warren of
          rooms and sees a figure chained to a chair in the corner.

                         JOHN
          Henri!
          He races over. But as he reaches for Henri's gag, a YOUNG
          MAN steps out of the shadows holding a baseball bat. John
          turns too late and the bat strikes his left side. He drops
          the dagger as he falls to the floor, his ribs searing. The
          man, BRET, raises the bat again. John focuses his mind.

                         THE BAT
          whips out of Bret's grip and torpedoes towards John -- who
          ducks out of the way as the bat flies past. Confused, Bret
          lurches forward. John scrambles for the bat, clenches it in
          his hand, and swings it into the young man's legs.

                         BRET
          knocks the light as he topples into a column and CRASHES onto
          the cement, out cold. It's over in a violent blur. John
          sits stunned for a moment. The swinging bulb casts surreal
          shadows as he spins back to Henri, telekinetically âunlocksâ
          the padlock securing the chains, and rips off the gag.
          Henri is groggy and his face is swollen from brutal beatings.

          Henri smashes his boot into Bret's face, knocking him out for
          good. John staggers up, they spin for the stairs just as

          SAM AND FRANK
          head down them into view. Frank holds the revolver against
          Sam's neck. Their shadows crisscross under the swaying bulb.

          Stay planted or I'll blow your
          friend's head off.

          stairs. John flashes on his palm, casting everything in
          eerie blue light.
          On all fours, Frank scrambles for the fallen weapon. It's
          almost within reach when he is lifted right off the ground by
          an invisible force.

          With tremendous telekinetic effort, John slams Frank against
          the ceiling.

                         JOHN
          Tell me what you know!
          Franks says nothing. John trains his palm light on the big
          man's face. It's like a blinding interrogation lamp.

          wanted.

          Henri urgently retrieves Sam's gun and his dagger.

          We need to go! Now!
          John âreleasesâ Frank, who drops onto the floor like a whale
          and is knocked out. At that moment, a razor-thin line of
          dust drops from the floorboards above.

          CREAK above them. They are definitely not alone.

          INT. HALL - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          FOUR MOGADORIAN SOLDIERS stalk through the house. Their long
          black coats SILENTLY sweep. One sniffs the air like a
          bloodhound and motions towards the basement door...

          INT. BASEMENT - WARSAW HOUSE - NIGHT

          BLAAAAM! -- the door is shredded off its hinges and flies
          down the stairs. The Mogadorian patrol storms through the
          cloud of splinters. Frank and Bret lie where they fell, but
          there's no sign of John, Henri or Sam.
          Pissed, one of the Mogadorians strides towards a small
          blacked-out window. He punches out the glass with his fist
          and catches sight of Sam clambering over the back fence!

          Yes, you can.
          John nods, puts his hand on the dash and closes his eyes.
          The engine TURNS OVER but doesn't start. Sam looks up the

          John's brow is furrowed with concentration. The Mog
          unsheathes his sword as he runs. With a superhuman leap, he
          lands on the hood -- TWAAAAACK! John and Henri spin out of
          the way as the sword SHATTERS the windshield and impales in
          the back of the seat, missing them by a mouse hair.
          As the Mogadorian withdraws the sword to strike again, Henri
          sweeps up his dagger and stakes it into the Mog's neck.

          VRRRROOMMM!
          The engine ROARS to life. The Mogadorian tumbles off the
          hood, magenta light spurting from his wound. John turns to
          Sam, who is petrified, and SCREAMS...

                         JOHN

          DRIVE!
          Sam wrenches the shaft into gear and floors the gas. The
          Mogadorian EVISCERATES in a frenzy of embers. The truck
          bursts through the blizzard of sparks and STREAK-PEELS away.

          THE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER.
          He's the one who slaughtered Number 3 in Africa. His men
          part as he steps into view and crosses to Frank and Bret who
          are chained to chairs. A Soldier stands behind each one.

          scar runs down his right cheek, identifying him as the same
          Mogadorian Henri wounded in the escape from Lorien. His skin
          is deathly pale and his eyes have a cold purple tint.

          Bret is too freaked to even speak. The Commander nods to the
          Soldiers. They grab Frank and Bret by the heads and yank
          open their mouths. Frank watches in confused terror as the
          Commander holds one of the meditation balls.

          forward and bridges the hole.

          Mark climbs in the back. He looks around nervously as the
          vehicle starts off.

                         MARK
          Where are we going? Is this about
          the fire? It was an accident.

          THE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          sitting in the back. His face is masked in shadow.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          We're hunting for one of the guests
          at your party.
          He holds up a netbook which flashes with the FlipVideo
          footage of John's rescue of Sarah. It's posted on YouTube.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          Do you know this boy?

                         MARK
          Yeah, John Smith. But I didn't
          invite him.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          He's a fugitive. We've been
          tracking him for some time.
          Mark smirks, vindicated.

                         MARK
          I'll help you find him.
          He points to Sarah's image on the screen.

                         MARK
          He's not at Sarah's, I already
          checked. And one of my dad's
          deputies drove by his house --
          nada.

          He poses a great threat to us.

          Mark pulls out his cell phone.

          I've got Sarah's cell number, maybe
          you guys can trace it?
          The Commander takes the phone and passes it to one of his men
          in the front. He looks back at Mark.

          At that moment, all the POWER in the school DIES and the

          The Commander climbs out. Mark follows but is distracted as
          a trio of black SUVs speeds into the lot followed by a
          tractor trailer from which inhuman GROWLS echo.

          What the hell's in there?
          He looks back at the Commander who is arming up from the
          trunk of the SUV. Mark glimpses the arsenal of future-tech
          machine pistols, double-bladed swords and heavy-duty daggers.
          He backs away in fearful realization.

                         MARK
          You guys aren't FBI.
          Before he can run, a Mogadorian Soldier grabs him by the neck
          and constrains him. The Commander pulls

                         TWO BANDOLIERS
          over his broad shoulders. The cartridges are made of crystal
          and swirl with purple light. Finally, he slips on his
          trademark red coat and spins towards the school.

          One of John's hands holds Sarah's while the other lights

          Girl. She swings up an awesome hand-cannon and FIRES right

          but takes out the

          who was stalking up the hall behind them! John watches in
          shock as the Mogadorian keels over and SHATTERS into embers.
          John swings back to the Teen Girl as she strides forward.

          their way is the six of us.

          There's a commander, a bunch of
          soldiers and two Piken. They'll
          have all the main entrances
          covered.

                         JOHN
          It'll take us out to the stadium.
          Six acknowledges that info with a curt nod. FOOTSTEPS. Six
          grabs John and Sarah by their arms and yanks them back
          against the wall.
          They hold their breath as one of the Mogadorian Soldiers
          prowls straight past. He stops for a moment, then turns the
          corner. Sarah looks across at the mirrored trophy case and
          sees there's no reflection.

                         SARAH
          We're invisible.
          John realizes, turns to Six.

          Lumen and telekinesis.
          More FOOTSTEPS. John turns and watches in horror as the
          Mogadorian Commander and a trio of Mogadorian Soldiers sweeps
          into view. The Commander is holding

          MARK.
          He is ashen with fear. Sarah has to catch herself from
          screaming. John makes a move, but Six holds him in place.

          Mark rips free and hits the deck a second before the trophy
          case EXPLODES. Shards of glass rip into the Mogadorians and
          trophies torpedo off the shelves and impale the aliens
          against the far wall. The Mogadorians SCREAM as they flail.
          John, Sarah and Six break cover. John wrenches Mark to his
          feet and they take off running. They dash around the next
          corner and find

          HENRI, SAM AND BERNIE
          sprinting towards them, followed by two Mogadorians! Six

          PUMMEL-RAMS through the wall in a shower of bricks, books and
          paper. It utters a glass-shattering ROAR. John looks back
          and sees Bernie bravely holding his ground.

                         JOHN
          Bernie!
          He watches as the beagle sprints forward and launches himself
          at the monster. Bernie clamps onto the Piken's neck. He's
          hopelessly outmatched and holds on for dear life as the Piken
          tries to buck him off. Then something amazing happens --

          BERNIE BEGINS TO MORPH.
          He doubles, triples in size and keeps growing. His features
          become reptilian, gecko-like, his fur turns to spines and in
          a matter of moments Bernie has transformed into a hulking

          ALIEN CREATURE.
          John looks to Henri as the truth of Bernie's origin dawns.

                         HENRI
          Bernie's a Chimera. He came with

          A projectile HISSES past John's ear and DETONATES a row of
          lockers -- BOOOOOM! -- it's like an incendiary grenade. The
          paint blisters off the lockers as they are consumed by FIRE.

          use the glass cartridges that glow on their ammo belts. One
          FIRES another round. John telekinetically RIPS a door off
          its hinges. It flies forward, blocks the charge and IGNITES.

          They take off. John follows and uses his telekinesis to
          fling cabinets, doors, benches anything he can to block the
          fiery onslaught. But the rounds are coming too fast and a
          projectile SMACKS him in the back. It's like being hit by
          napalm. As FLAMES wash across him, he looks up and snaps on

          THE SPRINKLER HEADS
          that run the length of the hall. A deluge sprays, dousing
          the fire. With his clothes smoking, John tears around the
          corner. The Mogadorians charge after him, but find

          SIX IS WAITING.
          BOOOOMM! BOOOOMM! She blasts them at point-blank range.
          Magenta light gushes from their wounds. Like rain hitting
          hot coals, their bodies HISS as they crack and cinder.

          Henri, Mark, Sarah and Sam race out of view. Then John sees
          something emerge through the smoky, water-choked haze.

          IT'S THE SECOND PIKEN!
          It utters a low, predatory GROWL and launches itself forward.
          Oddly, Six doesn't move. She closes her eyes and lays one
          hand on the flooded floor, turning the water to

          ICE!

          In a matter of moments, the hall has been transformed into an
          icy tunnel. The sprinklers spray snow. The Piken struggles
          to find purchase in this new frozen environment and slip-
          slides after John and Six, who disappear into...

          INT. CAFETERIA - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          CRAAAAACK! The doors are DEMOLISHED as the Piken flails off
          the ice. It takes out a row of tables and chairs and skids
          to a stop. It ROARS in humiliated FURY, and its red eyes
          scan for John and Six who are nowhere to be seen.
          The Piken prowls behind the serving counter. Snow beads off
          its back. Its monstrous nostrils suddenly flare, sensing
          something. It hunches lower and peers at the trays and pans
          that are stored below.
          REVEAL JOHN AND SIX. They're invisible. John clutches Six's
          arm. They're lying between a stack of roasting dishes.
          Threads of foamy drool drip onto their faces as the Piken
          pokes its head further. Its ghoulish red eyes seem to stare
          right at them. With a final frustrated SNORT, it carries on.

          INT. HALL - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          Henri, Sarah, Sam and Mark race into view. Sarah stops,
          panicked and afraid.

                         SARAH
          Where's John?

                         HENRI
          Right behind us.
          He offers her his hand. She's about to take it when

          A MOGADORIAN SOLDIER
          steps out of the shadows. There is nowhere and no time for
          Henri and the others to run. But as the Mogadorian squeezes
          the trigger of his hand-cannon, the wall on his right

          ERUPTS!
          Bernie and the first Piken crash into the hall. They are
          still at each other's throats and don't even notice as they
          steam-roller over the Mogadorian, squashing him like a bug.
          The creatures SMASH through the opposite wall and out of
          sight. It's over in a violent blink.

          INT. KITCHEN - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          John and Six sneak through the shadows. She steps to the
          door, but it won't budge.

          We're not leaving without my
          friends.

                         SIX
          Don't you mean the girl?
          John ignores the jibe and turns back. Six grabs his arm.

                         SIX
          I broke the Elders' spell to find
          you. The Mogs can kill me now. We

          We stay and fight.
          OFF his determination...

          INT. HOME ECONOMICS ROOM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          Henri and Sam crouch behind one station while Sarah and Mark
          hide in the one opposite. Henri pulls a selection of weapons
          from the backpack. He hands one to Sam, looks over at Mark.

                         HENRI
          You know how to use one of these?

                         MARK
          My dad's the sheriff.
          He slides two across the floor. The door opens. They swing
          up to fire but find -- John and Six.

                         JOHN
          Save it for the Mogs. Let's go!

          INT. LOCKER ROOM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          Bernie and the Piken pummel the rows of lockers which
          COLLAPSE like dominos. Gashed and exhausted, the battling
          duo SHATTER-SMASHES into

          THE SHOWER STALLS.
          Water SPURTS from a broken pipe. The Piken slips on the
          slick tiles. As it struggles to right itself, Bernie seizes
          the moment and sinks his fangs into the monster's neck.

          desperately thrashes. Its talons viciously rip into Bernie's
          side. Ignoring the pain, Bernie doesn't let go until his foe
          finally jerks to stillness. As Bernie sinks to the floor, he
          MORPHS back into a beagle and lies spent and bleeding...

          INT. GYM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          John leads the group past the bleachers and points to the
          side of the stage.

                         JOHN
          The door's over here. The tunnel
          leads out to the stadium.
          Sarah sweeps back the curtain, revealing a padlocked set of
          metal doors. John holds up his hand, snaps the lock and
          whips the chain free. The doors fly open,

                         TWO MOGADORIANS
          spring out of the dark. One tackles Henri while the other
          blindsides John. Henri struggles until

          BOOOOOM!
          The BLAST cinders the Mog's head clean off. Henri looks over
          and sees Mark holding a smoking shotgun and nods his thanks.
          The second has John pinned when it suddenly ROARS in agony
          and disintegrates into a shower of sparks, revealing

          SIX.
          She sheathes her dagger and helps John up.

                         SIX
          Saving your life. My new hobby.
          Sarah notices a smile of respect flicker between John and
          Six. PHHHHHHT! PHHHHHHT! PHHHHHHT! -- three Mogadorian
          knives razor the air. One impales Six in the shoulder. She
          slumps at John's feet. Henri opens FIRE on the

          THE COMMANDER AND TWO MOGADORIAN SOLDIERS
          who storm towards them. John SCREAMS to Sam and Mark.

                         JOHN

                         (RE: SIX)
          Get her down the tunnel!
          They grab Six by the arms and drag her into the tunnel.
          Sarah glances back at John and follows after them. Henri
          takes out a Soldier. John sweeps up his hand and

          THE WOODEN FLOOR OPENS LIKE A ZIPPER!
          The Commander and the other Soldier are sent flying as the
          planks rip free of their nails. John and Henri charge into
          the tunnel. The doors fly shut behind them and the bleacher
          stand rolls forward to seal the entrance.

          INT. TUNNEL - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          Sarah is in the lead. Sam and Mark follow, holding the
          wounded Six. They've almost reached the end when

                         A MOGADORIAN
          lurches into the mouth of the tunnel. Without a second's
          hesitation, Sam swings up his gun and BLASTS it. Mark looks
          at him in shock as they race through the embers. Sam shrugs.

                         SAM
          I play a lot of Xbox.

          EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          Sam, Mark, Six and Sarah hurtle across the field. When they
          reach the track, Sarah looks back and smiles with relief when
          John and Henri burst out of the tunnel.

                         JOHN
          Don't stop! Get to the woods!
          She nods and exits with the others.
          John and Henri head onto the field after them when

          THE SECOND PIKEN
          leaps out of the mouth of the tunnel behind them. It's
          seriously pissed. It bounds straight towards John. Its
          fangs glint like barbed wire as it launches itself towards
          him. At the last second,

                         HENRI
          nobly shoves John out of the way and is plucked into the
          Piken's jaws. The creature shakes him like a rag doll and
          flings him 50 feet down the field. John watches, anguished,
          as Henri lands in a heap.

                         JOHN
          Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
          The Piken pivots, turns its crimson eyes on John. It almost
          seems to smirk. Its fangs are stained with Henri's blood.
          John's face hardens into a mask of rage.

          He makes no attempt to flee as the Piken charges. As it
          springboards into the air...
          ANGLE ON JOHN'S HANDS -- as they suddenly clench.
          ANGLE ON THE GOALPOSTS -- as they're SNAPPED clean off their
          bases and fly skyward.
          ANGLE ON JOHN -- as the Piken's shadow washes across him.
          ANGLE ON THE PIKEN -- as it arcs towards John with its mouth
          open and teeth bared. Suddenly, the goalposts spear its
          flanks, impaling it like supersize BBQ forks.
          The three-ton killing machine drops out of the sky and smacks
          onto the 20-yard line. John watches impassively as the red
          life-fire dies in its eyes and its head lolls to one side.

          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

          The stadium looms in the distance. Sam wrenches the dagger
          from Six's shoulder while Sarah and Mark anxiously watch.

          EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          John sinks by Henri's side.

                         JOHN
          Henri.
          Henri GROANS as John cradles his head. His coat is soaked
          with blood and his torso is horribly mauled. John tries to
          drag him to his feet.

                         JOHN
          Come on, taillights in five.

                         HENRI
          I won't be coming with you this
          time. Save yourself.

                         JOHN
          We go together!
          Henri smiles, grateful, but at that moment

          THE COMMANDER'S SWORD
          flies past John and impales Henri in the chest. Henri utters
          a GROAN and his dying eyes meet John's.

                         HENRI
          Find the others.
          His voice is a GRAVELLED WHISPER.

          Your life is my life... always.
          His eyes flutter closed and he slips from John's grip.
          Anguished, John doesn't notice his pendant momentarily
          flicker with a radiant blue light. He angrily spins to face

          THE MOGADORIAN COMMANDER.
          But in a blur of speed, the Commander steps forward, wraps
          his hand around John's throat and plucks him into the air.
          He's flanked by the remaining Soldiers. John's feet kick
          uselessly as he's lifted face to face.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          Number 4.
          Three Loric pendants dangle from the Commander's belt like
          mocking trophies.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          Your Cepan saved you on Lorien.
          The Commander's voice hisses with cruel certainty. He
          wrenches his sword from Henri's corpse.

                         MOGADORIAN COMMANDER
          But this moment was inevitable.
          The blade shimmers with silver flame as he raises it.
          John's eyes narrow as the sword sweeps towards him. This is
          the moment his adolescence officially ends. This is the
          moment when a warrior is born.
          ANGLE ON BLADE as it SHATTERS into a million pieces, which
          flutter to the ground like glittering confetti.
          John stares at the alien with calm confidence.

                         JOHN
          Nothing is inevitable.

          ANGLE ON JOHN'S HAND AS IT IGNITES.
          The flame is hotter and brighter than 10,000 acetylene
          torches. He grips one of the Commander's bandoliers.
          TIGHT ON THE MOGADORIAN'S FACE as he realizes it's over.
          The glass cartridges detonate in a deadly chain reaction.

          IT'S LIKE A NUCLEAR IMPLOSION!

          John, the Commander, the Mogadorian Soldiers, in fact every
          goddamn thing in the stadium is obliterated in the

          SUPERNOVA OF FIRE
          that radiates across the field like a blinding ring of hell.

          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

          Sarah looks back as the blistering vortex of flame lights the
          night sky. Her breath catches in her throat.

                         SARAH
          Oh my God... John.
          Before anyone can stop her, she takes off running, sprinting
          for the stadium.

          EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - PARADISE HIGH - NIGHT

          It's a smoking ruin. The seats have melted into puddles.
          Sarah bursts into view. She looks across the devastated
          field. The grass has been reduced to a charred black carpet
          of stubble. Nothing remains of Henri or the Mogadorians.

                         SARAH
          John!
          She charges across the broiled expanse, hoping against hope.
          Then she sees John, lying motionless and naked, his clothes
          completely burned away. She stops, puts her hand to her
          mouth to stifle a sob, when he COUGHS and stirs.

                         SARAH
          John!
          Ash swirls like snow as she races to his side. They wrap
          each other in their arms. Neither wanting to ever let go.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. PICNIC AREA - WOODS - DAWN

          The sky is cracked with the first light of day. Sarah is
          dressing Six's wound at a table. Six winces.

                         SARAH
          Sorry, Girl Scout first aid didn't
          cover extraterrestrial dagger
          wounds.
          Six smiles, grateful.

          As the two teens size each other up, CAMERA FINDS Mark. He
          hangs up his cell and crosses to John and Sam, who are
          talking intently by the motorcycles. John is now wearing a
          pair of old jeans and a faded denim jacket.

                         MARK
          The Sheriff's Department is
          starting to put up roadblocks. You
          guys better get moving.
          Six and Sarah join them.

          You good to go?

                         SIX
          Don't worry about me.

          Sam, ride with Six.

          We don't need baggage.
          Sam steps in front of her, determined.

                         SAM
          I have to find out if the Mogs took
          my dad.
          Six turns to John, who is not bending, then glares at Sam.

                         SIX
          You slow us down, I'll shoot you
          myself.
          Sarah looks at John, tries to rein in her emotions.

                         SARAH
          I want to come too.

                         JOHN
          You need to stay here.

                         SARAH
          Why?

                         JOHN
          You could have died last night.
          I'm not putting you in danger
          again. Mark's promised to look
          after you.

          Tears tumble down her cheeks.

                         SARAH
          I don't want to say goodbye.

                         JOHN
          I'll come back for you.

                         SARAH
          When?

                         JOHN
          When it's safe.
          She bows her head, anguished. He gently lifts her chin.

                         JOHN
          Where I'm from, we only give our
          heart to one person. I've given
          mine to you.

                         (BEAT)
          I love you, Sarah.
          Their lips meet and they kiss. It only ends when John hears
          an URGENT RUSTLE in the woods. They turn and watch as

                         BERNIE KOSAR
          limps into view. Blood mats his fur and his face is
          scratched but he's alive. OFF John's relief...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. PICNIC AREA - DAY

          Sam sits behind Six on her motorcycle. John holds Bernie as
          he straddles his Harley. Bernie morphs into a gecko and
          darts into his pocket. Sarah studies John and Six, unsure.
          John THROTTLES the bike to life, then looks back at Sarah.
          He fights a pang of jealousy when he sees her standing at
          Mark's side. RAIN spits as the motorcycles start off.

          JOHN (V.O.)
          This is the first town I've left
          without Henri. The first one I
          have a reason to come back to.
          John and Sarah hold each other's gaze, desperately trying to
          brand the image of their faces onto their memories.

          EXT. ROAD - DAY

          The bikes blur past the âWelcome to Paradiseâ sign.

          JOHN (V.O.)
          He warned me the pain would be
          unbearable if I left her. He was
          right.

          EXT. TEXAS PLAINS - DAY

          A straight stretch of blacktop bisects the sunbaked flatness.

          JOHN (V.O.)
          But I don't regret it. The pain
          reminds me what's at stake.
          A dust trail plumes as the bikes power into view.

          JOHN (V.O.)
          We must find the others and face
          our enemy together. I'm not sure
          how we can stop them. But nothing
          is inevitable. I know that now.
          Thunderheads darken the horizon.

          JOHN (V.O.)
          I am Number 4.
          His eyes are fearless and his face is undaunted by the
          battles yet to be fought. He's ready to face a future
          unmapped and uncharted. Ready.

          FADE OUT.

                         THE END
