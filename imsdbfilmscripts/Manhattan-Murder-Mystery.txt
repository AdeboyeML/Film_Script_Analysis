          NOTE

          Most of the sequences in this production are filmed using a hand-
          held camera or a Steadycam. These very mobile cameras move around
          the set, and get constantly closer and further from the
          characters. Still, we'll be using the usual technical terms, such
          as «long shot» or «full shot» or «medium shot» here and there to
          give the reader an idea of the location of the camera at the
          beginning of each sequence. And then we'll mention the movements
          of the camera.

          NEW-YORK - AERIAL VIEW - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          While the camera is flying over New-York, we keep on hearing the
          jazz music.
                         
          The camera reaches a round building that looks like a stadium and
          starts moving around the building.

                         
          HOCKEY GAME - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Long shot on the skating rink. A hockey game is in progress on the
          rink. The camera follows a player, and then pans on the audience.
                         
          The camera stops on a medium shot of Larry and Carol, a couple in
          their early fifties. Larry seems fascinated by the game, but Carol
          seems to find it boring. She looks at the ceiling, and then puts
          her hand over her mouth to suppress a yawn. Larry turns toward
          her.
                         
                          LARRY
           Come on.
                         
                          CAROL
           What?
                         
                          LARRY
           You promised to sit through the entire hockey game without
           being bored and I'll sit through the Wagner opera with you
           next week.
                         
                          CAROL
           I know, honey, I promised. I know.
                         
                          LARRY
           I already bought the earplugs.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah. Well, with your eyesight, I'm surprised you can see
           the puck.
                         
          The crowd starts yelling and we guess that one of the players has
          done something really good. Carol mockingly claps her hands.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yay, hooray.
                         
          Then she raises her eyes to the ceiling, seeming more bored than
          ever.
                         
          LARRY'S BUILDING - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          A nice-looking apartment building in New-York.
                         
          Full shot of the lobby. We see the street through the glass door.
          An uniformed attendant is standing near a counter, on which he is
          writing on a book.
                         
          Larry and Carol are coming from the street and entering the
          building. He is carrying some shopping bags, and she is reading a
          newspaper, the «Daily News».
                         
                          LARRY
           God. I can't wait to get into bed and stretch out.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah.
                         
          The attendant slightly turns around and bows to them. They bow
          back to him. He goes back to his book-keeping, and the couple
          keeps on walking through the lobby.
                         
                          LARRY
           You know, there's a Bob Hope movie on television later.
                         
                          CAROL
           know. Can you believe this guy in Indiana ? Killed twelve
           victims, dismembered them and ate them.
                         
                          LARRY
           Really ? Well, it's an alternative lifestyle.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah, I'll say.
                         
          They reach the two elevators. Larry presses the call-button on the
          wall between the two elevators.
                         
          LARRY'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Medium shot inside the cabin of the elevator. The inner door
          slides open. Carol enters first, still reading her newspaper.
          Larry enters behind her and presses a button on the control panel.
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           Hold the elevator.
                         
           LILLIAN (voice over)
           I'm coming.
                         
          Hearing people's voices, Larry puts his hand on the edge of the
          door to keep it from closing.
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           Hold the elevator.
                         
          Paul and Lilian enter the elevator. They are a middle-aged couple.
          He is bald and tall, and very smily. She is small, with grey hair.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           That's right.
                         
                          PAUL
           Thank you.
                         
          Lilian has a broad smile when she recognizes Larry and Carol. The
          elevator door slides shut. Lilian looks at Carol.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           I, uh, I see you at the gym sometimes.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, you do ?
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Yeah, we live in the apartment down the hall.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, well, I go whenever I have the discipline.
                          LILLIAN
           It's important to put that time in. It does wonders.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh god, yeah. I agree with you.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Exercising changed my life.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, geez...
                         
                          LARRY
           I prefer to atrophy. I'm not a very exercise person.
                         
                          PAUL
           We bought a treadmill last week.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, well, we had one. But you know, we got rid of it
           because it was just taking up too much space.
                          LILLIAN
           Oh, it-it-it...
                         
                          LARRY
           Because you have to turn it on and get on it once in a
           while. That was her problem.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Hey, I... exactly, I... and it's so confusing, with all
           those buttons and computerized programs. I'm just never
           gonna get that.
                         
          LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Full shot of a very sober and modern hallway. Creme-colored walls,
          grey carpeting, dark wooden doors.
                         
          We hear the elevator door opening and Carol comes out, followed by
          Lilian, Larry and Paul. They all talk together and we can hardly
          understand the following dialogue.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, I know. It's late.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           It's so wonderful, meeting.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, well, yeah.
                         
                          PAUL
           It is just like New York. You have neighbors. You never
           meet them... You guys...
                         
          The following line, said by Lilian, is clearer and we understand
          it better.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           ... I've seen you so many times in the hallway, you know...
           and I've always wanted to come up and say hallo.
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, anyway... good night.
                         
          Larry and Carol walk away from Lilian and Paul, who remain near
          the elevator.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Good night. Such a lovely couple. You know that...
                         
          Paul bends down to pick up something on the carpet. Lilian walks
          one step in Larry's direction.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Oh, uh, say, hello ?
                         
          Paul starts opening his apartment door, just across the hallway
          from the elevator.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Huh ? Yeah ?
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Huh, listen... why don't you come in for a-a-a second and
           have a drink with us ? I mean, we'd really love that.
                         
          The camera pans around toward Larry and Carol. Larry makes a
          negative sign with his hand.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, oh well that'd be fine...
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           She makes great Irish coffee.
                         
          Mute conversation between Carol and Larry. Larry evidently doesn't
          want to accept Lilian's invitation, but Carol wants to.
                         
           LILLIAN (voice over)
           Oh, please ? Uh uh, I want you to give me a treadmill
           lesson.
                         
                          LARRY
           There's a movie on television I want to watch.
                         
          Carol starts walking toward Lilian and Paul's apartment, followed
          reluctantly by Larry.
                         
          The camera pans around during Carol's next line, and we see Carol
          entering Lilian an Paul's apartment.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, about the tread... oh, well, if I can figure it out,
           then believe me, anybody can.
                         
          She laughs, and Larry, entering the apartment behind her, utters a
          forced laugh.
          PAUL'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          The cosy apartment of middle upper-class people. The decoration
          looks like them.
                         
          Medium shot of Lilian walking across the bedroom toward the large
          double bed. She walks near the famous treadmill.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Have a look at the instructions. They drive me crazy. You
           know ? I don't know what I'm doing at all. Let's look...
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           No. Please, it's easy.
                         
          Lilian picks up a book on a table near the bed.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Wonderful book they've given me. Now I'm at level five.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           What ?
                          LILLIAN
           That I know.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           You're that advanced ?
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Well, yeah.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           God, I only got to level two.
                         
          Lilian brings the book to Carol.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Look at these diagrams. Do you believe this ?
                         
                          CAROL
           That's amazing.
                         
          She is standing near the treadmill. Lilian shows her one of the
          diagram in the book.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           I can't understand this even.
                         
                          CAROL
           Let me see.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Yeah, well. See this ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay.
                         
          PAUL'S APPARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
          One of the wall could be a bay window, but, for the moment, it is
          entirely covered by a beige drape.
                         
          Medium shot of Paul bringing a stamp book to Larry.
                         
                          PAUL
           Now, let me show you a mint 1933 airmail. Very rare... and
           very beautiful.
                         
          Larry is seated near a small table, on which Paul puts the book
          down. Paul sits down next to Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah.
                         
          Paul picks up a special philatelist magnifying glass and puts it
          in front of the stamp, for Larry to have a better look at it.
                         
                          PAUL
           Look at that. And this plate block is quite unique because
           it has a flaw in the engraving. See if you can see it.
          Larry, who is not interested in philately at all, scratches his
          head.
                          LARRY
           Uh, it's hard for me.
                         
                          PAUL
           Actually I'll give you a little hint. Right down here in
           the corner.
                         
                          LARRY
           That tiny thing there ?
                         
                          PAUL
           Interesting, yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           Ah, you have a really...
                         
                          PAUL
           That makes it quite valuable, you see. And I just got a
           commemorative set of issues that are going to be quite
           valuable, too.
                         
          He picks up a transparent envelope inside which are several
          stamps.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yes.
                         
                          PAUL
           Look at the color, right there. All these are gonna become
           a real f...
                         
          Larry stands up.
                         
                          LARRY
           Well, listen... we're probably keeping you up, right ?
                          PAUL
           Oh, no-no-no. This is wonderful.
                         
                          LARRY
           I should be going.
                         
                          PAUL
           What do you do, if I may ask ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Me ? I'm in book publishing. I work up at Harper's.
                         
                          PAUL
           Are you really ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah.
                         
                          PAUL
           I own an old, uh, cinema. Having it redone.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh.
                         
                          PAUL
           Used to have a string of three, but, you know, business is
           not what it used to be.
                         
          He picks up some more stamps from the table.
                         
                          PAUL
           Now, look at these presidentials. Look at the color work.
           Even the perforations are still intact.
                         
                          LARRY
           Where's Carol ?
                         
                          PAUL
           All the...
                         
                          LARRY
           Because I should really be going, actually.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, really ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah. I mean, so, we...
                         
          In the background, behind Larry, we see Carol and Lilian entering
          the room.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Coffee's ready !
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, coffee. I forgot coffee.
                         
          He turns around to face the women.
           PAUL (voice over)
           Good. We can get back to this later. Come on in.
                         
          We see Paul's hand on Larry's shoulder, pushing him toward the
          centre of the room.
                         
          A little later.
                         
          Full shot of the room. They are all seated around a low table,
          Larry and Carol on the sofa, Paul and Lilian on two armchairs.
          They've just finished their coffee.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Well, we've never had any children, but it's easy to
           empathize. Oh, um, uh, what college does your son attend ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Brown.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Oh.
                          PAUL
           Nice color.
                         
          They all laugh.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Paul never attended college. He's self-made.
                         
                          PAUL
           Always regretted it. I think knowledge is the second most
           important thing. First is health, then knowledge, then
           money.
                         
          Larry puts his cup down on the low table.
                         
                          LARRY
           You know, it's amazing how time, we,... we'll just...
                         
                          LILLIAN
           And, do you work ?
                         
          Larry stands up.
                         
                          CAROL
           Huh ? Do I ?
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Yes.
                         
          Larry looks at Carol and sits back on the sofa.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, well, I actually, um, I used to work at an ad agency,
           but that was many years ago.
                         
          The camera moves closer to Carol and Larry.
                         
                          CAROL
           But... You know, I've been seriously thinking of starting a
           little restaurant. But, well, Larry, he's trying to talk me
           out of it.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, she's a great cook, though, really. Her duck and fennel
           omelette on a bed of scallops and Hollandaise sauce with
           truffles and sweetbreads'll make you snap into a fetal
           position and have you in bed screaming for a month.
                         
                          CAROL
           He loves to tease me, but actually, he really loves exotic
           food.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           My weakness is any rich dessert, cream, butter, anything
           with fat.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, really ? Oh well, let... listen... I'll fix you a
           dessert that'll make your eyeballs roll up. You'll have to
           exercise for a month to work it off.
                          LILLIAN
           Yeah.
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           We're going to Le Cirque for our anniversary.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, really ?
                         
          The camera moves around, away from Larry and Carol, to Paul.
                         
           LILLIAN (voice over)
           Yes. Twenty-eight years. November.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Really ?
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, what do you buy the woman who buys everything ?
                         
          The camera moves around backward, away from Paul and back to Larry
          and Carol.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           We already have twin cemetery plots.
                         
                          LARRY
           Well, it's... I always think a Bentley is in good taste.
           You know, or you can go the route that I went with her. On
           her twentieth, I got her some very lovely handkerchiefs.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah. Oh no. But, you know, they had my initials on them.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, it was a very, very high-class item. I didn't even
           know her size. I'm going over.
          Carol bursts out laughing.
                         
          Black screen. Actually, we are in :
                         
          LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Carol and Larry's apartment is quite different from the one we've
          just left. It is the apartment of a couple of New-York
          intellectuals, with nice, artistic furniture. We hear a door
          opening.
                         
                          LARRY
           Jesus, couldn't you keep the conversation going a little
           longer in there ?
                         
          Lights are switched on.
                         
          Full shot. We see only part of the hall, the camera being in a
          corridor, and the walls of the corridor concealing part of the
          hall.
          Carol enters the apartment, and Larry holds the door for her.
                         
                          LARRY
           I was signaling you frantically.
                         
          Larry closes the door.
                         
                          CAROL
           I was just trying to be neighborly.
                         
                          LARRY
           Neighborly ? If this guy showed me his stamp collection one
           more time... I mean, my favorite thing in life is to, you
           know, look at canceled postage.
                         
          The camera follows Larry walking in the corridor toward :
                         
          LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Actually there are two large beds in the bedroom, the room being
          divided by a partition set between the two beds. The partition is
          only a half wall. There is a opening, without door, at each end of
          the partition, to go from one section of the room to the other.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Oh, come on, Larry. It was sweet. They, you know, they're
           looking forward to their anniversary.
                         
          Medium shot of Larry taking his jacket off. He puts it on a chair.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, and I'm looking forward to seeing that Bob Hope movie.
           I don't know why they put it on so late.
                         
          The camera turns back to the corridor and Carol, still in the
          front hall.
                         
                          CAROL
           You know, do you think that's gonna happen to us ?
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           What ?
                         
          Carol walks in the corridor, toward the bedroom.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, that we'll become like them ? You know, just another
           dull aging couple, you know, with our little walks, you
           know...
                         
          She walks into the bedroom.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           We are a dull aging couple.
                         
                          CAROL
           Our TV, our lox and bagels. And... and our twin cemetery
           plots ?
                         
          Larry is seated on his bed. Carol looks at some pills bottles on
          the night table.
                         
                          LARRY
           No, we should be as lucky as them. To, you know, to be in
           their physical shape, at their age ? They look great. Did
           you see the dumbbells this guy lifts ? If I lifted
           dumbbells like those, I would get a hernia the size of the
           San Andrea's Fault.
                         
                          CAROL
           How often do you think they make love ?
                         
          She goes out of the main part of the room, and the camera follows
          her.
                         
          She sits down on the other bed and starts taking her shoes off.

           Oh, you know, probably more than we do, in their shape. You

           LARRY (voice over)
           Of course. What kind of question is that ? Of course I do.
                         
          Carol stands up from the bed and moves across the room. The
          camera, still located in the main part of the room, follows Carol,
          so we don't actually see her walking, but we see the partition and
          the large clock on it.
           CAROL (voice over from behind the partition)
           Yeah, but we're not turning into a pair of comfortable old
           shoes, are we ? Do you think ?
                         
          Carol reappears on the other side of the partition.

          Larry's head appears in the forefront of the shot. He is still
          seated on the bed.
                         
                          LARRY

          MOVIE THEATER - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Full shot of the screen of the theater, on which the film «Double
          Indemnity» is shown. And under the screen, in the dark, the back
          of some of the spectator's heads.
                         
          This film is a very famous 1944 film directed by Billy Wilder, and
          referred by the Library of Congress as one of the hundred best
          films of the Twentieth Century. The term «double indemnity» refers
          to a clause in certain life insurance policies that doubles the
          payout in cases when death is caused by certain accidental means.
                         
           BARTON KEYES (played by Edward G. Robinson)
           I'd have the police after her so fast, it'd make her head
           spin. They'd put her through the wringer. And brother, the
           things they would squeeze out.
           WALTER NEFF (played by Fred MacMurray)
           They haven't got a single thing to go on, Keyes.

           Oh, not too much, I guess. Just twenty-six year
           experience... All the percentage there is, and this hunk of
           concrete in my stomach.

          by Barbara Stanwyck, is half-hiding behind a wall.

           Me ?
                         
          She laughs. They have reached their building. The camera turns
          around to follows them inside the building. Larry puts his hand on
          Carol's back to guide her inside the building. We see an ambulance
          revolving light reflected in the glass door of the building.
                         
                          LARRY

           Uh. Now he's divorced, you know ?

           Do I detect a note of jealousy ?
                         
          The camera is still on the sidewalk near the entrance of the
          building and we see Carol and Larry walking toward the elevators.

          outer door of the elevator. This door slides open, and we get a
          medium shot of Larry and Carol inside the elevator.
                         
          They seem surprised by what they see on the landing. There is a
          gathering of neighbors, which we don't yet see. But we hear their

          a stretcher standing in the corridor. On the stretcher, a body -
          Lilian's body - is covered by a white sheet. Three men are
          standing near the stretcher, one of them wearing green gloves and
          writing on a clipboard, another one carrying a black leather case

           Thank you so much for those wonderful flowers.
                         
          Paul seems very relax. He smiles a lot, which could be surprising,
          when we understand he put his wife in the grave only a couple of
          days ago.
                         
                          CAROL

                          CAROL
           No, anything. Anything at all. I mean, God, it's just such
           a shock when anyone... It was just so sudden. I mean, she
           seemed so... God, well, healthy.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah.

           She had a heart condition.

                          CAROL
           No. Right. Well...

                          PAUL
           Thank you. You know, you owe me a wonderful French dessert.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, no, no, no. I know, I haven't forgotten. Believe me, I
           haven't forgotten.

           Well, have a nice time. You seem all gussied up.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah. Oh, I know. We're going to the opera.

                          PAUL
           Goodnight.
                         
          He walks away toward the entrance of the building, still smiling a
          lot and looking very happy. Carol looks at him with a question on
          her face.
                         
                          LARRY
           Goodnight.

          THE METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Long shot on the Met building.
                         
          We hear the music from Wagner's The Flying Dutchman.
                         
          The camera slowly tilts down. We don't see Carol and Larry yet,
          but we hear their voices.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           The deal was, I sit through the ice hockey game and you
           watch the whole opera.
                         
          The camera is now on ground level, and we see Carol and Larry
          coming out of the Met.
                          LARRY
           I can't listen to that much Wagner, you know. I start to
           get the urge to conquer Poland.
                         
          They cross the esplanade in front of the Met.
                         
          ELAINE'S RESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Elaine's is a cosy place, like there are many around Greenwich
          Village.
                         
          Carol and Larry are eating at Elaine's with Sy, Marilyn and Ted.
          Ted is a quite handsome man in his forties.
                         
          We get a medium full view of the party, with a very mobile camera
          moving around the table and going from one person to another,
          getting closer to one person, then moving slightly away.
                         
                          SY
           I'll tell you something. I think it's weird. I mean, listen
           to this. One night she's having coffee, and the next night
           they are carrying her out in a rubber bag.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, I know, I know. And she did not look like she was ready
           to go.
                         
                          TED
           Maybe this guy killed her, you know ? Like, he's got, like,
           a young tootsie stashed someplace, or something.
                         
                          LARRY
           No, no, not this... you gotta, you gotta see this guy. This
           guy gets his jollies from licking the back of postage
           stamps. He's a-a boring old...
                         
                          TED
           Well, I can see that. Yeah, depending on whose picture is
           on the stamp.
                         
                          CAROL
           She never once mentioned that she had a heart condition.
                         
                          LARRY
           Well, what is she gonna say ? Oh, yeah, hello, I'm Mrs.
           House and I have a bad heart.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, she had no problem telling me about her hysterectomy
           in the first five minutes.
                         
                          SY
           It is much easier to talk about a hysterectomy than it is
           to talk about a heart condition.
                         
                          TED
           You said she liked... she liked eating high cholesterol
           desserts. Is that what you said ?
                          LARRY
           So, she had one too many.
                         
                          CAROL
           No. No ! She wasn't on a diet. We discussed diets.
                         
                          LARRY
           So she wasn't on a diet. But...
                         
                          TED
           This would be a really great way to kill somebody.
                         
                          SY
           How ?
                         
                          TED
           You clog their arteries with whipped cream, chocolate
           mousse, butter. They go like that.
                         
          Carol is laughing very heartily at Ted's joke.
                         
                          SY
          That's great.

          you know what I mean ?
                         
                         LARRY
          It's disgusting, but a... It's fatal.
                         
                         TED
          Wouldn't that be great ?

           Yes, but a restaurant is a serious business. I mean, you

           Did he seem a little too cheerful ?
                         
          She looks at some pills bottles on the night table.
                         
                          LARRY
           No, he seemed like his regular self to me, but-but, uh,
           when you brought up the notion of the restaurant... the guy
           lit up like Mr. Glowworm.

           The restaurant ?
                         
          She picks up a hair brush.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah. He sees himself as, uh, you know, as Humphrey Bogart
           in Casablanca. I-I see him more as Peter Lorre, wringing
           his hands.
          Carol starts walking toward the other section of the room. The
          camera follows her.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, no, no. No, no, no. I mean, Mr. House, Mr. House.
           Didn't seem a little too cheerful to you ?
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Mr. House, our next-door widower ?
                         
          Carol stops in front of a large mirror set on the wall in one
          corner of the room.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yes. Yes. I mean, there's... Well, you know. I mean, didn't
           he seem too compose for a man whose wife just died. Don't
           you think ?
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Well, Jesus. What do you want the guy to do, walk down the
           street sobbing hysterically ?
          Carol starts brushing her hair.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, I don't know. All I know is, they were supposedly
           looking forward to their, you know... anniversary, and,
           and, and, you know, uh-uh, i-i-if... I suddenly dropped
           dead... wouldn't you sob for months, or-or years, if I...
           You know...
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Hey, don't make those kind of jokes, okay ? I don't like

                          CAROL

           Uh, uh.
                         
          Carol walks to a chest of drawers, on top of which she drops the
          hairbrush. Then she switches the lights off in the other section
          of the bedroom, and walks back to the bed.
                         
                          CAROL
           I mean, to me he just seemed a little too perky. You know ?
           Now, suddenly he wants his French desserts, and, «Have a
           nice time, you know, at the opera». And, my God, «We're
           certainly dressed up». I mean, you know. This guy should be
           a wreck.
                         
          She sits down on her side of the bed, and takes her socks off.
          While talking, Larry puts the book and his glasses on the night-
          table. Carol switches the light off on her night table and gets
          into the bed.
                         
                          LARRY
           Right. Meanwhile, I can't get the-the Flying Dutchman theme
           out of my mind, you know ? Remind me tomorrow to buy up all
           the Wagner records in town and rent a chainsaw.
                         
          He switches the lights off on his bed table. The room is
          completely dark, and we hear the next sentences on a black screen.
                         
                          CAROL

                          LARRY
           Well, he's a little mousey, too. They could have their
           little rodent time. They can eat cheese together.
                         
          Carol bursts out laughing. The phone starts ringing.
                          LARRY
           Oh, Christ.
                         
          He switches the light back on, puts his glasses on his nose and
          picks up the phone.
                         
                          LARRY
           Hallo ? Yes. Yes, of.... Yes, of course you woke us. You
           know, not everybody's up at one o'clock in the morning
           watching the porn channel. I'll put her on.
                         
          He gives the phone receiver to Carol.

           No, no. You know, I mean, I just think this guy is too
           perky. You know, I mean he's not acting like a man whose
           beloved of twenty-eight years died just a few days ago.
                         
          Larry is trying to get the telephone cord, stretched from his

           Hey, I've got some stamps I wanted to show you.

          room but we can't understand the words.
                         
          Carol puts water in the glass jar of the coffee machine. She puts
          the lid on the jar and turns around to put the jar in the machine.
          She looks in the coffee plastic container and notices there is no
          coffee inside. She bends down and opens the cupboard door. Not
          finding any coffee in the cupboard, she closes it, stands up and
          turns around to look inside the cupboard above the sink. She
          closes it, and bends down to look inside the cupboard next to the
          dishwasher. She seems surprised by something and pauses. Then she
          takes a copper funeral urn from inside the cupboard. She stands up
          and takes the lid off the urn. She looks inside the urn and closes
          it. She seems a bit shocked and bends down to put the urn back
          inside the cupboard. Then she stands up and looks absently around
          her.

          other on the sofa. Carol is drinking coffee from a cup, and Larry
          is staring, with his arms crossed on his chest, looking a little
          bored. Paul is sitting on an armchair and eating the floating
          islands from a plate he is holding in his other hand.

           I was just... where, um, where are the twin cemetery
           plots ? We... because, we were thinking that that was just
           such a romantic idea. Weren't we, Larry ? You know ?
           Larry ? You remember when we were talking about the twin
           cemetery plots and, you know, how kind of romantic that
           is ? Remember ?
                         
          Larry looks at his wife. He has a little difficulty to come back
          into a conversation he wasn't following.
                         
                          LARRY
           Uh-huh. Yes, yes. We were. We were spending the eternity

                          CAROL
           Hey, I'm not tired.
                         
                          LARRY
           What do you mean, «You're not tired» ?
                         
                          CAROL
           You know, Ted's gonna check with the funeral home,
           tomorrow.
                         
                          LARRY
           Great.
                          CAROL
           You know what I mean ? I mean, I don't understand why
           you're not, not more fascinated with this. We could be
           living next door to a murderer, Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           Well, New York is a melting pot. You know, get used to it.

          Later in the night.
                         
          Medium shot on the bed. Larry is asleep, but Carol is not. She
          moves in the bed, and then sits up. She turns around, pats her
          pillow, and tries to lie back on her side. But she sits up again,
          looking around the room. Eventually, she gets out of the bed.
                         
          She walks around the bed in the dark, and switches on the lights
          in the corridor. The camera follows her in the corridor.
                         
          LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
          Carol switches the lights on in the hall, then she looks into the
          peephole in the front door.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh my God !
                         
          The camera turns around toward the corridor. Larry is getting out
          of the bedroom, putting his slippers on.
                         
                          LARRY
           Hey, are you okay ?
                         
          Carol walks in the corridor toward him.
                         
                          CAROL
           Larry. Larry, I heard a noise. I-I-I heard a noise in the
           hallway, so I just... I... You know, I-I looked and I
           think... I think Mr. House was getting on the elevator.
                         
          Larry hops toward her, still trying to put his slippers on. She
          backs up and they are now both in the front hall.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah ? You're sure ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah, you know, I was... I'm-I'm... almost certain that it
           was him.
                         
                          LARRY
           So-So-So what ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Just, you know... I mean, who else could it be ?
                         
                          LARRY
           So what ? It's not a crime. He can get on the elevator.
                          CAROL
           I know. I know. But wh-who would it be at one-thirty in the
           morning ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, Jesus. I was in a deep sleep. What-What's the
           difference ?
                         
                          CAROL
           But, you mean, you know how we're always complaining about
           living on the geriatric floor. Do you know what I'm
           saying ? A joke ?
                         
          While Larry is answering her, Carol opens the front door and peeks
          into the hallway.
                         
                          LARRY
           All right, so it was Mr. House. So he got on the elevator.
           It's not a felony. The guy pays rent. He's entitled. I
           mean, what... Can you go back to bed ? This is crazy. You
           woke me up out of a deep sleep. I gotta get up early
           tomorrow morning.
                         
          Carol closes the door, and walks toward the kitchen. The camera
          follows her.

                          CAROL
           I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna ring him up. I'm gonna
           ring his apartment. I'm gonna see if he's home.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           You're gonna ring Mr. House, now ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Yes, because this is really...
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           What are you talking about ?

           It's very sus...
                         
          Larry joins Carol when she already has the handset in her hand.
          But she succeeds in dialing Paul's number.
                         
                          LARRY

                          CAROL
           Let me just... Larry, don't. Wait.
                         
                          LARRY
           Don't ring Mr. house. This is a widower. Leave the poor guy
           alone. You're crazy. Stop it.
          Carol listens to the phone.
                         
                          CAROL
           That's one ring.
                         
                          LARRY
           So you saw him go out. It's not a-not a crime.
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay, two rings. He's not there, yet.
                         
          Larry takes the handset from Carol's hand.
                         
                          LARRY
           Give me this. Give me this.
                         
                          CAROL
           What are you doing ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Look, if you want to find out if somebody left, just call
           downstairs. Call the-the-the person at the desk.
                          CAROL
           All right, I'll call. Just keep ringing.
                         
                          LARRY
           Ask if someone went out.

           Yeah, um. Sure, I'm gonna keep ringing. You got it.
                         
          While Carol walks out of the kitchen, Larry puts the phone back on
          its hook on the wall.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, man.

          Larry, standing at the entrance of the kitchen.

           For crying out loud, it's no big deal. You're making a

           What's the big deal ? So, the next-door neighbor went out
           in the middle of the night and took his car. So, he went
           someplace.

          workshop of Jack, the factotum caretaker of the building. With a
          screwdriver and a plier in his hands, he is working on something
          we don't see.
                         
                          CAROL
           Jack, do you think you could come upstairs today, because I
           got a leak in the kitchen ?
                         
                          JACK

                          JACK
           I'll be back in about a minute.
                         
          Jack walks out of his workshop and along one of the basement
          corridors.
                         
                          CAROL

           Okay, just wait a second. I'll be right back.
                         
          The camera follows Jack walking away.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Yeah. Okay. All right. Oh, God.
                         
          The camera turns around to a reverse angle shot on Carol, still in
          the workshop. She looks around, apparently looking for something.
          She peeks through the door of the workshop, to make sure Jack is
          not coming back too early. Carol rushes to a key-box on the wall,
          into which there is a spare key for every apartment in the
          building. She selects a key, takes it out of the box and puts it
          in her pocket. Then she leaves the workshop toward the staircase.

          looks around her. She walks back and forth in the hallway, before
          coming back to Paul's apartment door, just in front of the
          elevator. She opens the door with the key she has just stolen in
          Jack's workshop.

          Carol crosses the kitchen. She kneels down to look into the
          cupboard where she had found the funeral urn. Apparently the urn
          is not there anymore.

          The camera zooms on Paul. He has almost crossed the street, but he
          suddenly stops a few feet from the next sidewalk. He feels his
          jacket : apparently he has forgotten something in his apartment.
          He turns around and starts walking back on the crosswalk.

          Carol has picked up a few papers from a low table, and is looking
          at them. She puts her hand into her trouser pocket to get her
          glasses out. She puts her glasses on to have a better look at the
          documents she has found.

          desk and is looking through its content. She takes an Air France
          ticket folder out of the drawer and looks inside it. Then she
          picks up another one.

          Paul opens both his hands in a gesture of despair : apparently, he
          hasn't found what he was looking for. He starts walking across the
          room, and the camera pans back to Carol in the kitchen. She rushes
          out of the kitchen.
                         
          The camera remains at the same spot, and we see Paul in the

          on the bed and picks up the phone.
          Back to Carol under the bed. The bed frame hits her back when Paul
          sits on it. She looks up. We hear Paul dialing a number.

           It's-It's...
                         
          They are now walking along a corridor.
                         
                          MARCIA
           You know, you're the only editor in the world I'll take
           suggestions from, but even you shouldn't push it.
                         
                          LARRY
           No, I'm not pushing it. I think the book is great.
           Absolutely great. You know, but, uh... how much, how much
           of Dorothy is you? As I was reading it, I kept thinking how
           much is... you know, how much did you base it on your own
           life ?
          They have now reached a smaller room, actually Larry's private
          room. Marcia takes her glasses off, and then her coat, and sits on
          a sofa.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Well, I was a waitress. I lived with a poet. I was a film
           critic.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Right, but not-not a blackjack dealer, right ?
                         
                          MARCIA
           No, but I put myself through school playing poker.
                         
          The camera pans to Larry, who is standing up at the other end of
          the room, looking through some documents.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, really ? Do you still play ?
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           No, but I still know how.
                          LARRY
           Yes ? Are you good ?
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           Yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, because maybe you could give me some pointers.
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           I could turn your game around in two hours.
                         
                          LARRY
           Could you ? That's great. That's... you know, you-you have
           all these skills, and you're beautiful, and you can write
           so well... and now it turns out you play poker. This is,
           uh, too good to be true.
                         
          Larry sits down with the pile of documents on his laps. The camera
          pans back to Marcia. She has a cigarette in her hand.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Well, I wouldn't say beautiful.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Oh, I would.
                         
                          MARCIA
           But I do have tremendous sex-appeal.
                         
          The camera pans back to Larry, who is looking through the huge
          pile of paper on his laps, perhaps a manuscript.
                         
                          LARRY
           Okay, you sold me. Are-are you seeing anybody ?
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           No. Don't let my confidence fool you, it's a facade. Why do
           you ask ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Because I have a friend who became single recently, and I-I
           know he would get a big kick out of you.
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           Oh. So, when do you want your poker lessons ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Uh, next week. I could take you to lunch. We could-we
           could, um, I'll put you on my expense account, and you
           could... teach me when to... bet and when to fold.
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           How about a cheeseburger right now ?
                         
          The phone rings.
                         
                          LARRY
           Now ? That's a possibility.
          Larry picks up the phone from a small table.
                         
                          LARRY
           You know, we could, we could do...
           (talking into the telephone)
           Hallo. Yes ? Where are you ?
                         
          The camera pans back to Marcia, who listens to Larry, smoking her
          cigarette.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Is everything okay ? Really ? No, I could, sure.
                         
          The camera pans back to Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           I could. Yeah. I need-I need, you know, five minutes, or
           so. Okay. Yes. Yes. I know where it is. Okay, hold on.
                         
          He puts the telephone down on its hook.
                         
                          LARRY
           I can't do it. I have to... My wife, I have a little thing
           I have to do. I'll do the cheeseburger with you next week,
           or something.
                         
          The camera pans back to Marcia, who is smiling.

          NEW-YORK - A PARK - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Full shot of a round concrete pond, with a fountain in the middle
          pouring water. In the background, a meadow, with chairs scattered
          on it. Carol is standing by the pond. Larry is talking to her,
          looking very nervous.
                         
                          LARRY
           What do you mean, you snuck into his apartment ? Are you
           nuts ?
                         
                          CAROL

                          LARRY
           A fuddy-dud ?
                         
          Carol starts walking around the pond. Larry follows her.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah.

           What are you talking about ? That's a crime. You can't do

           crying out loud, save a little craziness for menopause.
                         
                          CAROL
           It was a cinch. I took the key and I just let myself in.
                         
                          LARRY
           Hey, look. Do... I don't want to... You-You'll wind up
           rooming with John Gotti. You can't do that. You can't just
           steal the key and then go into somebody's apartment.
                         
                          CAROL
           Listen. He's not going snorkeling with his brother, okay ?
           Okay ?
                         
                          LARRY
           I don't wanna know. I don't wanna be an accessory.
                         
                          CAROL
           He's going to Paris, to a fancy hotel with a woman named
           Helen Moss.
                         
                          LARRY
           Tell Ted. I don't want to know. Leave me alone.
                         
          They keep on walking around the pond, the camera following them
          from a fixed location. They are now hidden by the fountain.
                         
           CAROL (voice over from behind the fountain)
           I told Ted.

           CAROL (voice over from behind the fountain)
           Yeah. He's more open-minded about these things.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from behind the fountain)
           Yes, I know. I'm-I'm-I'm a bore. I'm-Because I-Because I
           don't break the law, you know ?

           I live within the Constitution, so I'm dull.

           Listen. Perhaps he got rid of the urn, okay ?

           How do you know ?
                          CAROL

           He didn't see me, Larry. He didn't see me at all.
                         
                          LARRY
           I cannot believe this. My stomach is curdling, here I...

           He was-He was very lovey-dovey with his kind of bimbo, you
           know ? He kept saying stuff like, you know, «don't worry,
           it's gonna be all right. We're gonna be together.» That
           kind of thing.
                         
          They keep on walking around the pond, slowly coming back toward
          the camera, which moves a little to meet them.
                         
                          LARRY

                          CAROL
           Yeah, but... Larry, listen. And then, listen to this. He-He
           called this woman back. Probably this-this Helen Moss
           woman, right ?
                         
                          LARRY

                          CAROL
           And when he calls her back, she's not there. And then he
           leaves this message, and he says : «Tell her Tom called».
           You know what I'm saying ? Tom. Tom, Larry.
                         
          They are back at the same place where we saw them first by the
          pond. They stop walking.

           Yeah, yeah. I... I know, I get it, his name is Paul, but I

                          CAROL
           I thought I did a great job, and so did Ted. I don't think
           a private eye could have done any better than me. I put
           everything back where I found it, I was very careful. I
           made one mistake.
                         
                          LARRY

          Carol walks rapidly inside the apartment, followed by Larry. Paul

           for you, because, you know, you should have it while it's
           still fresh.
                         
          The shot becoming a bit wider, we notice that Paul is carrying the
          tray of chocolate mousse that Carol gave him when entering his
          apartment.

           Okay, I'll get some plates for it. Wait a minute.
                         
          Paul walks out of the corridor toward his kitchen, and Carol
          rushes into the living-room.
                         
                          CAROL

          They both start searching the room frenetically. While Larry looks
          on the desk, Carol searches the rest of the room, even kneeling on
          the floor.

          Larry drops things on the floor. With a nervous gesture, Carol
          shushes him.

          The camera pans back to the living room, where Larry is still
          nervously messing things on the desk. Then he starts moving around
          the room, looking for his wife's glasses. Carol puts things back
          in order on the desk. Larry walks to her, and whisper something we
          can't understand.

          Paul walks into the room, with a pair of glasses in his hand.
                         
                          PAUL

          Carol and Larry both look very nervous. Carol takes the glasses
          from Paul's hand.
                         
                          LARRY
           No, no, those aren't yours. These are the same, actually.

           I... You know what happened ? I think the other night, I
           must have left them here. It's the strangest thing.

           No, no. Yeah. I know. Because, remember, you were saying
           that you thought that I left them at your mother's house ?
                         
          Carol and Larry both look very embarrassed. Paul looks at them
          with a slight surprised eye.

          As he takes some more letters, Larry hits a small porcelain
          statuette, and drops it on the floor, where it breaks. He bends
          down to pick up the debris.

           sinister.

          This is very nice lounge in New-York, very tastefully decorated.
          It looks like one of those old English Club in London. Beautiful
          paintings on the walls, and even stained glasses on the windows.
                         
          This is where the wine-tasting is taking place. The camera pans
          around the room. We see people talking while holding wine-glasses.

          wine. She looks absently though the window.

           you're this way.
                         
                          CAROL
           I know. I know. Okay. I-I... Yeah. I had a few drinks, but
           it's-it's not... I mean, I saw her.
                         
          Larry puts the glasses away on the dinner table.

           How could you see her ? She's dead. Not only is she dead,
           she's been cremated. It's not even Halloween.

                          LARRY
           I think it's a pretty fair assumption that if a person is
           dead, they don't suddenly turn up in the New York City
           transit system.

                          LARRY
           Let me put it this way : total psychotic breakdown. Okay ?
           Is that enough ?

           Maybe, look. Maybe she's a twin. That's possible. Now
           forget this.
                         
                          CAROL

           That's right.
                         
          Larry opens the red wine bottle and pours some wine in his glass.
                         
                          LARRY

           Would you really ? Oh, that would be so great. You'd just
           run a check on Paul and Lillian House.
                         
          Larry stands up and walks toward Carol.

          a very good restaurant, with waiters dressed with white shirt and
          black vest.

          The camera pans back on Larry and Marcia. This is a different
          shot, with the camera in front of their table. Marcia seems very
          relaxed with the cards in her hands, when Larry seems quite
          nervous. He holds the card very close to his eyes, seeming afraid
          that his partner will look at them.
                         
                          MARCIA

          Larry shuffles his cards in his hand, hesitating on his next move.
                         
                          LARRY
           Uh, one second. Just let me, let me see, see what I,

           Inside and outside straight.
          Marcia looks at her cards. Larry keeps shuffling his cards very
          nervously.

           becoming attracted to somebody else... and it's really

                          LARRY
           Yeah. That's why I'm not playing my best. This guy is, you
           know, more adventurous than I am, and for some reason they
           just seem to hit it off. I'm gonna be very lonely if, uh,
           you know, if this happens.

                          MARCIA
           Well, we could always switch. Ted gets Carol, I can be your

          Full shot of the entrance of the Waldron Hotel. The pavement is
          wet but it doesn't seem to rain anymore. The camera pans to a car
          parked on the other side of the street a short distance from the
          hotel. This is Larry's car, with Larry seated behind the wheel and
          Carol seated on the passenger's seat. Medium shot of the inside of
          the car, seen through the open window.

           It's to me, it's like this-this tantalizing plum has just,

          A modern clean lobby, with a very conventional decoration. Medium
          shot of a clerk cleaning the lobby floor with a broom. She is a

          shoulders.
          The camera pans around toward the street door. Carol enters the

           Okay. Sure.
                         
          Carols walks away, but Larry stays with the clerk. He takes a
          banknote out of his pocket.

          He gives the banknote to the clerk, who seems a bit surprised by
          Larry's attitude and present. She looks at the banknote.

          they run around the corner of the hallway.
                         
                          LARRY
           Get down those stairs.
                         
          They don't use the elevator and instead run down the stairs.
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay, all right.

          NEW-YORK - STREET OUTSIDE THE WALDRON HOTEL - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Long shot of the entrance of the hotel, seen from the other side
          of the street. A blue police car is parked in front of the hotel.
          Two plainclothes police officers and one uniformed policeman are
          talking with Carol and Larry. They both try to explain the
          situation to the police officers. But since they both talk
          together, the police officers have a hard time understanding them.
                         
          While they are talking, the camera zooms forward from a long shot
          to a full shot of the group.
                         
           CAROL (talking together with Larry)
           And then, you see, what happened was I suspected Mr. House,
           right ? He's a... He runs a movie house. But-But then what
           hap... We're sit... I saw her on this bus, right ? And...
           And she has... no place at all. Then we checked anyway. So
           we were just sitting there, just waiting...
                         
           LARRY (talking together with Carol)
           We-We-We were there. She-She was very nervous. So-So we
           were going to the movies, and, and, and we were walking and
           looking around the place. And then suddenly she's a... Her
           hand is on the floor. You could see it on the side of the
           bed. She was lying there, she was sort of... like blue in
           the face. The girl was nervous. I tried to keep calm, as
           best as I could.
                         
          One of the plainclothes police officers stops their talking.

           SECOND POLICE OFFICER
           There's no body there.

           We-We saw...
                         
                          LARRY
           We just saw her there. She's lying on the floor.

           SECOND POLICE OFFICER (talking to the uniformed policeman)
           Mike, check the basement with...
          He starts climbing the few steps to the entrance of the hotel,
          followed by Carol and Larry. The other police officer remains on
          the sidewalk.
                         
                          LARRY
           She was totally dead.

          Medium close shot of an uniformed policeman, different from the
          one we just saw in the street.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           She was right here. She was lying, like, right this-a-way.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Yeah, she was definitely laying here.
                         
          The camera pans from the uniformed policeman to the two police
          officers talking with Carol and Larry in the middle of the room.
          The following dialogue transcript separates what Larry says from
          what Carol says, but, most of the time, they talk together at the
          same time, making it quite difficult for us, or for the police
          officers, to follow their conversation.
                         
                          CAROL
           Because, I mean, she was, she was there, do you
           understand ?
                         
          The camera tilts down on one of the police officers looking under
          the bed.
                          LARRY
           The... Y-Yes. She was... It looked like she was strangled,
           or something. Not-Not that I'm an expert on violent death,
           because I wouldn't know.

           Yeah, that's right, and I'm-I'm looking to start a little
           restaurant, basically French, although international
           cuisine would be fine. Not that I really have a location...
                          LARRY
           Right, she's a fantastic cook. But, uh, I'm against the
           restaurant, myself, but-but she's a wonderful cook.

           Look, obviously what happened is, in the time it took you
           guys to respond... somebody came here and removed the body.
           Not that you didn't respond quickly, you know, you were
           here fast. It took-took you three minutes, not-not-not
           counting the half-hour that the operator 911 took to
           understand what I was saying.
                         
           FIRST POLICE OFFICER
           Nobody is doubting you, okay ? We're going over the whole

           I'm telling you, I didn't know what's happening. It was
           like one of those television shows, where you open the
           door, and you see a-a dead body. You know, I always hated
           those shows.
                          CAROL
           Yeah. You know, I've never seen a dead person before in my

                          LARRY
           This is too exciting. I don't need this. You know, I like
           something quiet... like a fishing trip, a Father's day, you
           know, or, the time we saw Bing Crosby walking on 5th
           avenue. You know, I don't need a murder to enliven my life
           at all.
                         
                          CAROL
           You know, whoever did it was probably still in the room
           while we were there. Probably hiding in the closet.
                         
                          LARRY
           Make sure and tell me that just before I go to sleep,
           tonight. That'll be good for me.
                         
                          CAROL
           But you know, that probably means he saw us.

           Great, I'll never get my eyes closed. You know, I mean,
           what do you want me to do ? I'm petrified. Not only that,
           but I'm a little drunk.

           Well, it was... Well... You know, obviously, it wasn't Mr.
           House, because he has an alibi.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, yeah, but I don't buy that.
                         
                          LARRY
           She doesn't buy that. She doesn't buy the alibi. Let's get
           out of here. I want to go home.

          Full shot of Carol and Larry walking toward us. It is very dark
          and the sidewalks are wet from a recent rain.
                          LARRY
           Jesus, it's starting to rain again. Can you believe that ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, God. If only Ted were with us, he'd have a million
           theories about this, I'll tell you that.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, I know. I know. Ted's got a mind like a steel sieve.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, right.
                         
          The camera hasn't moved, so now we get a medium shot of Larry and
          Carol. They have reached their car, and Carol walks around it to
          get into the passenger's seat.
                         
                          LARRY
           You know what I think ? I think it's possible. That hotel
           room was on the, on the ext... That end of the hall.
          The camera tilts up the facade of the Waldron Hotel.

           LARRY (voice over)
           Well, what if they got the body out over that little roof ?
           You know, that would be a possibility. Why would...
                         
          The two windows, which Larry is pointing at, suddenly get lit.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)

           Oh, Jesus.
                         
          The camera tilts back down to street level. Larry and Carol are
          around their car, ready to climb in.
                         
                          CAROL

                          CAROL
           My God. This gave me the chills, honey.

           What, are you nuts ? No, I'm not gonna check that out.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, but look at it, Larry. Look at that. There's lights
           going on, there.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, I know, I know. That's crazy. Look, look. Why don't
           we go home and nap, and we'll call the police, and they can
           check it out while we're home in the... ?
          Carol walks away from the car toward the hotel.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, no, the police are red tape. Come on. This is my case,
           honey.
                         
          Larry catches up with her. The camera remains on the sidewalk,
          looking at the couple walking toward the hotel.
                         
                          LARRY
           What do you mean, it's your case ?

                          LARRY
           Hey, don't give me Ted. Ted would be shaking in his boots.

           I'm at least just trembling like a leaf.
                         
          They have reached the hotel and they are climbing the steps to the
          entrance of the hotel.

          Medium close shot on a window set in the wall of the lobby. Behind
          the window, the night clerk is sorting some paper. There is a
          grill in the window, to allow people to to talk to the clerk.
                         
          Carol and Larry walk to the window.

           Um, excuse me. We're with the Police department. We'd like
           to, uh, check out room, uh, six-eleven, please ?
                         
          Larry tries to play the part of the relaxed policeman doing his
          job, but he overdoes it and he looks more bizarre than serious.
                         
           HOTEL NIGHT CLERK
           You were here before.

           Your card, you know. Your card. He's got his card.
                         
          Larry goes through the pockets of his jacket and gets the business
          card the police officer gave him. He shows it to the clerk and
          then slides it through a small rectangular hole at the bottom of
          the window. The clerk takes it and looks at it.
                         
                          CAROL

           Okay.
                         
          The clerk gives the card back to Carol.
                         
                          CAROL
           Thank you very much. Six-eleven ? Okay. Great.
                         
          The clerks goes and gets the key of the room. He gives it to
          Carol, who drops the card on the small counter under the window.
                         
           HOTEL NIGHT CLERK
           Is there any trouble ?

           they're...
                         
          He takes the card from the counter and puts it back in the inside
          pocket of his jacket.

          showing Larry and Carol at the other end of the corridor ready to

           Okay, Larry ?
                         
          Larry closes the door.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm not upsetting anything. I just, you know, I'm just

           trial, we can get trapped.
                         
          The camera follows Carol and Larry moving around the room.

          Carol opens a closet.

           I don't like this.

          Larry picks up a metal lamp from the floor and hides behind a
          closet in front of the door with Carol behind him. The door opens
          and the cleaning lady walks in with her bucket and things. Larry
          is ready to hit her, but, when he realizes who she is, he drops
          the lamp. The cleaning lady yells.

          He takes some money out of his pocket and gives it to her.

           Oh, brother. Let's get out of here, come on. And take the

           What ? What are you doing ?
                         
          Apparently Carol has come out of the elevator.
                         
          HOTEL WALDRON - BASEMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          This shot is supposed to be in the basement of the hotel, but
          since it is still pitch dark, we can't tell the difference.
                         
                          LARRY
           Where are you... I'm getting back on the elevator. I don't
           care.
                         
                          CAROL
           I don't know where... Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           I-I can't see anything.
                         
                          CAROL
           There's nothing out there. Wait a minute. What are you
           doing ?
          Larry lights a match, and we see his scared face lit by the flame
          of the match.
                         
                          CAROL
           Hey, what are you doing with matches ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Th-Th-These are my matches. I got them at...
                         
                          CAROL
           Wait a minute, what... When were you at the «Café des
           Artistes» ?
                         
          Larry blows the match, because it is burning his fingers.
                         
                          LARRY
           Look. I got... Yeah, I was with an author. An authoress.
           At-at the... At...

           At the «Café des Artistes» ?
                          LARRY
           Yeah, b... A French, a French authoress. An author.
                         
          He lights another match. We very dimly see the basement walls
          around them.
                         
                          CAROL
           Wait. Shh ! Shh ! Shh !

          Medium full shot of Carol and Larry walking toward us in a
          corridor. Beside the light of the match, there is some other dim
          light coming from somewhere in the basement.
                         
                          LARRY
           I like a basement with-with knotty pine and a pool table.
           You know, where you can...
                         
                          CAROL
           Hey, look, look, look, look. Uh-huh.
                         
          They are now in close shot.
                         
                          LARRY
           What ? What ?
                         
                          CAROL
           What's this ?
                         
                          LARRY
           I... No, wait a minute. Not so fast. I don't like it here,
           it's dank.
          The camera turns around to follow them in the corridor.
                         
                          CAROL
           All right.
                         
                          LARRY
           And there's strange noises. I don't know what this is. I
           don't know. This...
                         
          We hear a loud metallic bang.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, Jesus !
                         
                          CAROL
           Calm down.
                         
                          LARRY
           Calm down ? Don't tell me to calm down.
                         
                          CAROL
           There. Turn the light on.
          Larry switches the light on. They are in a room with beige walls.
          There are pots of paint stacked behind Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           This... Wh-Wh... I-I don't... What do you...
                         
                          CAROL
           Let me see.
                         
          Carol tries to open a door near Larry, but it is locked.
                         
                          CAROL
           Where... There. Oh. We're locked in here. What are you
           gonna do ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, relax, relax, relax. Don't... I'll break it down. Stand
           back.
                         
          Larry walks back a few steps and rushes on the door, trying to
          break it open.
                         
                          CAROL
           Careful, now.
                         
                          LARRY
           Don't worry. Just-Just give me a second.
                         
          He does it another time.
                         
                          CAROL
           Don't hurt yourself.
                         
                          LARRY
           Must be one of those new doors.
                         
                          CAROL
           Let's try out here.
                         
          Carol points to another room opening in the one they are in.
                         
          Carol and Larry are now walking in a lit corridor.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, my god. I keep hearing noises.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh. What's down there ?
                         
          Carol walks rapidly toward a dark section of the corridor. The
          camera follows her.
                         
                          LARRY
           Where ? Where you... Where are you going ? Don't leave me.
                         
                          CAROL
           Let me see. It's okay. What ? Oh !
                         
          She has reached a door with a barred window showing the street
          outside.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah. I think this is it. I think this is the service
           entrance.
                         
          She tries to open the door, but it is a bit stuck.
                         
                          LARRY
           Well, come on.
                         
                          CAROL
           I'm trying.
                         
                          LARRY
           Come on, get it open.
                         
          Carol succeeds in opening the door.
                         
                          CAROL
           I got it. I got it.
                         
                          LARRY
           Go into a trot.
                         
          They rush outside.
                         
          NEW-YORK - STREET OUTSIDE THE WALDRON HOTEL - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Long shot on the dark street. At a distance, we see a man putting
          a large oblong-shaped parcel in the trunk of a car. The man looks
          very much like Paul.
                         
          The camera pans around to give us a reverse-angle medium shot of
          Carol and Larry coming out of the basement of the hotel. They
          stopped in the middle of the short staircase.
                         
                          CAROL
           Wait ! Wait ! Did you see that ?
                         
                          LARRY
           What ?
                         
                          CAROL
           It looks like somebody's putting a body into a car.
                         
                          LARRY
           Jesus.
                         
                          CAROL
           I swear. Look. It's got a white sheet on it.

           Yes.

           Right... Yeah. Come on.
                         
          Carol walks on to the sidewalk, followed by a very frightened
          Larry.
                          LARRY
           It is. Oh, brother.
                         
          The camera pans back around to give us a reverse-angle shot of the
          car leaving the curb of the street.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)

           Oh, my God. Wait. No, look ! Let's-Let's follow him. Come
           on.

           Yeah, no. Come on.
                         
          The camera pans back around again to give a reverse-angle medium
          long shot of Carol and Larry running toward their car.

                          LARRY
           It's-It's probably-It's probably a rented car.
                         
          They have reached their car and they start climbing into it, Larry
          still on the driver's side.
                         
                          CAROL

           Hurry up. Come on.
                         
          They slam the doors, switch the headlights on and start.
                         
          NEW-YORK - AERIAL OVERVIEW OF BROOKLYN BRIDGE - EXTERIOR NIGHT
          The camera starts with the interchange at one end of the bridge,
          then pans to the bridge itself. At this early hour of the night,
          the bridge still has a lot of traffic moving on it. Then the
          camera moves down to get a closer look of the traffic on the
          bridge.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)
           Oh, Jesus. I-I can't c... I can't follow his car.
                         
          The camera follows the moving traffic on the bridge, and certainly
          also follows Larry's car, even though, from this height, we can't
          tell which car it is.
                         
           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)
           Well, he's right up ahead. He's right there.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)
           Where, up ahead ? I don't know which car I'm following
           here. I... You know, I'm not a good driver. I can't chase
           somebody in a car. I'm gonna have an accident. I'm, you
           know, I'll-I'll-I'll wind up hitting a school bus or
           something.
                         
           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)
           Look, it's nighttime. There's no school buses at night-
           time.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

          NEW-YORK - INDUSTRIAL PARK - EXTERIOR NIGHT
          Long shot inside an industrial park, somewhere on the outskirts of
          New-York. Larry's car drives slowly inside the park, coming toward
          us. There is no one else at this time of the night. The place is
          lit by a few lampposts, and there is smoke behind Larry's car.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)

           Be careful, be careful, be careful.
                         
          They both get out of the car, and they start walking toward the
          place where Carol saw the other car.
                         
          They reach the other car surrounded by huge piles of metal scrap.
          The car and the scenery around it are lit by a powerful red light.
          Carol and Larry run toward the place where the red light comes
          from. It is inside a huge building. But they don't go inside the
          building and, instead, keep on running along the building.
                         
          Medium shot on Larry and Carol. Carol stops Larry and points at

           Look, look !
                         
          The camera pans to the thing Carol was pointing at. A body, half-
          wrapped in a white sheet, is being lifted by a huge electromagnet.
           LARRY (voice over)
           Oh, my God ! It's Mrs. House's body !
                         
          Reverse high-angle shot on Larry and Carol, as if they were seen
          from the magnet.

           Come on ! We gotta stop it before it gets dropped.
                         
          Larry takes Carol's hand and runs toward the magnet.
                         
          Reverse angle long shot on a group of workers in the background.
          Then the camera pans to a reverse angle medium shot on Larry and
          Carol coming out between rows of huge heavy-duty bags.
                         
          Reverse angle medium shot on a huge cauldron full of hot melted
          metal. A huge pair of metal jaws is dropping metal scraps into the
          cauldron. Among the metal scraps, we see Mrs. House's body

          The camera zooms to a close shot on the cauldron.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Good bye, Mrs. House.
                         
          Reverse angle shot on Larry and Carol. Then reverse angle long
          shot on the cauldron. A lot of bright sparks are coming out of the
          cauldron.
                         
          Long shot on the building. Larry and Carol are coming out of the
          building. They start running toward the camera. The camera pans
          around to a medium shot on Paul's car. Through the windshield, we
          see Paul behind the wheel, lit by the red light coming from the
          melted metal. He starts the car and drives away.
                         
          The camera pans around toward Carol and Larry, still running - too
          late - toward Paul's car.
                         
                          LARRY
           That was Mr. House ! That was definitely Mr. House.

           What are we...
                         
          Larry has walked around the car and joins Carol on the sidewalk.
                         
                          CAROL
           You know, he's got proof his wife died of a heart attack
           two weeks ago. We've got no body. We've got nothing, Larry.
                         
          Larry looks away from her and puts his hand on his mouth, as if
          frightened by something

           You know, it had to be some other woman. You know, some-
           some woman who probably had some kind of ballpark
           resemblance to Mrs. House.

          to the woman, then another one to Paul, and kisses him on the

          Later. The woman has a hard attack. Paul helps her to walk to the
          sofa.
           MARCIA (voice over)
           She has a heart attack. She drops dead spontaneously.
           They had no thought of killing her. Maybe they wished she

          woman, lying on the sofa, into her own clothes.

           Yeah, it's possible. He saw you there, he knows you're onto

          TED'S THEATRE - STAGE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Full slightly high-angled shot on the stage. In the middle of the
          stage floor, a white circle, on which there is a chair and a small
          table with a telephone. Suzanne Raphael, a young woman, is
          auditioning. She is seated on the chair, holding the telephone.
          Behind Suzanne, which is the left side of the stage seen from the
          audience, a white wall, with a doorless opening. On either side of
          the wall, two red columns. And on either side of the girl, which
          are the front and the back of the stage, two red metallic frames.
          In front of the girl, a video camera on a tripod, with an operator
          standing behind the camera. Actually, the operator is Sy, Larry
          and Carol's friend, whom we have seen much earlier in the film, in
          the antique market and at Elaine's restaurant. The stage is well
          lit, when the audience hall is in the dark.
                         
                          SUZANNE

           this.
                         
          She slams the phone down. The camera pans around to show us the
          right side of the stage, where there is several rows of theatre
          seats and a table in front of the seats. Ted, Marcia and Marilyn
          are seated in the front row. Marilyn is Sy's wife, whom we have
          also seen earlier in the film. Carol is seated in the second row,
          behind Marcia.

          Carol taps on Marilyn's shoulder, and whispers something to her.
          Ted joins them in their whispered conversation. The camera pans
          back on the stage. Larry, with a clipboard in his hand, has
          entered the stage, pushing Helen in front of him.

          Ted walks away. Helen takes a very deep breathing, sits down, puts
          her hands trough her hair, takes another breathing, and picks up
          the phone handset from the telephone on the table. She overdoes it
          a lot, trying to act as the prima dona she is not.

          Later. Helen is auditioning another scene. She doesn't have the
          phone in her hand any more. She is holding a script and looking at
          it. Larry is seated in front of her, and read his own script on
          his clipboard.

          Medium shot of Helen, seen from behind. We see Sy standing behind
          his camera on her right, and Larry standing with his clipboard in
          his hand on her left. In the background, Ted, Marcia, Marilyn and
          Carol listening to her. While Helen is talking, the camera moves
          backward through the opening in the scenery.

          are both looking at a large video monitor. On the monitor screen
          and on the computer screen, we see the same picture of Helen

          The camera pans to Marcia, seated behind Carol and also looking at
          the monitor. Behind her, Sy is looking at another monitor, and
          manipulating some switches on an editing machine underneath the
          monitor. Larry is standing next to him.

          The camera pans back on Ted and Marcia, then it pans to a close
          shot of a big high-tech tape recorder, on which Sy is working. We
          see his hands cutting off a short section of the audio tape, and
          gluing back the two severed ends of the tape together.

           police before he died.
                         
          Larry walks around the backstage, trying to find his way. We see
          the black and white film on the screen, but also reflections of
          the screen on the multiple mirrors scattered around the backstage.

          Behind Paul, we see the film on the screen. We have now reached

          Rita Hayworth's face is reflected on the many mirrors in the film,
          just like, in the actual scene in the backstage, Paul and Larry

          Arthur's figure, walking with a cane, is reflected in the many
          mirrors in the film. Just the same, Gladys, who has just entered
          the backstage, walking with a cane, is also reflected on the
          mirrors scattered around her. She has a gun in the hand which is
          not holding the cane.
                         
          While Gladys and Paul are talking, the film keeps on showing on
          the screen behind them, but we do not understand the words from
          the film, because Paul and Gladys' voices are louder.

          the mirrors are being broken. Paul enters from behind a mirror
          frame, and falls on the floor. Gladys' reflection appears in
