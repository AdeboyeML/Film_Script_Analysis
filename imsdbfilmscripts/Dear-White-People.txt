                         ANCHOR
               A "race war" has erupted at one of
               the nation's oldest and most
               prestigious institutions.

     Glued to this are our story's subjects, who we meet in...

     TROY FAIRBANKS, 21, Black. He drags a brush through his
     finger waves anxiously. The look of guilt is the only mark
     of imperfection in his privileged and chiseled demeanor.

                         ANCHOR (O.S.)
               Outrage over an "African American
               Themed" party organized by
               predominately white students of
               Manchester University has resulted
               in rioting and property damages.

2A   KURT FLETCHER, 21, white. No sympathy in his jaded blue      2A
     eyes as he watches on an iPad in a lavish parlor room.

                         ANCHOR (O.S.) (CONT'D)
               Guests were invited to "liberate
               their inner Negro, fry up chicken,
               enjoy a sugar water concoction

               oversized Barack Obama T-shirts."

2B   COLANDREA CONNERS (COCO), 20, Black with blue contacts    2B

     small TV in her dorm. A smirk on her glossy pink lips.            *

                         ANCHOR (CONT'D)
               Officials claim an investigation is
               underway to find those responsible
               for the event and subsequent riot.

2C   SAMANTHA WHITE (SAM) 21, records the broadcast in an       2C
     edit bay. Despite her light skin, the Afro pick in her fro
     pompadour leaves little doubt she identifies as Black.

                         ANCHOR (CONT'D)
               In an effort to address diversity
               issues, the school appointed
               African American scholar Dr. Walter
               Fairbanks as Dean of Students.

2D   LIONEL HIGGINS, 20, Black, watches through dark rimmed    2D
     glasses in a bustling indifferent Dining Hall. A guilt pains

                         ANCHOR (CONT'D)
               Last year the Dean's office
               celebrated slight gains in diverse
               applicants but with many now
               calling for Fairbanks' resignation,
               that may have been pre-mature.

2E   DEAN WALTER FAIRBANKS, a well adorned Black man in his       2E
     50's fights a panic as he watches in a stately office.

                         ANCHOR (CONT'D)
               Up next, a cat that loves to water
               ski? That and more after the break.

     checks his pockets. He's missing something. Shit.

     Lionel dials on his cell and we hear the PHONE RING from
     inside. Voicemail pops on with a voice other than Lionel's.

               Kurt. It's Lionel. I'm locked out.

     As Lionel slides down the length of the door into a sit he

               Dear White People, apparently
               Morgan Freeman in "Deep Impact"
               wasn't enough. Despite two terms

     bohemian and radical.

     Troy glares at Sam's picture on the book. It's on. There's a

          Randomization of Housing Act.
          Second years of color no longer
          have a say in where they go. The

19   EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY                                        19

     Lionel walks alone through the buzzing campus. He looks out
     to..

     ...a group of BLACK KIDS. He sees a version of himself
     amongst them - his hair a finger waved Ceasar fade, as he
     trades "No Homo's" with the others.

     Lionel shakes it off. Peers over to a group of out and proud
     gay kids and sees a version of himself amongst them - his
     hair straightened and coifed in a fitted shirt laughing.

     Not right either. Where does he fit? By surprise...

                         GEORGE
               Lionel right?

     GEORGE PIERCE, 24, an intellectual whose tattooed quotes from
     Nietzsche peek out seductively from under his button up.

                         GEORGE (CONT'D)

               No one reads the Observer.

                         GEORGE
               You seen this?

     George hands Lionel Sam's "Missing Black Culture" flyer.
                                                          18.

          The residents of Armstrong / Parker

          crazy or is there a there there?

                    LIONEL
          What made you come over here?

George holds up Sam's "Ebony & Ivy." Lionel takes it.

                    LIONEL (CONT'D)
          I mean I'm glad you came --

                    GEORGE

          They're whiter than Michael
          Jackson's kids. We're fucked if
          anyone of them writes this story
          and I will not let the transfers at
          the Gazette do it first.

                    LIONEL
          The oldest one has his face.

                    GEORGE
          You're in the Black Student Union.
          You probably know Sam.

Lionel shakes his head "yes" and "no" at the same time.

                    GEORGE (CONT'D)
          You come up with a good angle? I
          want it in the Bugle.

Lionel eyes the bold "Bugle" logo on George's shirt.

          Bugle. Focus. The only paper on
          campus with a national subscription
          base and an Advisor from the New
          York Times? Only so many ways a
          person can distinguish themselves
          at a place like this Lionel. You're
          good. You belong with us.

The way Lionel fights the smile creeping up his face - we
know he's never heard these words. Never belonged any place.
Doesn't hurt there's a handsome boy smiling at him either.
                                                             19.


20   INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY                     20

     Troy and Sam sit across from each other at a table. Their
     opposite facing laptops and a world of tension put a wall
     between them.

                         TROY

               calendar, contacts, and official
               email.

     Troy throws a smirk her way before pulling out a thick stack
     of papers.

                         TROY
               Just this month. They need your
               approval. Also don't forget to pick
               your office hours. At least 20 per
               week.

                         SAM
               That's absurd.

               You're in charge of a hundred
               residents now. And they need time
               to complain to your face. About
               noise. Leaky pipes. Gluten free
               options in the cafeteria. Etcetera.

                         SAM
               Troy. I didn't think I was going to

               None of the other houses are
               concerned.

               rich and powerful allies on the

               "random" works out to their
               advantage.

                         TROY
               And you think a petition is going
               to change that?

     Troy gets up to leave as Reggie sits - suspicious. Sam's
     phone buzzes: "MOM." The letters chill Sam to the core.

21   INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER - DAY                                21

     Lionel steps his way through the hall, a deer in headlights
     with a notepad. He flips through Sam's "EBONY & IVY" book...

                         SAM (V.O.)
               The Armstrong / Parker dining hall
               is the epicenter of Black culture
               as it stands at Manchester. Only
               here can you commiserate, celebrate
               and discuss everything from Kanye
               West lyrics to theoretical
               relativism all in one sitting. Not
               to mention find someone who can
               actually do your hair.

     ARMSTRONG / PARKER DINING HALL - CONTINUOUS

     Lionel enters and takes a place in a line. He absorbs this
     lively and somewhat alien dining hall.

     Troy now holds court near the windows at a table of eight or
     so friends including Martin and SUNGMI, a lip ringed Korean
     art major.

                         MARTIN
               "We wuz robbed." That election was
               suspect man.

     Martin glares at Reggie and his giant souped-up Laptop. Sam
     breaks this by sitting back down - her phone call ending.

                         SAM
               You call me the minute there's an
               update. Love you too mom.

     Sam hangs up. The call's really put her in a bad place. She
     sits at a table of her Bofros - who we'll name by their hair.
                                                       21.

Reggie glances over at Martin's Mac Air.

Sam pushes aside all the paperwork on her table.

                     SAM (CONT'D)
          So this is what the revolution
          looks like? Office hours and

Sam pulls her camera out - starts to shoot the room.

Sam feels the heat of her disciples' eyes on her as the topic
of the day rages on with the entrance of Coco, who sits with
a group of well manicured hot-ironed group of girls, white
and Black.

                    COCO

Lionel takes a seat alone facing the action.

Kurt and crew enter with plates of mac and cheese and sit in
the heart of the conversation. Lionel avoids eye contact.

Sam shoots this last one to Martin. Kurt rolls his eyes to

Lionel scribbles down notes furiously on a notepad.

          start a rebellion on the
          plantation? You tell him from

Kurt looks into Sam's eyes and then his crew. They want out.

     Kurt leads his crew out of the dining hall drawing a slight
     snicker from Lionel which draws Sam's eyes right to him.

     Something sparks in Lionel. He takes out his phone and texts
     to GEORGE: "I've got the angle. I'm in."

     Lionel sinks - the eyes of everyone in the room on him.

     Sam sits back down as a trickle of claps grow to a steady
     applause. Troy and his table look around baffled.

     By the caution on Sam's face it seems the first time she's
     ever heard this sound directed at her.

Kurt turns up his music and shoots Lionel a look, who plugs
headphones into his computer and looks down.

     light coming from a room past all the cubicles...

     ANNIE, a strawberry blonde laughs in George's lap. Lionel's
     envy shows.

      All of this is directed at a TEENAGER in the box office.

38    INT. KURT'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                    38

      Game Night and Kurt's house is filled with smoke, music, and
      rich kids who play cards at various tables.

      Coco, in a banging jumpsuit scans the room for prospects. A
      few eyes from the WHITE BOYS start to flicker her way. This
      perks her up, as she arches her back slightly...

      ...only to see their eyes follow the WHITE BRUNETTE HIPSTER
      GIRL who has entered behind her.

      Coco catches herself in the mirror. What don't they see?

     Troy deals cards at a table - the game is Texas Hold Em. Troy
     holds court - much to Kurt's chagrin. The mood is playful.
     There's a brief eye contact between Troy and Coco.

39   INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                              39

     A huge "Boycott Sal's Pizzeria" poster hangs on the walls of
     Sam's chic dorm surrounded by other street art. The BoFros
     and a few cool residents of Armstrong / Parker hang about.

     Underground hip hop permeates the room. Sam refuses a joint
     coldly from Reggie - her eyes fixed on "SCHOOL DAZE" which
     plays on her 36' flatscreen.

                         SAM
               How `bout you stop stereotyping
               yourself and put that shit out?

               Yo Sam. We got to talk about the
               protest. When are we are bringing
               the Housing fight to the prez?

     Sungmi takes a seat next to Sam. Some kids hop up and start
     grooving it out when a new song pops up on the playlist.

                         SUNGMI
               The House voted down sponsoring the
               rally.

               What do we need it sponsored for?

                         SAM
               Demonstrations can get shut down if
               a House doesn't sponsor them.

                         REGGIE
               Like the House you're head of?

     Sam shoots Reggie a glare. He backs off.

                          SUNGMI

               something bigger here. It's a
               profile piece on Armstrong / Parker

     Lionel's joke hits, but he feels gross for saying it.

     The image of Sam shaking her head in the dinner FLASHES
     before Lionel briefly.

               news item tonight and we'll work on
               the profile piece for next week.

     Lionel grabs a beer and takes a seat at one of the open
     computers. George starts up a beat on his desk as he and
     Annie stare at Lionel expectantly.

          Here's the deal. Every year we
          throw a party. The point is to mock
          the self important and moronic
          entities of the campus. The way to
          get staffed is to write an invite
          for the party.

                one that goes out, you're
                guaranteed a spot on the staff. The
                runners up are voted on by the rest

     the party winds down.

               Hey, about the rally. You could
               still get the permit anyway Sam and
               go against the board. Most people
               consider that political suicide
               though.

               It'll do a hell of a lot more than
               a radio show or views on Youtube.

               Come on Sam. You know how I feel
               about you.

               How am I supposed to know how you
               feel about me?

               You know what? Forgive me if I see
               something in you. Something
               inspiring. Something folks like me
               can get behind.

     Reggie puts his hands on Sam's belt and pulls her in to a
     kiss as a group walks by. Over Reggie's shoulder Sam sees...

     ...Gabe look back at her. He's heartbroken. She pretends not
     to be affected and sinks into a kiss from Reggie.

               It's two in the morning.

     Mitch shrugs as humiliation floods over Lionel.

     Lionel sighs and slumps on the steps outside the door. He
     scrolls through his phone for a contact...OFFICE OF THE DEAN.
     Starts an email.

50   INT. TROY'S BEDROOM - MORNING                               50

     Troy's Kangol sits in the ground, besides his undies, and
     besides a bright pink thong.

     Coco's pink painted finger nails travel through the creases
     of Troy's immaculate abs.

                           TROY
               Coco huh?

                         COCO
               Colandrea doesn't exactly pass the
               resume test, you know? I mean
               couldn't you fucking die? My
               parents should've just named me
               Ghetto-ass-hoodrat-anisha. Do
               you...indulge?

     Coco fiddles in her purse - pulls out a joint.
                                                          58.

Coco lights it and takes a drag. She hands it to Troy.

                    TROY (CONT'D)
          I don't mess with that stuff.

Coco sees right through him as Troy hits it like a pro.

          Sure about that?

                    TROY

          I'm not like that.

                    COCO
          I don't think Sam would agree.

                    TROY
          That was different.

                    COCO
          No it wasn't. Poor thing, she was
          light skin-ded and everything.

                    TROY
          Yo, it wasn't like that alright?

Troy's tone sobers Coco a bit. She places a hand on Troy's.

                    TROY (CONT'D)
          My pops. He wanted me with
          Fletcher's daughter. They've been
          in competition ever since they went
          here. Pops hates that Fletcher
          ended up President and he got stuck
          as the Dean.

                    COCO
          So your upbringing may have
          actually fucked you up more than
          mine? That's hot.

Troy laughs and takes the joint back.
                                                             59.

               Apparently four hundred years of
               unreconciled oppression.

                         COCO

               You will. And you should do it.
               They all land somewhere big, some
               before they even graduate. I've
               seen you in front of a crowd Troy.
               I bet you could be famous.

     Coco's phone buzzes with a message. It's Kurt.

     Troy checks his phone. Nothing. A decision weighs in Troy's
     eyes as Coco throws on a shirt and gets up to go.

                         COCO (CONT'D)

52   EXT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER QUAD - DAY                          52

     Troy and Sofia stand still amidst the bustle. Devastation
     marks her pretty face.

                         SOFIA
               You said you loved me.

                           SOFIA
                 What do you do in the bathroom?
                 When you leave the shower running?
                 Was it just to get away from me?

      Troy wagers his answer and decides to confess.

                           TROY
                 I smoke weed and write jokes.

      Puzzled by the man before her and too hurt for more, Sofia
      just turns and walks away. Troy watches her go just as...

      ...Lionel passes by. The two share an awkward glance before
      Troy turns to enter the house.

53    INT. ARMSTRONG / PARKER HALL - SAME TIME                     53

      Lionel shyly trudges down the hall of Armstrong / Parker. He
      turns to see Troy behind him. The two avoid the other's gaze.

      As they both head up the stairs, Troy notes it strange that
      they're headed in the same direction.

53A   UPSTAIRS                                                 53A

      Lionel heads to a door at the end of the hallway and opens it
      with a key. Troy's already at the door when he looks up and
      realizes Lionel's just entered his apartment.

54    INT. TROY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS                           54

                         LIONEL
               But you're not Head of House.

     Still stings. Troy heads into his room and closes the door
     leaving Lionel alone in the living room.

57   INT. ARMSTRONG/PARKER DINING HALL - DAY                      57

     Lionel sits alone in front of another bowl of soup. Eyes the
     different cliques of mostly Black students. Dreads walks past
     and shoots a head nod. Lionel uncomfortably shoots one back.

                         DREADS
               Stay Black, my brother.

                         LIONEL
               Sure thing?

     Lionel watches as Kurt and Troy walk together towards the
     entrance - suddenly chums. Troy's getting good news and
     gladly shakes Kurt's hand.

                         KURT
               Need your submission by Thursday.

                         TROY
               You got it bro.

     The two try and enter, when immediately Dreads slams a GONG
     in the back of the hall - prompting the whole of the dining
     hall to turn and throw paper balls at Kurt.

                           KURT
               The fuck?

     Sam grins from a table comprised of Martin, Sungmi and her
     other support staff. Martin is visibly annoyed.

                           TROY
               Yo!

     Troy takes some of the brunt of this and walks with the
     humiliated Kurt back out of the Dining Hall.

     Lionel watches with a smirk as Troy talks Kurt down on the
     other side of the entrance. Lionel catches eyes with Sam
     briefly who shares the same smirk.

     He realizes Sam's actually looking at Reggie, perched behind
     him at a table flanked by Curls and Dreads. They address him.

                         REGGIE
               Finally made it in.

                     LIONEL
          I listen to Mumford and Sons and

Reggie pulls a folded copy of the Bugle from under his arm.
Sam's on the front page with the headline "WHITE STUDENTS
TOLD TO `GET OUT' BY LIONEL HIGGINS."

                    REGGIE (CONT'D)
          We got to protect our girl.

Reggie motions over to a stressed out Sam as she argues over
something with Martin at another table.

      Sam walks off in a half jog - Fairbank's last words resonate
      more than she'd like.

      Gabe, making his way outside just catches her exit.

59B   EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY                                   59B

      Huge canvas signs with the words "WHITES ONLY" are strewn
      about the pavement, along with bullhorns and picket signs.

      Sam takes these in while the Brofros feverishly unpack the
      SUV.
                                                        66.


                    REGGIE
          There you are! We supposed to start
          at noon.

                    SAM
          I told you I had class.

There's a vibration in Sam's pocket. Her phone says "MOM."
She cuts it off and picks up a "white's only" sign.

                    REGGIE
          Those are going up on Gillespie.
          Good right?

Sam shrugs in the affirmative but it's too much. Reggie sees
a doubt in her eyes.

                    REGGIE (CONT'D)
          Yo. What's that? You're not getting
          cold feet are you?

                    SAM
          No. I mean how long do I have to
          talk anyway?

                    REGGIE
          You're kidding right? You're sort
          of the keynote.

                    SAM
          Yeah but...you know I think the
          whole Malcolm X thing is your lane
          Reg. I'm just not --

                    REGGIE
          -- They came to hear you Sam. Grab
          a bullhorn. Turn it on.

Sam is struck by the command. Stuck between wanting to curse
and comply another buzz in her pocket yanks her attention to
her phone. Sam checks: "IT'S ABOUT DAD. CALL ME"

Sam turns for some privacy. She makes eye contact with Gabe
who's just happened upon the parking lot.

                    GABE
          What is all this?

                    SAM

      Tears well up in Sam's eyes as she shakes her head no and
      heads away from the parking lot and passed Gabe.

      When Reggie looks up and catches eyes with Sam. His tilted
      look of indignation asks her what she's doing.

                          REGGIE
                Sam?

      Sam takes in the scene and decisively turns to go. Reggie's
      heart sinks as a bewildered Gabe goes to chase after her.

                          REGGIE (CONT'D)

      Reggie flanked by the BoFros bangs on Sam's door.

      The banging continues as Sam sits on the edge of her bed. The
      tears have dried. Gabe paces behind the bed.

          Bergman, but you tell people its
          Spike Lee. You love bebop, but
          you've got a thing for Taylor
          Swift. I know because my Mac picks
          up your Mac's library.

          you think I'm sleeping. And trace

          You're more "Banksy" than "Barack"

          sort of revolutionary leader or
          something? But really you're an

     Sam hangs up. A silence hangs - followed by a loud EXHALE
     from Sam as she let's go of the tension she'd been holding.

      SUBMISSION" in the subject field. He hits "send" and swallows
      the lump in his throat.

68    INT. DEANS OFFICE - DAY                                     68

      Troy gingerly enters into the Dean's office. Martin and Dean
      Fairbanks talk in hushed tones around Fairbanks' desk.

                          DEAN FAIRBANKS
                Martin, would you share with Troy
                what you shared with me?

                The server that processes the
                voting results for House Elections
                has shut down the A.P. database.
                Saw it this morning. Apparently the
                intermediary program is on a
                refractile loop.

                Sam currently has 445 votes. That's
                200 more than she had last week
                during the actual election.

                          TROY
                There's not even that many
                residents in Armstrong / Parker.

69    INT. PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - DAY                               69

      Sam sits before a giant fireplace - twice as large as the
      Dean's. She faces President Fletcher and fights nerves.
                                                                74.


                         SAM
               I wouldn't even begin to know how
               to do something like that.

                          PRESIDENT FLETCHER
               Is your little war really this
               important?

     Sam shifts gears slightly - he wants something from her.

                         PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT'D)
               I understand the pressure to stand
               for something at an institution
               like this but you're barking up the
               wrong tree okay?

               my programing class. Good. Just
               forgot to turn his program off.

               Wow.

                         DEAN FAIRBANKS
               Martin, let me talk to Troy for a
               bit. I appreciate this.

71   INT. PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                         71

     Sam glares at Fletcher.

                         PRESIDENT FLETCHER
               Your advisor tells me you're
               hanging on by a thread in you
               major. Perhaps it's time to
               reprioritize.

                         SAM
               You're trying to frighten me, but I
               think you're the one who's scared.
                                                       75.


                         PRESIDENT FLETCHER
               And I think you long for the days
               where Blacks were hanging from
               trees and denied actual rights.
               Then you'd actually have something
               to fight against.

     A swell of emotion behind Sam's steel eyes.

                         PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT'D)
               You will be facing two hearings in
               the coming weeks that could end in
               either Probation or Suspension. One
               on the merits of your show, the
               other on your election to Head of
               House.

     Sam is truly scared by this.

                         PRESIDENT FLETCHER (CONT'D)
               Your responsibilities to your house
               are suspended. Your show is done
               for. And another one of your
               illegal "demonstrations" will only
               make matters worse. This is a
               critical time for this school.

                         SAM
               You damn right it is.

                         PRESIDENT FLETCHER
               We don't have an intolerance

               Okay, so what? Is it the spotlight

     Sam steps out of Fletcher's office into the waiting room.
     Kurt is there. He stands and the two silently stare the other
     down as Kurt enters his father's office.

     A SECRETARY picks up a ringing phone - prompts her to exit
     the room. Sam watches her sign for a delivery outside through
     the window.

     Sam slips behind the office door - quietly pushes it open and
     listens in.

     Lionel walks through the empty office - slows down as he over
     hears...

                         GEORGE (O.S.)
               Lionel's story on the would-be
               protest outside of Gillespie is
               running tomorrow and I'm also
               having Lionel work on a profile
               piece of Armstrong/Parker like you
               suggested. Really break down what's
               going on.

     Lionel gingerly approaches the door to see George finish up a
     phone call.

                         GEORGE (CONT'D)
               Right. It's almost like they
               recycle so much from their past -
               Music, food, fashion, and now
               turbulence.

     This leaves a bitter taste in Lionel's mouth.

                         GEORGE (CONT'D)
               Thank you so much. Okay, take care.

     George can't fight his grin as he looks to Annie.

               Well?

                         GEORGE
               That was our Times advisor. He said
               it's stories like these that get
               editors recommendation letters.

     Lionel knocks on the door. Annie and George are startled but
     reassured when they see who it is.
                                                        78.

          you this time.

Annie smiles and heads for the door.

                    ANNIE
          Lionel please. You're only
          technically Black. G, going to
          French. You want me to hold your
          seat?

          Thanks.

Annie smiles and walks out.

          You need something? Saw your e-
          mail.

                    GEORGE
          Yeah, I need someone to do the
          Donor's function on Saturday. Small
          dinner for the school's big givers.

          coverage.

          That's Halloween night.

                    GEORGE
          Right, which is why no one else
          will take it.

                    LIONEL
          Ah. Thus the new guy.

George gathers his backpack and walks over to Lionel. Gets
close.

                    GEORGE
          On my way to class, but you can
          stay and check out last year's
          piece. You'll do fine.

                    LIONEL
          I don't know. Are there going to be
          any racially fueled outbursts at
          this thing?

     It's clear Lionel wants to say something else. George too.

                         LIONEL
               Am I a good writer?

               right now.

                         LIONEL
               You're just a big recommendation
               away from landing the Times.

                         GEORGE
               God I hope so.

      Laughter and music from the well to do event wafts outside
      while Troy dressed in a slick Armani tux hangs by the

      Lionel steps out in his ill fitted suit, a camera in hand.

     costume. Some as fairies or ninjas or Spiderman - but most as
     pimps and thugs. As Blaxploitation characters. As Barack
     Obama and Condi Rice. As Shaft, Ice Cube, and 2 Chainz.

      Her confidence starts to fight a shame that creeps up beneath
      her party face. She switches her iPhone to video mode...

     Lionel breaks George's grasp and heads out the bathroom...

     LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

     Lionel squeezes his way outside. Something goes off in his
     head as he starts walking away from the party.

     Just then Kurt arrives in front of the house with some
     friends. Looks at Lionel then at the house.

      Sam's focus shifts to her Super 8 resting by the door and
      then to a bullhorn directly across from it. Her mind ticks.

      here - but something's changed in him.

          making it so...let's just call it.

The crowd starts to talk amongst themselves, get up and
leave. Just then Lionel stands and before he can think...

                    LIONEL
          Uh. Excuse me. Hi. I'm Lionel. Some
          of you...none of you probably know

          But I just came back from a party
          on campus and I think you should
          know about it.

Lionel's nerves can be heard in his voice now. He's got the
judging eyes of the room fixed silently on him. He sees an
open laptop on a desk.

                    LIONEL (CONT'D)
          Anybody mind if I?

Reggie shifts a bit as Lionel goes to the laptop and pulls up
the party on Facebook. The crowd gathers around as Lionel
browses through the photos.

     Lionel realizes the eyes aren't judging. They're mobilizing.
     Readying for action. Lionel steels himself.

87   INT. GILLESPIE HALL - NIGHT                                  87

     Troy scrolls through an endless amount of Facebook uploads
     from the party. Forties, bad Afro wigs, fake asses.

     Shoved in between two RICH OLD WELL TO DOS at a long table
     covered in empty plates and glasses - Troy looks across to
     his father, in mid exaggerated guffaw with President
     Fletcher.

               You're being rude son.

     Dean Fairbanks turns away. Troy ponders a moment and then--

                         TROY
               Oh am I? How about I tell your
               precious donors and anyone here
               who'll listen about the kind of a
               school it is they're giving to?

     The Dean can feel the eyes of the Donors and the President on
     him - an outrage comes over him as he pulls Troy aside.
                                                                 90.

      flood into the kitchen and hold Kurt back.

                between your legs, run and tell the
                Dean and get the fuck out.

      Lionel sinks from this attack while his posse from BSU
      watches helplessly as the party goes back into full swing.

      Lionel turns to go and spots...

      ...George who joins Annie, fresh beer in hand. But right
      behind George is...

      ...Sam, having just arrived with her camera in hand pointed
      at the rap battle. She winks at Lionel.

      Lionel turns around - summons something from deep inside.

      Lionel steps onto the DJ platform and snatches the mic out of
      one of the rapper's hands.

                          LIONEL
                Heyyyy! Hoooo! Heyyy! Hooo!
                                                           92.


The crowd is with it - thinks it's part of the show as Lionel
proceeds to freestyle terribly...

          My name is Lionel,

          Well that's alright.
          Yeah that's cool.
          I'd rather you think I'm white,
          than tap dance for you.

With that Lionel takes the mic and SMASHES it on the wall. He
then takes the turntable by his hands and flips it over.

Sparks fly - the amp goes crazy - the crowd is in shock.

Lionel grabs a speaker tower and slams it to the ground.
Lionel's off the platform now. Kurt grabs him - Reggie pushes
Kurt away in his defense.

Gordon grabs Reggie - A FIGHT BREAKS OUT.

More equipment is slammed to the ground and stomped on as the
party disintegrates into chaos.

Sam dodges fights to capture it all with the camera.

Art is being ripped from the walls. Dishes being smashed on
the ground. Arguments come to physical blows.

The steel in Sam's gaze fades. Replaced by...heartbreak?

And then she spots...

...Coco squeezing her way through the crowd for the door.
Sam's camera and mic stay trained on Coco.

     Sam keeps her mouth shut and her camera rolling as Coco
     realizes it's herself she's trying to convince.

     Coco storms off. Sam exhales and lowers her camera. This is
     new for her. Keeping her mouth shut.

     ground.

               Dude. I know you can't help it...

               ...but why are you such a fag dude?

     Lionel spits in Kurt's face and pops right back up again. We
     see it in his eyes - he'll never give up.

     Kurt's hand is on Lionel's collar. He pushes him down again.
     Kids are all around - some from the BSU - some from Pastiche -
     some from the Bugle. Everyone holds an opposite party back.

     Lionel looks over at his audience and then into Kurt's eyes.
     Lionel leans in and kisses Kurt on the mouth long and hard.

                         LIONEL
               Finally got me where you want me.

     Kurt's in shock. He looks at his crew who laugh at him.

     Lionel sees the surprise in the eyes of his new supporters as
     well. No time to soak this in though. Kurt's let up. For a
     moment. Lionel turns back to Kurt and PUNCHES him in the
     face. The BSU kids go CRAZY in support.

     The shock gone - Kurt damn near knocks Lionel out.

     The world goes all slow motion and out of focus. Lionel sort
     of makes out that Kurt is yanked off him.
                                                                 94.

      One is shone directly on Lionel. CAMPUS SAFETY GUARDS and a
      couple POLICE OFFICERS surround him.

          putting up a strong front. Teasing
          me about being so worried. Then
          came the stories about me as a
          little girl I'd heard a thousand

          My mother worked nights so he would
          take me to school. And it pissed me
          off because he would follow me all
          the way to homeroom. Every time he
          tried to hold my hand I'd scream
          and pull away. He thought I was
          just being...difficult.

                    SAM (CONT'D)
          But it was the kids. And the
          parents and the teachers. They'd
          see this Black girl and this white
          man and wonder what we were doing
          together. Even at nine I could feel
          their eyes on me. Especially at
          nine. It brought tears to my eyes.

          Tubman! Don't give a fuck about no
          muthafuckin Tubman!

Coco's not sure what to think.

          Couple months, that's how long
          shooting for an episode takes. We
          recommend you cut your course load
          in half to accommodate the
          schedule.

                    COCO
          Half?

                    HELMUT
          Trust me it it'll read "full-time"
          in the episode. If...once we go to
          series, we might have to figure out
          a summer schedule.

                    COCO
          For shooting?

                    HELMUT
          For uh...classes and stuff. Won't
          be graduating early anymore
          sweetheart.

Helmut shifts a contract over to Coco.

                    HELMUT (CONT'D)
          Five grand for the episode. Twenty
          each if you get picked up for
          series. What do you say?

Coco stares at the contract and back at Helmut.

                    HELMUT (CONT'D)
          Trust me sweetie it's the same out
          there as it is in here. Good news
          is? Against all that damn white you
          and I? We pop. Think I wanted to be
          the go-to producer for all things
          Black?
                                                               105.


     Coco shrugs.

                         HELMUT (CONT'D)
               Tell you what's worse though. Being
               that broke Nigga stuck on the south
               side of Chicago. Hundred and
               Fiftieth street.

     Coco takes a deep breath. Stares right into his eyes --

99   EXT. MANCHESTER - DAY                                        99

     Coco exits a building and spots Troy up ahead. He's flanked
     by his former enemies turned supporters, Reggie and the other
     BoFros. They all carry Troy's "New Hope" posters.

                         COCO
               Made some new friends?

     Troy shrugs as Coco grabs for his hand. He pulls away and
     shares a glance with Reggie, who doesn't approve.

                           COCO (CONT'D)
               Fine.

                         TROY
               Come on Coco.

                           COCO
               Fuck you.

     Coco starts to walk ahead.

                         TROY
               My dad saw your videos. He's a
               little worried about --

                         COCO
               -- how it'll look. With your
               campaign and all. What's your best
               friend Reggie think?

     Troy motions for Reggie to go on ahead.

                         TROY
               We had fun, alright?

                         COCO
               I get everyone else wants you to
               win Troy. But do you?

     Troy doesn't know how to answer that. He stares at the
     triumphant, winning version of himself on his poster.
                                                               106.


      Coco's eyes shift longingly as she walks ahead - unsure of
      who she is at the moment and who she will be in the next.

      Watching her is Lionel and Sam - sitting with Gabe and
      Sungmi. They both know that look well...

                          SAM
                Hey Lionel. With me out and Troy
                moving on - A/P's going to need a
                new head of house.

                          LIONEL
                Think there's a story there? Who do
                you think it'll be?

      Sam and Sungmi share a glance and stare right at Lionel.

                            LIONEL (CONT'D)
                What? No.

                          SUNGMI
                Everyone loves you. Won't be hard
                to rally the vote.

                          SAM
                Yeah. We got you man.

      Lionel takes in this moment. One of complete acceptance.

100   INT. FLETCHERS OFFICE - DAY                                100

      Fairbanks turns from the window in Fletcher's office to join
      him at his desk. They're all ears as they look across to...

                          HELMUT
                Let me get this straight. First you
                tried to break up the Black house.
                Then you took down the sister with
                the little radio show. And after
                all that, your kid throws a
                Blackface party?

                          FLETCHER
                Now wait a minute!

                          HELMUT
                You thought you were having money
                problems before? Wait till cable
                gets their hands on this story.
                Bill Maher is gon' fuck you up!

                          FLETCHER
                I have heard enough --
                                                               107.


                          HELMUT
                -- Wait I'm sorry. Look from where
                I'm sitting this place is a
                goldmine.

                          DEAN FAIRBANKS
                What?

                          HELMUT
                For one we got to show the events
                that led up to the party --

                          DEAN FAIRBANKS
                -- That already happened.

                          HELMUT
                Well yeah, but we can reenact --

                          DEAN FAIRBANKS
                -- reenact?

                          HELMUT
                Documentary term...Look, I can
                start putting together an overall
                deal today. I'm talking real money!
                Turns out the one thing America
                likes in it's reality more than
                ignant Black folks, is crazy racist
                White people!

                          DEAN FAIRBANKS
                Now you look here. This is an
                honorable institution. The idea
                that we would so much as entertain
                this suggestion --

      Fletcher holds his hand up. His turn to speak.

                          FLETCHER
                How much we talking?

      Fairbanks' outrage turns to resignation as Helmut, the one
      winner here smiles. Dollar signs in his eyes.
