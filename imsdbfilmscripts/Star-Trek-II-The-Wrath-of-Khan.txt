                   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE

                   As the ANGLE WIDENS, we see the crew at stations;
                   (screens and visual displays are in use): COMMANDER
                   SULU at the helm, COMMANDER UHURA at the Comm Con-
                   sole, DR. BONES McCOY and SPOCK at his post. The
                   Captain is new -- and unexpected. LT. SAAVIK is young
                   and beautiful. She is half Vulcan and half Romulan.
                   In appearance she is Vulcan with pointed ears, but her
                   skin is fair and she has none of the expressionless
                   facial immobility of a Vulcan.

                             Aye, Captain.

                             on the distress channel. Minimal

                   Screen verifies this. Saavik makes an agonized choice.

                             get us out of here.

                   hurled from his station, and Bones hurries to him.

                   The bridge takes another hit -- a big one. In its wake
                   there is a second electrical EXPLOSION along the communi-
                   cations panel. Uhura falls from her station. Bones
                   rushes to her side amid the smoke and alarms.

                   Another hit: reverberating flashes of spark and flame
                   on the bridge. Spock dies. Bones comes to him, but
                   even as he coughs his way through the smoke, a final
                   hit and Bones falls. The room is smoke filled and a
                   shambles. Saavik looks about in shock.

                   Sulu awakens with a grin. Uhura straightens herself
                   demurely. The Trainees head toward the distant room,
                   Spock rises and leaves. Bones remains on the floor,
                   head propped in his hand, whimsically.

                   Bones rolls his eyes and rises. Kirk sees Saavik who
                   has not moved.

                   Kirk rounds the corner and sees Spock, leaning against
                   the wall.

                   Kirk looks around uncomfortably, overlaps:

                   On the monitor: Terrell and Chekov, looking hopeful.

                             It might only be a particle of
                             preanimate matter...

                             Then again it might not. You
                             boys have to be clear on this:
                             there can't be so much as a
                             microbe or the show's off.
                                     (she thinks)
                             Why don't you have a look? If it
                             IS something that can be moved...

                                           TERRELL
                                     (eager)
                             You bet, doctor. We're on our way!

                   Carol sighs as the image fades, not happy.

              10   INT. CORRIDOR, SPACE STATION REGULA I                       10

                   Carol walks through the labyrinthine complex with
                   DAVID, her son, a bright young scientist of twenty.
                   He is good looking and humorous.

                                           DAVID
                             How can you let them pull that
                             stuff on you? They're just lazy.

                                           CAROL
                             And bored. I know. But maybe it
                             IS something they can...

                                           DAVID
                             Come on, Mother, that's just the
                             military mentality. Never put off
                             tomorrow what you can put off today.
                             If there's one atom of life...

                             I know, I know...

                   Silence.

                                           DAVID
                             Well, don't have kittens.
                             Genesis is going to work. They'll

                             Thanks a lot. No respect from my

                             up with me for bridge after dinner?

                                           CAROL
                             Maybe...

                             Every time we have dealings with

                             We're dealing with something
                             that COULD be perverted into
                             a dreadful weapon. Remember that
                             overgrown boy scout you used to
                             hang out with? That's exactly

                             Listen, kiddo, Jim Kirk was many
                             things, but he was never a Boy
                             Scout...

                   HOLD ON the empty corridor.

              11   INT. KIRK'S APARTMENT, TERRA - NIGHT                        11

                   Kirk reads the novel, trying to focus. His flat befits
                   an Admiral and a loner with few possessions, except
                   a collection of antiques.

                   WE HEAR A SOFT BONG.

                   Startled, Kirk lowers the book and pushes a button.

                                           KIRK
                             Come.

                   The door slides open and Bones enters. He carries two
                   packages, one of them wrapped in brown paper.

                                           KIRK
                                     (continuing)
                             Bless me, doctor; and what beams
                             you into this neck of the woods?

                             Happy Birthday...

                   With a flourish, he pulls out a bottle of blue
                   liquid.

                                           KIRK
                             Romulan Ale! Bones, you know
                             this stuff is illegal --

                             I only use it for medicinal
                             purposes. Don't be a pring...

                                           BONES
                             Takes the stuff a while to
                             ferment. Gimme.

                   He takes the bottle and pours; continues talking.

                             Now open the other one.

                   Kirk starts to obey.

                             I'm almost afraid to. What did
                             you bring me, contraband Klingon --

                   They drink. The package is opened: a pair of gold
                   "Ben Franklin" half-glasses. (N.B.: Romulan Ale is
                   an INSTANT DRUNK: both men react.)

                             of your age, I generally administer
                             Retlax Five to restore flexibility
                             of the lens.

                             But I'm allergic to Retlax.

                             Exactly. Happy birthday.

                   He toasts. Kirk is unsure how they work.

                   An awkward silence.

                   is worried; something about all this is familiar.

                   They descend towards the structures, now seen to be the
                   wreckage of some sort of space craft.

                   They pass but do not notice the FEDERATION LOGO, half
                   buried next to their feet.

                                           TERRELL
                             They look like cargo carriers...

                   As Chekov looks at the porthole, a face suddenly looks
                   back! It is the face of a CHILD! The Apparition
                   scares the daylights out of Chekov -- and us. He
                   screams.

                                           TERRELL
                                     (continuing)
                             What is it?

                   He comes clumsily over --

                                           CHEKOV
                             A face! I saw -- it was like a
                             child --

                   He points. The porthole is empty.

                                           TERRELL
                             You're crazy -- !

                                           CHEKOV
                             I saw it -- !

                                           TERRELL
                             There's an air-lock.

                   He points and they go into the airlock.

              19   INT. CARGO HOLD                                             19

                   Terrell and Chekov enter, dumbfounded. THEIR POV.
                   Someone lives here -- there are beds, food, all jury-
                   rigged -- but no people. Terrell checks a monitor.

                                           TERRELL
                             There's breathable atmosphere in here.

                   He takes off his helmet; Chekov likewise.

                                           TERRELL
                                     (continuing)
                             What the hell is this? Did they
                             crash? Where's the rest of the
                             ship?

                   They wander as they talk, picking up objects that be-
                   speak a fairly sophisticated ad hoc environment: a
                   laboratory in one hold; a kitchen; A LARGE SAND TANK
                   filled with disgusting CETI EELS.

                   ABRUPTLY A SOUND -- They start: CHILD'S GURGLE.

                                           CHEKOV
                                     (terrified)
                             I told you! I told you I saw a --

                                           TERRELL
                             Ssssh!

                   They start looking. They enter a new chamber --

              20   KHAN'S QUARTERS                                             20

                   On its side in the sand: the walls are now the floor,
                   etc. All in crookedness -- like its owner. On the
                   floor, smiling at them (i.e., the wall) is a BABY.

                   Tentatively they come over to it, looking around --

              21   ANGLE - CHEKOV'S POV                                        21

                   Lethal-looking odd swords on one wall, a bookshelf;
                   CAMERA PANS by 20th Century volumes; MOBY DICK, KING
                   LEAR, THE HOLY BIBLE -- and a seat belt dangling with
                   the name on it -- Botany Bay.

                   Chekov mouths the words, softly at first, then aloud --

                                           CHEKOV
                             Botany Bay -- oh no!

                             What's the matter -- ?

                   Chekov runs, tries to get his helmet on, tries to drag
                   Terrell --

                                           CHEKOV
                             Captain, we've got to get out of
                             here -- now! Damn! Hurry!

                   Terrell catches his urgency --

                                           TERRELL
                             But the child --

                                           CHEKOV
                             Never mind! Hurry!

                   Terrell and Chekov emerge, helmeted, then stop dead.

                   A RING OF SUITED FIGURES has them surrounded.

                   Mr. Beach, the duty officer, stands looking at Ceti
                   Alpha V on the forward screen.

                   Nothing.

                                     (thinks)
                             Let's give them a little more
                             time.

              25   INT. CARGO HOLD - CETI ALPHA V                              25

                   Terrell and Chekov are held by FOUR STRONG MEN.

                   They seem to be waiting. One of the men is JOACHIM.

                   Out of the airlock steps a tall masked figure. A
                   moment of suspense as Terrell and Chekov watch, terri-
                   fied. The mask is peeled back.

                                           CHEKOV
                                     (aloud despite himself)
                             Khan!

                   KHAN is startled by the recognition; comes over and
                   examines Chekov and Terrell.

                                           KHAN
                                     (finally)
                             I don't know you. But you. I never
                             forget a face. Mister Chekov,
                             isn't it?
                                     (wonderingly)
                             I never thought to see your face
                             again.

                             Chekov, who is this man?

                                           CHEKOV
                             A criminal, Captain -- a product of
                             the late 20th Century genetic
                             engineering --

                             What do you want with us? I demand --

                                           KHAN
                                     (mild)
                             You are in a position to demand
                             nothing, sir. I, on the other hand,
                             am in a position to grant nothing.
                             What you see is all that remains of
                             the ship's company and the crew of the
                             Botany Bay, marooned here fifteen
                             years ago by Captain James T. Kirk.

                                           TERRELL
                             Listen to me -- you men and women --

                                           KHAN
                             Save your strength, Captain, these
                             people have sworn to live and die at
                             my command two hundred years before
                             you were born. Do you mean he...
                                      (i.e. Chekov)
                             ... never told you the tale?
                             To amuse you, Captain? Never told
                             you how the Enterprise picked up the
                             Botany Bay, lost in space from the
                             year 1996, myself and the ship's
                             company in cryogenic freeze?

                                           TERRELL
                             I've never even met Admiral Kirk --

                                           KHAN
                             Admiral? He didn't tell you how
                             Admiral Kirk sent seventy of us into
                             exile on this barren sand heap with
                             only the contents of these cargo bays
                             to sustain us?

                                           CHEKOV
                             You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was
                             life, a fair chance to --

                                           KHAN
                             This is Ceti Alpha V! Ceti Alpha VI
                             exploded six months after we were
                             left here. The shock shifted the
                             orbit of this planet and everything
                             was laid waste. Admiral Kirk never
                             bothered to check on our progress.
                             It was only the fact of my genetically
                             engineered intellect that enabled us
                             to survive! On earth, two hundred
                             years ago, I was a prince, with power
                             over millions -- now, like Prometheus
                             I have been left by Admiral Kirk to
                             digest my own entrails.

                                           CHEKOV
                             Captain Kirk was your host! You repaid
                             his hospitality by trying to steal his
                             ship and murder him.

                                           KHAN
                                     (moves closer)
                             And I'll wager he never told you
                             about his shipmate, the beautiful
                             and courageous Lieutenant McGiver,
                             who gave up everything to join me
                             in exile. OUT OF LOVE. And see how
                             Admiral Kirk requited her devotion --
                             She's dead as earth!

                   The wind howls in the silence. When Khan turns, his
                   eyes are filled with tears.

                                           KHAN
                                     (continuing)
                             A plague upon you all.

                   He recovers his poise and returns to them --

                                           KHAN
                                     (continuing)
                             You didn't expect to find me.
                             You thought this was Ceti Alpha VI.
                             Why are you here?

                   They don't answer. Khan goes over to Terrell and, WITH
                   ONE HAND, LIFTS HIM INTO THE AIR --

                                           KHAN
                                     (continuing)
                             Why?

                   Terrell gasps, stays silent --

                                           KHAN
                                     (continuing)
                             No matter.

                   He lets go; Terrell falls with a thud --

                                           KHAN
                                     (continuing)
                             You will soon tell me willingly
                             enough.

                   He goes over to the tank and dips a kind of strainer in,
                   pulling out TWO CETI EELS -- wriggling items --

                                     (continuing)
                             Let me introduce you to Ceti Alpha V's
                             only remaining indigenous life form;
                             what do you think? They've killed
                             twenty of my people, including my
                             beloved wife. Oh, not all at once
                             and not instantly, to be sure. Their
                             young enter through the ears and wrap
                             themselves around the cerebral cortex.
                             This has the effect of rendering the
                             victim extremely susceptible to
                             suggestion. Later, as they grow,
                             follows madness, paralysis -- and
                             death. These are pets, of course --
                             not quite domesticated.

                   As he speaks, Khan dumps an eel in each of their helmets;
                   he swirls the helmets around as though he were mixing
                   martinis --

                                           CHEKOV
                             Khan, listen to me! Captain Kirk
                             was only doing his duty! You --

                                           KHAN
                             There is some pain at first, I am
                             told, and then the effects are quite
                             benign -- until the end. That was
                             what I learned from watching my wife.

                   At a sign, the helmets are slammed down. As the muffled
                   shrieks are heard from within, the eels crawl across
                   the faces of Chekov and Terrell; with unerring in-
                   stincts they head for the ears of the two hapless men.
                   There is some atrocious pain as they enter -- then
                   dazed calm.

                                           KHAN
                                     (continuing)
                             That's better! Now: tell me why
                             you are here -- and tell me where I
                             may find James Kirk.

                             is always an excuse for nostalgia.

                             forward to this for a long time.

                   FEATURING power room separated by glass from the rest
                   of the facilities. Bones, Sulu, Uhura, and some train-
                   ees watch as Kirk inspects one console, clearly the
                   responsibility of the bursting Midshipman Preston.

                                           PRESTON
                                      (blurting)
                             I believe you'll find everything
                             shipshape, Admiral.

                                           KIRK
                                     (sternly puts
                                      him on)
                             Oh do you? Have you any idea,
                             Midshipman Preston, how many times
                             I've had to listen to Mr. Scott on
                             the Comm, telling me his troubles?
                             Have you any idea the ribbing I've
                             had to endure in the officers' mess
                             to the effect that the Enterprise
                             is a flying death trap?

                                           PRESTON
                                     (scandalized)
                             Oh, no, sir! This is the finest
                             engine room in the whole Star --

                   The repressed grins of the others, and a smile on Scotty's
                   face tell Preston he's being had. He stops, confused.

                                           PRESTON
                                     (continuing)
                             If the Admiral can't see the facts
                             for himself, then, with all due
                             respect, he's as blind as a Tiberion
                             bat. SIR.

                   Approving laughter. Kirk looks amused.

                             Midshipman, you're a tiger.

                                           SCOTTY
                             My sister's youngest, Admiral.
                             Crazy to get to space.

                                           KIRK
                             Every young boy's fancy. I seem
                             to remember it myself.
                                     (brisk)
                             Very well. Mr. Scott, are your
                             engines capable of handling a minor
                             training cruise?

                                           SCOTTY
                             Give the word, Admiral.

                                           KIRK
                             Mr. Scott, the word is given.

                                           SCOTTY
                             Aye, sir.

                   He moves off, followed by Preston, who gives one last
                   salute as Kirk leaves, followed by Bones.

                                           BONES
                                     (dry)
                             What about the rest of the
                             inspection, Admiral?

                                           KIRK
                             The inspection will continue once
                             we're underway, Doctor.

                   They step into the Turbo Lifts.

                   The real one, no doubt! CAMERA REVEALS the maze detail:

                   a hum of activity, Uhura and Sulu in familiar chairs,
                   Spock is in the Captain's chair, Saavik in the First
                   Officer's position. Kirk and Bones stand towards the
                   rear.

                             moorings.

                                           SAAVIK

              37   INT. BRIDGE, ENTERPRISE                                     37

                   Saavik watches instruments, punches data in response.

                                           SAAVIK
                             All moorings are clear, Captain.

                                           SPOCK
                             Thank you, Mr. Saavik.

                   Spock casts a glance at Kirk, then, to Saavik:

                                           SPOCK
                                     (continuing)
                             Lieutenant, how many times have you
                             piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?

                                           SAAVIK
                             Never, sir.

                   Kirk tries to conceal his reaction. Spock enjoys it.

                                           SPOCK
                             Take her out, Mr. Saavik.

                                           SAAVIK
                             Aye, sir.

                   Saavik settles herself in the chair, looks again at
                   the console -- Spock looks at Kirk.

                                           SPOCK
                             There's a first time for everything,
                             Admiral.

                                           KIRK

                             To be sure, Captain.

                   They all stifle their responses. Kirk is like a father
                   watching his kid drive the family car for the first time.

                                           SAAVIK
                             Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.

                   Kirk starts to say something, but doesn't. Bones looks
                   at him.

                                           BONES
                                     (sotto voice)
                             Would you like a tranquilizer?

                   Kirk shakes his head, takes a breath --

                                           SULU
                             Ahead one quarter impulse power.

                   The ship clears the dock and begins heading into space.

              42   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE                                      42

                   Kirk quietly lets his breath out.

                                           SULU
                             We are clear and free to navigate.

                                           SAAVIK
                             Course heading, Captain?

                   Spock turns inquiringly to Kirk.

                                           KIRK
                             Captain's discretion.

                   Spock digests this with a slight smile.

                                           SPOCK
                             Mr. Sulu, you may follow your nose.

                   crew of the RELIANT has been replaced by Khan's fol-
                   lowers in their odd-looking clothes.

                   At the helm is Joachim, Khan's lieutenant. He is in the
                   largest and brightest of Khan's group. Terrell sits in

                   Their behavior is normal, save for subtle hesitation,
                   symptoms of their mind-controlled state.

                             years ago, Captain Kirk kindly allowed
                             me to memorize her technical manuals.
                             And now, Mr. Chekov, let us review:
                             You say you have no details of
                             Project 'Genesis' ?

                                           CHEKOV
                             Beyond what I told you, sir, it is
                             classified information.

                                           KHAN
                             Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have
                             access to such information?

                                           CHEKOV
                             I would think so, sir. He's on the
                             Fleet General Staff.

                                           KHAN
                             Then to whom do you report directly
                             regarding Genesis?

                                           CHEKOV
                             To Doctor Marcus, the civilian
                             director of the experiments on Space

                             May I speak? We're all with you,
                             sir, but consider: we are free,
                             we have a ship and the means to
                             go where we will. We have

                             superior intellect and defeated
                             the plans of Admiral Kirk.
                             You do not need to defeat him
                             again.

                             chase him round the moons of Nibia
                             and round the Antares maelstrom and
                             round perdition's flames before I give
                             him up.

                   Huge and busy. Among the scientists going about their
                   tasks are JEDDA, a Deltan; MARCH, thin intense;
                   MADISON, black, easy going. They are all young and
                   earnest. Carol and David huddle over a computer
                   console.

                                           DAVID
                             Does that about do it?

                                           CAROL
                             I don't think there's another piece
                             of information we could squeeze
                             into the memory banks. Next
                             time, we'll design a bigger
                             one.

                                           DAVID
                             Who --

                   Jedda at the Comm Console overlaps.

                                           JEDDA
                             Comm-Pic coming in on hyperchannel
                             ... It's Reliant.

                   Carol moves forward as the others close in.

                                           CAROL
                             On the screen, please, Jedda.

                   Buttons punched; the screen ebbs, flows and crackles
                   on. ON SCREEN is CHEKOV.

                                           CHEKOV
                             ... come in, please. This is Reliant
                             calling Regula I. Repeat. This is
                             USS Reliant --

                                           CAROL
                             Commander, we are receiving. This
                             is Regula I. Go ahead.

                                           CHEKOV
                             Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route
                             to you and should be there in three
                             days.

                                           CAROL
                             En route? Why? We weren't expecting
                             you for another three months. Has
                             something happened?
                                     (pause)
                             Has something happened? Do you read 
                             us?

                                     (fractional pause)
                             All went well. Nothing has happened.
                             Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.

                   Pleased reaction from the scientists.

                                           CAROL
                             I still don't under --

                                           CHEKOV
                             We have received new orders. Upon our
                             arrival at Regula I, all materials of
                             Project Genesis will be transferred to
                             this ship for immediate testing at
                             Ceti Alpha VI.

                   Consternation in the lab. David is livid -- the words
                   "Bullshit" are overlapped  by his mother.

                                           CAROL
                             Will you please be quiet!
                                     (back to console)
                             Commander Chekov, this is completely
                             irregular. Who gave the order you
                             are quoting? Who gave the order?

                                           CHEKOV
                                     (still smiling)
                             The order comes from Starfleet
                             command, Dr. Marcus, direct from
                             the General Staff.

                                           CAROL
                             But Genesis is a civilian project,
                             under my control --

                                           CHEKOV
                             I have my orders.

                                           DAVID
                             Pin him down, mother! Who gave the
                             orders!?

                   Chekov hesitates, seems to be listening to someone off
                   the monitor.

                                           CHEKOV
                             The orders come from Admiral James
                             T. Kirk.

                   Sensation in the lab.

                                           DAVID
                             I knew it! I knew it! All along
                             the military has wanted to get their
                             hands on this --

                   He starts to press a button; Carol pushes his hand
                   away and communicates herself.

                                           CAROL
                             This is completely improper,
                             Commander Chekov. I have no
                             intention of allowing Reliant or
                             any other unauthorized personnel
                             access to our work or materials.

                                           CHEKOV
                                     (pauses; listens)
                             I'm sorry you feel that way, Doctor.
                             Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed.
                             Please prepare to deliver Genesis to
                             us upon our arrival. Reliant out.

                   The image fades.

                             You realize, sir, that they will
                             attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and
                             confirm the order.

                   Khan smiles, more charming than ever as we move in.

                             Will you please be quiet! We must
                             have order here.
                                     (as they subside)
                             This has to be some sort of mistake.

                             Mistake? We're all alone here.
                             They waited until everyone was on
                             shift-leave to do this. Reliant is
                             supposed to be at our disposal, not
                             vice-versa.

                             It seems clear that Starfleet never
                             intended that --

                             I know, but --

                                           DAVID
                             I've tried to warn you. Scientists
                             are always pawns of the military --

                             Starfleet has kept the peace for
                             a hundred years, I cannot and
                             will not subscribe to your 
                             interpretation of this event.

                   Silence.

                                     (Deltan cool)
                             You may be right, Doctor, but what
                             about Reliant? She's on her way.

                   Carol reacts: this is certainly true.

                                           CAROL
                             Get your gear together where it's
                             handy.

                                           CAROL
                             That's for us to know and Reliant
                             to find out. We have only three
                             days. Let's not waste time.

                   They split off in different directions as ordered.

                   Kirk waits for the Turbo Lift, which opens at last. As
                   he gets in --

                                           SAAVIK'S VOICE
                             Hold please -- !

                   Kirk holds and Saavik dashes in. She is surprised to
                   see him.

                                           SAAVIK
                                     (continuing)
                             Thank you, sir.

                   Kirk nods, the doors close. There is an uneasy forced
                   intimacy between them.

                                           KIRK
                             Lieutenant, are you wearing your
                             hair differently?

                                           SAAVIK
                             It is still regulation, Admiral.

                   She reaches out and touches a button. The lift stops.

                             Lieutenant, self-expression does not
                             seem to be one of your problems.

                                           SAAVIK
                             I wish to thank you for the high 
                             efficiency rating.

                             I did not think so.

                             I failed to resolve the situation.

                             There is no correct resolution.
                             It is a test of character.

                                           SAAVIK
                             May I ask how you dealt with the
                             test?

                             That was a little joke.

                             Humor... that is a difficult concept
                             ... it is not logical...

                   She's a laugh a minute. Kirk pushes the button; the
                   elevator starts.

                   She studies him, considering. No doubt about it, the
                   attraction is mutual and she has no idea how to handle
                   it.

                                           SAAVIK
                             Yes.

                   The lift stops and the doors open.

                   He reacts to them. Saavik exits demurely.

                                           SAAVIK
                             Thank you, sir.

                   Bones enters and the doors close. Kirk studies the
                   ceiling.

                   Kirk says nothing.

                             That is wise. In any case, were I
                             to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates
                             that the needs of the many outweigh
                             the needs of the few.

                   Scotty stands there, tears streaming down his face;
                   he holds the body of Midshipman Preston. Both of them

                   by, his lips trembling. Preston opens his eyes, sees
                   Scotty and Kirk.

                   and tricorders.

                   For a moment they look around, seeing emptiness. Like
                   being in a haunted house.

                   place, like a scuba diver exploring a cave. We want
                   him to go back.

                   A NOISE. Bones reacts with brave apprehension.

                   Rounding a corner, he starts: A RAT scuttles right in
                   front of him.

                   Bones sighs with relief and moves forward. We think
                   he's safe.

                   SUDDENLY SOMETHING FALLS RIGHT ON HIS FACE: an upside

                   Kirk helps Bones cut down the last of the five BODIES
                   from where they were hanged, upside down.

                   Having recovered his composure, Bones examines the

                             you for the death of his wife...

                                           KIRK
                             I know what he blames me for.
                                     (thinks)
                             The escape pods are all in place.
                                     (looks around)
                             Where's the transporter room?

             122   INT. SPACE STATION TRANSPORTER ROOM                        122

                   Kirk, wearing his spectacles, studies the transporter
                   consoles. ANGLE WIDENS TO REVEAL the transporter pods,
                   and the others, b.g.

                                           KIRK
                             Did he make it down here?

                   Chekov and Terrell look at each other; they seem a bit
                   stronger.

                                           CHEKOV
                             It was not my impression. He spent
                             most of his time trying to wring the
                             information out of the people.

                   Saavik approaches Kirk:

                                           SAAVIK
                             Anything?

                   Kirk looks at her over the rims of the glasses:

                                           KIRK
                             Somebody left the unit on. If
                             everyone else was dead, it implies
                             that no one remained to turn it off.
                             Those people back there bought escape
                             time for Genesis with their lives.

                   Saavik studies the console.

                                           SAAVIK
                             It doesn't make sense. These
                             coordinates are well within
                             Regula -- a plantoid we know to be
                             lifeless and airless.

                                           KIRK
                                     (wheels turn)
                             If Stage Two was completed, it was
                             underground -- she said it was going
                             to be underground.

                                           SAAVIK
                             Stage Two of what?

                   Kirk gets it.

                                           KIRK
                                     (on communicator)
                             Kirk to Enterprise. Damage report,
                             Spock?

                                           SPOCK'S VOICE
                             Admiral, if we go by the book, like
                             Lieutenant Saavik, hours could seem
                             like days.

                                           KIRK
                                     (beat)
                             I read you, Captain. Let's have it.

                   Fractional pause.

                                           SPOCK'S VOICE
                             The situation is grave, Admiral. We
                             won't have main power for six days
                             at least. Auxiliary power has
                             temporarily failed, but maybe we can
                             restore that in two days. By the
                             book, Admiral.

                   Kirk frowns.

                                           KIRK
                             Meaning you can't even beam us back?

                                           SPOCK'S VOICE
                             Not at present.

                   Kirk looks at Saavik and Bones, decides --

                                           KIRK
                             Captain Spock, if you do not hear
                             from us within one hour your orders
                             are to restore what power you can,
                             take the Enterprise to the nearest
                             Star Base and alert Starfleet
                             command when you are out of jamming

                             Sir -- we won't leave you behind...!

                                           KIRK
                             Uhura, if you don't hear from us,
                             there won't be anybody behind. Kirk
                             out.
                                     (to Terrell and Chekov)
                             You gentleman can remain here, or...

                                           TERRELL
                             If it's all the same, Admiral, we'd
                             like to share the risk.

                                           KIRK
                                     (hesitates)
                             Very well. Let's go.

                                           BONES
                             Go? Where are we going?

                                           KIRK
                                     (points to console)
                             Where they went. Saavik.

                   Kirk walks onto the pods as Saavik works the console,
                   rolling in electronic coding. The others join Kirk.

                                           BONES
                             But what if they went -- nowhere?

                                           KIRK
                             Then this will be your big chance
                             to get away from it all.

                                           SAAVIK
                             Ready.

                   She presses a button, joins them on the pods. Slowly
                   they VANISH.

             123   EXT. SPACE - THE PLANTOID REGULA                           123

                   CAMERA MOVES TOWARD it as the BEAM SOUND continues,
                   with irregularity. The plantoid is ugly and dead.
                   The sound frightens us, and climaxes with:

             124   INT. ROCKY CAVERN - REGULA                                 124

                   The BEAM SOUND screeches, then settles into its comfort-
                   able mode as the FIVE FIGURES FLUCTUATE, FADE, then
                   APPEAR. They look around in wonder and relief.

                                           SAAVIK
                             Admiral --

                   She indicates something O.S. They cross as CAMERA
                   reveals a cave wall stacked with technical materials
                   and crowned by a LARGE PROJECTILE, a giant version
                   of the model we saw earlier. They stare. (N.B. FEATURE
                   GENESIS ARMING CONTROL BOX.)

                                           BONES
                             Genesis, I presume.

                   They walk by a group of crates. It all happens very
                   fast: David leaps out and tackles Kirk, throwing him to
                   the ground and landing atop him, a knife at his throat.

                   At the same time, Bones and Saavik reach for their
                   phasers, but Jedda, already armed, steps out. He has
                   them covered and helpless.

                                           DAVID
                             You're the sonavabitch who
                             committed mass murder up there.

                   He raises the knife --

                                           KIRK
                             I'm Admiral Kirk...

                                           DAVID
                             We were still there, you dumb
                             bastard! We could hear the screams
                             all the way to the transporter room --

                   Again he raises the knife --

                                           KIRK
                             Where's Dr. Marcus --

                                           DAVID
                             I'm Doctor Marcus!

                   Carol reaches the tunnel entrance to the cave --

                                           CAROL
                             David --

                                           DAVID
                             Mother, go back!

                   Carol sees Kirk --

                                           CAROL
                             Jim --

                                           DAVID
                             Go back. I'm going to kill him.

                                           CAROL
                                     (takes a breath)
                             You do that and you'll have murdered
                             your father.

                   All react. David and Kirk, facing each other, are
                   turned to stone. Bones, Jedda and Chekov turn to look
                   at Carol, wondering. Terrell very casually takes the
                   phaser from Jedda.

             126   NEW ANGLE (FORMERLY SCENE 134)                             126

                             I'll hold onto this.

                   But Kirk and Carol ignore them and walk towards each
                   other. There are tears in Carol's eyes. She reaches
                   up, trying to smile and touches his hair --

                                           CAROL
                             You've got a little grey --

                   She can't. Kirk takes her and holds her tightly, look-
                   ing at David, over her shoulder. He stands there,
                   stunned, looking back.

                                           KIRK
                             Carol. Is that true?

                   She nods --

                             She's making it up! My father was
                             Professor --

                                           CAROL
                             David, you're just making this
                             harder --

                                           TERRELL
                             I'm afraid it's even harder than you
                             think, Doctor.

                   He and Chekov have their phasers trained on them.

                                           TERRELL
                                     (continuing)
                             Please don't move --

                             I'm sorry, Admiral.

                   Terrell speaks into his wrist recorder.

                                           TERRELL
                             Your excellency, have you been
                             listening?

                             I have indeed, Captain. You have
                             done well...

                                           DAVID
                             I knew it -- !

                   David makes a reckless break for Terrell; Saavik
                   instantly throws herself on him bringing him down as
                   Terrell fires, hitting Jedda, who was behind David --
                   a killing ray. Jedda dematerializes. Carol SCREAMS
                   and David reacts with horror and guilt.

                   Most importantly, Chekov begins to tremble. Terrell
                   himself is shaken by his reflexive action. He's in
                   semi-panic.

                   speaks into his console.

                             the delay?

                                           TERRELL
                             All is well, sir. You have the
                             coordinates to beam up Genesis...

                             First things first, Captain. Kill
                             Admiral Kirk.

                   Reactions by all -- only Kirk and Bones are unsurprised.
                   David and Saavik, dazed, fight the urge to do something.
                   Chekov is close to a seizure. Terrell fights conflicting
                   mental signals.

                                           TERRELL
                             Excellency... it is difficult.
                             I try to obey, but --

                                           KHAN'S VOICE
                             Kill him.

                   As though tearing off a leach, Terrell grabs at the
                   wrist recorder and flings it to the ground. A shock-
                   wave of pain hits Terrell. He recovers, trembling and
                   tries to obey. Chekov is shaking badly. Terrell aims
                   his phaser at Kirk. Chekov slowly raises his phaser
                   and aims at Terrell, though his hands are like lead.
                   We THINK Chekov is going to do the right thing. Then,
                   shockingly: Terrell turns his phaser on himself.

                                           KHAN'S VOICE
                                     (still emanates from

                             Kill him, Terrell. Now.

                   Terrell does, blowing himself into oblivion.

                   He SCREAMS, horribly, drops his phaser, clutching his
                   head.

                   Bones leaps to his side, pulls an injection device from
                   his belt pack, jabs it into Chekov's arm. Chekov,
                   almost with a sigh of relief, drops.

                                           KHAN'S VOICE

                   Horror from all. Kirk picks up a phaser. As the eel
                   clears Chekov, he fires and destroys it. He shudders,
                   then sees the wrist recorder and grabs it.

                   Khan reacts to Kirk's VOICE: electronic shock. He
                   clutches the communicator, his eye-whites rolling.

                             keep missing the target.

                   In the Rocky Cavern the transporter beam locks on to the
                   Genesis torpedo and its arming control box.

                   As Kirk and the others watch, horrified, Khan beams up
                   the materials. David tries to reach the torpedo, but
                   Saavik holds him fast --

                   alone.

                             and the Lieutenant our idea of food.

                                           DAVID
                             But we can't just sit here -- !

                             Oh, yes we can. Is there really
                             something to eat?

                   David looks at his father, who checks his watch, putting
                   on his spectacles.

                                           CAROL
                             David. Please.

                                     (to Kirk)
                             This is just to give us something
                             to do, isn't it?
                                     (he shrugs)
                             Come on.

                   Saavik and Bones make to follow. Saavik turns to Kirk --

                   Carol sits on the ground, Chekov's head in her lap,
                   looking at Kirk.

                                           CAROL
                             David was right, wasn't he? It's
                             just to keep them busy.

                                           KIRK
                             Why? Why didn't you tell me?

                                           CAROL
                             How can you ask me that? Were we
                             together? Where we going to be?
                             You had your world and I had mine.
                             I wanted him in mine, not chasing
                             through the universe with his father.

                   Kirk turns away, overcome. She watches him.

                                           CAROL
                                     (continuing)
                             He's a lot like you in many ways.
                             Nothing I could do about it. He's
                             smarter, of course; that goes without
                             saying. Most of Genesis is really
                             his.

                   Her joke doesn't take effect. He doesn't turn.

                                           CAROL
                                     (continuing)
                             This is it, isn't it? We're never
                             going to get out of here.

                   Kirk says nothing.

                                           CAROL
                                     (continuing)
                             Please. Tell me what you're feeling.

                   Kirk hesitates, comes back and sits next to Chekov; he
                   changes Bones' compress on the ear as he finally speaks.

                                           KIRK
                             There's a man I haven't seen in
                             fifteen years who thinks he's killed
                             me. You show me a son who'd almost be
                             happy to help him. My son. My life
                             that could have been and wasn't. What
                             am I feeling? I'm feeling old --
                             worn out.

                   Carol studies him; gently she sets Chekov's head down
                   on a sweater, then stands.

                                           CAROL
                             Let me show you something that will
                             make you feel young -- young as when
                             the world was new.

                   She offers her hand. Kirk looks at Chekov, who smiles,
                   faint assurance.

                                           CAROL
                                     (continuing)
                             He'll be all right. Come.

                   After a moment's hesitation, Kirk takes her hand and
                   she leads him to the tunnel.

                   TRUCKING BEFORE Carol and Kirk. A rising light falls
                   on their faces as they walk, then run with excitement
                   toward the source. Kirk races ahead...

                   toward an iridescent light at its end, blindingly
                   beautiful with color.

                   INTERCUT: THESE TWO ANGLES until WE CAN HARDLY WAIT
                   for Kirk to reach the end of the tunnel, and then,
                   when it does:

                   where the rock tunnel ends. Kirk comes out of the
                   tunnel, and his mouth drops open.

                   A huge cavern. Kirk is actually standing at the middle
                   of it. Space extends vastly above and below his point
                   of view. Like Eden, lush growth everywhere, water-
                   falls, and a cobalt blue sky high, high above where a
                   round orb glows sending light and warmth downward.
                   There is a path from where Kirk stands down to the lower
                   level where Bones, and the others are waiting and calling
                   to him. Mist and haze waft gently across the cavern.

                             His pattern indicates two dimensional

                   Reliant in purplish mass, banking slightly, completing
                   a long turn, then boring ahead.

                   As Reliant emerges from the dark blue mass into a clear
                   almost tranquil place. Reliant, moving slowly, stops,
                   as if looking around.

                   Now, behind Reliant and from below, like a great whale
                   rising from the depths, Enterprise rises vertically,
                   slowly passing the unsuspecting enemy. When Enterprise

                   In f.g., chillingly, Khan rises INTO SHOT by the main

                   As Uhura's voice continues O.S., Khan pulls himself
                   into a chair at the console, one of his hands useless

                   Outside the glass, Scotty and Bones screaming:

                   WE CAN SEE the silent urging of Bones and Scotty.
                   Spock is oblivious. Amid the fire-blue arcs, he moves 
                   to the control panel. Between his hands and the con-
                   trols, power arcs insanely. Spock is in an inferno,
                   a radiation hell, fighting now with all his strength
                   to control it. Slowly, the damping rods move out.
                   Spock moves to a manual control, begins to turn it.

                   of to control the pain, continuing to work --

                   The bridge doors open and Carol appears. Instinctively

                   Kirk emerges to encounter Scotty and Bones. Their
                   looks tell him. He sees the flashing light over the
                   Reactor Room. He dashes for the control panel. Bones
                   grabs him.

                                           SCOTTY

                   With stunned understanding, Kirk stumbles to the door,
                   sees Spock on his knees, hands blackened, face cracked
                   with radiation lines and scars.

                   Spock shakes his head. With a feeble hand he reaches
                   the intercom button: filtered communication.

                   his face.

                   He props a hand on the glass to support himself. Kirk's
                   hand reflexively goes to match Spock's on the other side
                   of the glass --

                             nourish. He did not feel that
                             sacrifice a vain or empty one --

                             wisdom, in these proceedings. Of
                             my friend, I can only say this, that

                   He tries to go on, but catches Bones' face: Bones is
                   streaming tears. Kirk can't go on.

                             Aye, sir.

                             Understood, sir.

                             Dismiss the company.

                   They salute. She about-faces as Kirk walks towards
                   the  Turbo Lift. Saavik issues dismissal and posting 
                   orders, but WE TRUCK with Kirk until CAMERA STOPS and
                   he leaves FRAME and WE HOLD on David. He finally
                   understands.

             245   INT. KIRK'S QUARTERS                                       245

                   After a long moment, the CAMERA DISCOVERS Kirk. He
                   pours a drink, then decides not to have it.

                   He sits wearily, not knowing how to shake the ghosts.
                   Then he sees the book.

                   Kirk picks up the battered volume, the gift from his
                   friend, and closes his eyes a moment. Almost idly
                   he starts turning pages, looking for a clue. But he
                   can't see the writing -- he rummages through his
                   pockets and pulls out the half-glasses --

                   One of the lenses is broken. It has a deep impact on
                   Kirk. He puts down the book and glasses and covers
                   his eyes.

                   A SOFT BONG. Kirk clears his throat.

                                           KIRK
                             Yes... come.

                   The door whooshes open and closes to admit David. The
                   last person Kirk expected to see.

                                           DAVID
                             I don't mean to intrude.

                             Uh, no...

                             I should be on the bridge.

                                           DAVID
                             Are you running away from me?

                   David's strength is turning a corner with Kirk --

                                           KIRK
                             I suppose I was.

                             I poured a drink. Would you like
                             it?

                                           DAVID
                             No. I -- I guess I'm not what you
                             expected.

                             I didn't expect anything.

                                           DAVID
                             That makes two of us.
                                     (he studies his
                                      father)
                             Lieutenant Saavik was right: you
                             never have faced death --

                                           KIRK
                                     (hoarse)
                             Not like this -- no. I haven't faced
                             death, I cheated death. I tricked
                             my way out of death and patted myself
                             on the back for my ingenuity. I
                             know nothing.

                                           DAVID
                             You knew enough to tell Saavik that
                             how we face death is at least as
                             important as how we face life --

                             It was just words.

                                           DAVID
                             But good words. That's where ideas
                             begin. Maybe you should listen to
                             them.

                             I'm trying, David.

                                           DAVID
                             So am I. My friends were killed,
                             too.

                             I am truly sorry.

                   Pause. They study each other.

                                           DAVID
                             I was wrong about you. And I'm
                             sorry.

                                           KIRK
                             Is that what you came here to say?

                                           DAVID
                             Mainly.
                                     (he starts out,
                                      then turns -- )
                             And also that I'm proud -- very
                             proud -- to be your son.

                   A stunned moment, then Kirk lets it all hang out: for
                   David, for Carol and for Spock. He hugs his son, hold-
                   ing onto him as if to life itself.

                   The door whooshes. Kirk strides on the bridge, David
                   with him. Carol is there with Bones; they are glad at

                             around and...

                                           SAAVIK
                             Aye, sir --

                   She takes him off, deadpan amusement --

                             So you turn out to be the dumb
                             bastard.

                   They stare at her.

                                           SAAVIK
                                     (continuing)
                             That is a little joke.

                   Kirk has a smile. He joins Bones and Carol facing the
                   screen.
