          Credits start on a black screen, then they continue during the
          whole scene at Michelle's place, and they end at the beginning of
          the scene at Bill Capa's office.
                         
          MICHELLE'S PLACE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Close-up on a silver lipstick stand made into a bad taste musical
          box. We see Michelle's hand selecting a lipstick then we see
          Michelle putting the lipstick on her lips, seated in front of the
          mirror of her dressing table. She is dressed in a green frock, and
          her face shows that she is quite disturbed.
           Her apartment's decoration is very heavy, with a lot of various
          useless objects and gold-plated furniture and many mirrors.
           She looks for a new dress in her wardrobe, and get mad at not
          finding it. She then goes to a sofa covered with cushions, which
          she throws all around the place, still madder at not finding her
          dress. A cat, who was lying on the armrest of the sofa, runs away
          hurriedly from the mad Michelle.
                         
                          MICHELLE
           God !...... No !......
                         
          Michelle is back in front of the mirror of her dressing-table. She
          takes the lipstick and put a lot of it on her lips, then on her
          teeth, then all around her mouth. She makes faces to herself in
          the mirror. She seems more and more disturbed.
           She takes a chrome-plated revolver in her drawer, starts to put
          it in her purse, then takes it out, spins the cylinder of the
          revolver, and puts the revolver in her mouth, as if she wanted to
          kill herself. But instead, she starts sucking the barrel, while
          she strokes the revolver in a quite erotic way.
                         
          BILL CAPA' OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Large planes of ground glass. We hear, without understanding them,
          some voices and laughs. Then a male voice becomes more
          understandable...
                         
                          BILL'S VOICE
           So who do you think is the enemy ?... No, no, give me a
           specific answer...
                         
          ... then Michelle appears on the screen. She is dressed in a green
          suit, she is heavily made up, et she still seems very disturbed.
           The office is very chic and evidently belongs to a very rich New-
          York psycho-analyst. Beautiful and good taste furniture. Shelves
          with leather-bound books.
                         
                          MICHELLE
           You are the goddamned enemy, Capa, you and this all tower
           of psycho-babble. You know what I hope ? That God gets real
           pissed off and He shrivels up your cock, so that it points
           straight down to Hell, where you belongs !...
                         
          During this reply, Bill Capa has appeared on the screen. He is
          seated. He is wearing a long-sleeve shirt, a necktie, but no
          jacket. He laughs at Michelle's last sentence.
                         
                          BILL
           OK... Michelle, so you will become His Avenging Angel, and
           swoop down to finish me off.
          He stands up.
                         
                          MICHELLE
           Now, I finally get it : you're are like my ex-husband. You
           think that everything got to be either black or white
           because you got color-blind. But God is on my side now. He
           knows I'm not like you
                         
                          BILL
           Well, we are pretty much the same, Michelle. We all do it.
                         
                          MICHELLE
           We all do what ?
                         
                          BILL
           Tend to view our lives as we were looking through a
           keyhole. I's a very limited view of the truth. So, we have
           to fill in the blanks. We invent things.
                         
                          MICHELLE
           I don't know what you mean.
                         
                          BILL
           You invent enemies to test your strength against. You
           invent gods to protect you from these enemies.
                         
                          MICHELLE
          Cutting him.
           What a depressing view of life you have, that is such
           horse-shit !
                         
                          BILL
           Who is the enemy ? One minute you have friends, the next
           moment they've slipped away. You leave here and I wonder
           who is Michelle really hating this week. I try to remember
           and I can't bring it to mind. Do you know why ?
                         
                          MICHELLE
           No, why don't you tell me
                         
                          BILL
           Take a look in the mirror, Michelle
                         
                          MICHELLE
           Which mirror ?... This mirror ?...
                         
                          BILL
           Any mirror. Tell me what you see.
                         
                          MICHELLE
          We see Michelle as if we were watching her from behind the mirror.
           I see... I see your reflection over my shoulder... I see... there
           is nothing much that I really like... I think I prefer the
           view outside actually...
                         
          During this last reply, Bill, standing up, is fidgeting with
          something on his desk. At Michelle's last words, he turns toward
          her, looking alarmed. But he doesn't have time to do prevent her
          from breaking through the glass pane and jumping outside. He yells
          «Michelle» twice.
                         
          A STREET IN NEW-YORK - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          We see Michelle's body falling all the way down. Capa's office
          must be around the 25th floor. The body crashes on the street. A
          police horse, who was near the impact, rears up in fright. As if
          the asphalt were translucent, we see Michelle's body from
          underneath, with the blood flowing around it.
                         
                          SEVERAL VOICES
           All right, get back there... Stay back !... Get back in your
           car... Stop it...
                         
          BILL CAPA'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          We see Bill with tears in his eyes. He walks to the broken window,
          and look outside.
                         
                          BILL
          Voice over.
           My God, it was the reddest blood I ever saw, poured around
           her green dress. And... Then the red disappeared...
                         
          OPHTHALMOLOGIST'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill is seated with a huge ophthalmologic device on his head. He
          finishes the preceding reply.
                          BILL
           Christ, Ed. It was like a vibration of color broadcast from
           Hell. And then the red started to fade away.
                         
          The ophthalmologist moves the device away. We see Bill's face, and
          behind him, projected on the wall, an abstract drawing made of
          colored spots close together. The red spots start to blink and
          then they become grey.
                         
          LARRY'S PLACE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          It is the apartment of an old New-York intellectual. A bit messy.
          A old Earth globe on a stand. Objects and books everywhere, but
          with an warm atmosphere. Larry wears an open shirt and a sweater.
          Bill also is in open shirt, with a sleeveless sweater. At the
          beginning of the scene, Bill is lying on a couch.
                         
                          LARRY
           Poor Capa ! You're here for me to pity you.
                         
          Larry puts down the newspaper he was reading. It is the New York
          Post. On the front page, a title in large prints : «Patient's
          family sues Manhattan shrink»
                         
                          BILL
           Hell, yes. It doesn't take Sigmund Freud to figure out I
           don't care to see the color of my patients' blood.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm a little surprised that this happened to you.
                         
                          BILL
           Starts to stand up.
           Sure. You always thought I was a cold-hearted son of a
           bitch.
                         
                          LARRY
           Not really, but there is a kind of arrogance here.
          Bill laughs.
           Do you really believe that you're responsible for her
           illness. You were a small recent part of her life.
                         
                          BILL
           Yes, that's right, that's right. But it's all too fucking
           glib for me, Larry. I cannot dispose of this woman that
           easily.
                         
                          LARRY
           Well, you always were a romantic. Are you involved with
           anyone else ?
                         
          Larry starts to make tea in a corner of the room. Bill is seated
          on an armchair during the following reply, and strokes the grey
          cat who is lying on the table.
                         
                          BILL
           No. I am still a romantic. I just don't have anybody to be
           romantic with. They want to fuck me or marry me... None of
           them want to love me
                          LARRY
           Maybe you don't want to be loved. You had a happy marriage
           once.
                         
                          BILL
           She loved me to death. Then she ran off and loved somebody
           else to death.
                         
                          LARRY
           Of course, there is something else here. To deny red is to
           deny emotion.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh yeah !
                         
                          LARRY
           As you know, that could be very dangerous.
                         
          Bill stands up.
                         
                          BILL
           Yes, yes, I know. Very dangerous. I know and I have got
           something broken. I know it's gonna take some time to get
           fixed.
                         
          He picks up his jacket on a chair and put it on.
                         
                          LARRY
           You're a pretty good therapist. How long does it take a man
           like you to forgive himself.
                         
                          BILL
           I see you when I get back from Los Angeles.
                         
          During the two last replies, Bill has walked to the front door.
                         
                          LARRY
           Don't run away because of one treatment failure.
                         
                          BILL
           I'm not running away, Larry, it's just a little trip to Los
           Angeles. Besides, you can't really run away. It's all up
           here, isn't it...
          He shows his forehead and pretends he is shooting a bullet in it.
           Pow !... It's a package deal. The head goes with me.
                         
          ABOVE L.A. - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Shot of L.A. seen from the sky, then shot of an airplane landing.
          On these two short shots, we hear :
                         
                          STEWARDESS
           Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to Los Angeles. Please remain
           seated until the aircraft comes...
                         
          The end of the sentence is not understandable, because it is mixed
          with the sound of a radio set in a car.
                         
           VOICE IN THE RADIO
           Just another Monday in paradise. There is a fender-bender
           on 405, slowing thing down.
                         
          TAXI IN A TRAFFIC JAM - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          The voice in the radio is covered by the voice of the taxi driver.
          He wears a French cap and a striped shirt. He has a strong foreign
          accent, which makes his sentences a bit hard to understand. Bill
          is seated at the back of the taxi. He is wearing a black polo
          shirt, jeans and sunglasses.
                         
                          TAXI DRIVER
           Hey ! Jerk-off ! What are you looking at ! There's an
           accident !...
          Short shot of the accident.
           ... Hey ! What happened ? Anybody is hurt ? Anybody is dead ?
          Car horns. A car bumps into the back of the taxi. Bill moves
          forward and backward, and then massages the back of his head.
           What are you doing ? You 're looking there and driving
           here ? Put the pedal on the metal... Asshole !
                         
          BOB'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
          Bob's office is located in a big modern building in downtown L.A.
          A wide sitting room, called «Group Room» is reserved for group
          therapy sessions. Furniture is modern and functional, but with a
          little personal touch.
           Close-up of a woman's hand, who steals a lighter on a table. Then
          we see Sondra putting covertly the lighter in her purse. She is
          dressed in a very elegant way, and wears expensive jewels. Richie,
          a teenagers with a large checkered floating shirt, a sleeveless
          denim jacket and walkman earphones on his head, walks behind her
          without looking at her, and gets seated in an armchair. We hear
          voices, but we understand only a few words here and there. Then a
          voice becomes clearer than the other ones. It is Clark's voice
          counting the books on a shelf.
                         
           BITS OF CONVERSATION

                          CLARK
          He is dressed with a very neat grey suit. Everything on him is
          neat : not a hair going the wrong way.

                          CASEY
          He is seated on an armchair shaped like a giant hand. He looks ver

          Talking to Bill.
           Funny... Oh, fucking laugh !...We're entertaining the shit out

                          SONDRA
           Why don't you stop feeling responsible for everyone.
                         
                          BUCK
           Would you stop wound-licking, Sondra.
                         
                          SONDRA
          She seems a bit shocked.

                          BOB

                          BUCK
           I lost my wife... and daughter... And it just can't seem to
           pass... All right ?
                         
                          BILL
           Very sorry. How did they die ?
                         
                          BUCK
           They say...
          He starts crying.
           ... I... I can't talk about it...
                         
          Sondra turns her head away : she looks disturbed and moved. Clark
          wipes his eyes.
                         
                          BOB

                          CASEY
          He talks in articulating his words in an affected manner.
           I am Casey Heinz. I am a painter. I live in a loft
           downtown, and I guess... you could say... I'm alienated...
          At the end of his reply, he seems to be ready to cry. He puts his
          head in his hands, then shows his laughing face.
                         
                          SONDRA

           Does a bear poop in the woods ? I sit next to Clark
                         
          He moves to sit behind Clark. He lights a cigarette.
                         
                          CLARK
           And then smoke up a storm. My name is Clark. I'm a lawyer.
           And I... I have a compulsive obsessive disorder.
                         
                          CASEY
           So what's the problem ?
          He sneers.
                         
                          CLARK
           The problem is that if you and Buck are going to smoke in
           here, then the door to Doctor Moore's office must remain
           opened in minimum of fifteen inches.
                         
          Buck comes and sits next to Casey. They smoke together.
                         
                          SONDRA
           I can't stand smoke... OK ?
                         
          Buck and Casey puff clouds of smoke.
                         
                          CLARK
           And I would also like to suggest that you buy one of those
           ashtrays...
                         
                          SONDRA
           How come you don't listen to Clark ? How come you don't do
           anything about this, Bob ?
                         
                          CLARK
           ... that sucks up the smoke and purifies it. They cost nine
           dollars and ninety-nine cents, half of which is four-
           ninety-nine point five.
                         
                          CASEY
                         HE LAUGHS
           He's going to open the door.
                         
                          CLARK
           One of you will have to pay an extra penny, but I'm sure
           you can work that out.
                          CASEY
           He's going to open the door.
                         
                          CLARK
           I'm going to open the door.
                         
          General laugh. Several incomprehensible words. We understand only
          Sondra's next reply.
                         
                          SONDRA
           You smell like an ashtray.
                         
                          CLARK
           You know, if you don't act more seriously in groups.
                         
          Richie enters the room.

           Bill... What would you like to tell us about yourself ?
                         
          Richie walks behind Bill to reach his seat.
                         
                          BILL
           Well... I have plenty of problems... the biggest of which right
           now is jet-lag. So I think I'll pass for now, Bob.

          BOB' OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          The end of the preceding scene fades in the beginning of this one.
          We are now later in the same day. Night has come. The atmosphere
          seems more relax. Buck is half lying on a sofa. Sondra is
          finishing her story with a sweet voice, and does not simper
          anymore.
                         
                          SONDRA
           ...She's like a daughter to me... We hang out... Meaning that...
           It's wonderful...
                         
                          BOB
          He looks at this watch.
           Well, that's all for tonight. I'll see you all next week...
                          BUCK
           Way to go.
                         
          Bob gets up very quickly. Everyone does like him, but more slowly.
          Bob turns back before he leaves the room.
                         
                          BOB
           Bill... I'll be with you in a couple of minutes.
          Bill nods in agreement.

          He whispers.
           Nine.
                         
          Bill remains seated and nods to the people getting out. Clark
          remains, behind Bill, in front of the shelves. He puts something
          back in a plastic bag and mumbles something we don't understand.
          Bill turns toward him.
                         
                          CLARK
           Have you read Bob's book ?

           No, I haven't.
                         
                          CLARK
          He puts the bag in the pocket of this jacket, and takes a book on
          a shelf. He gives it to Bill.
           It's really... it's quite excellent.
                         
                          BILL
           "Way to go"... I'm glad to hear you liked it.
                         
                          CLARK
          He wipes his hand with a white handkerchief, wipes the handle of
          his black leather case before taking it, and then puts the
          handkerchief in the pocket of his pants.
           Very much. Good night, Doctor Capa.
                         
                          BILL
          Bill holds his hand out, but Clark does not take it. He just nods
          in a friendly way and goes out.
           Good night.
          Alone, Bill flips through the books.
                         
          IN FRONT OF BOB'S OFFICE BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bill and Bob come out of the building where Bob's office is
          located. Bob has his jacket on and Bob is wearing a brown leather
          jacket. He is carrying his traveling bags.
                          BILL
           Alone at last !...

                          BILL
           Well, nobody jumped out of the window. So maybe I am making
           progress...
                         
          BOB'S CAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bob's expensive convertible Mercedes starts away. On the back
          license plate, we can read «WAY TO GO». The roof of the car is
          open. The rest of the scene takes place inside the car driving
          through Los Angeles.
                         
                          BOB

          Bill laughs.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          A huge sliding metallic door, with spikes on the top, moves
          smoothly to let the car enter. Bill seems impressed by the
          residence of his friend. He looks at the security camera. Bob
          stops the car and they get out of it. Bill takes his luggage.
                         
                          BILL
           It's all one place ?...
          They come near a door shaped like a giant keyhole.
           Goddamn...
          A metallic gate slides behind the door to let them in.
           Like peeking through a keyhole...
          They get down a few steps and reach a lawn.
           You get a very limited... view of the truth....
                         
                          BOB
           What's that ?
                         
          Bill looks with admiration at the pool, and at the huge and
          impressive house, very Hollywood-like.
                         
                          BILL
           "Way to go" must have gone really well !
                         
                          BOB
           Yeah !
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          They enter the house. A beep is heard when Bob opens the door.
                          BOB
           After you, wise guy... Come on.
          Bill laughs.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh, men...
          He laughs, looking at the luxury that surrounds him. The best and
          the most expensive in modern furniture. Large expensive paintings
          hanged on the walls. Leather armchairs. Bob types a secret code on
          a keyboard. Then he switch on a small TV set that shows the
          pictures from all the security cameras.
           So, how are we as we approach forty ?
                         
                          BOB
           We are in a good shape. Really good shape. We finally got
           divorced. We have some money...
          He puts back in place a painting that was slightly crooked.
           ... We're meticulous.
                         
                          BILL
          He takes off his jacket.
           I don't detect a woman's touch.
                         
                          BOB
           We have a little friend... You'll meet her.
                         
                          BILL
           She's too young for you.
                         
                          BOB
           Ohh !
                         
                          BILL
          He sits behind the bar.
           Always get the clichés and you won't be disappointed.
                         
                          BOB
           This woman is not a cliché.
          He has taken two bottle of beer from the fridge and he gives one
          to Bill.
                         
                          BILL
           Thanks...
          They clink the two bottle and drink the beer from the bottle.
           Good to see you, Bob !
                         
                          BOB
           You too !... So...
          Bill plays with a «piece of art», consisting of an assembly of
          square pieces of glass glued together into a larger square. The
          object can pivot on his stand and, when you look through it, you
          get a distorted view of whatever is behind it.
           You're ready yet ?
                         
                          BILL
           Ready to what ?
          We see the distorted face of Bill through the «piece of art», or
          rather several distorted view of Bill's face seen through each of
          the individual square of glass. Bob pivot the object to have a
          better view of his friend.
           So hard to talk about... So hard to talk about...
          Bill pivot the object again to hide behind it.
           I's just a game... dumb, deceitful game. So I quit my
           practice.
          He gets up.
                         
                          BOB
           Lost you religion, huh ?
                         
                          BILL
          He takes a big book on a shelf. There is a picture of Sigmund
          Freud on the cover.
           Well, I certainly lost my belief in the scriptures.
          He puts the book back, and with his hand, makes a masturbation
          gesture.
                         
                          BOB
           I'm sorry, buddy. You gonna be in a lot of pain.
                         
                          BILL
           There is a distinctive absence of pain. I... I cannot feel
           the pain that I know that I'm supposed to be feeling right
           now. And I think I'm going crazy...
          We feel that Bill is ready to cry.
           I'm lost, man, I think I'm going crazy.
          He has tears in his eyes.
                         
                          BOB
           You may be... Your mind may be shot...
                         
          COUNTRYSIDE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          In front of Bob's residence. The sun is shining. Bill is wearing a
          brown tank top and white jogging pants. Bob is wearing a blue
          cyclist shirt and black pants. They're both wearing caps. They are
          ready to go cycling. We hear the voice over of Bob, finishing the
          sentence from the preceding scene.
                          BOB
           ... but I hope your body isn't.
                         
                          BILL
           Do I get to warm up ?
                         
                          BOB
           Yeah !... Two mile any pace you like. And then...
          They mount their bicycles.
           ... let's do ten.
                         
          They are now on the road in front of Bob's residence.
                         
                          BILL
           Ten ?
                         
                          BOB
           Too much for you, huh ?
                         
                          BILL
           I dunno... I was thinking of maybe twenty.
          He starts full speed.
           They are now on a minor dirt road. We can see Bob's house in the
          background.
                         
                          BOB
           Gees ! Billy ! You'll never change... Why don't we just drop
           our pants to see who's got the bigger dick, and then we can
           go back and have a nice civilized breakfast ?
                         
                          BILL
           Wouldn't be civilized...
                         
                          BOB
           Why ?
                         
                          BILL
           You'll be sulking !
                         
                          BOB
          They are going uphill.
           You don't have hills in New-York...
          He slows down.
           Hang on a second... Hang on a second... Hang on a second...
          Bob stops and dismounts his bike.
                         
                          BILL
           What ?
                         
                          BOB
           What was that ?... What the hell was that ?...
                         
          Bill dismounts his bike. Bob gets his bike upside down and sets it
          upright standing on the saddle and the handlebar. He checks the
          chain. Bill is leaning on his bike.
                         
                          BILL
           What are you afraid of ?
                          BOB
           I got a gear slip, here somewhere...
                         
                          BILL
           That's not what I meant... What with the security systems,
           the security gates, looking over your shoulder.
                         
                          BOB
           I've been getting some threats.
                         
                          BILL
           What do you mean ?... Death threats ?
                         
                          BOB
           Pretty sure it's somebody in the Monday night group, I just
           don't know who...
                         
                          BILL
           Monday night as in last night ?
                         
                          BOB
           Yeah !... I was hoping that maybe with your tuning fork that
           you might have a hunch.
                         
                          BILL
           No... No hunch, Bob. What make you think it's somebody in the
           group ?
                         
          Bob spins the pedals to check the chain.
                         
                          BOB
           Only about a dozen things... I's been going on for a couple
           of months now. It's funny how it gets you after a while.
                         
                          BILL
           Call the cops ?...
                         
                          BOB
          He puts his bike back on the wheels.
           Yeah ! They say if they had to protect every shrink in
           L.A., they'll need an army ! But that I should call them if
           anything happened.
                         
          They put their sunglasses on.
                         
                          BILL
          He laughs.
           That makes sense.
                         
                          BOB
           Yeah ! Probably, it'll just blow over.
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah !
                         
                          BOB
           How about you ?
                         
                          BILL
           About me... what ?
          We see them going very fast on the minor dirt road. A horse rider
          rides near them.
           What would you give a suicidal patient that's got
           everything ?
          They ride even faster while clowning, like riding on the back
          wheel.
                         
                          BOB
           Parachute, I heard it already.
                         
                          BILL
           Out here already, huh ?

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          The heavy metal door is sliding away. Bob and Bill are getting in.
          They dismount their bikes with some difficulty. They drop their
          bikes on the ground.
                          BILL
           Oh, shit ! You may have to... You may have to carry me in.
                         
          They hold each other by the waist and the shoulders.
                         
                          BOB
           You know you lose a lot more gracefully than you used to...
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah ! Well, you know... Practice and all... Hey ! How about
           that : "Learning to loose" by Doctor Bill Capa !
                         
          A beep and the second gate gets open.
                         
                          BOB
           Got a ring to it !
                         
                          BILL
           They are making those seats smaller, huh ? Whoo !
                         
          They enter the residence. Bill is massaging his buttocks.
                         
          BOB'S OFFICE - BOB'S WORKROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Short low angle shot of the whole building, before entering Bob's
          workroom. Bob's desk is decorated with two wrought iron eagles.
          Bob is wearing jacket and necktie. He is just finishing a session
          with a patient.
                         
                          BOB
           See you next week. All right ?
                         
          He escorts his patient to the door. Enter Barbara, Bob's
          secretary.
                         
                          BARBARA
           I'm going now. You want me to lock on the way out ?
                          BOB
           That'll be great, Barbara.
                         
          She gets out. Bob takes his jacket off and sets it on a clothes
          valet. He then stops by the shelves behind his desk and starts the
          music : a concerto for piano and orchestra. He sits behind his
          desk, and starts writing in a large notebook. He hears a strange
          noise, and raises his head. He puts his pen down, open a drawer
          and takes his revolver out. A draught flips the pages of his
          notebook. He seems to feel better, puts the revolver back and
          closes the drawer. Then he closes the notebook, takes it and goes
          to the shelves. He seems to be looking for something, and feels
          worried not to find it. He gets out of his workroom.
                         
          BOB'S OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          He enters the meeting room and goes directly to the shelves. He
          looks around and takes an art book about Van Gogh. He checks that
          the size of the art book and the size of his notebook are similar.
          He takes off the dustcover of the art book and puts it on his
          notebook, puts his notebook on the shelf where the art book was
          and puts the art book in the bottom of the shelves. A shadow moves
          on the shelves and a strange noise is heard. Bob, a bit nervous,
          goes to the door and opens it. The classical music stops. Through
          the open door, we can see Bob opening the door of his workroom.
                         
                          BOB
           Barbara ?...
                         
          He comes back into the meeting room. When he enters the room, the
          light is suddenly switched off. He crosses the meeting room. We
          can hear someone chuckling, and we can see a shadow through the
          glass on the door.
                         
          BOB'S OFFICE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bobs gets rapidly out of the meeting room. A man, completely
          covered in black leather, jumps through a large ground glass
          paneI, and jumps on Bob's back. Short fight on the floor. Bob gets
          up, bumps into the drinking fountain which falls on the floor, and
          falls down.
           Close-up of the mysterious man's hand. It is covered with a
          glove. The hand closes itself and a long blade appears on the top
          of the hand. Bob gets up and is stabbed in the chest. He staggers
          a bit, takes a blue vase on a table and tries to hit the head of
          the mysterious man. He misses and the vase crashes on the wall. He
          is stabbed again in the chest. His staggering increases. He turns
          around and the man stabs him several time in the back. He stumbles
          to the front door. Another stab in the back. The man grabs him by
          his hair to bring him back into the workroom.
                         
                          BOB
           No... Nooooo !... Why ?
                         
          The man stabs him several times. Bob is covered with blood. He
          falls on a glass door. The glass is shattered. Bob falls on his
          back. A big piece of glass goes through him and comes out of his
          stomach. Through the window, we can see an helicopter flying over
          Los Angeles.
          MAIN POLICE STATION - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          A car has just stopped in front of the building. The blue
          revolving light keeps on moving on top of the car. An helicopter
          is flying above the building. It could be the same that is seen at
          the end of the preceding scene. Officer Anderson goes around the
          car and opens the door for Bill. Bill is wearing a T-shirt, a
          light sweater and jeans. One can tell he had to dress quickly.
          Bills gets out of the car, and the car moves away. Anderson takes
          Bill into the building.
                         
          MAIN POLICE STATION - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Classical setup of a californian police station. The various rooms
          are separated with glass partitions. An officer enters pushing, in
          front of him, a hooker dressed with a minimum of very flashy
          clothes.
                         
           VOICE OF A POLICE WOMAN
           Have you thought about...
                          THE HOOKER
           Man, I didn't do nothing. Oh, please... You know, you're very
           cute. I love you.
                         
           THE POLICE OFFICER
           I love you too !
                         
          Anderson leads Bill into a room and leaves him there. Bill sits
          down. Enters lieutenant Hector Martinez. He is wearing a pink
          shirt with short sleeves. His tie is badly knotted on an open
          collar. He has a police badge fixed on his belt. He holds a file
          in his hand.
                         
                          HECTOR
           You're Capa ?
                         
                          BILL
           Yes, I'm Doctor Capa.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He closes the door, puts his file on the desk and sits down behind
          the desk.
           You're here because of the dead doctor ?
                         
                          BILL
           Yes...
                         
                          HECTOR
           I read something about sessions on Mondays. Tell me about
           this Monday group.
                         
                          BILL
           There's five patients in the group. I Can't really remember
           their names right now.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He taps his head with his right hand, a gesture meaning mental
          illness. He has a telephone number scribbled on the palm of his
          hand.
           Like five cuckoos.
                         
                          BILL
           No. Four neurotics of varying degrees and one killer. At
           least, that's what Bob thought.
                         
                          HECTOR

                          BILL
           Good. Yes, Bob Moore.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Four men and one woman.
                         
                          BILL
           Right.
                         
                          HECTOR
           And you sat in one of these sessions, right ?
                          BILL
           Yes, I did.
                         
                          HECTOR
           So, who did it ?
          Anderson enters the room behind Bill, carrying a plastic cup.
           Hey-hey-hey-hey... ! Anderson ! This is civilization, man.
           What do think this is ?... Your bedroom ?...
          Anderson gives Bill the cup.
           Damn... Knock... Knock... Don't... don't come into my office like
           that, bro. Hey !
          Anderson leaves the room and closes the door.
           It's third world thing !... Where were we ?...
                         
                          BILL
          He blows on the cup.
           You were probing me about the patients. And I was about to
           tell you that I really can't help you at all. I don't
           really know any of these people.
                         
                          HECTOR
           But you're a professional like me. You gotta have some kind
           of suspicion.
                         
                          BILL
           I really don't have a clue. I'd like to help you, but even
           if I could, there is an issue of confidentiality.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Confidentiality ?...
                         
                          BILL
           Yes.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He laughs and gets up.
           You're talking to me about an issue of confidentiality.
                          BILL
           Similar to the Miranda oath.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He sits down on the desk, facing Bill.
           If a friend of mine got killed, and the only thing between
           the killer and me was Miranda, you know what I will do ?...
           Huh ?... Fuck Miranda up the ass. But don't tell anybody,
           because it's a matter of confidentiality... Shhh !...
                         
          He puts a finger on his lips.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh, look ! I'm sorry I can't help you. I've only been in
           Los Angeles four days.
                         
                          HECTOR
           You're sleeping at that... dead guy's house, aren't you ?

           Yes.
                          HECTOR
           Maybe something will come to you in the night, you know,
           like dreams and shit. But... what happens to patients in a
           situation like this ?
                         
                          BILL
           Usually a colleague will offer to take over the group...
           continue the treatment.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He gets up. We see his pistol hooked on the back of his belt.
           How sweet !... How sweet !... It's like one of the vultures
           dies and then the others step in line and eat his portion.
          He mimes vultures walking.
           Is that what you're planning ?
                         
                          BILL
           No.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Why not ?
                         
                          BILL
           Because I really can't handle that right now.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Sure you can !... Come on !... You've been a week in L.A. and
           you already have you own private screwing farm.
          He sits back on the edge of the desk.
           How bad can that be ?... That's a great career move.... Where
           were you at the time of the killing, Capa ?
                         
                          BILL
          He pauses before answering.
           I was at his house, Bob's house.
                         
                          HECTOR
           You had to think about that ?
                          BILL
           Jesus Christ !... Are you going to arrest me, Lieutenant
           Martinez ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           Hey ! You want a lawyer ?
                         
                          BILL
           Do I need a lawyer ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           You're in L.A. Everybody needs a lawyer.
          He goes back to his seat behind the desk, and conspicuously shows
          his back to Bill.
           All right !... You can go home now, take a shower.
          He turns back to Bill.
           And keep your mouth shut. The only thing that I got going
           for me is that few people know what happened, and I don't
           want the press fucking things up.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR NIGHT
          Bill plays with the «piece of art» made of pieces of glass. He
          pivots it. We can see Bill's face duplicated by the object. We
          then see Bill putting back in place the same crooked painting that
          Bob had been putting back in place the first time Bill was in the
          house. Then we see him walking pensively around the house.

          A corridor. We hear the buzz of an intercom. Bill comes out of the
          bathroom, dressed in a white bathrobe. He is drying his hair with
          a towel.

          He walks in the corridor, looking for the buzzer. He arrives into
          the main hall, near the video security device. On the wall near
          the TV set, two large paintings showing enlarged footprints. On
          the screen, we see Hector's face.

          belt. Next to him is Bob's car. Behind him, a uniformed police
          officer. Hector presses the bell. We hear a beep.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
          Hector is searching the shelves on the wall. He quickly looks

          a row of books, and grabs a photo album. While flipping through
          the pages, he goes to the sofa and sits next to Bill. Bill is
          wearing a white shirt and a pair of jeans. Hector goes on turning
          the pages, and stop on a page with the picture of supine naked
          woman.

          Bill closes the album, takes it from Hector's hands and gets up.
          He turns to look at Hector.
                         
                          BILL

          He walks to the shelves and put the album back where it was found.
          He looks at Hector.
           I'm sure it will mean a lot to her...

          Close-up of the head of the bed. It is decorated with wooden
          sculpture of women's faces. Hector enters the room, followed by
          Bill. He goes to the bed and strokes the sculptures.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Check this fucking bed !
          He goes around the bed and sits next to the sculpture, which he
          keeps on fondling.
           Damn !... Everybody is having fun but me, goddammit !
          Hector opens a drawer, and takes a revolver out of it. He holds it
          with his pen stuck into the trigger ring.

           Well, maybe one of them won't come in, or maybe they will
           all come in, but then you would be able to spot something
           wrong.

           fucking daffodils, your shrink is dead.
          They have reached the main gate. Hector gets out and Bill presses
          a switch. The gate starts sliding between him and Hector.
           Which means that all the time, effort and love you put in
           this relationship is wasted. You've got to remain as fucked
           up as you are or get worse. »

          We are in Bob's car, with the roof open. Bill is wearing a green
          polo shirt, jeans and sunglasses. He is on the phone, while he
          drives the car, but he drives slowly.
                         
                          BILL
           No, you listen to me. You don't understand, Gene. Don't
           lie, just give the family what it wants... No... No, you don't
           understand.
          We see Bill from the back. In the rear-view mirror of the car, we
          see another convertible vehicle approaching with also its roof
          open. A young girl is driving. She comes a bit too fast and bumps
          into the back of Bill's car. Bill jumps and stops his car.
           I have to call you back. Christ !
          He puts the telephone back on his hook and gets out of the car. He
          goes to Rose's car. She is leaning on the steering wheel.
           Hey !... You're right ?... Hey !...
          He opens the door. She stands back. She is wearing a large beige
          sweater.

           I got no insurance...
          She gets out of her car.
           I know it's against the law and everything.
          She goes around her car, and looks at the damage.
           Don't bust my chops. I'll bring the money to you, if you
           just get an estimate.
          She stoops, picks up a piece of red plastic and gives it to Bill.
           OK ?... Just give me a break !
                          BILL
           Got a pen ?
                         
          Rose goes to her car and Bill throws the piece of red plastic
          away. Rose gets into her car, looks into her purse, and takes a
          small notebook and a pen. Bill takes them but hesitates before
          writing. Rose smiles mockingly.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, poor old brain can't remember its own phone number.

           I'm saying, Sondra, that you really, really have to hate a
           person to stab him that many times. You're a shrink,
           right ? You know what kind of power people hand over a
           shrink. Or maybe sometimes, they hand even more than they
           want to.

           That is absolutely correct... A thief would not stick around
           and stab someone thirty times.

          Usual atmosphere of a well-known bar. At a short distance from the
          entrance of the bar, a truck with two floodlights, the beams of

          Quick shot on the very noisy orchestra. A long hair bearded guy is
          playing the drums, a girl is playing the guitar. Bill, dressed
          exactly like in the preceding scene, is looking for someone.
          Eventually he founds him, Hector, who is already seated. Bill sits
          down at Hector's table. Hector is wearing an open dark pink shirt.

          whole floor is flooded.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill enters the kitchen without switching the light on. He takes a
          big butcher's knife in a stand on the table, and looks in the
          corridor.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bill wades in the flooded corridor. He seems worried and we see
          the knife blade shining. He enters the bathroom, the door of which
          is wide open, and opens the shower stall. A rush of water runs out
          of it. An alarm starts sounding. He goes back into the corridor
          and turns off the garden hose faucet.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR NIGHT
          The alarm has stopped sounding. Bill is wearing short pants and he
          is emptying a bucket of water on the lawn. Then he spreads a wet
          cloth on the back of a seat. Several other wet clothes are already
          drying.
                         
                          ROSE
           Hello !
                         
                          BILL
           Who's there ?
                         
          We see Rose entering through the keyhole-shaped door.
                         
                          ROSE
           Hi !... Remember me ?... Fender-bender !...
                         
                          BILL
           There she is, a little angel, dancing on the head of a pin.
                         
          Rose gets down the few steps to the garden. She is wearing a light
          flowered summer dress.
                         
                          ROSE
           So... did you get that estimate ?
                         
                          BILL
           No.
                         
                          ROSE
           Waow !... Nice place you got here. It's a little cold... but
           it's kind of tasteful, right ?
                         
                          BILL
           And wet !
                         
                          ROSE
           You too, I guess.
                          BILL
           Cold or tasteful ?
                         
                          ROSE
           So... Are we eating in here, or you take me out ?...
                         
          Bill bursts laughing.
                         
          BIG HOTEL - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          We still hear Bill's laugh slowly fading out. We are looking above
          the main hall of a big luxurious hotel. Two attendants are pushing
          a baggage cart. We move with them to the restaurant room. Bill and
          Rose are seated at a table.
                         
                          ROSE
           You can't ? ... At all ?... Waow !...

          Close-up on Rose putting lipstick on.
                          ROSE
           Not even a shade of pink ?... Can't tell me if it's smeared
           or not ?
                         
                          BILL
           I can't tell you if your eyes are bloodshed.
                         
                          ROSE
           Really !... That's sad !... You know what ?... In respect for
           your infirmity, I'm gonna give up wearing lipstick.
          Close-up on Rose putting her lipstick in her glass of water.
           There is something about me that I bet you find a little
           strange. Right ?
                         
          In several shots during this dialogue, we see Bill seated in front
          of a mirror wall and Rose's reflection in the mirror behind Bill's
          back.
                         
                          BILL
           What is that ?
                         
                          ROSE
           Well, I haven't asked you what you do.
                         
                          BILL
           That's right. You showed a remarkable restraint.
                         
                          ROSE
           Well, it's because I'd rather guess. You know, I actually
           get upset if someone tries to tell me before I can... figure
           it out for myself, you know ?
                         
                          BILL
           But what if I am ashamed of what I do.
                         
                          ROSE
           Why... Why should you be ashamed of being a shrink.
                          BILL
           Who told you I was a shrink ?
                         
                          ROSE
           Well... Are you ?
                         
                          BILL
           How did you know ?
                         
                          ROSE
           The way you looked at me, you know ?
                         
                          BILL
           How I look at you ?
                         
                          ROSE
           You... you have this kindness in your eyes. But I think
           you're using it to keep me away. You know, you're trying to
           play safe. You're trying to think of a case instead of
           thinking of a female.
                         
                          BILL
           So, you have a tuning fork too.
                         
                          ROSE
           I guess we have a lot in common.
                         
                          BILL
           We seem to be playing the same game.
                         
                          ROSE
           Why do you say I'm playing a game?
                         
                          BILL
           Because you're the fantasy girl, aren't you? Quicksilver?
           The face glimpsed across a crowded room?
                         
                          ROSE
           Yeah, that's... That's exactly what I am.
                         
                          BILL
           You'll be whatever they want you to be... no substance, no
           rules. Light as air. So your feet never have to touch those
           burning hot coals the rest of us walk around on.
                         
                          ROSE
           Yeah. Sort of like... not seeing red?
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah, sort of like that.
                         
          BIG HOTEL - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          The main hall seen from above. Bill is crossing the hall with Rose
          holding his arm.
                         
                          ROSE
           I was afraid during dinner that you had taken a room
           here... and I might have to decide whether or not to go up
           with you.
          BIG HOTEL - HOTEL MAIN ENTRANCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Rose and Bill are leaving the hotel.
                         
                          BILL
           Yes, but that was part of my plan. I mean, I wanted to.
          Bill gives a ticket to the car valet.
           Thank you.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, I need a taxi. Taxi !
                         
                          BILL
           No, hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait. What are you being so tough
           for ?
                         
                          ROSE
           I'm just beginning to think that maybe I'Il...
                         
          Rose kisses Bill very tenderly, and even with some spirit. While
          kissing, Bill moves Rose to a more discreet place near the
          entrance. He strokes her shoulder and gets the strap of her dress
          a bit down. Then he moves up the bottom of her dress to stroke her
          thigh.
                         
           VOICE OF THE VALET
                         VOICE OVER
           Cab's here ! Yo, who called a taxi ?
                         
                          BILL
           I am thinking you should just let me take you home and
           forget about this stupid taxi.
                         
                          ROSE
          Rose walks to her waiting cab.
           Well, I'm thinkin' you should stay exactly where you are,
           'cause...
          She smiles and looks at Bill's crotch.
           In that condition, you'd get arrested. Start another riot.
                         
                          BILL
           Give me your phone number and address.
                         
                          ROSE
           Why? You want to make me fall to earth and burn my feet ?
           Whatever happened to quicksilver and light as air?
          She opens the cab's door and climbs inside. She waves to Bill.
                         
                          BILL
           She floats away on her sweet young legs. Waves to him once.
           Drives away without a backward glance.
                         
          Rose closes the door and the cabs moves away.
                         
          BOB'S OFFICE - BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          The first sentence of the following dialogue is heard voice-over
          on a wide shot of the modern glass building where Bob's office is
          located.
          BOB'S OFFICE - WORKROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill sits behind the desk. In front of the desk, already seated,
          Dale, Richie's brother. He is wearing an open khaki shirt. Bill
          wipes his glasses and puts them on. He is wearing an open light-
          blue shirt.
                         
                          DALE
           Richie is what he is.
                         
                          BILL
           What exactly is that?
                         
                          DALE
           He was born back of a van going up Route 5 to a Grateful
           Dead concert. The first sound he ever heard was "Beat It On
           Down The Line."
                         
          They both laugh.
                         
                          BILL
           Well, it could be worse.
                         
                          DALE
           Not much.
                         
                          BILL
           How long have you been his guardian?
                         
                          DALE
           Since he was nine or ten. But I've always taken care of
           Richie.
                         
                          BILL
           So, what can I do for you ?
                         
                          DALE
           Um, I was hoping you would help me... get Richie out of
           therapy. Look, I know I'm just his brother, but I've been
           like a mother and a father to him...
          Bill takes his glasses off.
           and I know I can get overprotective, but...
                         
                          BILL
           Why would you want to take Richie out of therapy now ?
                         
                          DALE
           What Richie needs is normalcy.
                         
                          BILL
           Well, normalcy...
          Bill gets up and keeps on talking while walking in the room.
           Normalcy can be interpreted in a lot of different ways.
                         
                          DALE
           Richie has practically been raised by the state...
          Bill sits back.
           ... the social workers, psychiatrists... forcing him into
           this, um, psycho-servitude. He is the sweetest kid you'll
           ever meet, but he thinks of himself as handicapped. It just
           isn't right.
                         
                          BILL
           Well, he's got legal problems. Richie was sentenced by the
           court to mandatory treatment.
                         
                          DALE
           Every kid gets into trouble. And that's why I need you to
           help get him out.
                         
                          BILL
           You know, Dale, it's hard to tell when someone's feeling
           pain... but I want you to know...
                         
                          DALE
           If Richie feels pain... then I feel pain. Pretty much in
           tune with him. I just wish you'd give us a chance.
                         
                          BILL
           Let me check out Richie's status. Then, uh, I'll give
           probation a call.
          Bill gets up.
                         
                          DALE
           Oh, thanks. Thanks, Dr. Capa.
          Dale gets up and shakes Bill's hand.
           I really appreciate it.
                         
                          BILL
           You're welcome, Dale. You either lift weights or work with
           your hands.

                          DALE
           Yeah, I made this desk for Bob, to remind him of New York.

          CASEY'S LOFT - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Tracking shot starting on a large painting showing a naked woman
          tied with ribbons. We hear the phone ringing. The answering
          machine gets on while the tracking shot moves to a painting
          showing another woman naked but for very small leather panties.
          She is hung upside down with chains and ropes.
                         
           CASEY'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE
           Hi. This is Casey.
           I can't get to the phone right now, so, uh, leave a
           message. Thanks.
                         
          A beep ends the message. The tracking shot moves on to a
          motorcycle, looking old, then to another painting showing a
          redhead woman wearing a bustier, a garter belt and hoses, all red.
          She is standing on hands and knees and she is wrapped with chains.
          We hear Bill's voice leaving a message on the answering machine.
                         
           BILL'S VOICE ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE
           Casey, this is Bill Capa. It's around noon. Your father
           sent me a check for the private sessions you were having
           with Bob. Should I send the check back or do you want to
           continue ? Let me know, okay ?
                         
          A click ends the message. During Bill's message, the tracking shot
          moves to a giant plastic statue, with Walt Disney's Pluto's head
          on a human male body. Then the tracking shot moves more quickly to
          another painting showing a redhead woman wearing a close-fitting
          sexy black overall. Then a close shot on a painting of a woman
          wearing a harness with spikes. Further away we see another
          painting showing a redhead woman being whipped. At the end of
          Bill's message, the tracking shots ends on Casey lying supine on a
          weightlifting bench. His writs are tied to the vertical bars where
          a dumbbell is resting.
                         
                          CASEY
           I think I want to continue.
          We hear the crack of a whip. Since the shot is showing only
          Casey's head and chest, we don't see who is whipping him.
           You bitch !
          Another whip crack.
           I called you a bitch !
          Whip crack.
           I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
          Whip crack. The tracking shot starts moving backwards, but with a
          larger angle.
           Oh!
          Whip crack. Casey's voice is softer. Medium long shot on the room.
           Oh! I'm sorry.
          Almost hysterical laugh.
                         
          ROAD IN FRONT OF BOB'S RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          We see Bill, bare chest, wearing sneakers short pants and cap,
          running toward us. His T-shirt is hanging at his side, partly
          stuck in the elastic band of his shorts. Bill stops running when
          he reaches the mailbox, hesitates one moment, comes two steps back
          and opens the box. Close-up on the box, inside of which a coiled
          rattlesnake whips a menacing forked tongue. The snake rattles,
          then the front half of the snake jumps out of the box, with its
          mouth wide open. Bill falls on the road, where he remains seated
          without moving. The snake, with the back half of his body still in
          the box, doesn't seem to know what it must do next.
           A car arrives at a high rate of speed. Since a pick-up is parked
          on the other side of the road, the car must zigzag and it barely
          avoid driving on Bill.
                         
                          BILL
          Yelling to the driver.
           Hey !
                         
          The car honks. We get a close-up of the driver when the car comes
          very close to Bill.
                         
                          THE DRIVER
           You idiot !
                         
          Bill looks at the departing car and notices a city worker blowing
          dead leaves on the bank of the road.
                         
                          BILL
          He yells to the city worker, but, with the loud noise of his power
          blower, the man does not hears him and remains concentrated on his
          work.
           Hey ! Hey !... Help !... Shit !
          Bill crawls back a little, then he eventually stands up. He
          crosses the road, and takes a big shovel in the pick-up truck.
           Fuck !
          He crosses the road back. The snake is back in the mailbox.
           Hello !
          Bill hits the box very hard with the shovel. Snake and mail fall
          on the road. Bill laughs and throws the shovel on the side of the
          road.
           I am not goin' back to New York, you hear me ? You're stuck
           with me !
          Bill stoops to pick up the letters scattered on the road. He looks
          at the envelopes.
           Fuckin' bill. Great.
                         
          We see the snake disappearing through the grass on the side of the
          road. Bill, with his back to the road, is getting ready to enter
          the house. A car stops and honks. Bill turns around to face
          Hector.
                         
                          HECTOR

                          BILL
          He comes back to the car. He looks very angry.
           Oh, that's perfect ! That's really perfect ! Just like a
           cop ! You're never there when you need one !
                         
                          HECTOR
           What did I do now ?

           Somebody put a rattlesnake in the mailbox, Hector !
                         
                          HECTOR
          He laughs.
           A rattlesnake !
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY

                          HECTOR
           I could use some assistance, some of your professional
           wisdom.
                         
                          BILL
           I'm really flattered.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Everyone in the group has an alibi. Except for Casey. He
           says he was alone in his loft.
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah ?

           Mm-hmm.
                         
                          BILL
           What does that mean ?
          He dries his arms with a dishcloth.
                         
                          HECTOR
           What do you make of Casey?
                         
                          BILL
           He's a good kid.
                         
                          HECTOR
           You're an asshole, Capa.
                         
          Bill turns the water off, throws the dishcloth on the sink. Hector
          walks in the room while wiping his hands with another dishcloth.
                         
                          BILL
           Should we analyze that statement, Hector ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. Who is our man ?

           You're the cop. Figure it out.
                         
          He gets out of the kitchen, followed by Hector.

                          HECTOR
           Yeah, I been talking to people who knew you both. Everyone
           says there was a weird competitive thing going between you.
                         
          They have come to the hall where the security TV screens are
          located. They stop walking.
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah, that's right. There was. I admit it. He was on the
           way up... and I was on the way down.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Including...
          He whistles, miming, with both hands, something crashing down.
           Splat ! It unhinged you.
                         
                          BILL
           I bet you've seen every episode of Columbo, huh?
          Sound of a buzz. The two men look at the security screen.
           Who is it?
          Bill taps on the remote control, and Rose appears on the screen.
                         
                          ROSE
           Hi. It's me, Rose. The old fender bender.
                         
          Bill taps again on the remote control to open the gate, and Rose
          leaves the TV screen.
                         
                          HECTOR
           That's a very young girl to be going around... fending
           benders.
                         
          Bill puts the remote control down and follows Hector to the main
          gate.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Hector is walking to the exit. As he reaches the bottom of the
          steps, Rose is going down. Bill, standing behind a low wall, looks
          at her coming.
                         
                          BILL
           Here she comes. Weightless, hanging from the sky... wearing
           a short dress of indeterminate color.
                         
                          ROSE

           Thank you.
                         
          They kiss. Rose takes his hand.
                         
                          ROSE
           I was thinking. Maybe I should see a shrink.
                         
                          BILL
           I can recommend someone.
                         
                          ROSE

          Close-up on their kissing.
                         
                          BILL
           God, I missed you.
                         
          They are now at the edge of the pool.
                         
                          ROSE
           This time you won't miss.
                         
          They fall fully dressed in the pool.
           Underwater shot. They keep on kissing in the water. Bill takes
          her dress off. She wears nothing underneath. We can see a rose
          tattooed on her buttock. She slips Bill's short down to his
          ankles. We get a brief view of Bill's penis.
           Above water shot. They are now in the water up to their waists.
          Bill is kissing Rose's breasts.
           Underwater shot. They are back underwater. Bill is kissing Rose's
          legs, and moves slowly up to her crotch. She has trimmed pubic
          hair, but with some left. Still kissing, Bill moves up along her
          stomach and reaches hers breasts, which he kisses greedily.
           Above water shot. Bill is leaning his back against the edge of
          the pool. Rose is lying on him. They are still in the water up to
          their waists.
           Underwater shot. Rose is kissing Bill's chest et goes slowly down
          his stomach, then along one of his legs. We get another brief view
          of Bill's penis. We notice that it is not erected (certainly to
          avoid being X-rated).
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Multiple shots of Bill and Rose making love, seen through the
          «piece of art». Then tracking shot on the two bodies fondling each
          other.
           Shot on the bedroom window, and two hand-glider in the
          californian sky.
           Back to the lovers couple. They are sweating profusely. Their
          position and their movements suggest, without actually showing it,
          that Bill is inside Rose. Bill turns Rose around to put her lying
          on her stomach. Rose holds the two sculpted bed posts very
          tightly. It is suggested that Bill could be sodomizing her.
           They both moan. The moaning increases with a suggestion of an
          orgasm.
                         
                          ROSE
          Still holding the bedposts. She speaks with a breathless voice.
           I want you to get dressed up... Get dressed up... All right ?
          She turns around to face him.
           I want to get dressed up.
                         
                          BILL

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - DINING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Through the window, we notice that the night has fallen. Bill,
          seated behind the table, is wearing brown suit and necktie, very
          elegant. On the table, wine and water glasses and two chandeliers,
          with a lighted candle. In front of Bill, a plate with food. Rose
          enters the field, carrying another plate, which she sets on the
          other side of the table.
           In the plate, a piece of grilled beef, noodles et vegetables.
           Rose sits behind her plate. As the table is made of glass, we see
          that Rose is naked.
                         
                          ROSE
           You're not eating. Don't you like my food?
                         
                          BILL
           I'd like your food five inches to the left.
                         
                          ROSE
           Okay.
          Rose moves the plate to her left, showing her naked body though
          the glass table.
           But if you don't like this... I have something else for
           you.
           She laughs.
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah, okay.
                         
                          ROSE
           I think it's ready.
                         
          She stands up laughing. Fade out on the next scene.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Long scene on the couple making love standing under the shower.

          BOB'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill wakes up, naked, and alone in the bed. One of his hand is
          cuffed to one of the bedpost with a long strap. He laughs.
                         
          ARCHIVES ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          An archives room, congested with shelves from floor to ceiling. On
          these shelves, hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of files, stacked
          not too cleanly. Bill is leaning on one of the shelves. The
          archivist, a forty-year old lady, appears from behind another
          shelf, apparently coming down some steps. Bill stands up.
                         
                          THE ARCHIVIST
           It's a miracle. I found it.
          She starts walking between two rows of shelves. Bill follows her,
          putting his glasses on.
           Here he is. Richie Dexter. Legal guardian: Dale Dexter.
           That's his brother. Kids were put under care, let's see,
           about six years ago.
                          BILL
          He tries to read above her shoulder.
           Does it say why?
                         
                          THE ARCHIVIST
           Abandonment, abuse. The children were assigned to a, uh...
          She flips a page in the file.
           Dr. Niedelmeyer in Pasadena. A child psychiatrist. Richie
           was 12.
          Bill tries to come back to the preceding page, but the archivist
          looks angrily at him, silently meaning he is going a bit too far.
           No foster parents. Looks like the doctor retired a couple
           years after that. Then we lost track of the kids until
           recently.
                         
                          BILL
           What do you mean, "lost track" of them?
                         
                          THE ARCHIVIST
          She closes the file, and keeps on walking between the rows of
          shelves, followed by Bill.
           Like on a radar : One minute a blip, the next, no blip.
           Hey, look. This is the lost souls memorial wing. Children
           of L.A. County of the '90s: 250 000 cases in here, and
           there's two more down the hall.
                         
          SONDRA'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          The room is decorated in quite a luxurious way, but with a lot of
          good taste. Paintings on the walls. Bed covered with an
          embroidered bedspread, and many cushions. At the foot end of the
          bed, a small upholstered bench.
           Two women enter the room, laughing and carrying many parcels,
          which they throw on the bed.
                         
                          BONNIE
           Nobody's like your ex-husband!
                         
                          SONDRA
           That's for sure. That's for sure.
          Bonnie takes one of the parcel, a large white box.
           Okay, okay, okay.
                         
                          BONNIE
          She takes a white dress out of the box. For the first time, we see
          a close-up of her face, and we discover she is Rose, different
          hairdo, a lot of almost vulgar make-up, but still, she is Rose.
           Here it is. Oh, Sondra, it is so beautiful. Isn't it
           great ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           I know. It's incredible. Look at all these bags.
                         
                          ROSE
          She shamelessly takes off the dress, and, as she wears no bra, she
          stands naked, save for her panties, in front of Sondra.
           Oh, the man that was staring at you in the shop... was so
           funny.
          She laughs. Sondra freezes watching the naked body of her friend.
           I think I should have got it in green or something.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh ! Oh ! Lush !
          She has put the white dress on.
           What do you think?
                         
                          SONDRA
          She seems very moved.
           I think... you look beautiful.
                         
                          ROSE
           You sure ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, yeah.
                         
                          ROSE
           Come zip me up.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Okay. Okay.
          She gets up from the bed to zip up Rose's dress.
           Oh, this is so tight.
                         
                          ROSE
           Thank you.
                         
                          SONDRA
           I need to find a new husband.
          They both laugh. Sondra goes back sitting on the bed and looking
          through the parcels.
           I need some more money.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, men. Who needs them ? Have you seen my earrings
           anywhere ?
                         
                          SONDRA
          She waves the earrings in front of Rose's face.
           Yes, I've got them.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, sweet !
          Rose takes off the large rings she is wearing to replace them by
          the earrings Sondra just gave her. She sighs.
           Oh, my God. I love these. Aren't they pretty ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           They're so gorgeous, yes.
                         
                          ROSE
           Try yours on.
                         
                          SONDRA
          Sondra doesn't move, feeling very embarrassed by the idea of
          undressing in front of her friend.
           Okay.
          She eventually gets up, an starts taking off the belt from her
          suit. Rose is putting her jacket on. A long silence : Sondra looks
          more and more embarrassed. She snickers stupidly. Rose looks at
          her without really understanding what's going on.
                         
                          ROSE
           What now ? Sondra, what ?
                         
                          SONDRA
          She sits back on the bed.
           I feel embarrassed.
                         
                          ROSE
           Why?
                         
                          SONDRA
           'Cause... the way you're looking at me.
                         
                          ROSE
           Sondra... Do men look at you like that ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           No... Yes... But it's different.
                          ROSE
          She bends to her.
           You know, Sondra... it doesn't have to be any different at
           all.
          The phone rings. Rose starts laughing.
           You better get that.
                         
                          SONDRA
          She takes the phone.
           Hello. Oh, h-hi. Um... Oh...
          She seems embarrassed. Rose is making funny faces.
           Um, mmm, okay.
          She stammers a little.
           N... My trainer's coming at 2:30, but that's... Yeah. You
           are? Okay !...
          She goes to the window and moves the curtain aside. We see Bob's
          car in the street.
           Um, oh, there you are ! Okay, okay. I'll see you in a
           minute !
                         
          STREET IN FRONT OF SONDRA'S RESIDENCE -- BOB'S CAR - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill drives and holds his car phone on his ear.
                         
                          SONDRA'S VOICE

                          ROSE
          She is looking at herself in the full-length mirror.
           Who's that?
                         
                          SONDRA
           That's my analyst ! He's coming to visit me.
                         
                          ROSE
          When she hears Sondra's last reply, Rose's carefree face becomes
          very anxious.
           He what?
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, my God. He's coming over.

                          ROSE
           Nothing !
          She starts gathering her belongings.
           If you don't know, I thought we were just going to have a
           nice afternoon together... maybe have dinner.
                         
                          SONDRA
          She puts the telephone back on its stand and takes Rose's arm.
           Well, we can. Oh, don't worry. Don't be upset. You can stay
           here. Really.
                         
                          ROSE
          She closes her purse and puts it over her shoulder.
           You just don't understand, do you?
                         
                          SONDRA

                          ROSE
           Nobody appreciates you the way that I do. People just use
           you, and you don't even see it.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, don't be upset.

          Rose kisses Sondra tenderly on the lips.
           That's more like it. Ciao.
                         
          She leaves the room. Sondra seems very disturbed by the kiss. She
          puts her hands on her chest.

          Rose gets quickly down the stairs. Chimes. Rose gets large
          sunglasses out of her purse and adjust them on her nose before
          opening the front door.
           She opens the door to face Bill whom she almost jostle to get
          outside as fast as possible. Through a low window, we see her
          going down the stairs to the street.
           Larger shot. We discover the sitting-room next to the hall. Good
          taste expensive furniture, nice paintings, concert piano.
           Sondra gets down the stairs. Bill, who was looking around him,
          turns to her.
                         
                          BILL

                          SONDRA
          She closes the front door, which had remained open.
           Oh... no. That was my, um... That was my girlfriend,
           Bonnie. Yeah.

           Thank you very much. Thank you.
          He enters the sitting-room, followed by Sondra.
           This is a really lovely place you have here. Yeah.
          He sits on a cushions-covered sofa.
                         
                          SONDRA
           You think so? Thank you.

                          BILL
           A lot of nice, nice things. A lot of nice art.
                         
                          SONDRA

           Well, I feel like I have so much... so much catching up to
           do with all of you. And I know that you're very close with
           Richie. And I was wondering if you could tell me anything
           that might help me... understand him a little better.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Richie's... my little baby.
                         
                          BILL
           His brother Dale thinks that your "little baby"... should
           be taken out of therapy.
                         
                          SONDRA
           That's insane!
                         
                          BILL
          He gets up.
           I think it's a mistake too.
          He goes to the window and looks at the children playing in a park.
                          SONDRA
           That Dale is a dangerous bastard.
                         
                          BILL
           But he obviously seems to care for Richie a great deal.
           There's a big gap in Richie's life up until about a year
           ago. Did he ever mention a Dr. Niedelmeyer to you ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           I don't have much to tell. Richie's okay. He's sweet. Did
           you know that he was... molested as a child ?
          She has tears in her eyes.
                         
                          BILL
           No, I didn't know that.
          He comes back to her.
           It's sticking out all over.
          He sits on the bench of the piano.
                         
                          SONDRA
           It's fashionable.
          She laughs nervously.
           I mean, it pays well. At least, you know, you can write a
           book, go on Oprah.
                         
                          BILL
           That was quite a show he gave us in group. You think Richie
           has a violent streak ?
                         
                          SONDRA
          She sighs.
           Oh. Let's cut to the chase. Richie did not kill Bob Moore.
           You know... it's really swell. Snooping around here...
          She gets up.
           ... sniffing for blood on other people's hands... while
           pretending to help your patients ?
                         
                          BILL
           You really think that I don't care about Richie ?
                         
                          SONDRA
          She gets upset.
           Richie wouldn't hurt a fly ! Why don't you take a look at
           someone dangerous. Why don't you take a look at someone who
           could do it ! Why don't you take a look at Clark !
                         
                          BILL
           Clark ?
                         
                          SONDRA
          She gets more and more upset.
           Clark ! Clark ! Clark is a sneaky, lying, button-down son
           of a bitch... who pretends to be this gentle creature ! I
           heard him screaming one night at Bob. It made the hairs on
           my neck stand up ! Anyway... I hope that they fry...
           whoever did it, and it takes a really long time. And
           then... And then a fuse blows. They have to start all over
           again.
          She sits back. Bill has been listening to her outburst without
          reacting.
           We hear the front door chimes, and Sondra's expression changes
          immediately. Her angry face becomes suddenly softer.
           She snickers and puts her tongue to her lips.
           Wow ! That's my trainer.
          She gets up and sniffs a bit.
           I gotta go. I gotta get the door.
          She goes to the front door and opens it to a very muscular young
          man wearing a sleeveless T-shirt.
           This is my trainer, Chris.
                         
                          BILL
           Hi.
          Chris just nods his head.
           Bye-bye.
          Bill gets out. As soon as the door is closes, Sondra literally
          jumps in Chris' arms, and starts giggling.
                         
                          SONDRA
           I don't feel like lifting weights today.
                         
                          CHRIS
           Okay.
                          SONDRA
           Let's do something else.
          She bursts laughing.
           Through the low window, we see Bill going down the stairs to the
          street. He stops for two seconds to look at the tender couple !
                         
          DALE'S WORKSHOP - PARKING - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bob's car stops in front of a slightly dilapidated building, on a
          desert parking lot. The building could be an old factory
          reconverted by Dale into a workshop to make his furniture. A very
          high chimney above the building.
           Bill, dressed in jeans and light-colored shirt, gets out of the
          car and walks toward the building. He passes a board that
          indicates the location of the «office». He knocks at a door with a
          window and a grating and a sign that says «beware of the dog». The
          dog starts barking. Bill knocks again. He tries to look through
          the door window. The dog keeps on barking.
           Bill comes back the way he came toward the «office». He stops in
          front of a window and bends to try to see something inside. He
          knocks on the window. He turns around, and we catch a quick
          glimpse of someone behind the window.
           Bill comes back to the parking lot toward a pickup that two men
          are unloading.
                         
                          BILL
           Hey! Is this Dale Dexter's shop here?
                         
          One of the men nods and shows the main door to Bill.
                         
          DALE'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Entrance of the workshop. The door opens and Bill appears. He
          takes off his sunglasses, puts them in the pocket of his shirt and
          gets in.
           The workshop has a very high ceiling and looks a bit dilapidated.
          On the roof of a small structure (perhaps the quoted «office»)
          sits the impressive statue of a lion who gives the impression to
          watch Bill.
           Bill keeps on walking and passes a spray of burning sparks.
          Someone must be using a blowtorch in the neighborhood.
           Bill looks around him, looking a bit anxious. Several men are
          working. He approaches one of them, wearing a sleeveless T-shirt,
          and who is welding, with a protection mask covering his face.
                         
                          BILL
           Excuse me.
                         
          The man stands up and puts down the piece he was welding. He
          raises his mask : It's Dale.
                         
                          DALE
           Hello. Did you go to the house?
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah. Nobody was home. I would have phoned a...
          Dale shuts his blowtorch off.
           I would have phone ahead, but, uh, I don't have your phone
           number in our file.
                          DALE
          He takes off his mask, then his protection gloves.
           No problem. So, uh, did you make up your mind ?
                         
                          BILL
           After Dr. Niedelmeyer, did Richie get another
           psychiatrist ?
                         
                          DALE
           No. No, we moved.
          Dale goes around a huge, geometrically shaped, metallic structure.
           Richie went to school. Everything was fine.
                         
                          BILL
           Well... that's the problem, Dale. I look at Richie, and I
           don't see that everything is fine. I see a kid that's on
           the brink.
                         
                          DALE
          He starts working on the metallic structure, but stops to look at
          Bill.
           A person, uh, gets a bullet in the head. Sometimes they
           just leave it there 'cause... to fuck around in the brain
           is gonna paralyze the person. That's Richie.
                         
                          BILL
           What's the bullet ?
                         
                          DALE
           Whatever it was, I got him away.
          He has taken protection glasses to work.
                         
                          BILL
           You want to talk about that ?
                         
                          DALE
           No. I want you to stop trying to tear off the scabs. Let
           the demons rest. You dig around in Richie's head, he's
           gonna blow up in your face.
                         
                          BILL
           You think he's violent ?
                         
                          DALE
           Not with me.
                         
                          BILL
           I think you're making a mistake, Dale. This is not the time
           to take Richie out of therapy. If you don't like me, let's
           get him someone else.
                         
                          DALE
           Jesus Christ. One of you is the same as another.
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah.
                         
          NIEDELMEYER'S RESIDENCE - GARDEN - EXTERIOR DAY
          Bill gets out of his car. He is wearing light-colored pants, a
          shirt, and a very elegant leather jacket. He walks up a few steps
          toward the house.
           He crosses the garden, then reaches the very impressive main door
          of the house. Above the door, two similar faces are carved in the
          stone. Probably Doctor Niedelmeyer's face.
           A small panel opens in the door and Edith Niedelmeyer's face
          appears.
                         
                          BILL

           Yes.
                         
                          BILL
           Hi, I'm Bill Capa. I'm a doctor. I tracked you down through
           the Psychiatric Institute.
                         
                          EDITH
           How very enterprising of you.
                         
          She slams the panel shut. A few seconds, then she opens the door.
                         
                          BILL
           Actually, I was wondering if I could speak to Dr.
           Niedelmeyer.
                         
                          EDITH
           My husband died last year. If it makes you feel better, he
           suffered a lot. Well, anyway, it made me feel better.
                         
                          BILL
           I'm treating a young man that was a patient... of Dr.
           Niedelmeyer's when he was a child. His name is Richie
           Dexter.
                         
                          EDITH
           Why don't you leave me alone ?
                         
                          BILL
           If I could just ask you a few questions.
                         
                          EDITH
           You get out of here before I call the police !
          She angrily slams the door shut.
                         
                          BILL
           Just a few questions. Mrs. Niedelmeyer...
                         
                          EDITH
          Voice over through the door.
           Get out of here !
                         
          Bill sighs, then walks away from the door. The camera moves above
          the door and ends up on a close-up of Niedelmeyer's carved face,
          who seems to sneer at Bill.

          Night is falling on L.A. Clark, in the foreground, is counting
          books. Behind him, Richie, Buck and Casey are seated, Casey in his

                          CLARK
           Three. Not four, as recommended. There are three chairs and

          He just came in and is standing by the window. He is wearing his
          glasses, jeans, open shirt and a light grey jacket. He turns
          around to speak to the group.
           Okay, let's get started.
                         
                          BUCK
          Finishing a sentence the beginning of which was not

                          BILL
           More or less. You see, the primary romantic relationship...
           in our life is often a symptom of our illness.
          He has seated himself in the hand-shaped armchair.

           your partner... Sondra, how would you make them different ?
           What's wrong ? What's missing ?
                         
                          SONDRA
           Now ?
                         
                          BILL
           You need a minute to think about it ?
                         
                          CLARK
           She's totally forgot her Rolodex.
          Casey snickers.
           Sorry, sorry.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Well, I don't have an attachment in my life right now. The
           last one sort of went to pieces. If you enjoy sex... A man
           thinks you're doing it with everybody.
                         
                          BILL
           He was jealous.
          He gets ups, walks to a cupboard, opens its door and takes a cup.
                         
                          SONDRA
           That's right. And I was as good as gold.
                         
                          BILL
           Well, there's a good chance that he was the one that was
           sleeping around... and projecting his fantasies and desires
           onto you.
                         
                          SONDRA
           This guy had a major projection, and he couldn't keep it in
           his pants.
          The whole group laughs. Bill smiles while pouring himself a
          coffee.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Anyway, I do have this girlfriend. She really makes me
           laugh. A wish list. I wish... she was a guy.
                         
                          BILL
          He comes back with his cup in his hand.
           Fair enough. Casey, what do you got for us?
                          CASEY
          He is playing with a small statue of a monkey who looks at a
          skull.. He waits a few seconds, and puts the statue down before
          speaking.
           Well... I met this girl about a month ago. I've painted
           every inch of her in detail. She's the best model I've ever
           seen. Completely uninhibited. Does whatever I ask no matter
           how...
                         
                          BUCK
          He smiles.
           I'll bet she does.
                         
                          CASEY
           That's right, Buck. See, but this is where the problem
           comes in. It's what you see beneath the skin... when you
           study somebody endlessly, the way an artist does. I see a
           transcendental beauty there... beyond anything I could
           ever, ever imagine.
                         
                          BILL
           How does this woman feel about you?
                          CASEY
           She thinks I'm the living end because I've got talent. But,
           I mean, what's talent ? Kick a garbage can... starving
           artists crawl out, right ? But there's only one, unique
           her. And, uh, I think it's love, you know ? And, um... I
           don't know what to do about that.
          He is suddenly moved on the verge of tears.
                         
                          BILL
           Do you think she loves you ?
                         
                          CASEY
           No. No.
                         
                          BILL
           Do you care, Casey ?
                         
                          CASEY
           I don't know. I don't know.
                         
                          BUCK
           He's a romantic. He loves the suffering.
                         
                          CASEY
           Maybe being who I am... I have no choice.
                         
                          BILL
           Very good, Casey. That's good stuff.
                         
                          SONDRA
           I agree.
                         
                          BILL
           Buck, what do you got?
                         
                          BUCK
          He jumps.
           Oh, nothing to talk about, not compared to that.
                         
                          BILL
           It's not a contest.
                         
                          BUCK
          He lights a cigarette.
           Hey, Yard Sale, you want to share the ashtray ?
          Casey puts his foot on the ashtray to prevent Buck from using it.
           Thanks a lot.
          He gets up.
           Forget it. You want to share something, share the ashtray.
          He sits on a small armchair by a glass table with an ashtray on
          it.
           I got something in my life, something new. You know, she's
           young. Auburn hair, 5'5", 105. Pretty as hell. I see her on
           weekends.
          He picks up the ashtray and moves to sit in a more comfortable
          armchair.
           I don't think she'd sleep with a man unless she was married
           to him.
                          BILL
          He has taken his glasses off.
           Anything else you'd like to tell us?
                         
                          BUCK
           She doesn't mind the gray, you know.
          Bill smiles.
           She's fragile... you know ? It's like she's running through
           my fingers. Two people I loved died. I never thought that I
           could feel anything.
                         
                          BILL
           Good, Buck. Richie. How 'bout you ?
                         
                          RICHIE
          He is playing with the statue of the monkey.
           I don't have,really, relationships. I have m-my brother.
                         
                          BILL
           Okay. You want to talk about him?
                         
                          RICHIE
           H-He worries a-a lot about me. And he l-loves me. But l...
           I wish he didn't... love me so m... so much sometimes. I
           wish l-I had more of a l-life.
          He puts the statue down and gets up.
           And I know that everyone h-here thinks that I'm gay... but
           I'm-I'm not. A-And I don't want to be.
          Richie opens the cupboard, takes a can of Pepsi and opens it.
                         
                          BILL
           What would you like to be ?
                         
                          RICHIE
           I'd like t-to be a w-woman.
                         
                          BILL
           Have you seen a doctor ?
                          RICHIE
           Yeah.
                         
                          BUCK
           So the next step is the chop.
                         
                          BILL
          He cuts him very curtly.
           Thank you, Buck. Anything else you'd like to tell us,
           Richie ?
                         
                          RICHIE
           Nope.
                         
                          BILL
           Very good. Hi, Clark. What would you change about your
           partner ?
                         
                          CLARK
          He is manicuring with his handkerchief.
           Um, I think I'll pass... today.
                          SONDRA
           Excuse me. You think you're gonna pass today ? Don't you
           think that's kind of a betrayal to the rest of the group ?
           I mean, we're all sitting here sharing our most intimate
           thoughts... and you're just gonna pass today ?
                         
                          CLARK
           Well, Sondra, I have my little problems... but I don't s-
           see how it's your business...
                         
                          SONDRA
           Your "little problems" ?
                         
                          CLARK
           To decide when I'm gonna share in group and not.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Ah, I see. You're smiling. Is that a smile ? You think this
           is funny ?
          She gets up from her armchair.
           Look at you. Just look at you. Look at your hair.
          Buck snickers.
           Who do you think you are ? Huh ? You think you're God's
           gift to women ? Let me tell you something. You are nothing.
           Nothing but a shallow, rigid... self-protective, anal
           coward ! And I'll tell you what your little fucking
           problems are...
                         
                          CLARK
          He gets ups, looking angry.
           Oh, shut up ! Shut up, shut up ! You promiscuous cunt ! And
           if you must know, I do have somebody in my life ! Black,
           emotional hole, unattractive me !
          He walks nervously to the door. Sondra remains standing, looking a
          bit embarrassed.
                         
                          BUCK
          He snickers.
           You can say that again !
                         
                          CLARK
          He slams furiously the door.
           Fuck you ! Fuck all of you !
                         
                          CASEY
           Is this what you call "treatment failure" ?
          Buck snickers.
                         
                          BILL
           Well, it's not a total loss. He left without counting
           everything.
          He puts down the file he was holding in his hand.
                         
          CLARK'S RESIDENCE - STREET IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          A quiet little street, surrounded by houses an buildings of good
          standing. Children in roller skates are playing hockey on the
          pavement.
                          CHILDREN
           Come on !... Hey, right here !... Hit it !
                         
          Bob's car arrives in the street. The children moves away to let it
          pass. While Bill is parking the car, we hear, in voice over, the
          beginning of the conversation between Bill and Clark. Bill is
          wearing a light-colored shirt and beige pants.
                         
                          CLARK
          Voice over.
           So pretty soon the relevant numbers weren't enough. I had
           to know all the irrelevant numbers... like the numbers of
           pages in each deposition.
                         
          CLARK'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Walls are white, furniture modern, but with good taste. Everything
          is meticulously clean and tidy. Bill sits in an armchair. Clark is
          standing by the window.
                         
                          BILL
           So you were fired.
                         
                          CLARK
          He takes off his sunglasses and gets regular glasses from his
          shirt pocket. He is wearing disposable gloves.
           Yes. In effect. Obsessive-compulsive. Medical leave.
          He puts his glasses on.
           "Just please, please don't come back."
          He sits down and sighs.
           I do apologize for my outburst in group.
                         
                          BILL

          He puts his sunglasses in his shirt pocket, gets back up and start
          walking in the room.
           I'm very fond of Sondra. More than that, perhaps. Sondra
           is... A very warmhearted woman, but...
          While talking, he sprays a liquid from a can on his plants.
           Tissues. Panty hose. CDs put back in the rack without
           cases. Frying pans with coagulating grease. Cotton balls.
           Cotton balls. I mean, my God, the cotton balls that woman
           used. Unspeakable items of underwear left hanging in the
           shower. Chewed gum in the ashtrays. I made a list. There
           were 22 items I couldn't take.
                         
                          BILL
           It must be difficult to find someone... to measure up to
           your keen sense of order.
                         
                          CLARK
           I found someone. This woman thinks I'm messy. It's perfect.
           She comes, she goes. I don't even know she's been except
           for the faint smell of perfume.
                         
                          BILL
          Bill sneers.
           Nice. And what does Sondra think of this woman ?
                          CLARK
           Take a look at this.
          He goes to a closet, from which he gets a paper bag. From the bags
          he takes out a tattered piece of clothing.
           Sondra tried to do this to my clothes... while I was
           wearing them; butcher knife in hand, screaming. The next
           day she came back, did this to my friend's dress. I'm
           terrified to go near the woman.
                         
          FREEWAY, THEN ROAD - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Cars on the freeway. Among them Bob's car. The car phone is

           THE VOICE IN THE PHONE
          Giggly voice sounding like a child's voice.
           Hey, puke-face. Look around. Can't you see me ? I'm in the
           red car.
          Bill looks around him on the freeway, and sees a red car on his
          right.
           You got doo-doo in your eyes... or caca on the brain, Dr.
           Shithead Capa.
          Strange sounding giggles.
                         
                          BILL
           Does your mommy know you escaped from the straightjacket?
                         
           THE VOICE IN THE PHONE
           Suck my Tinkertoy, you faggot cretin... after you suck my
           scalpel, Doctor.
                         
          Bill puts the phone down and speeds the car up to avoid the red
          car which is still following him. The red car catches up with him
          and bumps into him. Bill jumps up.
                         
                          BILL
           Goddamn it !
                         
          The red car bumps into him a second time, and looses part of its
          radiator grill.
           Third bumps. Bill is now out of the freeway and on a road
          downtown.
           The two vehicles are zigzagging between the others cars. Lot of
          honking.
           Without warning, Bill turns on a side street on his right, and
          gets honked by the other cars. In spite of the very dangerous
          driving of Bill among the other cars, the red car keeps on
          following him.
           To follow Bill, the red car must take a vey sharp left turn, and
          bumps into a pickup truck full of kits and gears which fall on the
          pavement.
           The chase goes on. The red car is dented everywhere. It catches
          up with Bill, overtakes him, and bumps violently into Bill's car
          right side.
                          BILL
           Fuck you !
          The red car hits him on the right side twice in a row.
           Fuck you!
          Bill hits the red car on its left side and remains stuck to it.
          They move together, and Bill tries to bring the red car as close
          to the curb as possible.
           Get the... You... Ohh! Get the fuck...
          The red car is so close to the curb that it snatches away the open
          door of a parked car, and then knocks down the shopping caddie of
          a woman. Fortunately, the woman is able to move away, but all her
          shopping items are scattered on the pavement. The two car bump
          again into each other and arrive into a main road.
           When the red car wants to hit Bill's car again, Bill stands on
          the brake and the red car hits a big truck carrying cars. The
          truck honks and start zigzagging in the traffic. The last car on
          the upper bridge of the truck gets loose and falls on the road.
          Bill barely avoids it. Another car gets loose from the truck and
          causes a pile-up on the road.
           Bill zigzag out of the pile-up, and comes to a crossing with a
          railway. A train is approaching. The red car is still behind Bill.
          Bill brakes suddenly just after he has crossed the railway, then
          starts moving backwards. He hits the front of the red car, and
          keeps on moving backwards until he brings the red car on the
          railway itself. The train keeps on honking to move the cars away.
           Hey! You wanna die ! Huh ? You wanna die ?
          We see the driver of the train working madly on his brake, and
          looking to the red car with terror in his eyes.
           Just before the train reaches the crossing, Bill jumps his car
          forward and the red car quickly moves backward.
           Bill stops a few feet after the crossing to get his breath back.
          We see the train moving behind him.
                         
          MEXICAN BAR - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          A Mexican bar, where Hector is a regular. The first shot shows two
          hands playing the harp. Then we get a larger shot and we see
          Hector and Bill talking together. Bill is carrying his jacket on
          his arm, and Hector is wearing his necktie very loose.
           There is quite a crowd in the bar, some people dancing, others
          drinking and some are seated to eat. Electric lines with colored
          bulbs are hung in the trees. In the back, the orchestra keeps on
          playing.
                         
                          HECTOR

          He kisses a passing Mexican woman.
           ? Como esta? Gracias.
                         
                          BILL
           I almost killed somebody out there. I mean, I had that car
           wedged right on the railroad tracks. Christ, man. It's a
           spooky feeling.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Like mainlining adrenalin, huh ? The rush is really
           something, huh ? See ? You're my kind of guy !
          He takes him by the shoulders. They walk out of the field, and we
          see kids hitting a puppet hanging from a tree with a bat. The
          puppet is dressed in a cop's costume !
          Hector and Bill come to the buffet table.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He gets a notebook from his pocket.
           You want to hear what I found out about your famous Monday
           group ?
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah, sure. Can stand a little more pain.
          He takes a plate and starts helping himself at the buffet.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He takes a tray and starts reading. A woman is serving him from
          the buffet.
           Well, Clark's wife divorced him... after he put her in
           intensive care.
                         
                          BILL
           What'd she do ? Spill some wine on the rug ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           Then Sondra, she stabbed her father with a knife... and a
           fork. She must have been having dinner. One of her husbands
           died of unnatural causes.
                         
                          BILL
           Probably lost some body fluids.
                         
                          HECTOR
           And that, that kid Richie. That Richie's been busted for
           drugs... and Casey hates his father so much... he set the
           house on fire. So what do you think of that ?
                         
                          BILL
           I think it's good. They should learn to assert themselves.
                         
          A very bright light, coming from above, suddenly shines on the
          bar. Hector and Bill raises their heads. We hear the engine of a
          helicopter and a voice coming from a loudspeaker.
                         
                          THE VOICE
           Hey, the house is surrounded. Come out with your hands up
           and your legs spread !
                         
                          HECTOR
           What the hell is this ?
                         
          We see the helicopter and its powerful floodlight.
                         
                          THE VOICE
           Happy birthday, Hector ! Hey, Martinez, come on out ! We
           got something for you !
                         
          We get a better view of the helicopter. The word «police» is
          written on its fuselage. Two uniformed cops are standing on the
          right skid. One has a megaphone.
                         
           VOICES OF THE COPS
           Martinez, happy birthday, man !... Happy birthday !
          The crowd starts singing, accompanied by the Mexican orchestra.
                         
                          THE CROWD
           For he's a jolly good fellow ! For he's a jolly good
           fellow ! Which nobody can deny ! Which nobody can deny !
          Bill and Hector come in front of the crowd, and look up.
           For he's a jolly good fellow ! For he's a jolly good... !
          People yell and whistle.
                         
          One of the cops standing on the right skid is a woman. She gets
          her pants down and shows her buttocks to the crowd. Another cop,
          on the other skid, has another megaphone.
           People scream when they see the female cop's buttocks.
                         
                          BILL
           If I had known it was your birthday, I'd have come by
           tomorrow.
                         
                          HECTOR

          In a corner of the bar, Bill and Hector are eating quietly.
          Thunder rumbles and the first drops of rain start falling. The two
          men get up to find a shelter.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Oy. Oigan, ivengan a buscar el cake ! Better get your cake.
           Ivengan a buscar el cake !
                         
          People stop dancing and run to find a shelter.
                          A MAN
           Everybody inside !

           How come you didn't mention Buck ?
                         
                          HECTOR
           There wasn't anything on him.
                         
          BUCK'S RESIDENCE - STREET IN FRONT OF HOUSE - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          It's raining. Bill drives with lights on and roof closed. On the
          side of the car, we can see the dents from the chase with the red
          car. Bill stops in front of a big vehicle. He switches off the car
          lights, gets out of the car, and pulls the collar of his jacket
          up. He stops near a car parked in front of Buck's house. He goes
          round the vehicle. There is a bullet hole in the windshield. Bill
          touches the bullet hole. He then walks toward the house, and stops
          in front of the open garage door. Inside is a red car. Bill enters
          the garage to have a better look at the car. When he gets up after
          inspecting the car, we see Buck standing behind him. Bill turns
          around. Buck has a gun in his hand.
                          BUCK
           You caught me at a bad time.
                         
                          BILL
           Can we get in out of the rain?
                         
          Slowly Buck starts walking toward the inside of the house. Bill
          starts walking too in front of Buck. They enter the house.
                         
          BUCK'S RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          They get inside the house, which is lit only by the street lights
          and a unique lamp above the desk.
           Typical bachelor's place. Very messy. The furniture is simple and
          practical.
           We hear the storm rumbling in the distance.
                         
                          BUCK
           Have a seat.
                         
          Buck gets into the bathroom, the door of which is wide open, and
          grabs a towel. He dries himself and throw the towel to Bill. Bill
          sits down. Buck sits down on an armchair covered with a tartan
          rug. Bill dries his face. He looks at the gun, still in Buck's
          hand.
                         
                          BILL
           I don't like guns.
                         
          Buck shoves angrily the gun between the armrest and the cushion of
          his seat. He lies back in his armchair which rocks a little. Bill
          takes his jacket off.
           A lightning floods the room with a very bright light. Buck puts
          his hands on his face. He moans.
                         
                         
                          BUCK
           Oh, shit !
                         
                          BILL
           Was it raining like this that night ?
                         
                          BUCK
           Yeah. We were drivin'... me, my wife, my daughter. This guy
           comes out wavin', "Stop!" So I slow down. My wife said,
           "No, not here, Buck. It's a bad neighborhood. Besides, the
           baby's asleep in the back." And I said, "Bad neighborhood,
           nothing." So I stopped. Never even made it to the other
           car. I could hear the shots being fired, but my eyes
           wouldn't open. L...
          Another lightning. Buck puts his hands on his head.
           Oh, man ! The rain brought me around. This heavy, heavy
           rain. And I'm on the sidewalk, and I crawl over... and pull
           my way up and... There are two lateral shots... to the head
           for my wife... and a single shot through the heart for my
           daughter. Oh, Jesus, God ! Oh, Jesus. They got, uh... They
           got $31. The rain nails me every time, man.
                         
                          BILL
           Did they ever find out who did it ?
                         
                          BUCK
           No. I think it was some kind of payback for something. But
           that's a long story.

          The rain has stopped, but the ground is still wet. The garage door
          opens slowly and Bob's car enters the garage. The roof is still

          seeming more and more anxious. Finally, he enters the house.

          Still anxious, Bill walks along the corridor.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bill enters the kitchen. A lot of cooking ingredients scattered on
          the table. A noise makes Bill turn around. Rose, who was kneeling
          behind the table, stands up. She smiles when she sees Bill.
                         
                          ROSE
           Hey.
          She snickers. The only piece of clothing she is wearing is a hotel
          room-maid white apron.
           Busy day ? Can I get you something ?
          Bill doesn't react at all. He looks shocked.
           No ? Okay.
          She crosses the room to get something in a drawer, showing her
          naked buttocks. All of a sudden, she seems to remember she is
          naked and put the two square fireproof cloths she is holding on
          her buttocks.
           Oh! I forgot about that !
          She laughs then comes back to the stove, where she moves a dish.
           Bill's face still looks very shocked.
                         
                          BILL
           How did you get in here ?
                         
                          ROSE
           Last time I was here, I stole the key. It was by the door.
                         
                          BILL
           What about the alarm ?
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh ! I never thought about that.
                          BILL
           It didn't go off ?
                         
                          ROSE
           No. Um, did I make a mistake ? You have someone in the
           car ?
                         
                          BILL
           No, goddamn it, there isn't someone in the car ! People are
           getting killed around here ! You walk around like it's
           goddamn Disneyland ! What if something were to happen to
           you ?
                         
                          ROSE
          She seems not to understand Bill's anger.
           I just thought that it would be a nice surprise, that's
           all. You don't look too happy to see me.
                         
                          BILL
          He waits a few second before he cools down.
           This is my happiness mode. I'm sorry.
                          ROSE
          She is crying. Bill comes to her and takes her in his arms.
           I'm sorry.
                         
                          BILL
           I'm sorry. Baby, I'm sorry. This is a very nice surprise.
          He gives a quick look at her naked body. She laughs.
           Really nice. I'm sorry.
          They kiss.
                         
                          ROSE
           I'll never take a risk like that again.
                         
                          BILL
           Why don't you take the biggest risk of all and give me...
           your phone number.
                         
                          ROSE
          She laughs and goes away from him and back to her cooking.
           Christ, Capa ! I can't have people tying up the phone
           lines. I'm trying to run a business here.

          Bill, with his shirt completely open, eats spaghettis in front of
          a lighted candle. Rose also eats spaghettis, still dressed only in
          her white apron. Bill drinks from a glass of white wine. Rose
          bites into a asparagus in a slightly erotic way. Under the glass
          table, we can see Bill's naked foot stroking Rose's foot. With her
          other foot, Rose moves Bill's pants up. Rose slides down on her
          chair, so Bill can reach her feet with his hands. Then Rose slides
          completely out of her chair and under the table.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          A toy remote-controlled tank is moving on Rose's naked legs. The
          shot gets larger and we discover that Rose is in a bathtub full of
          foaming water.
                          BILL
          Voice over.
           General Patton comes out of the foothills.
          The tank moves on Rose's pubis, then on her stomach.
           Oh, he's in the swamp. Oh, oh, he's in the deep abyss.
          The tank skid on Rose's naked skin and doesn't succeed in climbing
          on her breast. We then see she is lying on her back on Bill's
          naked body, who is also lying on this back in the bathtub.
           Ooh! Ooh ! And now... Oh, he's having a problem. He's up in
           the Swiss Alps, ladies and gentlemen.
          They both laugh. We see Bill's hand holding the remote control.
           Fire one. Fire... Oh !... A direct hit !
          The tank skids into the water and stops.
                         
                          ROSE
          Voice ironically disappointed.

           Oh, our, our tank fleet is crippled.

                          ROSE
          She turns around and we guess she is grabbing Bill's penis under
          water.
           How's the submarine fleet ?

          Tracking shot down a high glass building until it reaches the
          entrance of the «Grand Central Market».
           We hear Anderson and Bill in voice over.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Nobody told me Buck was one of your patients.
                         
                          BILL
           "Nobody," like Martinez ?
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Right.
                         
                          BILL
           That's the same "nobody" who didn't tell me Buck was a cop.
                         
          The camera is now on street level and we see Bill and Anderson
          crossing the street towards the main gate of the market. They pass
          a truck delivering fresh meat.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Fucking Martinez. That's a can of worms you don't want to
           mess with.
                         
                          BILL

           Hey, look, you gotta promise... if I tell you what I know
           about this shit, it stays between me and you. And you never
           heard it from me, okay ?
          They walk in the market alleyways. Anderson stops near a stall,
          and starts talking to a stall-holder we do not see.
           Two, Angelo.
                         
                          BILL
           Why ?
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Why ?
          Two uniformed cops are walking between the stalls. Anderson raises
          his voice to them.
           Because cops are vindictive sons of bitches. Right, Alex ?
          He throws a chicory to a cop, who catches it.
                         
                          ALEX
           Right.
                         
                          ANDERSON
          The cops are gone away. Anderson lowers his voice.
           Fucking asshole. I don't want to spend the rest of my
           career getting pissed on from above, okay ?
                         
                          BILL
           Okay.
                         
                          ANDERSON
          He laughs nervously.
           Martinez was nailin' Buck's wife.
                         
                          BILL
           Holy shit.
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Yeah. Both these guys were in narcotics. And those guys
           usually stick together like shit on a shirt... so who knows
           how long it's been going on. Anyway, one day, it came out.
           In the station, they had this big fight in front of
           everybody.
          Anderson takes two little wrapped packages from the unseen stall-
          holder and gives one to Bill.
           Two days later, Buck's wife gets blown away.
                         
                          BILL
          He follow Anderson between the stalls.
           Jesus Christ ! Was there an investigation ?
                         
                          ANDERSON
           Of course there was an investigation. Martinez was a
           suspect. Buck was a suspect. I mean nobody figured Buck
           forgiving her. For a while, half the station was a suspect.
                         
                          BILL
           What do you think ?
                         
                          ANDERSON
           I think Buck and Martinez had a lot of enemies on the
           street. This was just payback
           for both of 'em.
          They have come to a fishmonger stall. The fishmonger wraps a fish
          for Anderson.

           Well, you think you can do it in 30 ?

          Bob's car stops in front of the building. Bill, wearing
          sunglasses, gets out of the car and walks toward a three-story,
          impressive but a bit dilapidated, brick building. Evidently, it is
          an old workshop changed into an artist's loft. We can still read
          «Nate Starkman & Son» on the front of the building.
           Bill comes to a large metallic door and presses on an intercom
          button. No answer. He tries again. He raises his head to the above
          windows. No one. He walks a few steps back to get a better view of
          the building.

          Casey is still lying on his exercise bench. Both his hands are
          tied to the weight-lifting device, and his mouth is gagged. He

           Casey !
                         
          He comes back to the door and presses the intercom button several
          times. He raises his eyes and notice a folded fire-exit ladder. He
          test the strength of the folding gate pulled in front of one of
          the doors. It seems strong enough for him to climb it. He reaches
          the ladder, which he brings down.

          Bill is now on the roof of the building. He jumps down in a sort
          of yard, in which are scattered various objects : plants, modern
          furnitures and a full-size very realistic plastic sculpture of a
          cow. Bill remains crouched a few second, pats the cow's snout,
          stands up and walks towards a glass wall located on one side of
          the yard. He notices he is above Casey's workshop. He walks along
          the glass wall to a closed window, from which smoke is coming out.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh, Jesus Christ.
          Bill succeeds in forcing the window open. A big cloud of smoke
          gets out of it.

          Bill walks on the upper gallery, coughing with the smoke. He takes
          off his sunglasses. Down he sees flames around the mantlepiece. He
          gets very quickly down the steps to ground level.
           He goes to the mantlepiece. What looks like pieces of paper are
          burning on the floor around the mantlepiece. He first tries to put
          the flames out with his foot, then he takes a small shovel and
          shovel the flaming papers back into the mantlepiece.
           A curtain suddenly opens on the glass wall above the workshop,
          flooding the room with bright light.
           Bill walks to the center of the room, and notice that paintings
          have been lacerated. On each one, it is the face of a red-hair
          woman which has been taken away. Bill runs back to the
          mantlepiece, where he picks up a piece of what he first thought
          was a piece of paper, but which is actually a piece of canvas from
          the paintings. On the half-burned piece of canvas, the face of a
          woman, who is heavily made up but looks slightly like Rose.
           He puts the piece of canvas down, and notice a slimy liquid on
          the floor. He turns around to try to find out more about this
          slimy liquid.
           He pulls a rope and the painting, hooked on an horizontal cable
          line, start moving toward him. Behind the paintings, hooked on the
          same cable, comes Casey's body, hanging upside down. He looks dead
          and sill have the gag on this mouth. The half-naked body is
          covered with graffitis. The slimy liquid on the floor is Casey's
          blood.
                         
                          BILL
           Ow ! Ow ! Ow ! Shit !
                         
          Suddenly the blood, which was grey seen through Bill's eyes, turns
          red.
                         
          A ROAD - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Sondra's car. Sondra is driving. Rose is on the passenger seat,
          with her Bonnie's hairdo and make-up. The car radio is playing a
          song.
                         
                          ROSE

           I know.
                         
          Honking. Two thirty-year old men, in an open convertible red car.
                         
           THE RED CAR PASSENGER
           You girls want to go dancing ?
                         
           THE RED CAR DRIVER
           Yeah. We're going to a party.

           Hi ! Hi !...
                         
          Rose bends over Sondra and kisses her tenderly.
                         
           THE RED CAR PASSENGER
           Well, pardon me !
          The two men look disappointed. Their car speeds up and goes away.
          The two women start laughing. Rose stands up through the open roof
          of the car. She waves to the passing cars. She then sits down and
          moves tenderly very close to Sondra.
                         
                          SONDRA
           What are you doing ?
          Rose takes Sondra's hand and guide it under her skirt toward her
          crotch.
           Wha... No!
          Sondra bursts laughing and takes her hand away. Rose keeps on
          cuddling Sondra who tries to concentrate on her driving.
           Don't ! Don't !
                         
          SONDRA'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Music from preceding scene has gone on without interruption. The
          two girls are dancing in front of the mirror. Sondra is wearing a
          tight-fitting black dress and Rose a skirt and a short top which
          shows her belly.
                          SONG WORDS
           Out all night Lady did. When nobody else would. Lady did
           And she did it real good. Once was not enough.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Ah !
                         
                          ROSE
           Sondra, go !
                         
                          SONG WORDS
           Tell me, Katie What would your mama say.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, I'm gonna go change the music.
                         
          While Sondra moves away to change the music, Rose goes to the
          window. In the house across the street, she sees a couple kissing.
          The music stops.
                         
                          ROSE
           Sondra, come here. Oh, come here. My God !
                         
                          SONDRA
          She comes near Rose.
           Oh, my God !
                         
                          ROSE
           These are your neighbors !
                         
                          SONDRA
           They do this all the time.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, wait. Watch, watch! No!
                         
                          ROSE
          She bends down under the window sill and get Sondra down too.
           They're gonna see you !
                         
          They get up and keep on watching.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, I don't believe it !

                          SONDRA
           Believe me, they can fuck.
          They laugh.
           Oh, I can't watch this anymore. I didn't see anything.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, Sondra, go. I love this song.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Yeah.
                         
          The two girls start cuddling each other. Sondra strokes Rose's
          naked stomach, then her face.
           Close-up on the mirror, which shows the fire in the mantelpiece,
          between the girls legs.
                         
                          ROSE
           Sondra, through the window ! Look ! Look !
                         
          The camera remains on the mirror, which shows the two girls
          climbing on the bed to get a better look.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Oh, what are they doing now ?
                         
                          ROSE
           I can't tell.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Are they gonna do it ? No !
                         
          We see the couple in the house across the street. She is only
          wearing panties and her breast is naked. He is only wearing his
          trunks. They flirt on the couch.
                         
                          ROSE
           My God ! It's gonna happen right now.
                         
          Back to the mirror shot. The two girls, still standing up, are
          slapping each other buttocks. Rose raises Sondra's dress.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Ow !
                          ROSE
           Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
          She sits on the bed and picks up a champagne glass.
           Oh, champagne.
                         
          Sondra comes and sits next to her. Rose gives her her glass.
          Sondra drinks.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Mmm.
                         
          Sondra gives the glass back to Rose, who puts it on a furniture.
          The two faces come very close, and the two girls start exchanging
          tender little kisses. Then Rose moves Sondra's dress down and
          takes her own top off, showing her breast. Sondra seems very moved
          by what she sees. She strokes Rose's face. Their lips are getting
          very close.
           We see Sondra's hand going down Rose's back, and slipping under
          the top of her skirt, showing her buttocks. We see the tattooed
          rose.
                         
                          ROSE
          She moves her face away from Sondra.
           No, no, Sondra. I can't. I can't.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Why ? It's wonderful.
                         
                          ROSE
           Sondra, I'm a jinx.
                         
                          SONDRA
           No. We can cancel each other out.
                         
                          ROSE
          She sobs a little.
           No. I'm not who you think I am. Oh, God, I'm in love with
           somebody and it's all falling apart. I'm sorry.
                         
                          SONDRA
           Look, the sky isn't falling down.
                         
                          ROSE
           Yes, it is.
                         
                          SONDRA
           No. Let's get that silly thing off your head. There. I love
           your brown hair.
          She strokes her hair.
                         
          BOB'S RESIDENCE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Bill sleeps on a leather couch, dressed with a western-style shirt
          and jeans. There is a gun on the low table near his head. We hear
          a buzz. Bill wakes up, gets up and looks at the security TV set.
          He takes the remote control to change the camera.
                         
                          BILL
           Who is it ?
          After two unsuccessful pictures, Rose appears on the screen. She
          is wearing very short pants, a flowered blouse knotted under her
          breast and a small backpack.
                         
                          ROSE'S VOICE
           I'm back.
                         
          Bill opens the gate and looks through the window at Rose crossing
          the garden.
                         
                          BILL
           Here she comes. Wearing a backpack on her back... making
           her look even younger than she is.
          Rose enters the room, puts her backpack down and falls in Bill's
          arms.
           She falls into his arms. And they kiss.
          They kiss.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, God. I'm so glad that you're here. I didn't know if
           you'd be in.
                          BILL
           I don't have to be anywhere until this evening.
                         
                          ROSE
           Yeah ?
          She opens her blouse. She doesn't wear a bra and her nipple
          appears.
           So, what color are my nipples ?
                         
          They both laugh. She covers and uncovers her nipple. They kiss
          tenderly.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, God. To be normal like this all the time.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh, God, this is better than normal. This is much better
           than normal. It's just driving me crazy, that's all. I
           mean, I don't really know you... who you are... what you
           do... if you're safe, when you're coming by. You have all
           the power. I just sit around here and wait for you.
                         
                          ROSE
          She cries.
           You do ?
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah. I mean, other things happen, but... in the "what I
           wait for" department, you're it.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, my.
                         
          Time has elapsed. They are now seated next to each other. Bill is
          bare-chest and Rose is wearing one of Bill's denim shirts. They
          look at a photo album. Rose puts her finger on the pictures and
          Bill tells her who it is.
                          BILL
           Bob's wife. My ex-wife.
                         
                          ROSE
           She's pretty.
                         
                          BILL
           Pretty fucked up.
          Rose flips the page. A picture of Bob.
           Oh, God. I forget that he's dead.
          She kisses him tenderly to comfort him.
                         
                          ROSE
          She flips the page.
           He looks so young here. God, how long ago were these
           taken ?
                         
                          BILL
           Ten years ago.
                         
                          ROSE
           Really ? Do you have anything more recent ?
                          BILL
           Maybe. Hold on.
          He gets up and goes to the shelves. He start looking for another
          album.
           I don't know why he kept this hidden back here except
           maybe... because it had a picture of his wife naked, which
           leads me to believe that... the relationship wasn't as dead
           as they were pretending.
          He sits back next to Rose, and start looking at the new album.
           I don't know who these people are.
                         
                          ROSE
          She seems very worried all of a sudden.
           No. It's morbid. I don't want to see anymore. Let's go
           outside. Let's pretend it's Sunday. Yeah? You wanna?

          We hear the birds chirping. By the poolside, Bill is lying on his
          back on a mattress. He is wearing sunglasses, and is naked except
          for a white towel spread on his pelvis. Rose is lying on her
          stomach, head to foot with Bill. She is naked but is wearing one
          thick woolen sock on one foot.

          He takes off his sunglasses and start getting up, covering his
          crotch with the towel.
           About a half hour before group. I'm gonna get a shower. You
           gonna be okay out here ?

          Rose has dressed up. She enters the room and goes directly to the
          shelf where the photo album was hidden. She gets it and starts
          turning the pages.

          Bill comes out of the dressing room, and into a gallery above the
          sitting room. He sees Rose looking through the album, taking a
          picture out of the album and then putting the album back where it
          was. He hides behind a wall for her not to see him. She is looking
          inside a photo-lab envelope. Bill comes out of his hiding.
                         
                          BILL

          We see Bill driving his car. He chases Rose, whom we then see in
          her car. Tires screech with the high speed driving. Bill comes
          closer to Rose and tries to memorize her license plate numbers.
                          BILL
           2ASB... 185...
                         
          The chase goes on. Rose drives very recklessly, Bill too. He
          drives through the cross roads without slowing down.
           A man, who was seated on a low wall, has to climb on it to avoid
          Bill's car, which is driving on the sidewalk. Bill stops near him.

          He is very smartly dressed, and even wears a bow tie. He counts
          the books on the shelves.
           Five and six are 31. Seven, seven, that makes 45. And that
           will remain 45, and every single time you count it, it will
           be 45, no matter what. And then this is five, and that
           makes 50. And nine is 59. Now that's odd. That's really
           odd. Now there's 59 again.

           Which one, Sondra ?
                          SONDRA
          She is very smartly dressed too, in a white suit with black
          collar. She sighs.
           I didn't read any of it. Really. I felt so bad when I got
           it home. I couldn't help myself.

          Bill has seated himself, and he looks through the book. Sondra
          tries to read above his shoulder. Close-up of the book. It is
          Bob's diary. Close-up on one paragraph. We hear Bob's voice
          reading the paragraph.

           I'd like to start, if I may. I'd like to apologize to the
           group and Sondra.
          While he is talking, Bill keeps on looking through his friend's
          diary. A photo is stuck between two pages. It is a photo of Rose
          naked.
           Everything that you said last week in group was right, and
           that's why I lost my temper. Uh, the young lady that I
           mentioned last week... that relationship has been
           terminated. No reason and no hope. She just, just called...
           and told me, and that's it.
                         
                          BILL
          He reads what is written on the back of the photo.
           "The sociopath, lacking the restraints that... hold a
           normal character together, can become anything. Amorality
           frees her to be universally perfect. A charming chameleon
           with a scorpion's tail." Do any of you recognize...
           recognize this woman ?
          He gives the photo to Sondra.
                          SONDRA
          She laughs and brings the picture to her chest.
           Oh, my God ! Oh ! This is my girlfriend. This is Bonnie.

           Bob Moore... who probably took this amazing picture himself
           in front of his expensive painting. I'm gonna call the
           Guinness Book of World Records... because I think this
           woman deserves credit. And I'm gonna make sure that all of
           your names are included... so you can all share in the
           glory.

                          HECTOR

           But I realized we both loved her. It became a, sort of a
           bond between us. Isn't that right, Hector ? Isn't it ?
           Hector ! Jesus God ! I never got the chance to forgive her.
           So I forgave him instead.

          Bob's car, still dented all over, starts, with open roof, and Bill
          driving. He is wearing sunglasses.
           As the car passes a crossroad, we see, coming on its right , the
          «red car», also dented all over. It starts following Bill.
           Bill parks his car on a parking lot, at the bottom of a parking
          building. The red car climbs to the roof of the building.
           Bill cuts the ignition off, takes his keys and gets out of the
          car. He starts walking along the building, the red car following
          him from the roof.
           The red car stops behind a car parked on the edge of the roof,
          then starts pushing the car. The car breaks the guardrail and
          falls down to the ground. Bill raises his head, sees the car
          coming down, jumps away and falls flat on the ground, just
          avoiding the falling car, which crashes on two other parked cars.
          We see the front of the red car appearing behind the broken
          guardrail. Bill bangs his fist on the ground, while pieces of
          broken cars are flying all around him.

          the bannister of one of the upper galleries.
                         
                          ANDERSON

           Why in God's name are you doing this horrible joke ?

                          EDITH
           Richie Dexter is dead ! He killed himself four years ago.
                         
                          BILL
           Why ?
                         
                          EDITH
           Because he couldn't stand... what my husband was doing to
           him.
          She gets up goes to the window bay and open a glass door. She
          leans against the frame of the door.
           He hung himself with a belt. He was 12. I didn't know ! I
           mean, how could I know ? Nobody knew.
                         
                          BILL
           What about the family ?
                          EDITH
           He is survived by his brother, Dale. If Richie Dexter were
           alive today... he'd be 16 years old. He also had a sister,
           Rose.
                         
          Bill stands still for a few seconds. He has just understood the
          truth. Then he sighs and rushes out of the house. He runs near a
          impressive mantlepiece decorated with a fierce lion head pulling
          its tongue out.
                         
          DALE'S WORKSHOP - PARKING - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bob's car arrives on the empty parking lot in front of Dale's
          workshop. The atmosphere is even more uncomfortable at night than
          during the day. Lightnings in the sky. There are lights evenly
          placed all along the high chimney. Several windows are lit on the
          first floor of the building.
           Bill parks the car in front of the building, gets out the car
          and runs toward the building. He enters using the door with the
          sign «Beware of dog».
                         
          DALE'S WORKSHOP - LIVING QUARTERS - INTERIOR NIGHT
          Bill gets in the living quarters of the Dexter. It is quite dark.
          In one corner, a large kitsch statue of Christ of the Sacred
          Heart. A sink with two cabinets with glass doors..
           Bill pushes the sliding door leading to the workshop.
                         
          DALE'S WORKSHOP - WORKSHOP - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Bill walks between statues being worked on. He bumps into a small
          cage hanging from the ceiling.
           He opens a door which leads him into a small room covered with
          spiderwebs. Something liquid drops on his hand. It's blood. Bill
          raises his head.
           Though a gate in the ceiling, he sees the crying face of Richie.
           He gets out of the small room, takes a big piece of carved wood
          on a table, and climbs the steps leading to the upper parts of the
          workshop.
           When he arrives in the upper gallery, he menacingly waves the
          piece of wood, and walks very cautiously. Richie is seated with
          his back to him. He has blood on his T-shirt.
                         
                          BILL
           Richie.
          He gets nearer and puts the piece of wood down.
           Jesus Christ !
          When he is close to Richie, he sees that his T-shirt is badly torn
          down and full of blood. He wants to touch it, but Richie starts
          moaning. Bill kneels near him.
           What did he... What did he do to you ?
                         
                          RICHIE
          He can hardly talk, and stammers even more than usual.
           W-What I... d-deserved. Y-You shouldn't be here. Get away
           from me.
                         
                          BILL
           Richie... Richie... I have to see Rose.
          He takes off Richie's glasses.
           I need her.
          He takes off Richie's wig, and Rose's face appears.
                         
                          ROSE
          She has gone back to Rose's voice, and doesn't stammer anymore.
           Get away from me, please ! You'll make it worse !
                         
                          BILL
           Where's Dale ?
                         
                          ROSE
          She cries.
           L-I don't know, but he'll be back ! L-I don't know where he
           is.
                         
                          BILL
          He is also crying.
           Was this your idea, to become Richie ?
                         
                          ROSE
           No ! No ! L-It happened. It just happened.
                          BILL
           What? What happened, Rose ? Please. I need to know.
                         
                          ROSE
           When Richie died... Dale buried the body and then he said,
           "Richie, come here." And I told him, I told him, "My name
           is Rose !" He slapped me so hard, I couldn't get up. A-And
           he, he made me dress in these clothes... and h-he did
           things to me that made me not want to be a woman anymore. I
           was Richie from then on.
                         
                          BILL
           What happened to Rose ?
                         
                          ROSE
           After a while, I forgot about Rose. Then Richie got busted.
                         
                          BILL
           And you had to come to group.
                         
                          ROSE
           They were our world. They were our family.
                         
                          BILL
           But then what ? Rose started coming back ?
                         
                          ROSE
           No! Rose, Rose was too scared, so Bonnie came out. Bonnie
           was first.
                         
                          BILL
           Oh, honey.
                         
                          ROSE
           Help me, please ! Help me.
          Rose moves her eyes down and Bill follows her eyes. He discovers
          that Rose's hand has been nailed to the carved armrest of the
          armchair.
                          BILL
           Jesus! Oh, my God !
          Bill stands up.
           Oh! Jesus Christ ! Jesus Christ !
          He goes to the table where he had dropped the piece of wood and
          start looking for an appropriate tool. He finds a big hammer.
           That crazy bastard !
          With the forked end of the hammer, he raises the nail.
                         
                          ROSE
          She cries and yells.
           Oh, God !
                         
          Bill gets the nail off. Rose can't breathe anymore. Her eyes are
          rolling upwards.
                         
                          BILL
          He feels that she is going away from him.
           Rose !
                         
                          ROSE
          She goes back to Richie's voice and face. She starts stammering
          again.
           Get away f-from me!
                         
                          BILL
           Rose, come back ! Richie ! Richie, leave her alone !
                         
                          ROSE
          Still talking like Richie.
           I never get to be out a-anymore.
                         
                          BILL
           Rose. Come on.
                         
                          ROSE
          Rose's head stands up : she is gone back being Rose.
           And then I met you and the fog... Started to lift.
          Bill takes off the other nail.
           It did. It did.
                         
                          BILL
           I know. Come on, let's go.
          He helps her to stand up, and then to walk.
           Let's go. Here we go. Come on. Shh. Come here.
          They start going down to the workshop.
           Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.
                         
          We hear the sound of a nail-gun, and a nail clicks on a piece of
          metal near them.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh !
                         
          Several nail-gun shots. Nails are getting stuck in the various
          wooden objects around them.
                         
                          DALE
          Shot from behind Dale. He holds a nail-gun and keeps on shooting
          nails.
           Back up!
          He sticks a nail in Bill's shirt. Bill remains nailed against a
          carved wooden panel.
                         
                          ROSE
          She yells and holds Bill tightly.
           No ! No, Dale, don't !
                         
                          BILL
           Get back ! Get back !
                         
                          ROSE
           Dale, no !
                         
                          DALE
           Quick tongue, slow wit. Deadly, Doctor.
          Bill tries to take the nail off. The nail must have gone through
          his flesh, because there is blood on his shirt.
           Deadly.
                         
          Dale raises his nail-gun slowly, but Hector appears from behind a
          wall, holding a «real» gun.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Hi, Dale. You fucking daffodil. Put that toy down. Put it
           in the toolbox. Now ! I got .45 caliber nails in this gun !
                         
                          BILL
           What are you doing here, Martinez ?
                         
                          HECTOR
          He talks to Bill who is behind him, but without taking his eyes
          away from Dale.
           Aren't you glad I'm here ? Anderson snitched you out !
           That's what happens when you try to outsmart a cop ! Let
           that be your psych lesson for the day !
                         
          At the end of his sentence, Hector slightly turns his head toward
          Bill. Immediately Dale shoots him. Hector bends down a little
          because of the pain, and stands back up to shoot Dale. But Dale is
          faster than him and nails both of his hands against the wood
          panel.
                         
                          HECTOR
          He yells.
           Go ! Run !
                         
                          BILL
           Go ! Get over there ! Get over there !
                         
                          ROSE
           No ! No !
                         
          Dale keeps on shooting and sticks several nails in Hector's
          fingers.
                         
                          HECTOR
           Go ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Run ! Go !
          Bill succeeds in getting the nail off his arm. He runs away with
          Rose.
           We follows them through the workshop. As they reach a staircase,
          we hear an engine starting. Then a whole block of shelves falls in
          front of them. We see Dale in a small glass cabin, his hands on
          the controls of a handling machine.
           Bill moves Rose away from him...
                         
                          BILL
           Let's go!
                         
          ... just as a huge piece of furniture falls on Bill, who falls
          down, stuck under the furniture.
                         
                          ROSE
           No ! Get out !
                         
          Dale appears behind Bill, and wraps a leather belt around his
          neck. He tightens the belt. Bill suffocates. Dale pulls him by the
          belt across the workshop.
                         
                          DALE
           Come on ! Come on !
                         
          He puts him inside a metal cage. He ties the belt on the top of
          the cage. Bill tries, with both hands to move the belt away from
          his throat.
                         
                          BILL
           You fucking son of a bitch !
          Dale takes a small electric saw, switches it on and tests it on
          the bars of the cage. Sparks spring up.
           You really fucked it up, didn't ya ? Got your little
           brother killed.
                         
                          DALE
           No !
                         
                          BILL
           You let old Niedelmeyer do it to him.
                         
                          DALE
           No, I saved him !
                         
                          BILL
           You knew what was happening...
                         
                          DALE
           I didn't know !
                         
                          BILL
           Because it happened to you before !
                         
                          DALE
           Would you goddamn shut up ?
                         
                          BILL
           Could have saved your little brother, but he killed
           himself.
                          DALE
          He is getting angry.
           Shut up ! Shut the fuck up !
                         
                          BILL
           You failed, Dale. And you made Rose become Richie !
                         
                          DALE
          He calms down and smiles.
           Oh, you're smart. You're really smart. Bob Moore was smart,
           but I put a stop to that.
                         
                          BILL
           Yeah, you did.
          He coughs.
           Why'd you kill Casey, Dale?
                         
                          DALE
           Why are you head-shrinkers all alike, huh ? Y-You can't
           keep your fucking hands off of us. Huh ? Always pokin' and
           pushin'. Huh ?
          While talking, he keeps on switching his saw on and off.
                          BILL
           Why'd you do it, Dale ?
                         
                          DALE
           Because... that little bitch, Rose, she started sneaking
           out... playing like Bonnie, modeling for him night after
           night. Christ, Bill, he was lookin' right through her...
           gonna recognize Richie in group. Well, I might have missed
           old Niedelmeyer... but I sure as hell got Bob... real good.
           - And now...
          He starts his saw. Sparks spring up on the edge of the cage.
           I'm gonna cut you into little pieces and sand the skin off.
                         
                          BILL
          He snickers.
           The inspiration of madness, Dale.
                         
                          DALE
           The tyranny of normalcy, Bill.
                         
          He starts his saw again, and slowly moves it close to Bill. We
          hear the sound of the nail-gun and a nail gets stuck in Dale's
          shoulder. The saw stops. Dale walks back a few steps to face Rose,
          holding the nail-gun pointed on him.
                         
                          DALE
           Richie.
                         
                          ROSE
           My name is... My name is Rose.
          He rushes on her. She shoots and sticks a nail in the middle of
          his forehead. Dale falls down. Rose starts screaming.
           No ! No !
          Bill tries to get the belt off his neck. Rose raises the gun to
          her throat, and presses the trigger. But it doesn't work. She
          tries again. It still doesn't work. The gun must be empty.
           No !
          Bill eventually succeeds in getting free, but Rose, after she has
          thrown the gun away, starts running through the workshop.
           No !
                         
                          BILL
          He runs after her.
           Rose ! Rose ! Come back ! Rose !
                         
          DALE'S WORKSHOP - CHIMNEY - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Rose starts climbing the ladder mounted on the body of the
          chimney. Bill follows her and yells.
                         
                          BILL
           Rose ! Rose ! Stop ! Rose !
          Rain is soaking both of them, but they keep on climbing. Thunder
          is rumbling.
           A long distance shot shows the whole chimney, with Rose and Bill
          climbing on it.
           Wait ! Rose!
                         
                          ROSE
          She sobs.
           Don't !
                         
                          BILL
           For God's sakes, don't jump ! Rose !
                         
                          ROSE
          She has reached the circular platform on the top of the chimney.
          She yells.
           No !
                         
                          BILL
           Rose ! Stop !
                         
                          BILL
          He reaches the platform.
           No ! No. No !
                         
                          BILL
           Wait !
                         
                          ROSE
           Why ?
                         
                          BILL
           Rose ! No ! Stop, please !
          Rose jumps on the very narrow ring which circles the platform.
           Just stay there !
                         
                          ROSE
           It's too late. I've gone too far. I can't go back.
                         
                          BILL
           If you go, I go ! I swear to God ! I swear to God.
                         
                          ROSE
           Why would you do that ?
                          BILL
           Please, God, just come over here. I don't want you to die.
           Just give me your hand. Take a risk ! There's no risk in
           dying. Come on.
                         
                          ROSE
           Oh, Capa.
                         
                          BILL
           Come on.
                         
                          ROSE
          She puts her hand out to Bill's strutted hand. We hear the sound
          of a high gust of wind, and Rose looses her balance and starts
          falling backward.
           L... No...
                         
                          BILL
           No !
                         
                          ROSE
           Capa !
          She yells.
           No !
                         
          Bill jumps from the platform and catches a chain hanging under the
          platform. His momentum makes him swing and he catches Rose's arm
          just as she was falling from the outer ring. With his other arm he
          holds on the chain and they start swinging back and forth. They
          eventually reach the chimney ladder. Rose grabs one of the rungs,
          followed by Bill, who pushes her up.
                         
                          BILL
           Come on.
                         
          They move back to the platform, and, as soon as they reach it,
          they hug each other very tight. Bill looks at the beacon on the
          top of the chimney. From white, the beacon becomes red, which is
          its real color. Bill smiles : he sees red again. He hugs Rose even
          more tightly.
                         
                          HECTOR'S VOICE
          While the camera pans away from the platfom, showing the whole
          platform with Bill and Rose holding each other, we hear Hector's
          voice.
           Hey! Listen up, you fucking daffodils ! You gonna leave me
           hanging here all night, huh ?
          Bill starts laughing.
           Get me down, you goddamn cuckoos ! Get me some fucking
           Band-Aids !
          Bill keeps on laughing. Rose starts laughing too.
           Come on, you fucking daffodils ! Get me out of here !
