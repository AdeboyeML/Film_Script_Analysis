          An abandoned looking trailer sits on top of two 15-foot-tall
          oil drums. Distant thunder trembles through the peeling
          metal panels. The structure is in such disrepair, that
          surely no one lives here.

          baby chicken that appears to be dead. This is HUSHPUPPY, an

          Hushpuppy places the chick on the crawfish hole, like a queen
          on her throne and the chick twitches to life, cheeps twice.
          Hushpuppy's esoteric science experiment is interrupted by
          DISTANT THUNDER. Her eyes stand to attention.

           distance. This levee, the first piece of modern construction
           we've seen, encloses the civilized world, protecting it from
           rising water. The Bathtub is on the wrong side of wall.
                         
           Wink stares out at the distant factories behind the wall with

           They look up to the sound of FOOTSTEPS on the upper deck.
                         
           Hushpuppy looks up to see SERGEANT MAJOR (60) -
                         
           A big, timeless looking man with a salt and pepper moustache,
           saunters up to the rail. He stares down, examining these
           runts with an air of suspicion.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           I'm going by my Mamma.
                         
           He smiles broadly, as if this was the secret password. Him
           and Hushpuppy stare at each other and immediately there is
           understanding. Two lost souls in the wilderness.
                         
                          SERGEANT MAJOR
           That's a good place to go.

           Hushpuppy sits adjacent to the Sergeant in the tug's elevated
           wheelhouse. They are two stories up, and the white walls
           create a glow that makes us feel like we're almost in another
           dimension.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           Which way are we going?
                         
                          SERGEANT MAJOR
           Don't matter baby, this boat'll
           take you exactly where you need to
           be. It's just that type of boat.
                         
           Hushpuppy and Sergeant Major share an ease unlike anyone else
           we've seen Hushpuppy interacted with. The speak like an old
           teacher with his favorite disciple. They let their silences
           last.
                         
           SERGEANT MAJOR (CONT'D)
           You want a chicken biscuit?
                         
           Hushpuppy shakes her head `no'.
                         
           SERGEANT MAJOR (CONT'D)
           They're good for you.
                         
           A deep, far away melancholy settles over him. He munches on
           a chicken biscuit, then tosses the wrapper on the floor. The
           wheelhouse is wall to wall with chicken biscuit wrappers.
                         
           SERGEANT MAJOR (CONT'D)
           I been eating these all my life. I
           keep the wrappers in the boat,
           `cause they remind me who I was
           when I ate each one. The smell
           make me feel cohesive.
                         
                          HUSHPUPPY
           I wanna be cohesive. 
                         
                          SERGEANT MAJOR
           Oh you will be, I got no doubt in
           my mind.
                         
           They let this thought settle, then Hushpuppy turns her swivel
           chair back toward the water
                         65
                         
                         
           The beacon appears through the mist. Hushpuppy's eyes go
           wide.
                         
           As they approach, another boat comes into view. A half-
           sunken barge that looks as though its been rusting in the
           same position for a century. As we move in we see a lit up
           sign: "Elysian Fields Floating Catfish Shack GIRLS GIRLS
           GIRLS."

           Hushpuppy, Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard disembark onto the barge
           with Sergeant Major following behind. They circle around a
           hatch in the floor with light pulsing out of it. Far-away
           JAZZ echoes up from the bowels of the ship. They look to
           each other in wonder.

           Hushpuppy descends a ladder into a glimmering wonderland.
           Christmas lights swallow the ceiling, and a light smoke
           facade encompasses everything. We feel like we're looking at
           a portal into the past, a Belloq-esque turned New Orleans
           Jazz parlor. The regulars are all oil-workers wooing their
           ladies of the night.
                         
           There is a stage with a DJ and two singers, karaokeing along
           with "Until the Real Thing Comes Along" by Fats Waller.
                         
           The hyperactive MISS FRANKIE, the matriarch of this
           establishment, comes a'hoppin'.
                         
                          MISS FRANKIE

                          SERGEANT MAJOR
           Good afternoon, Miss Frankie.

           Well butter my butt and call me a
           biscuit! How you, Sergeant Major?
           You need some grits?
                         
                          SERGEANT MAJOR
           Yes ma'am.

           Holy Sugar, they are so precious!
           Y'all just as cute as a tub of
           puppies!
                         
           Women descend on the kids who recoil, not knowing what to do
           with all this affection. Joy Strong puts up her fists.
                         
           Hushpuppy pushes through the crowd nonplussed by the flurry
           of doting ladies. They are not who she is looking for. They
           are not who she is looking for.
                         
           She scans pictures of strippers through the ages pasted up
           all over the ceiling, each of them with a bra hung on it,
           none of them right.
                         
           Bar patrons nod and tip their glasses to her as she passes,
           ladies smile and return to their drinks, drunk flirtatious
           dancers giggle at her, but she remains unfazed.
                         
           She reaches two swinging doors that lead to the kitchen.
                         
           Hushpuppy stops. Sniffs. Heaven.
                         
           SLOW MOTION: in Hushpuppy's POV, smoke curls through the
           swinging doors, the light illuminating the dust particles.
           It's a magic kitchen. Her POV tilts down to the floor where
           a pair of well-pedicured feet in flip-flops walks towards the
           swinging doors. They open.
                         
           Hushpuppy holds her breath.
                         
           A gorgeous COOK (35) wearing a baseball cap and an apron
           comes out the double doors. She wipes some sweat off her
           brow. She watches the band and kills a bottle of ice-cold
           beer.
                         
           The Cook looks down. Sees Hushpuppy.
                         
                          COOK
           You need something baby?
                         
           Hushpuppy nods, holding her breath. She still can't speak.

           Well whatchu want? You alone?
                         
           Hushpuppy shrugs.
                         
           She's too stunned, too shy to speak.

           The Cook takes stock of the helpless creature in front of
           her. Like a butcher shop owner with a pesky hungry puppy,
           she submits to Hushpuppy's longing gaze.
                         
                          COOK (CONT'D)

           magic trick.
                         
           Hushpuppy follows her into the magic kitchen, knocking her
           head against the swinging doors on her way in.

           With the smooth fanfare of a circus performer, The Cook lifts
           an egg, opens a beer bottle with her teeth, SPITS the cap at
           the egg and it cracks over the grits.
                         
           Hushpuppy's face is joy beyond all measure. She watches the
           Cook's flying hands, she prepares everything in a single
           motion, it's like a dance. She slaps a fresh alligator tail
           on the table and begins sawing through the scales.
                         
                          COOK

           get that out your head right now.
                         
           She removes the knife from the gator and aims it at Hushpuppy
           like its a pointer.

           She scales a gator, strips the bones, dredges, fries.

           She stirs the grits. Grits on plate. Gator on plate. Plate
           in front of Hushpuppy. Lemon is squeezed all over

           Hushpuppy tries to crack a grin. She barely remembers how to
           smile and it comes out all wrong. The Cook shakes her head,
           opens another beer on her teeth, and heads for the pantry.

           Hushpuppy stays behind staring into the floating particles of
           dust in the incandescent light-- stars of the universe. The
           golden bubbling fry pot-- lava of the molten core.
