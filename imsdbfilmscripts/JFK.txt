               Credits run in counterpoint through a 7 to 10 minute sequence 
               of documentary images setting the tone of John F. Kennedy's 
               Presidency and the atmosphere of those tense times, 1960 
               through 1963.  An omniscient narrator's voice marches us 
               through in old time Pathe' newsreel fashion.

                         Eisenhower's Farewell Address to the 
                         Nation -

               EISENHOWER ADDRESS

                                     EISENHOWER
                         The conjunction of an immense military 
                         establishment and a large arms 
                         industry is new in the American 
                         experience.  The total influence - 
                         economic, political, even spiritual - 
                         is felt in every city, every 
                         statehouse, every office of the 
                         Federal Government... In the councils 
                         of government we must guard against 
                         the acquisition of unwarranted 
                         influence, whether sought or unsought, 
                         by the military industrial complex.
                         The potential for the disastrous 
                         rise of misplaced power exists and 
                         will persist... We must never let 
                         the weight of this combination 
                         endanger our liberties or democratic 
                         processes.  We should take nothing 
                         for granted...

               ELECTION IMAGERY

               School kids reciting the Pledge of Allegiance.  WPA films of 
               farmers harvesting the Texas plains.  Rain, thunderheads, a 
               dusty car coming from far away on a road moving towards 
               Dallas.  Cowboys round up the cattle.  Young marrieds in a 
               church.  Hillsides of tract homes going up.  The American 
               breadbasket, the West.  Over this we hear Eisenhower's 
               address.  As we move into the election campaign of 1960, we 
               see the TV debates, Nixon vs. Kennedy, Mayor Daley, Kennedy 
               victorious...

               Against this is juxtaposed other forces: segregation, J. 
               Edgar Hoover, military advisors, Castro, Marilyn Monroe, 
               Lumumba... three frames of the Zapruder film counter-cut... 
               ending with the Kennedy inauguration and the irony of Earl 
               Warren administering the oath as he will Kennedy's eulogy.

                         November, 1960 - Senator John F. 
                         Kennedy of Massachusetts wins one of 
                         the narrowest election victories in 
                         American history over the Vice- 
                         President Richard Nixon by a little 
                         more than 100,000 votes.  Rumors 
                         abound that he stole the election in 
                         Illinois through the Democratic 
                         political machine of Mayor Daley...
                              (inauguration shots)
                         At his inauguration, at a time when 
                         American males all wore hats, he let 
                         his hair blow free in the wind.  
                         Alongside his beautiful and elegant 
                         wife of French origin, Jacqueline 
                         Bouvier, J.F.K. is the symbol of the 
                         new freedom of the 1960's, signifying 
                         change and upheaval to the American 
                         public, scaring many and hated 
                         passionately by some.  To win the 
                         election and to appease their fears, 
                         Kennedy at first takes a tough Cold 
                         War stance.

               BAY OF PIGS IMAGERY

               The beach, the bombardment, the rounding up of prisoners, 
               Kennedy's public apology, Allen Dulles standing next to 
               J.F.K., both uncomfortable with the small talk...

                         He inherits a secret war against the 
                         Communist Castro dictatorship in 
                         Cuba, a war run by the CIA and angry 
                         Cuban exiles out of bases in the 
                         Southern United States, Panama, 
                         Nicaragua and Guatemala.  Castro is 
                         a successful revolutionary frightening 
                         to American business interests in 
                         Latin America - companies like Cabot's 
                         United Fruit, Continental Can, and 
                         Rockefeller's Standard Oil.  This 
                         war culminates in the disastrous Bay 
                         of Pigs invasion in April 1961, when 
                         Kennedy refuses to provide air cover 
                         for the exile brigade.  Of the 1600 
                         men who invade, 114 are killed, 1200 
                         are captured.  The Cuban exiles and 
                         the CIA are furious at Kennedy's 
                         irresolution... Kennedy, taking public 
                         responsibility for the failure, 
                         privately claims the CIA lied to him 
                         and tried to manipulate him into 
                         ordering an all-out American invasion 
                         of Cuba.  He vows to splinter the 
                         CIA into a thousand pieces and fires 
                         Director Allen Dulles, Deputies 
                         Charles Cabell and Richard Bissell, 
                         the top leadership of the Agency.

                         In October 1962, the world comes to 
                         the brink of nuclear war when Kennedy 
                         quarantines Cuba after announcing 
                         the presence of offensive Soviet 
                         nuclear missiles 90 miles off American 
                         shores.  The Joint Chiefs of Staff 
                         and the CIA call for an invasion.  
                         Kennedy refuses.  Soviet ships with 
                         more missiles sail towards the island, 
                         but at the last moment turn back.  
                         The world breathes with relief but 
                         backstage in Washington, rumors abound 
                         that J.F.K. has cut a secret deal 
                         with Russian Premier Khrushchev not 
                         to invade Cuba in return for a Russian 
                         withdrawal of missiles.  Suspicions 
                         abound that Kennedy is "soft on 
                         Communism."

                         In the ensuing months, Kennedy clamps 
                         down on Cuban exile activities, 
                         closing training camps, restricting 
                         covert operations, prohibiting 
                         shipment of weapons out of the 
                         country.  The covert arm of the CIA 
                         nevertheless continues its plan to 
                         assassinate Castor... In March '63, 
                         Kennedy announces drastic cuts in 
                         the defense budget.  In November 
                         1963, he orders the withdrawal by 
                         Christmas of the first 1000 troops 
                         of the 16,000 stationed in Vietnam.  
                         He tells several of his intimates 
                         that he will withdraw all Vietnam 
                         troops after the '64 election, saying 
                         to the Assistant Secretary of State, 
                         Roger Hilsman, "The Bay of Pigs has 
                         taught me one, not to trust generals 
                         or the CIA, and two, that if the 
                         American people do not want to use 
                         American troops to remove a Communist 
                         regime 90 miles from our coast, how 
                         can I ask them to use troops to remove 
                         a Communist regime 9,000 miles 
                         away?"... Finally, in August 1963, 
                         over the objections of the Joint 
                         Chiefs of Staff, the United States, 
                         Great Britain and the Soviet Union 
                         sign a treaty banning nuclear bomb 
                         tests in the atmosphere, underwater 
                         and in space...  Early that fateful 
                         summer, Kennedy speaks of his new 
                         vision at American University in 
                         Washington.

                         What kind of peace do we seek?  Not 
                         a pax Americana enforced on the world 
                         by American weapons of war... We 
                         must re-examine our own attitudes 
                         towards the Soviet Union... If we 
                         cannot now end our differences at 
                         least we can help make the world 
                         safe for diversity.  For, in the 
                         final analysis, our most basic link 
                         is that we all inhabit this small 
                         planet.  We all breathe the same 
                         air.  We all cherish our children's 
                         future.  And we are all mortal...

               stories up, schoolgirls surging out into the street in front 
               of the car.  The President is wildly popular - except for 
               the occasional posters calling for his arrest for treason...

                         More rumors emerge of J.F.K.'s 
                         backdoor efforts outside usual State 
                         Department and CIA channels to 
                         establish dialogue with Fidel Castro 
                         through contacts at the United Nations 
                         in New York.  Kennedy is seeking 
                         change on all fronts.  Bitter battles 
                         are fought with Southern 
                         segregationists to get James Meredith 
                         into the University of Mississippi.  
                         Three months after Kennedy submits a 
                         sweeping civil rights bill to 
                         Congress, Martin Luther King leads 
                         250,000 in a march on Washington.  
                         Robert Kennedy, as Attorney General, 
                         for the first time ever vigorously 
                         prosecutes the Mafia in American 
                         life, bringing and winning a record 
                         number of cases - 288 convictions of 
                         organized crime figures including 13 
                         grand juries against Jimmy Hoffa and 
                         his Teamsters Union.  The President 
                         also takes on Big Business, forcing 
                         back steel prices, winning 45 of 46 
                         antitrust cases during 1963 and he 
                         wants to help everyday taxpayers by 
                         ending age- old business privileges 
                         like the oil depletion allowance and 
                         the fees paid to the Federal Reserve 
                         Bank for printing America's currency.
                         Revolutionary changes are foreseen 
                         after J.F.K.'s assumed re-election 
                         in 1964.  Foremost in the political 
                         consciousness of the country is the 
                         possibility of a Kennedy dynasty.  
                         Robert Kennedy in '68, Teddy Kennedy 
                         in '76.  In November, 1963 John 
                         Kennedy travels to Texas, his 
                         popularity sagging to 59% largely 
                         due to his civil rights stand for 
                         which he is particularly hated in 
                         the South.  Texas is a crucial state
                         for him to carry in '64.  With him 
                         is Vice-President, Lyndon Johnson 
                         and Texas Governor John Connally.  
                         On November 21, they visit Houston 
                         and San Antonio.  On the morning of 
                         November 22, he speaks in Fort Worth, 
                         then flies 15 minutes to Love Field 
                         in Dallas, where he takes a motorcade 
                         through downtown Dallas on his way 
                         to speak at 12:30 at the International 
                         Trade Mart.  Later, the motorcade 
                         takes him through Dealey Plaza at 
                         12:30...

               DEALEY PLAZA - THAT DAY (NOV. 22, 1963)

               We see a massive overhead shot of the Plaza as it lay then.  
               Credits conclude under shot - and we have the subtitle 
               "November 22, 1963."

               A young epileptic screams and suddenly collapses near the 
               fountains in front of the Texas School Depository.  He has a 
               violent epileptic fit that attracts surrounding attention.  
               Dallas policemen run over to him.  We hear the siren of an 
               ambulance roaring up.

               TIMECUT TO ambulance loading the epileptic man and taking 
               off.

                                     AMBULANCE VOICE
                         We are en route to Parkland.

               BACK TO a montage of the shooting.  We see Kennedy, in the 
               last seconds, waving, turning the corner at Houston from 
               Main... We see TV footage and a piece of Zapruder film from 
               before the shooting; fragmented images...

               CUT TO stages shots of crowd people looking on.  The images 
               are grainy to match the tone of the Zapruder film.  People 
               are on rooftops, hollering.  The crowd is wild with 
               enthusiasm.  We pan past Jack Ruby and slam into him in black-
               and-white.  The camera shows a Cuban man with a radio; a man 
               with an umbrella; subliminals.  Through open windows on the 
               fifth floor of the Criminal Courts Building, convicts watch 
               and holler from their jail cells.  We see the sixth floor of 
               the Texas Book Depository with open windows and a vague blur 
               of a figure and a rifle.

               The clock on the Hertz sign reads 12:30.

                                     VOICE
                         We'll be there in about five minutes.

               A motorcycle officer paralleling the Kennedy car tries to 
               use his radio.

               It's jammed.  The sound of the jammed Dictabelt drives the 
               rest of the sequence.

               We see Zapruder, a short middle - aged man, shooting his 8mm 
               film from the Grassy Knoll, and then we see Jackie Kennedy - 
               floating on film, her voice, high, soft:

                                     JACKIE KENNEDY
                              (voice restaged)
                         And in the motorcade, you know I 
                         usually would be waving mostly to 
                         the left side and he was waving mostly 
                         to the right, which is one reason 
                         you're not looking at each other 
                         very much.  And it was terribly hot.  
                         Just blinding all of us... We could 
                         see a tunnel in front of us.  
                         Everything was really slow then.  
                         And I remember thinking it would be 
                         so cool under that tunnel.

               The camera rests on Jackie for a beat, and then we see the 
               shot of the little schoolgirl skipping on the grass.

               CUT TO the approaching overpass.  J.F.K. waves... Mrs. 
               Connally turns to J.F.K.  The shot is crazy, fractured, 
               surreal.

                                     MRS. CONNALLY (V.O.)
                         Mr. President, you can't say that 
                         Dallas doesn't love you.

                                     JFK (V.O.)
                         No, you certainly can't.

               Then we hear the shots: the volley sounds like a motorcycle 
               backfire.  We catch a glimpse of a muzzle flash and smoke.  
               We see a view from the street of the Texas School Book 
               Depository - all in line with the "official" version of 
               events.  Pigeons by the hundreds suddenly shoot off the roof.  
               Then the screen goes gray as did CBS TV's first bulletins to 
               the country.

                                     CBS BULLETIN
                              (full screen)
                         We interrupt this program to bring 
                         you this flash bulletin.  A burst of 
                         gunfire!  Three bursts of gunfire, 
                         apparently from automatic weapons, 
                         were fired at President Kennedy's 
                         motorcade in downtown Dallas.

               We hear voices under this from everywhere, colliding in 
               confusion and horror:

                         OH NO!  MY GOD THEY'RE GOING TO KILL 
                         US ALL!  Be still.  You're going to 
                         be all right.  LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.  
                         WE'RE HIT!  LAWSON, THIS IS KELLERMAN.  
                         WE ARE HIT.  GET US TO THE HOSPITAL 
                         IMMEDIATELY.  PULL OUT OF THE 
                         MOTORCADE.  TAKE US TO THE NEAREST 
                         HOSPITAL.

                                     JACKIE KENNEDY VOICE
                         Oh, no, they've shot Jack... I love 
                         you, Jack... Jack... they've killed 
                         my husband...

                                     CBS BULLETIN (V.O.)
                         The first reports say that President 
                         Kennedy has been seriously wounded 
                         by the shooting.  More details just 
                         arrived.  United Press say the wounds 
                         to President Kennedy perhaps could 
                         be fatal.  Repeating: President 
                         Kennedy has been shot by a would-be 
                         assassin in Dallas.  Three bursts of 
                         gunfire, apparently from automatic 
                         weapons...

                              (blending under)
                         IT CAME FROM THERE.  SECURE THAT 
                         AREA BEHIND THE FENCE.  IT'S THAT 
                         BUILDING UP THERE.

               We hear sirens and screeching tires.  The screen is still 
               gray, randomly intercut with the end of the Nix film showing 
               the car escaping.  There are wildly tracking shots of the 
               crowd running towards the Grassy Knoll.

               The camera pans up the little set of stairs.  We see more 
               faces.

               Someone in a suit stops our camera.  Secret Service?

               We see the briefest glimpse from the Zapruder film.  The 
               camera moves in on the open umbrella next, then to the freeway 
               sign, then to Mrs. Kennedy out of the car reaching for help, 
               then to the agent rushing onto the rear fender.  The car 
               finally speeds away.  The people on the other side of the 
               underpass wave at the oncoming hearse from hell.  (These are 
               fragmented, mystifying shots.  The main effect is one of 
               blackout - of not knowing; of being in the dark, as we all 
               were back then.)

               CUT TO JIM GARRISON'S OFFICE - NEW ORLEANS - SAME DAY (1963)

               Pause.  The lovely old china clock on the wall reads 12:35.  
               Somewhere a car backfires.  We see a close-up of the clock 
               moving to 12:36.  We hear the sound of a pen on paper, 
               scratching... We see a shot of Jim Garrison as a young air 
               pilot in World War II; hear the sound of airplanes.  The 
               camera moves to framed photos of Jim as a young, Lincolnesque 
               lawyer... we hear sounds of political rallies, cheering... a 
               shot of Jim's grandfather shaking hands with President William 
               Taft.  The sound of bulldozers carries us to a shot of Jim 
               staring at piles of decaying corpses at Dachau... a photo of 
               Clarence Darrow... a law degree and an appointment as District 
               Attorney of the New Orleans Parish... Mother Garrison with 
               young Jim on the desk... another family - his own.  We look 
               across the thick desk with the chess set, A Complete

               Works of William Shakespeare and a Nazi helmet with a bullet 
               hole in it... to Jim himself writing - pen to paper.  We 
               sense the quiet intellect of the 43 year old man.  The clock 
               ticks in the awful suspended silence.

               It's as if the air itself has been sucked from the silent 
               room.  This is the last moment of peace before the World 
               will rush through the door in all its sound and fury - to 
               change his life forever.  The camera haywires into a close-
               up of Jim as he looks up... and knows.

               Lou Ivon, Jim's chief investigator, is already standing there 
               in the room.  He is burly, in his 30s - his expression 
               universal for that day.

                                     JIM
                         What's wrong, Lou?

                                     LOU
                         Boss, the President's been shot.  In 
                         Dallas.  Five minutes ago.

               Jim is stunned.  His look of horror and shock speaks the 
               same language as on faces all across America that Black 
               Friday.

                                     JIM
                         Oh no!... How bad?

                                     LOU
                         No word yet.  But they think it's in 
                         the head.

               Jim gets up, heading rapidly for the door.

                                     JIM
                         Come on.  Napoleon's has a TV set.

               NAPOLEON'S RESTAURANT - THE QUARTER - DAY(1963)

               The midday customers all stare solemnly at the TV set high 
               in the corner of the cafe.  The manager, ashen, serves drinks 
               to Jim and Lou.

                                     NEWSMAN 1
                         Apparently three bullets were found.  
                         Governor Connally also appeared to 
                         be hit.  The President was rushed by 
                         the Secret Service to Parkland 
                         Memorial Hospital four miles from 
                         Dealey Plaza.

               We are told a bullet entered the base of the throat and came 
               out of the backside, but there is no confirmation, blood 
               transfusions are being given, a priest has administered the 
               last rites.

                                     JIM
                         There's still a chance, dammit!  
                         Come on, Jack - pull through.

                                     MANAGER

                         I don't believe it.  I don't believe 
                         it.  Here, in this country.

               They all look up, expectant, as Walter Cronkite interrupts 
               on the TV:

                                     WALTER CRONKITE
                         From Dallas, Texas - the flash 
                         apparently official, President Kennedy 
                         died at 1 p.m.  Central Standard 
                         Time, 2 o'clock Eastern Standard 
                         Time, some 38 minutes ago.
                              (choked pause)
                         Vice-President Johnson has left the 
                         hospital in Dallas, but we do not 
                         know to where he has proceeded.  
                         Presumably, he will be taking the 
                         oath of office shortly, and become 
                         the 36th President of the United 
                         States.

               There are sounds of shock, muttering, some sobbing in the 
               restaurant.  Lou gulps down his drink.  Jim sits stunned.

                                     JIM
                         I didn't always agree with him - too 
                         liberal for my tastes - but I 
                         respected him.  He had style... God, 
                         I'm ashamed to be an American today.

               He holds back the tears.  The food comes.  Lou waves it off.  
               They just sit there.

               EXTERIOR KATZENJAMMER'S BAR - SAME DAY(1963)

               Katzenjammer's is an Irish working class bar across Canal 
               St. In a seedy area near the Mississippi River, just off 
               Lafayette Square.

               INTERIOR KATZENJAMMER'S BAR - SAME DAY(1963)

               A variety of loud Irish working men sit on stools watching 
               the TV.  There are a few formica tables with chairs against 
               the walls, and an unused pool table.

                                     NEWSMAN 2
                         Many arrests have been made here 
                         today.  Anyone looking even remotely 
                         suspicious is being detained.  Most 
                         of the crowd has gone home but there 
                         are still many stunned people 
                         wandering around in Dealey Plaza 
                         unable to comprehend what happened 
                         here earlier today.

               On the TV, we see the scene at Dealey Plaza.  The reporter 
               has several men, women, and children gathered around him.  
               He puts his microphone in their faces.

                                     BLACK WOMAN
                              (crying)
                         It's all so terrible.  I jes' can't 
                         stop crying.  He did so much for 
                         this country, for colored people.  
                         Why?

                                     MAN
                              (Bill Newman, with 
                              wife and kids)
                         I grabbed my kids and wife and hit 
                         the ground.  The bullets were coming 
                         over our heads - from that fence 
                         back on the knoll - I was just so 
                         shaken.  I saw his face when it hit... 
                         he just, his ear flew off, he turned 
                         just real white and then went stiff 
                         like a board and flopped over on his 
                         stomach, with his foot sticking out.

               CUT TO the picket fence above the Grassy Knoll.

                         I thought... it came from up there, 
                         that building.

                         I heard shots from over there.

               CUT TO the County Records Building.

                         How many shots?

                                     WOMAN 3
                         About 3 to 4... I don't know.

                                     MAN 3
                         I never thought it could happen in 
                         America.

               Back in the bar, the camera moves to two patrons seated at a 
               table by themselves, far enough away not to be heard.  Guy 
               Banister is a sturdy, imposing ex - FBI agent in his 60's, 
               steel gray hair, blue eyes, ruddy from heavy drinking.  He 
               wears a small rosebud in his lapel.  Jack Martin is a thin, 
               mousy man in his mid - 50's, wearing a Dick Tracy hat.

               They're both drinking Wild Turkey heavily.  The TV blares 
               loudly across the room over their voices.

                                     BANISTER
                         All this blubbering over that 
                         sonofabitch!  They're grieving like 
                         they knew the man.  It makes me want 
                         to puke.

                                     MARTIN
                         God's sake, chief.  The President 
                         was shot.

                                     BANISTER
                         A bullshit President!  I don't see 
                         any weeping for all the thousands of 
                         Cubans that bastard condemned to 
                         death and torture at the Bay of Pigs.  
                         Where are all the tears for the 
                         Russians and Hungarians and Chinese 
                         living like slaves in prison camps 
                         run by Kennedy's communist buddies - 
                         All these damned peace treaties!  
                         I'm telling ya Jack, that's what 
                         happens when you let the niggers 
                         vote.  They get together with the 
                         Jews and the Catholics and elect an 
                         Irish bleeding heart.

                                     MARTIN
                         Chief, maybe you had a little too 
                         much to drink.

                                     BANISTER
                         Bullshit!
                              (yells across the 
                              room)
                         Bartender, another round...
                              (finishes drink)
                         Here's to the New Frontier.  Camelot 
                         in smithereens.  I'll drink to that.

               NAPOLEON'S RESTAURANT - DAY(1963)

               Several hours have elapsed.  The clientele has grown, 
               drinking, watching the tube with the insatiable curiosity 
               the event engendered.  People stare in from the street... 
               There is a silence in the restaurant.

               TELEVISION INSERT:  image of a Dallas policeman hauling a 
               Mannlicher - Carcano rifle with a sniperscope over the heads 
               of the press gathered in the police station.

                         This is the rifle, it is a Mannlicher - 
                         Carcano Italian rifle, a powerful 
                         World War II military gun used by 
                         infantry and highly accurate at 
                         distances of 100 yards.

               We see images of the textbook boxes - the sniper's nest in 
               the sixth story of the Book Depository - and then the view 
               out the window looking down at Elm Street.

                         The assassin apparently fired from 
                         this perch... but so far no word, 
                         much confusion and...

                         A flash bulletin... the Dallas Police 
                         have just announced they have a 
                         suspect in the killing of a Dallas 
                         police officer, J.D. Tippit, who was 
                         shot at 1:15 in Oak Cliff, a suburb 
                         of Dallas.

               Police are saying there could be a tie - in here to the murder 
               of the President.

               TELEVISION INSERT:  Lee Harvey Oswald, a bruise over his 
               right temple, is apprehended at the Texas Theatre.

                                     NEWSMAN 4
                         The suspect, identified as Lee Harvey 
                         Oswald, was arrested by more than a 
                         dozen police officers after a short 
                         scuffle at the Texas movie theatre 
                         in Oak Cliff, several blocks from 
                         where Officer Tippit was killed, 
                         apparently with a .38 revolver found 
                         on Oswald.  There is apparently at 
                         least one eyewitness.

               TELEVISION INSERT:  Oswald is booked at the station.  A surly 
               young man, 24, he claims to the press:

                                     TV OSWALD
                         No, I don't know what I'm charged 
                         with... I don't know what dispatches 
                         you people have been given, but I 
                         emphatically deny these charges.

                                     VOICE FROM THE BAR
                         They oughta just shoot the bastard.

               The room bursts out with an accumulated fury at the young 
               Oswald - a tremendous release of tension.  On the TV we see 
               the excitement in the newsmen's eyes; they all sense that 
               this is the break they're looking for in the case.

               Garrison and Ivon watch the TV, and then Garrison stands and 
               pays the bill.

                                     LOU
                         One little guy with a cheap rifle - 
                         look what he can do.

                                     JIM
                         Let's get outta here, Lou.  I saw 
                         too much stuff like this in the war.

               As they leave, the camera holds on the image of Oswald.

               MISSISSIPPI RIVER WATERFRONT - TWILIGHT(1963)

               The sun is setting through thunderheads over the Mississippi 
               River waterfront as Banister and Martin wobble out, drunk, 
               down the street.

                                     BANISTER
                         Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?
                              (Martin says nothing, 
                              looks troubled)
                         I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just 
                         did this crazy thing before anyone 
                         could stop him, right?

                                     MARTIN
                         I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I 
                         gotta get home.

                                     BANISTER
                              (strong-arms Martin)
                         Get home my ass.  We're going to the 
                         office, have another drink.  I want 
                         some company tonight.

               BANISTER'S OFFICE - NIGHT(1963)

               Rain pours down outside 531 Lafayette Street as Banister 
               opens several locks on the door and turns on the lights.  
               The frosted glass on the door says "W. Guy Banister 
               Associates, Inc., Investigators."  It's a typical detective's 
               office with spare desks, simple chairs, large filing cabinets 
               and cubicles in the rear.

                                     BANISTER
                              (repetitive)
                         Who'd ever thought that goofy Oswald 
                         kid would pull off a stunt like an 
                         assassination?
                              (Martin waits)
                         Just goes to show, you can never 
                         know about some people.  Am I right, 
                         Jack?
                              (Martin, frightened 
                              now, doesn't reply)
                         Well, bless my soul.  Your eyes are 
                         as red as two cherries, Jack.  Don't 
                         tell me we have another bleeding 
                         heart here.  Hell, all these years I 
                         thought you were on my side.

                                     MARTIN
                         Chief, sometimes I don't know whether 
                         you're kidding or not.

                                     BANISTER
                         I couldn't be more serious, Jack.  
                         Those big red eyes have me wondering 
                         about your loyalty.

               Banister, going to a file cabinet to get a bottle out, notices 
               one of the file drawers is slightly ajar.  He flies into a 
               rage.

                                     BANISTER
                         Who the hell opened my files!  You've 
                         been looking through my private files, 
                         haven't you, you weasel?

                         You may not like this, chief, but 
                         you're beginning to act paranoid.  I 
                         mean, you really are.

                                     BANISTER
                         You found out about Dave Ferrie going 
                         to Texas today and you went through 
                         all my files to see what was going 
                         on.  You're a goddamn spy.

                                     MARTIN
                              (angry)
                         Goddammit chief, why would I ever 
                         need to look in your files?  I saw 
                         enough here this summer to write a 
                         book.

                                     BANISTER
                         I always lock my files.  And you 
                         were the only one here today...
                              (stops as he hears 
                              Martin)
                         What do you mean, you son of a bitch?

                                     MARTIN
                         You know what I mean.  I saw a lot 
                         of strange things going on in this 
                         office this summer.  And a lotta 
                         strange people.

               Enraged, Banister pulls a .357 Magnum from his holster, 
               cursing as he suddenly slams it into Martin's temple.  The 
               smaller man crumples painfully to the ground.

                                     BANISTER
                         You didn't see a goddamn thing, you 
                         little weasel.  Do you get it?  You 
                         didn't see a goddamn thing.

               JIM GARRISON'S HOME - THAT NIGHT(1963)

               Jim and his wife, Liz, watch the television.  She is in her 
               early 30's, an attractive, quiet southern woman from 
               Louisiana.  They live in a spacious two-story wood house, 
               suburban in feel.

               of the Dallas Police Headquarters as Oswald is brought through 
               the corridor, officers on either side of him.

                              (over the din)
                         Did you shoot the President?

                                     TV OSWALD
                         I didn't shoot anybody, no sir.  I'm 
                         just a patsy.

               The camera moves onto Jim with Liz and the children - Jasper, 
               the oldest at 4, holds his dad's hand.  On Liz's lap, Snapper, 
               the youngest, is asleep.  Virginia, the 2-year-old, is 
               pestering the Boxer dog... and Mattie, the heavyset black 
               housekeeper, 35, is in tears.

                                     LIZ
                         My god, he sure looks like a creep.  
                         What's he talkin' 'bout... a patsy?

                         Well, I was questioned by a judge.  
                         However, I protested at the time 
                         that I was not allowed legal 
                         representation during that very short 
                         and sweet hearing.  Uh, I really 
                         don't know what the situation is 
                         about.  Nobody has told me anything 
                         except that I am accused of, uh, 
                         murdering a policeman.  I know nothing 
                         more than that and I do request that 
                         someone come forward to give me, uh, 
                         legal assistance.

                         No.  I have not been charged with 
                         that.  In fact nobody has said that 
                         to me yet.  The first thing I heard 
                         about it was when the newspaper 
                         reporters in the hall, uh, asked me 
                         that question.

                         You have been charged.

               Oswald seems shocked.

                                     NEWSMAN 5
                         Were you ever in the Free Cuba 
                         Movement or whatever the...

                         It was the Fair Play for Cuba 
                         Committee.

               Oswald looks over and spots Ruby in the back of the room, on 
               a table.  Recognition is in his eyes.  The police start to 
               move him out.

                         under pressure like that.

                                     LIZ

               Jim moves to the phone as Liz starts the kids up the stairs.  
               The TV cuts to stills of Oswald's life.  Two newsmen sit in 
               a studio, smoking, sharing information.

                         So several hours after the 
                         assassination, a disturbed portrait 
                         is emerging of Lee Harvey Oswald.  
                         Described as shy and introverted, he 
                         spent much of his childhood in New 
                         Orleans, Louisiana and went to high 
                         school there.  After a stint in the 
                         Marines, he apparently became 
                         fascinated by Communism and in 1959 
                         defected to the Soviet Union.

                              (Newsman 8)
                         He married a Russian woman there, 
                         Frank, had a child, and then returned 
                         to the United States after 30 months.  
                         But he is still believed to be a 
                         dedicated Marxist and a fanatical 
                         supporter of Fidel Castro and ultra 
                         left wing causes.  He spent last 
                         summer in New Orleans and was arrested 
                         in a brawl with anti-Castro Cuban 
                         exiles.

                         And apparently, Bob, Oswald had been 
                         passing out pro-Castro pamphlets for 
                         an organization called Fair Play for 
                         Cuba, a Communist front he reportedly 
                         belongs to.

                         born wife, who has identified the 
                         rifle found in the Book Depository

                         we better get on this New Orleans

               GARRISON CONFERENCE ROOM - 2 DAYS LATER - DAY(1963)

               Jim is with his key players: Lou Ivon, chief investigator; 
               Susie Cox, in her 30's, and efficient, attractive Assistant 
               D.A.; La Oser, Assistant D.A. in his 40's, serious, 
               spectacled; Bill Broussard, Assistant D.A., handsome, 
               volatile, in his 30's; Numa Bertell, D.A. in his 30's, chubby 
               and friendly, and several others.  They sit around a 
               conference table with a black-and-white portable TV on a 
               side table showing the current Sunday, November 24 news from 
               Dallas.

               Camera moves to Lou Ivon, looking at paperwork.

                         As far as Oswald's associates, boss, 
                         the one name that keeps popping up 
                         is David Ferrie.

               Oswald was seen with him several times last summer.

                                     JIM

                         He's been in trouble before.  Used 
                         to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern 
                         Airlines, but he got canned after an 
                         alleged homosexual incident with a 
                         14-year old boy.

                         Texas trip... yesterday mentioned to 
                         somebody about Ferrie... find it 
                         out.

               On the TV we see the first image of the "backyard photos" of 
               Lee Harvey Oswald holding the rifle.

                                     NEWSMAN 1
                         These backyard photos were found 
                         yesterday among Oswald's possessions 
                         in the garage of Janet William's 
                         home in Riving, Texas, where Marina 
                         Oswald and her children are living.  
                         The picture apparently was taken 
                         earlier this year.  Police say the 
                         rifle, a cheap World War II Italian-
                         made Mannlicher-Carcano, was ordered 
                         from a Chicago mailing house and 
                         shipped to Oswald's alias A. Hidell 
                         at a post office box in March, 1963.  
                         This is the same rifle that was used 
                         to assassinate the President.

               The camera moves back to the staff, who watch, obviously 
               influenced.

                         That ties it up...

                                     NUMA
                         Another nut.  Jesus, anybody can get 
                         a rifle in Texas.

                              (hangs up)
                         So it seems that Dave Ferrie drove 
                         off on a Friday afternoon for Texas - 
                         a source told Kohlman he might have 
                         been a getaway pilot for Oswald.

               Members of the team exchange looks of surprise and disbelief.

                                     JIM
                         Hold your horses.  What kinda source?

                                     BILL
                              (grins)
                         The anonymous kind, Chief.

                         I think I remember this guy Ferrie 
                         speaking at a meeting of some 
                         veteran's group.  Ranting against 
                         Castro.  Extreme stuff.

                         We go back now to the basement of 
                         police headquarters where they're 
                         about to transfer Oswald to County 
                         Prison...

               TELEVISION IMAGE: The basement of the Dallas police 
               headquarters - waiting.  Men mill around as Oswald is led 
               out of the basement by two deputies.  Jack Ruby rushes forward 
               out of the crowd - and into history - putting his sealing 
               bullet into Oswald.  Total chaos erupts...

               The camera is on the staff, looking.  We hear gasps.

                                     ANNOUNCER
                         He's been shot!  Oswald's been shot!

                         Goddamn!  Look at that... Look at 
                         that... I don't believe this... Right 
                         on TV!  What is going on?  Who is 
                         this guy... oh Jesus.

               Jim is silent.

                                     LOU
                         Seventy cops in that basement.  What 
                         the hell were they doing?

                                     NEWSMAN 1
                         Jack Ruby... Who is Jack Ruby?  Oswald 
                         is hurt.

               We see images of Oswald being lifted onto the stretcher, 
               into the ambulance, and the newscaster crouching, whispering.  
               Everybody in the room is stunned still.

                                     LOU
                         Well, no trial now.  Looks like 
                         somebody saved the Dallas D.A. a 
                         pile of work.

               They look to Jim.  There's a pause.  He is deeply disturbed.

                                     JIM
                              (quietly)
                         Well, let's get Ferrie in here anyway.

               GARRISON OFFICE - NEXT DAY - DAY(1963)

               The portable television plays to Jim alone, sitting in his 
               chair smoking a pipe.  We see searing images of the funeral - 
               crowds of mourners, the casket being driven through the 
               streets, the honor guards, the horses, the dignitaries walking 
               behind, Jackie veiled... the faces of De Gaulle, MacMillan, 
               Robert Kennedy.  We intercut briefly to Lyndon Johnson sitting 
               down earlier that day with the Joint Chiefs of Staff... and 
               then a future cut to Johnson in the Oval Office (staged).  
               The shots are very tight, uncomfortable - noses, eyes, hands - 
               very tight.

               As the door opens following a knock, David Ferrie is brought 
               into Jim's office by two police officers and Lou Ivon.  Jim 
               stands up, cordial.

                                     LOU
                         Chief... David Ferrie.

               Ferrie suffers from alopecia, a disease that has removed all 
               his body hair, and he looks like a Halloween character - 
               penciled eyebrows, one higher than the other, a scruffy 
               reddish wig pasted on askew with glue, thrift store clothing.  
               His eyes, however, are swift and cunning, his smile warm, 
               inviting itself, his demeanor hungry to please.

                                     JIM
                              (shakes hands)
                         Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make 
                         yourself comfortable.  Coffee?

                                     FERRIE
                         Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I 
                         met you on Carondolet Street right 
                         after your election.  I congratulated 
                         you, remember?

                                     JIM
                         How could I forget?  You make quite 
                         a first impression.
                              (on intercom)
                         Sharon, could you please bring us 
                         some coffee?
                              (Ferrie laughs; pause)
                         I've heard over the years you're 
                         quite a first-rate pilot, Dave.  
                         Legend has it you can get in and out 
                         of any field, no matter how small...
                              (Jim points to the 
                              pictures on his wall)
                         I'm a bit of a pilot myself, you 
                         know.  Flew grasshoppers for the 
                         field artillery in the war.

               Ferrie glimpses the low-volumed TV - and images of the 
               funeral.  He looks away, jittery, and takes out a cigarette.  
               Sharon brings the coffee in.

                                     FERRIE
                         Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?

                                     JIM
                              (holds up his pipe)
                         How could I?  Dave, as you know, 
                         President Kennedy was assassinated 
                         on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey 
                         Oswald was arrested as a suspect and 
                         then was murdered yesterday by a man 
                         named Jack Ruby.
                              (on each name, watching 
                              Ferrie's reaction)
                         We've heard reports that Oswald spent 
                         the summer in New Orleans and we've 
                         been advised you knew Oswald pretty 
                         well.

                                     FERRIE
                         That's not true.  I never met anybody 
                         named Oswald.  Anybody who told you 
                         that has to be crazy.

                                     JIM
                         But you are aware, he served in your 
                         Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a 
                         teenager.

                                     FERRIE
                         No... if he did, I don't remember 
                         him.  There were lots of kids in and 
                         out... y'know.

                                     JIM
                              (hands him a current 
                              newspaper)
                         I'm sure you've seen this.  Perhaps 
                         you knew this man under another name?

                                     FERRIE
                         No, I never saw him before in my 
                         life.

                                     JIM
                         Well that must've been mistaken 
                         information we got.  Thanks for 
                         straightening it out for us.
                              (puffs on pipe, Ferrie 
                              looks relieved; images 
                              of the funeral 
                              continue on the TV)
                         There is one other matter that's 
                         come up, Dave.  We were told you 
                         took a trip to Texas shortly after 
                         the assassination of Friday.

                                     FERRIE
                         Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to 
                         Houston.

                                     JIM
                         What was so appealing about Houston?

                                     FERRIE
                         I hadn't been there ice skating in 
                         many years, and I had a couple of 
                         young friends with me, and we decided 
                         we wanted to go ice skating.

                                     JIM
                         Dave, may I ask why the urge to go 
                         ice skating in Texas happened to 
                         strike you during one of the most 
                         violent thunderstorms in recent 
                         memory?

                                     FERRIE
                         Oh, it was just a spur of the moment 
                         thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.

                                     JIM
                         I see.  And where did you drive?

                                     FERRIE
                         We went straight to Houston, and 
                         then Saturday night we drove to 
                         Galveston and stayed over there.

                                     JIM
                         Why Galveston?

                                     FERRIE
                         No particular reason.  Just to go 
                         somewhere.

                                     JIM
                         And then Sunday?

                                     FERRIE
                         In the morning we went goose hunting.  
                         Then headed home, but I dropped the 
                         boys off to see some relatives and I 
                         stayed in Hammond.

                                     JIM
                         Did you bag any geese on this trip?

                                     FERRIE
                         I believe the boys got a couple.

                                     JIM
                         But the boys told us they didn't get 
                         any.

                                     FERRIE
                              (fidgeting, lighting 
                              another cigarette)
                         Oh yes, well, come to think of it, 
                         they're right.  We got to where the 
                         geese were and there were thousands 
                         of them.  But you couldn't approach 
                         them.  They were a wise bunch of 
                         birds.

                                     JIM
                         Your young friends also told us you 
                         had no weapons in the car.  Dave, 
                         isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for 
                         geese without a shotgun?

                                     FERRIE
                         Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison.  
                         I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got 
                         out there near the geese and it was 
                         only then we realized we'd forgotten 
                         our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of 
                         course we didn't get any geese.

                                     JIM
                         I see.
                              (stands up)
                         Dave thank you for your time.  I'm 
                         sorry it has to end inconveniently 
                         for you, but I'm going to have you 
                         detained for further questioning by 
                         the FBI.

                                     FERRIE
                              (shaken)
                         Why?  What's wrong?

                                     JIM
                         Dave, I find your story simply not 
                         believable.

               Lou and the two cops escort Ferrie out of the office as Jim 
               turns to the television image of Kennedy's final moments of 
               rest.  The bugler plays taps.  John Jr., 3 years old, in an 
               image which will become famous, salutes his Dad farewell.  
               The riderless horse stands lonely against the Washington

               At a small press conference, the FBI spokesman reads a 
               statement.

                                     FBI SPOKESMAN
                         Gentlemen, this afternoon the FBI 
                         released David W. Ferrie of New 
                         Orleans.  After extensive questioning 
                         and a thorough background check, the 
                         Bureau found no evidence that...

               television.  Lou, Broussard, Numa and Jim watch.

                              (on TV)
                         ...Mr. Ferrie knew Lee Harvey Oswald 
                         or that he has had any connection 
                         with the assassination of President 
                         Kennedy.  The Special Agent in Charge 
                         would like to make clear that Mr. 
                         Ferrie was brought in for questioning 
                         by the District Attorney of Orleans 
                         parish, not by the Federal Bureau of 
                         Investigation.  The Bureau regrets 
                         any trouble this may have caused Mr. 
                         Ferrie...

                         In national news, President Johnson 
                         has announced the creation of a blue 
                         ribbon presidential commission to 
                         probe the events in Dallas.

               Lou looks at Jim, angry.

                                     LOU
                         Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought 
                         we were on the same side.  What the 
                         hell business is it of theirs to say 
                         that?

                                     BILL
                         Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way 
                         they let him go.

                                     JIM
                         They must know something we don't.
                              (dismisses it)
                         So, let's get on with our lives, 
                         gentlemen... we got plenty of home 
                         grown crimes to prosecute.

               He reaches to turn off the TV and get back to work.  The 
               last image on the TV is:

                         The Commission will be headed by 
                         Chief Justice of the United States 
                         Supreme Court, Earl Warren, and is 
                         expected to head off several 
                         Congressional and Texas inquiries 
                         into the assassination.  On the panel 
                         are Allen Dulles, ex-chief of the 
                         CIA, Representative Gerald Ford, 
                         John J. McCloy, former head of Chase

               AERIAL SHOT - WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY(1966)

               We look down at the White House from the plane's point of 
               view.  A subtitle reads: "THREE YEARS LATER."

               INTERIOR OF PLANE

                                     SENATOR RUSSELL LONG
                              (looking out the window)
                         That's a mess down there, Jim.  We've 
                         bitten off more "Vietnam" that we 
                         can possibly chew.

               Jim, now 46, reads the front page of THE WASHINGTON POST 
               which details the latest battle in Vietnam.  He sits next to 
               Senator Long from Louisiana, in his 50's, who's drinking a 
               whiskey.  They're on a crowded businessman's shuttle.  We 
               see a close-up of a newspaper article about the Vietnam war: 
               "more troops asked by Westmoreland."

                                     LONG
                              (continuing)
                         Sad thing is the way it's screwing 
                         up this country, all these hippies 
                         running around on drugs, the way 
                         young people look you can't tell a 
                         boy from a girl anymore.  I saw a 
                         girl the other day, she was pregnant - 
                         you could see her whole belly, and 
                         you know what she painted on it?  
                         "Love Child."  It's fuckin' outa 
                         control.  Values've gone to hell, 
                         Jim... Course it figures when you 
                         got somebody like that polecat Johnson 
                         in the White House.

                                     JIM
                         I sometimes feel things've gone 
                         downhill since John Kennedy was 
                         killed, Senator.

                                     LONG
                         Don't get me started on that.  Those 
                         Warren Commission fellows were pickin' 
                         gnat shit out of pepper.  No one's 
                         gonna tell me that kid did the 
                         shooting job he did from that damned 
                         bookstore.

                                     STEWARDESS
                         Here you go, Senator Long.

               The stewardess brings more drinks.

                                     JIM
                              (surprised)
                         I thought the FBI test-fired the 
                         rifle to make sure it could be done?

                                     LONG
                         Sure, three experts and not one of 
                         them could do it!  They're telling 
                         us Oswald got off three shots with 
                         world-class precision from a manual 
                         bolt action rifle in less than six 
                         seconds - and accordin' to his Marine 
                         buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he 
                         wasn't any good.  Average man would 
                         be lucky to get two shots off, and I 
                         tell ya the first shot would always 
                         be the best.  Here, the third shot's 
                         perfect.  Don't make sense.  And 
                         then they got that crazy bullet 
                         zigzagging all over the place so it 
                         hits Kennedy and Connally seven times.  
                         One "pristine" bullet?  That dog 
                         don't hunt.

                                     JIM
                         You know, something always bothered 
                         me about that from day one, and I 
                         can't put my finger on it.

                                     LONG
                         If I were investigatin', I'd round 
                         up the 100 best riflemen in the world 
                         and find out which ones were in Dallas 
                         that day.  You been duck hunting?  I 
                         think Oswald was a good old-fashioned 
                         decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a 
                         patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes 
                         y'ask me.

                                     JIM
                         You think there were other men 
                         involved, Russell?

               Russell looks at Jim quizzically and laughs.

                                     LONG
                         Hell, you're the District Attorney.  
                         You read the Warren Report - and 
                         then you tell me you're satisfied 
                         Lee Oswald shot the President all by 
                         his lonesome.

                                     JIM
                         Russell, honestly you sound like one 
                         of those kooky critics spreading 
                         paranoia like prairie fire.  I just 
                         can't believe the Chief Justice of 
                         the United States would put his name 
                         on something that wasn't true.

                                     LONG
                              (to the stewardess)
                         Honey, another one of these.  This 
                         one's as weak as cricket pee-pee.  
                         Yessir, you mark my words, Jim, 
                         Vietnam's gonna cost Johnson '68 and 
                         it's gonna put that other varmint 
                         Nixon in - then watch your hide, 
                         'cause there ain't no offramps on a 
                         freeway to Hell!

               GARRISON'S STUDY - NIGHT(1966)

               The study is lined with bookshelves up to the ceiling; we 
               see photos of family, a chess set.  Jim, smoking his pipe, 
               reads in a red leather chair from one of the 26 thick Warren 
               Commission volumes piled all over the place.  Liz enters.  
               Jasper, now 7, draws on a piece of paper on the floor at 
               Jim's feet.

                         Jim, dinner's just about ready... 
                         I've got a surprise for you... tried 
                         something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.

                                     JIM
                              (lost in thought)
                         Mmmmm... sure smells good... but 
                         Egghead, do you realize Oswald was 
                         interrogated for twelve hours after 
                         the assassination, with no lawyer 
                         present, and nobody recorded a word 
                         of it?  I can't believe it.  A police 
                         captain with 30 years experience and 
                         a crowd of Federal agents just had 
                         to know that with no record anything 
                         that Oswald said would be inadmissible 
                         in court.

                                     LIZ
                         Come on now, we'll talk about it at 
                         the table, dinner's getting cold.
                              (to Jasper)
                         What are you doing in here?

                         Daddy said it was all right if I was 
                         real quiet.

                              (rising to dinner)
                         Sure it is.  Freckle Face, if I ever 
                         handled a minor felon like that, 
                         it'd be all over the papers.  I'd 
                         catch hell.  And this is the alleged 
                         murderer of the President?

               GARRISON DINING ROOM - (1966)

               Two-year-old Elizabeth watches "Crusader Rabbit" on TV as 
               the new one-year-old sits in diapers with Liz at one end of 
               the dinner table.  Jim sits at the other end.  There are 
               five kids now, ages 7, 5, 4, 2 and 1... and Mattie, the 
               housekeeper.  Dinner's finished, they pass plates, the 
               children horse around... the boxer dog, Touchdown, begs for 
               a piece of the action.  Jim, not a big eater, feeds him ice 
               cream.

                                     JIM
                         Again and again they ignore credible 
                         testimony, leads are never followed 
                         up, its conclusions are selective, 
                         there's no index, it's one of the 
                         sloppiest, most disorganized 
                         investigations I've ever seen.  Dozens 
                         and dozens of witnesses in Dealey 
                         Plaza that day are saying they heard 
                         shots coming from the Grassy Knoll 
                         area in front of Kennedy and not the 
                         Book Depository behind him, but it's 
                         all broken down and spread around 
                         and you read it and the point gets 
                         lost.

                                     MATTIE
                         I never did believe it either!

                         you take Be up now.  And Elizabeth, 
                         too, your bedtime, honey.

                         Nahhhh!  I don't wanna go to bed!

                                     LIZ
                         Honey, that was three years ago - we 
                         all tried so hard to put that out of 
                         our minds, why are you digging it up 
                         again?  You're the D.A. of New 
                         Orleans.  Isn't the Kennedy 
                         assassination a bit outside your 
                         domain?  I mean all those important 
                         people already studied it.

                                     JIM
                         I can't believe a man as intelligent 
                         as Earl Warren ever read what's in 
                         those volumes.

                                     LIZ
                         Well maybe you're right, Jim.  I'll 
                         give you one hour to solve the case... 
                         until the kids are in bed.
                              (rising, she puts her 
                              arms around him from 
                              behind and kisses 
                              his ear)
                         Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can 
                         wait 'til morning.  Come on, everybody 
                         say goodnight to Daddy.

                                     JASPER
                              (showing his drawing)
                         Dad, look what I drew.

                                     JIM
                              (rising)
                         That's something, Jasper.  What is 
                         it?

                                     JASPER
                         A rhinoceros.  Can I stay up another 
                         hour?

               Virginia and Snapper each get one of Jim's shoes as he dances 
               with them, holding one with each hand.

                                     JIM
                              (dancing)
                         Pickle and Snapper, my two favorite 
                         dancing partners.

               As the children dance, they fall off Jim's feet, laughing 
               and giggling.  He throws each in the air and kisses them.

                                     JIM
                         Goodnight, my doodle bugs.

                                     KIDS
                         Goodnight, Daddy.

               Liz comes over, smiling.  Jim takes her in his arms.

                                     LIZ
                         One hour, y'hear?  Some Saturday 
                         night date you are.
                              (sighs)
                         Mama warned me this would happen if 
                         I married such a serious man.

                                     JIM
                         Oh, she did, huh?  When I come up 
                         I'll show you how Saturday night got 
                         invented.

               GARRISON STUDY - LATER THAT NIGHT(1966)

               The clock on mantelpiece reads 3 A.M.  Jim is alone, smoking 
               his pipe.

               In the stillness, his mind crawls all over the place.  The 
               camera closes on the thickly-worded pages of the Warren 
               Report.

               FLASHBACK TO the Warren Commission hearing room in Dallas, 
               1964.  We hear thin, echoey sound as the attorneys question 
               some of the witnesses.

               The overall effect is vague and confusing, as is much of the 
               Warren Report.  A Mr. Ball is questioning Lee Bowers, the 
               switchman in the railroad yard.  Bowers, in his early 40's, 
               has a trustworthy, working-man face and a crew cut.

                                     BOWERS
                         I sealed off the area, and I held 
                         off the trains until they could be 
                         examined, and there was some 
                         transients taken on at least one 
                         train.

                                     ATTORNEY
                         Mr. Bowers... is there anything else 
                         you told me I haven't asked you about 
                         that you can think of?

                                     BOWERS
                         Nothing that I can recall.

                                     ATTORNEY
                         Witness is excused.

               Jim, upset, reads on... Another witness, Sgt. D.V. Harkness 
               of the Dallas Police responds to a second attorney.

                                     SGT. HARKNESS
                         Well we got a long freight that was 
                         in there, and we pulled some people 
                         off of there and took them to the 
                         station.

               We see another FLASHBACK - to the Dallas rail yards on the 
               day of the assassination.  Three hoboes are being pulled off 
               the freight by the Dallas policemen.

                                     ATTORNEY (V.O.)
                         You mean some transients?

                                     SGT. HARKNESS (V.O.)
                         Tramps and hoboes.

                                     ATTORNEY (V.O.)
                         Were all those questioned?

               FLASHBACK TO Dealey Plaza an hour or less after the 
               assassination.  The three hoboes are marched by shotgun-toting 
               policemen to the Sheriff's office at Dealey Plaza.  We note 
               that they do not look much like hoboes.

                                     SGT. HARKNESS (V.O.)
                         Yes, sir, they were taken to the 
                         station and questioned.

                                     JIM
                              (astounded)
                         And?
                              (writes "incomplete")

                                     ATTORNEY (V.O.)
                              (switching subjects)
                         I want to go back to this Amos Euins.
                              (voices dribble off)

                                     BOWERS (V.O.)
                         Yes sir, traffic had been cut off 
                         into the area since about 10, but 
                         there were three cars came in during 
                         this time from around noon till the 
                         time of the shooting... the cars 
                         circled the parking lot, and left 
                         like they were checking the area, 
                         one of the drivers seemed to have 
                         something he was holding to his 
                         mouth... the last car came in about 
                         7 to 10 minutes before the shooting, 
                         a white Chevrolet, 4-door Impala, 
                         muddy up to the windows.

               The camera's point of view is now from the railroad tower 
               near Dealey Plaza.  We are fourteen feet off the ground, 
               overlooking the parking lot behind the Grassy Knoll.  The 
               shot includes this last car circling in the lot.

                                     BOWERS
                         Towards the underpass, I saw two men 
                         standing behind a picket fence... 
                         they were looking up towards Main 
                         and Houston and following the caravan 
                         as it came down.  One of them was 
                         middle-aged, heavyset.  The other 
                         man was younger, wearing a plaid 
                         shirt and jacket.

               Inside the railroad tower, Bowers glances out, busy with the 
               main board, flashing lights, a train coming in.

                                     BOWERS
                         There were two other men on the 
                         eastern end of the parking lot.  
                         Each of 'me had uniforms.

               We see the parking lot from Bower's point of view - at a 
               distance, but we have a sense of the cars and see the men at 
               a distance, tow uniformed men.  The parking lot is bumper-to-
               bumper with a sea of cars.  Rain that morning has muddied 
               the lot.  These brief images are elaborated on later.

                                     BOWERS
                         At the time of the shooting there 
                         seemed to be some commotion... I 
                         just am unable to describe - a flash 
                         of light or smoke or something which
                         caused me to feel that something out 
                         of the ordinary had occurred there 
                         on the embankment...

               We feel the growing intensity: music, drums - but all blurred.  
               We see a puff of smoke but no sound because of the window 
               Bowers is glancing through.  A motorcycle cop shoots up the 
               Grassy Knoll incline.  People run, blurring into a larger 
               mosaic of confusion.  Bowers is confused, seeing this.

               INTERCUT with Jim's heart pounding as he reads.

               Back in Dealey Plaza, S.M. Holland, an elderly signal 
               supervisor, stands on the parapet of the railway.

                                     HOLLAND (V.O.)
                         Four shots... a puff of smoke came 
                         from the trees... behind that picket 
                         fence... close to the little plaza - 
                         There's no doubt whatever in my mind.

               We see the scene from Holland's point of view - the puff of 
               smoke lingering under the trees along the picket fence after 
               the shooting.

               GARRISON BEDROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT(1966)

               Jim is asleep, having a tortured dream.

               DREAMSCAPE FLASHBACK: We see the Zapruder film, in slow-motion 
               and J.F.K.'s face just before he goes behind Stemmons Freeway 
               sign.  Jim sits up suddenly.

                                     JIM
                         NO!

               Liz stirs, shaken.

                                     LIZ
                         Honey, you all right?
                              (looks at watch)

                                     JIM
                         It's incredible, honey - the whole 
                         thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies 
                         that Lee Oswald was given a Russian 
                         language exam as part of his Marine 
                         training only a few months before he 
                         defects to the Soviet Union.  A 
                         Russian exam!

                                     LIZ
                              (sitting up, angered)
                         I cannot believe this.  It's four-
                         thirty, Jim Garrison.  I have five 
                         children are gonna be awake in another 
                         hour and ...

                                     JIM
                         Honey, in all my years in the service 
                         I never knew a single man who was 
                         given a Russian test.  Oswald was a 
                         radar operator.  He'd have about as 
                         much use for Russian as a cat has 
                         for pajamas.

                                     LIZ
                         These books are getting to your mind, 
                         Mr. Garrison.  I wish you'd stop 
                         readin' them.

                                     JIM
                         And then this Colonel tries to make 
                         it sound like nothing.  Oswald did 
                         badly on the test, he says.  "He 
                         only had two more Russian words right 
                         than wrong."  Ha!  That's like me 
                         saying Touchdown here...
                              (points to the dog)
                         ...is not very intelligent because I 
                         beat him three games out of five the 
                         last time we played chess.

                                     LIZ
                              (gives up)
                         Jim, what is going on, for heaven's 
                         sake!  You going to stay up all night 
                         every night?  For what?  So you'll 
                         be the only man in America who read 
                         the entire 26 volumes of the Warren 
                         Report?

                                     JIM
                         Liz, do I have to spell it out for 
                         you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary 
                         soldier.  That was no accident he 
                         was in Russia.  He was probably in 
                         military intelligence.  That's why 
                         he was trained in Russian.

                         years!

               She takes him now, gently, and pulls him down on top of her 
               and kisses him.

                         come on.

               LAFAYETTE SQUARE - NEW ORLEANS - MORNING(1966)

               A Sunday, early.  We see a statue of Ben Franklin in an empty 
               square frequented by drunks who doze on benches in a little 
               leafy park in the center of the Square.  The camera moves to 
               Jim by himself and then moves to a sedan, pulling up, which 
               disgorges Lou Ivon and Bill Broussard.

                                     JIM
                         Morning, boys.  Ready for a walking 
                         tour?

                                     BILL
                         At 7:30 Sunday morning?  It's not 
                         exactly fresh blood we're sniffing 
                         here, boss.

                                     JIM
                              (points)
                         Old stains, Bill, but just as telling.

               TIME CUT TO Jim indicating 531 Lafayette Street, a seedy, 
               faded, three-story building across the street from the square.

                                     JIM
                         Remember whose office this was back 
                         in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.

                                     LOU
                         Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He 
                         died couple years ago.

               FLASHBACK TO the exterior of the Banister Office on a day in 
               1963.  The door is now clearly labelled "W. GUY BANISTER, 
               INC. INVESTIGATORS."  It opens and Banister comes out in 
               slow motion, neatly dressed, rose in his lapel - the same 
               office and same man we saw three years before when he pistol-
               whipped Jack Martin.  Banister seems to be smiling right at 
               us, greeting us.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Headed the Chicago office.  When he 
                         retired he became a private eye here.  
                         I used to have lunch with him.  John 
                         Birch Society, Minutemen, slightly 
                         to the right of Attila the Hun.  
                         Used to recruit college students to 
                         infiltrate radical organizations on 
                         campus.  All out of this office.  
                         Now come around here, take a look at 
                         this...

               Back to the Lafayette Square of 1966.  Jim walks Ivon and 
               Bill to the corner, to another entrance to the same building - 
               this one with a sign that says "544 Camp Street."

                                     JIM
                         544 Camp Street.  Same building as 
                         531 Lafayette, right... but different 
                         address and different entrances both 
                         going to the same place - the offices 
                         on the second and third floors.

               Bill studies the present sign: "Crescent City Dental 
               Laboratory", and gives Jim a puzzled look.

                                     JIM
                         Guess who used this address?

               Lou gets it and glances up.  We FLASHBACK TO the exterior of 
               544 Camp Street in 1963.  Lee Oswald comes out the door into 
               a full close-up, now clearly seen by us, and heads out into 
               the street as Guy Banister intercepts him on the sidewalk, 
               holding a leaflet and point to "544 Camp Street stamped on 
               it.  Guy seems miffed at Oswald, tells him something quickly, 
               and then moves on.

                                     BANISTER
                              (under)
                         See this?  What the hell is this 
                         doing on this piece of paper?
                              (he moves away)
                         Asshole.

                                     LOU (V.O.)
                         My God!  Lee Harvey Oswald.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Bull's-eye.  How do we know he was 
                         here?  Cause this office address was 
                         stamped on the pro-Casto leaflets he 
                         was handing out in the summer of '63 
                         down on Canal street.  They were the 
                         same leaflets that were found in his 
                         garage in Dallas.

               FLASHBACK to Canal Street in New Orleans on a summer day in 
               1963.  Oswald, in a thin tie and white short-sleeved shirt, 
               and wearing a homemade placard reading "Hands Off Cuba"; 
               "Viva Fidel!", is hawking leaflets to pedestrians with two 
               young helpers.

               A large white-haired businessman in a white suit, very 
               distinguished, walks with a friend on Canal Street.  Oswald 
               glances at him and meets his eyes.  The businessman enters 
               an office building.  This man is Clay Bertrand, later known 
               as Clay Shaw.

               Some Cubans, led by Carols Bringuier, now appear.  One of 
               them, "the Bull", is heavy-set with dark glasses.  More of 
               him will also be seen.

                                     JIM
                         He was arrested that day for fighting 
                         with some anti-Castro Cubans... but 
                         actually he had contacted them a few 
                         days earlier as an ex-Marine trying 
                         to join the anti-Castro crusade.  
                         When they heard he was now pro-Castro, 
                         they paid him a visit.

                                     CARLOS
                              (haranguing passerby)
                         He's a traitor, this man!  Don't 
                         believe a word he tells you!
                              (to Oswald)
                         You sonofabitch, you liar, you're a 
                         Communist, go back to Moscow.

               Carlos throws Oswald's leaflets in the air and pulls off his 
               glasses, prepared to fight.  Oswald only smiles, and puts 
               his arms down in an X of passivity.

                                     OSWALD
                         Okay, Carlos, if you want to hit me, 
                         hit me.

               There is no real fight, but the police, as if pre-alerted, 
               arrive.

               Arrests are made.  We see Oswald in a room in the police 
               station, talking with FBI Agent John Quigley.  A calendar on 
               the wall shows that it's August, 1963.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         There was no real fight and the 
                         arresting Lieutenant later said he 
                         felt it was a staged incident.  In 
                         jail, Oswald asked to talk to Special 
                         Agent John Quigley of the FBI who 
                         showed up immediately.  They have a 
                         private session.  Oswald is released 
                         and Quigley destroys his notes from 
                         the interview.

               In a television studio in 1963, Oswald debates Carlos 
               Bringuier with two moderators.

                                     JIM
                         But the arrest gets him a lot of 
                         publicity and as a result Oswald 
                         appears on a local TV debate that 
                         established his credentials as a 
                         Communist.

                                     BRINGUIER
                         But you're a Communist, are you not, 
                         and you defected to Russia.

                                     OSWALD
                         No, I am not a Communist.  But I am 
                         a Marxist-Leninist.

                                     BRINGUIER
                         What did you do when you were in 
                         Russia?

                                     OSWALD
                              (defensive)
                         I worked while I was there.  I was 
                         always under the protection of... 
                         that is to say, I was not under the 
                         protection of the U.S. Government.

               Back in 1966, Jim walks with his two assistants.

                                     BILL
                         What the hell's a Communist like Lee 
                         Oswald doing working out of 
                         Banister's?

                                     JIM
                         Y'ever heard of a double agent, Bill?  
                         I'm beginning to doubt Oswald was 
                         ever a Communist... after the arrest, 
                         544 Camp Street never appeared on 
                         the pamphlets again.  Now here's 
                         another one for you:  What would you 
                         say if I told you Lee Oswald had 
                         been trained in the Russian language 
                         when he was a Marine?

                                     LOU
                         I'd say he was probably getting 
                         intelligence training.

                                     JIM
                         Lou, you were in the Marines.  Who 
                         would be running that training?

                                     LOU
                         The Office of Naval Intelligence.

                         Take a look across the street.

               We see the Post Office building across the street.

                                     LOU
                         Post Office.

                         Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office 
                         of Naval Intelligence - And just by 
                         coincidence, Banister, before he was 
                         FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?

                                     LOU
                         "Once ONI, always ONI"?

                         Well, he likes to work near his old 
                         pals.

               Jim makes a gesture encompassing the whole Square.

                                     JIM
                         Bill, Lou, we're standing in the 
                         heart of the United States 
                         Government's intelligence community 
                         in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, 
                         the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't 
                         this seem to you a rather strange 
                         place for a Communist to spend his 
                         spare time?

                                     LOU
                         What are you driving at, boss?

                                     JIM
                         We're going back into the case, Lou - 
                         the murder of the President.  I want 
                         you to take some money from the Fees 
                         and Fines Account and go to Dallas - 
                         talk to some people.  Bill, I want 
                         you to get Oser on the medical, the 
                         autopsy, Susan on Oswald and Ruby 
                         histories, tax records...

                         No, you're awake, Bill, and I'm dead 
                         serious.  And we're going to start 
                         by tracking down your anonymous source 
                         from three years ago.  How did you 
                         find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas 
                         that day?

               RACETRACK - DAY(1966)

               A straggly group of people watch from the grandstands eating 
               hotdogs and talking in small clusters.  The horses are running 
               early morning laps.  Three men sit apart in the bleachers.  
               A scared Jack Martin, three years older than when last seen, 
               still wearing the Dick Tracy hat, sucks up coffee like a 
               worm does moisture.  He has the red puffy cheeks of an 
               alcoholic and deeply circled, worried eyes.  Bill and Jim 
               wait.

                                     JIM
                         You're not under cross-examination 
                         here, Jack.

               What I need is a little clarification about the night Guy 
               Banister beat you over the head with his Magnum.  You called 
               our office hopping mad from your hospital bed.  Don't tell 
               me you don't remember that?

               Jack looks away and doesn't respond.

                                     JIM
                         Here's my problem, Jack.  You told 
                         me you and Guy were good friends for 
                         a long time?

                                     MARTIN
                         More than ten years.

                                     JIM
                         And he never hit you before?

                                     MARTIN
                         Never touched me.

                                     JIM
                         Yet on November 22, 1963 - the day 
                         of the President's murder - our police 
                         report says he pistol-whipped you 
                         with a .357 Magnum.
                              (Martin's eyes are 
                              fixed on Jim)
                         But the police report says you had 
                         an argument over the phone bill.  
                         Here, take a look at it.
                              (Martin looks at the 
                              report)
                         Now, does a simple argument over 
                         phone bills sound like a believable 
                         explanation to you?

               SUDDEN FLASHBACK to the night of the pistol-whipping.  The 
               camera shows Banister laying Martin's head open / the beating 
               the humiliation.

                                     MARTIN
                              (shaking his head 
                              slowly, dreamily)
                         No, it involved more than that.

               Bill looks at Jim.

                                     JIM
                         How much more?

                                     MARTIN
                              (waits)
                         I don't know if I should talk about 
                         this.

                                     JIM
                         Well, I'd ask Guy - we were friendly, 
                         you know - heart attack, wasn't it?

                                     MARTIN
                         If you buy what you read in the paper.

                                     JIM
                         You have other information?

                                     MARTIN
                         I didn't say that.  All I know is he 
                         died suddenly just before the Warren 
                         Report came out.

                                     JIM
                         Why did Guy beat you, Jack?

                                     MARTIN
                         Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, 
                         it don't really matter... it was 
                         about the people hanging around the 
                         office that summer.  I wasn't really 
                         part of the operation, you know.  I 
                         was handling the private-eye work 
                         for Guy when that came in - not much 
                         did - but that's why I was there... 
                         it was a nuthouse.  There were all 
                         these Cubans coming and going.  They 
                         all looked alike to me.

               FLASHBACK to Banister's office in 1963.  There are Cubans in 
               battle fatigues and combat boots; duffle bags are lying 
               around.  David Ferrie, in fatigues, directs the Cubans as 
               they carry crates of ammunition and weapons into a back room.  
               Martin observes from another desk.

                                     MARTIN
                         Dave Ferrie - you know about him?

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Was he there often?

                                     MARTIN (V.O.)
                         Often?  He practically lived there.  
                         It was real cloak and dagger stuff.  
                         They called it Operation Mongoose.  
                         The idea was to train all these Cuban 
                         exiles for another invasion of Cuba.  
                         Banister's office was part of a supply 
                         line that ran from Dallas, through 
                         New Orleans to Miami, stockpiling 
                         arms and explosives.

               Still in 1963, we see the exterior of Banister's office.  A 
               dozen Cubans follow Ferrie downstairs into the street, and 
               pile into several cars, duffels thrown in with them.  Ferrie 
               drives the lead car.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         All this right under the noses of 
                         the intelligence community in 
                         Lafayette Square?

               We see the cars cross the long Lake Pontchartrain Bridge and 
               enter a remote guerrilla training camp.  Bayou and jungle 
               are all around.

                                     MARTIN (V.O.)
                         Sure.  Everybody knew everybody.  It 
                         was a network.  They were working 
                         for the CIA - pilots, black operations 
                         guys, civilians, military - everybody 
                         in those days was running guns 
                         somewhere... Fort Jefferson, Bayou 
                         Bluff, Morgan City... McAllen, Texas 
                         was a big gun-running operation.

               At the guerrilla training camp at Lake Pontchartrain in 1963, 
               we see scenes of basic training - shooting, obstacle courses, 
               callisthenics - led by Ferrie and other trainers.  Scattered 
               among the Cubans are several white American mercenaries.  We 
               catch a glimpse of Oswald and glimpses of several other men 
               we will see again, in sprinklings.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Where is Banister in all this?

                                     MARTIN (V.O.)
                         Banister was running his camp north 
                         of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled 
                         a lot of the training.  There was a 
                         shooting range and a lot of tropical 
                         terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans 
                         got trained, too.  Nazi types.  
                         Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the 
                         craziest.

               It's night at the training camp.  FBI agents race up in cars 
               in the middle of the night, swarming over the camp, rounding 
               up the trainees.

                                     MARTIN
                         Anyway, late summer the party ended.  
                         Kennedy didn't want another Bay of 
                         Pigs mess, so he ordered the FBI to 
                         shut down the camps and confiscate 
                         the napalm and the C-4.  There were 
                         a buncha Cubans and a couple Americans 
                         arrested, only you didn't read about 
                         it in the papers.  Just the weapons 
                         got mentioned... 'cause the first 
                         ones behind bars would've been 
                         Banister and Ferrie, but I think the 
                         G-men were just going through the 
                         motions for Washington.  Their hearts 
                         were with their old FBI buddy 
                         Banister.

               We see FBI agents loading dynamite, bomb casings, arms 155mm 
               artillery shells, etc.

               Back at the racetrack in 1966, Jim listens.

                                     MARTIN
                         Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.

                                     JIM
                         And Oswald?

               Martin hesitates.  We hear the rhythmic beating of the horse 
               hooves and Martin sucking on the steaming cup of coffee.

                                     MARTIN
                              (finally)
                         Yeah, he was there, too... sometimes 
                         he'd be meeting with Banister with 
                         the door shut.  Other times he'd be 
                         shooting the bull with Ferrie.  But 
                         he was there all right.

                                     JIM
                         Anything more specific, Jack?  It's 
                         important.

               FLASHBACK TO Banister's office in 1963.  Banister and Martin 
               shooting the breeze as the straight-laced middle-aged 
               secretary, Delphine Roberts, hurries in.

                                     MARTIN (V.O.)
                         Yeah, one time the secretary got 
                         upset, I remember...

                                     SECRETARY
                         I can't believe it, Mr. Banister.  
                         Lee Oswald is down on Canal Street 
                         giving out Communist leaflets 
                         supporting Castro!

               Banister just looks at her and laughs.

                                     BANISTER
                         It's okay, Delphine, he's with us.

               Back at the racetrack...

                                     JIM
                         Anyone else involved at Banister's 
                         level?

                                     MARTIN
                              (shrugs)
                         There was one guy, I don't know, big 
                         guy, business guy, white hair - I 
                         saw him come into the office once.  
                         He looked out of place, y'know - 
                         like a society guy.  Can't remember 
                         his name.
                              (thinking)
                         Oswald was with him. 

               FLASHBACK to Banisters office on a day in 1963.  Martin is 
               snooping in Banister's files.  Cut to Martin leaving the 
               office as a big businessman with white hair briefly talks to 
               Oswald and then goes into Banister's private office.

                                     MARTIN
                         He had something to do with money.  
                         I remember him cause Guy, who didn't 
                         kiss anybody's ass, sure kissed his.

               Banister lets the man into his private office.

                                     MARTIN
                         Clay something, that was his name - 
                         Clay.

                                     JIM
                         Bertrand.  Clay Bertrand?

                                     MARTIN
                         Yeah!  That's it.
                              (pause, paranoid)
                         I don't know.  Maybe it wasn't.  I 
                         gotta go.

                                     JIM
                              (to Bill)
                         Clay Bertrand.  He's in the Warren 
                         Report.  He tried to get Oswald a 
                         lawyer.
                              (to Martin)
                         Was Kennedy ever discussed, Jack?

                                     MARTIN
                         Sure.  'Course they hated the 
                         sonofabitch, but...

                                     JIM
                         The assassination, Jack?

                                     MARTIN
                              (tightens)
                         Never.  Not with me sir, never... 
                         Listen, I think I'd better go.  I 
                         said enough.  I said all I'm going 
                         to say.
                              (rises suddenly)

                         Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?

                                     MARTIN
                         What's the problem?  What's the 
                         problem?  Do I need to spell it out 
                         for you, Mr. Garrison?  I better go.

                                     JIM
                         Nobody knows what we're talking about, 
                         Jack.

                                     MARTIN
                         You're so naive, mister.

               Martin picks his way nervously down the bleacher benches.

               CAR - FRENCH QUARTER - DAY(1966)

               Jim drives, with Numa in the front and Bill in the back.

                                     BILL
                         Well, it's a terrific yard, Chief, 
                         but the man's an obvious alcoholic 
                         with a reputation lower than crocodile 
                         piss.

                                     JIM
                         Does that bother you, Bill?  I always 
                         wondered in court why it is because 
                         a woman is a prostitute, she has to 
                         have bad eyesight.

                                     BILL
                         He'll never sign a statement, boss, 
                         let alone get on a witness stand.

                                     JIM
                         When something's rotten in the land, 
                         Bill, it generally isn't just one 
                         fish, we'll get corroboration... 
                         find this Clay Bertrand.  If I were 
                         a betting man, I'd give you 10 to 1 
                         it's an alias.  Start checking around 
                         the Quarter.

                                     BILL
                         And the six of us, with almost no 
                         budget and in secret, are going to 
                         solve the case that the Warren 
                         Commission with dozens of support 
                         staff and millions of dollars couldn't 
                         solve.  We can't keep up with the 
                         crimes in the Parish as it is, Chief.

                                     JIM
                         The murder of a President, Bill, is 
                         a crime in Orleans Parish too.  I 
                         didn't pick you because of your legal 
                         skill, you know.

                                     BILL
                         Gee, thanks boss.

               Jim pulls the car over to park.

                                     JIM
                         But because you're a fighter.  I 
                         like a man who isn't scared of bad 
                         odds.

               FRENCH QUARTER SIDEWALK - DAY(1966)

               Jim and the others get out of the car and head towards 
               Antoine's Restaurant.  A black woman greets him.

                                     BLACK WOMAN
                         How ya doing, Mr. Garrison?  Remember 
                         me - from the piano bar at the Royal 
                         Orleans?

                                     JIM
                         I sure do.  We sang "You're the Cream 
                         in My Coffee."

               She laughs.  Others move in on him.

                                     JIM
                              (to Numa)
                         Make sure we come back here, now.

               ANTOINE'S RESTAURANT - DAY(1966)

               They enter a busy lunchtime crowd in an elegant eatery.  Lou 
               Ivon and Al Oser are waiting for them as they're shown to 
               their table by the Maitre d'.

                                     MAITRE D'
                         Mr. Garrison, we have not seen enough 
                         of you lately.

                                     JIM
                         Been too busy, Paul - an elected man 
                         can't have as much fun as he used 
                         to.
                              (seeing Lou and Al)
                         Welcome back, Lou.  Find out anything 
                         on those hobos?

               Lou's been waiting, excited.  He gives Jim blowups of the 
               five hobo photographs.

                                     LOU
                         They took 'em to the Sheriff's office, 
                         not the police station, and they let 
                         'em go.  No record of them ever being 
                         questioned.

                                     JIM
                         I can't say that comes as a surprise 
                         anymore.

                                     LOU
                         A photographer from The Dallas Times 
                         Herald got some great shots of them 
                         never published...

               The camera moves in on the photographs.

               FLASHBACK TO the "hoboes" being escorted to the Sheriff's 
               office - as per Sgt. Harkness' earlier description.

                                     LOU
                         ...take a good look, chief, do any 
                         of 'em look like the hoboes you 
                         remember?

                                     JIM
                         Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep 
                         in their clothes - these two look 
                         pretty young.

                                     LOU
                         ...not a single frayed collar or 
                         cuff, new haircuts, fresh shaves, 
                         clean hands - new shoe leather.  
                         Look at the ear of the cop... That's 
                         a wire.  What's a cop wearing a 
                         headset for?  I think they're actors, 
                         chief; they're not cops.

               Susie Cox arrives.

                                     JIM
                         Who the hell are they, then!  Hi, 
                         Susie, sit down.
                              (to Lou)
                         This could be it.  Let's start looking 
                         for 'em.

               How 'bout that railroad man, Lee Bowers?  Saw those men at 
               the picket fence?

                                     LOU
                         Graveyard dead.  August this year.
                              (Jim curses quietly)
                         A single car accident on an empty 
                         road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor 
                         said he was in some kind of strange 
                         shock when he died.
                              (pause)

                                     JIM
                              (shares the look)
                         We need to find more witnesses, Lou.

                                     LOU
                         There was Rose Cheramie.  A whore.  
                         Two Cubans threw her out of a car on 
                         the way to Dallas.

               She talked to a cop from a hospital bed two days before the 
               assassination, said Kennedy would be hit that Friday.  She 
               said she was a dope runner for Jack Ruby and that Ruby knew 
               Oswald for years...

                                     JIM
                         Can we find her?

                                     LOU
                         Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas 
                         in '65.  Two in the morning on some 
                         highway.  A hit and run.

               FLASHBACK to Rose lying dead on an empty highway.

                                     BILL
                         Why not go right to the horse's mouth, 
                         chief?

               Jack Ruby's been rotting in a Dallas jail cell for three 
               years.  Maybe he's ready to crack?

                                     JIM
                         If we go to him our investigation'll 
                         hit the front pages by sunrise.  
                         Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was 
                         just given a new trial.  If he has 
                         something to say, it'll be there.  
                         Susie, what did you find out on 
                         Oswald?

                                     SUSIE
                         Negative on his tax records.  
                         Classified.  First time I know a 
                         D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put 
                         together a list of all the CIA files 
                         on Oswald that were part of the Warren 
                         Report and asked for them.  There 
                         are about 1200 documents...
                              (gives it to Jim who 
                              reads)
                         Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, 
                         Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel 
                         file, a memo from the Director on 
                         Oswald, travel and activities - can't 
                         get one of them.  All classified as 
                         secret on the grounds of national 
                         security.  It's real strange.

                                     BILL
                         Maybe there's more to this, Susie.  
                         The CIA's keeping something from our 
                         enemies.

                                     SUSIE
                         Yes, but we're talking about a dead 
                         warehouse employee of no political 
                         significance.  Three years later and 
                         he's still classified?  They gave us 
                         his grammar school records, a study 
                         of his pubic hairs... Put it in 
                         context, Bill, of what we know about 
                         Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, 
                         unstable childhood, high school 
                         dropout - wants to grow up and be a 
                         spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He 
                         learns Russian, he acts overtly 
                         Marxist with two other marines, but 
                         he's stationed at a top secret base 
                         in Japan where U2 spy flights over 
                         Russia originate.  He's discharged 
                         from the Marines supposedly because 
                         his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 
                         days, then with a $1500 ticket from 
                         a $203 bank account, he goes to 
                         Moscow...

               FLASHBACK TO Moscow in 1959.  We see shots of the city - 
               strange and eerie black-and-white stills.  Inside the U.S. 
               Embassy Oswald slaps his passport on the table with a formal 
               letter.  Two consuls attend him.

                                     OSWALD
                              (voice stilted)
                         I want to renounce my citizenship 
                         and become a Soviet citizen.  I'm 
                         going to make known to them all 
                         information I have concerning the 
                         Marine Corps and my specialty therein, 
                         radar operation...

                                     SUSIE (V.O.)
                         One of the consuls, John McVickar, 
                         says Oswald's performance was not 
                         spontaneous - it seemed coached.  
                         Oswald gives an interview to a 
                         journalist.

               Continuing the Moscow flashback, we see Oswald talking with 
               a female journalist in his small room in the Hotel Metropole.  
               Again he sounds robotic.

                                     OSWALD
                         I will never return to the United 
                         States for any reason.  It is a 
                         capitalist country, an exploitive, 
                         racist country.  I am a Marxist since 
                         I was 15.  I've seen poor niggers 
                         and that was a real lesson.  People 
                         hate because they're told to hate, 
                         like school kids.  It's the fashion 
                         to hate people in the U.S.

                         The Russians are skeptical - want to 
                         send him back.  Maybe they suspect 
                         he's a spy.  He supposedly slashes 
                         his wrists in a suicide attempt so 
                         that they're forced to keep him, and 
                         he disappears for six weeks, 
                         presumably with the KGB.

               We see photos of the city of Minks, in Russia, Oswald with 
               various friends and tourists, shots of Lee and Marina with a 
               new baby.

                         Finally they shuttle him to a radio 
                         factory in Minks where he lives as 
                         high on the hog as he ever has - 
                         he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy 
                         apartment with a balcony, has affairs 
                         with local girls.

                         any propaganda for the Russians.  He 
                         meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel 
                         in Soviet intelligence, at a trade 
                         union dance; she thinks he's Russian 
                         the way he speaks, six weeks later 
                         they marry, have a daughter.

                         the royal treatment is he did give 
                         them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.

               We see documentary shots of the U2 on Russian soil... Francis 
               Gary Powers... The Summit Conference canceled... Eisenhower 
               and Khrushchev.

                         I don't know if it's coincidence, 
                         but Oswald had a top security 
                         clearance and knew about the U2 
                         program from his days at Atsugi Air 
                         Base in Japan.  Six months after he 
                         arrives in Russia, Francis Gary 
                         Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in 
                         Russia.  That plane was untouchable.  
                         Powers hinted that Oswald could've 
                         given the Russians enough data to 
                         hit it.  As a direct result, the 
                         peace summit between Khrushchev and 
                         Eisenhower failed.  I can't help 
                         thinking of that book Seven Days In 
                         May, maybe someone in our military 
                         didn't want the Peace Conference to 
                         happen, maybe Oswald was part of 
                         that.  It gets weirder.

               FLASHBACK TO a Forth Worth map factory.  We see Oswald at 
               work on photo mattes with a Minox spy camera.  The camera 
               shows close-ups of maps and then flashes to a hand in the

               on the Oswald photo - and a razor blade cutting mattes.

               FLASHBACK TO Fort Worth in 1963.  In Oswald's cheap apartment, 
               seven White Russians, including George de Mohrenschildt, a 
               distinguished grey-haired man in his late fifties, are 
               visiting Marina and Oswald, bringing old dresses, groceries,

                         FBI and was told Oswald is all right.

               Anna Meller, one of the guests, glances at a copy of Das 
               Kapital in a pile of books, and talks to another Russian man

                         Williams.  It's through Janet Williams 
                         in October '63 that Lee gets the 
                         warehouse job, right smack on Elm 
                         Street at the Book Depository, which 
                         is owned by another oilman with ties 
                         to defense and military intelligence.

                         Presumably so he can now exercise 
                         his intellect stacking school texts 
                         at $1.25 an hour.

               We see Oswald and another man in the Texas School Book 
               Depository in 1963.  They are hauling and stacking school 
               textbooks - an obviously lower-level job for Oswald after 
               the map factory.  We cut ahead to empty graphics of the sealed 
               off area, the window site, the cafeteria.

                         All I can find out about the Williams' 
                         is their tax returns are classified 
                         and that Bill Williams, a descendant 
                         of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has 
                         links through his family and United 
                         Fruit to the CIA and does classified 
                         work for Bell Helicopter which 
                         requires a security clearance - so 
                         what is Oswald, a defector, doing 
                         visiting his wife in his house?  
                         Williams has a relationship at Bell 
                         with General Walter Dornberger, 
                         another one of the Nazis we brought 
                         in after the War for our missile 
                         program.  He used slave labor to 
                         build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler 
                         before Bell needed him.

                                     JIM
                         I wonder about the Williams'.  Just 
                         where did the first description of 
                         Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one 
                         knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, 
                         but his description came after 1 
                         P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's 
                         been tapping the Williams' and picks 
                         up a call between Bell Helicopter 
                         and Janet's phone, an unidentified 
                         voice saying "We both know who's 
                         responsible."  Who called?  Why's 
                         the Bureau been tapping them?

               We see the interior of the Williams' home in Irving on a day 
               in 1963.

                                     SUSIE (V.O.)
                         His wife, Janet Williams, studied 
                         Russian in college and her father 
                         worked for the Agency for 
                         International Development, which 
                         works hand in hand with the CIA.  
                         She suddenly becomes Marina's best 
                         friend.  Marina fights often with 
                         Lee about many things - his secrecy, 
                         the lack of money.  She says Lee is 
                         not sexually adequate.  Lee hits her 
                         on several occasions.  Bill Williams' 
                         convenient separation from Janet 
                         allows Janet to invite Marina to 
                         move into her house in Irving.  There 
                         Marina and Lee have a second daughter - 
                         while Lee, now 24, stores his 
                         belongings in Janet's garage and 
                         rents a small room in Dallas under 
                         an alias of "O.H. Lee".

               We see Marina and Oswald in bed at night in the Williams' 
               house, in a tender scene.  Oswald says goodbye to his child.

               TIME CUT TO Oswald living in a boarding house.  It is at 
               night, and he sits in his room alone.  The housekeeper, 
               Earlene Roberts, heavyset, white, in her 60's, comes in and 
               asks him if he wants to watch some TV with her.  He declines.

                                     SUSIE
                         When he's arrested, Marina buries 
                         him with the public.  Her description 
                         of him is that of a psychotic and 
                         violent man.

               FLASHBACK TO Marina on TV, a different person from before.

                                     MARINA
                         I do not want to believe, but I have 
                         too much facts.. tell me that Lee 
                         shot Kennedy.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Yeah, after, they take her to Six 
                         Flags Inn in Arlington, prepare her 
                         for the interviews, teach her how 
                         she should answer - and after two 
                         months and 46 interviews, she has a 
                         nervous breakdown.
                              (flashback)
                         Oswald was no angel, that's clear, 
                         but who was he?

               BACK TO Antoine's Restaurant.

                                     BILL
                         I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying 
                         here?

                                     JIM
                         We're saying that when Oswald went 
                         to Russia, he was not a real defector, 
                         that he was an intelligence agent on 
                         some kind of mission for our 
                         government and he remained one till 
                         the day he died, that's what we're 
                         saying.

                                     BILL
                         And therefore because Oswald pulled 
                         the trigger, the intelligence 
                         community murdered their own commander 
                         in chief.  That's what you're saying!

                                     JIM
                         I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald 
                         didn't even pull the trigger, Bill.  
                         The nitrate test indicates he didn't 
                         even fire a rifle on November 22nd.  
                         And on top of that, they didn't even 
                         bother to check if the rifle had 
                         been fired that day.

                                     BILL
                         He had his palm print on the weapon.

                                     JIM
                         It went to the goddamn FBI and they 
                         didn't find a goddamn thing.  It 
                         comes back a week later and one guy 
                         in the Dallas police department 
                         suddenly finds a palm print which 
                         for all I know he could've taken off 
                         Oswald at the morgue.  There's no 
                         chain of evidence, Bill.  And what 
                         about the tow guns actually seen in 
                         the Depository?  One an Enfield 
                         photographed by a newsman and the 
                         other a Mauser, described by Deputy 
                         Weitzman... Maybe, just maybe, Lee 
                         Oswald was exactly what he said he 
                         was Bill - "a patsy".  Take it at 
                         face value.  Lou, Susie, I'm going 
                         with my gut here.  He's got an alias 
                         of Hidell to buy the rifle, "O.H. 
                         Lee" to rent the room, right?  What's 
                         in a name, right?  In intelligence, 
                         they're assumed to be fake.  A name 
                         is sort of like a postbox number, a 
                         code - several different people can 
                         use the same name, right?  Then why 
                         can't somebody be using Oswald's 
                         name?

               We see blank faces around the table.

                                     BILL
                         But why?

                                     JIM
                         To frame him, obviously.  You got to 
                         get in your minds how the hell spooks 
                         think, Bill!  They're not ordinary 
                         crooks.

                                     LOU
                         I never could figure out why this 
                         guy orders a traceable weapon to 
                         that post office box when you can go 
                         into any store in Texas, give a phony 
                         name and walk out with a cheap rifle 
                         which can never be traced.

                                     JIM
                         Unless he or someone else wants him 
                         to get caught.  Maybe he never ordered 
                         the weapon, Lou.  Somebody else did.  
                         It was picked up at the post office 
                         early morning when Oswald's time 
                         sheet shows him clocked in at his 
                         job.  Lou, come alive.  These things 
                         are not adding up.

                                     BILL
                         I still have to question what the 
                         legal basis is that supports this, 
                         boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, 
                         but...

                                     JIM
                         Let's start making some assumptions 
                         about the man.  Why would he leave a 
                         path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's?  
                         This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, 
                         it is a very wide one.  Who found 
                         the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, 
                         Bill, Susie, I want you to go back 
                         and check all the sightings of Oswald 
                         in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in 
                         the summer and fall of '63 - see if 
                         it's the same guy.

                                     AL
                         Boss, Oswald impersonators?  Sounds 
                         like James Bond now.

                         Please relax, Mr. Ruby.  This'll 
                         calm you down and clear this up.

                                     RUBY
                         Doc, I'm telling you, I don't need 
                         any shots.

                                     DOCTOR
                         Mr. Ruby, I don't want to involve 
                         the guards.  It'll just take a few 
                         seconds.

               Ruby looks over at the two guards, who eye him.  The Doctor 
               gives him the injection.

               FLASHBACK TO Ruby's jail cell in 1964.  Ruby talks to men 
               with their backs to us.  Lawyers and police clutter the cell, 
               making Ruby hyper-nervous.  The chief official's white hair 
               and avuncular voice are all we see and hear of him; his back 
               is to us.

                         Then do you understand that I cannot 
                         tell the truth here?  In Dallas.  
                         That there are people here who do 
                         not want me to tell the truth...  
                         who do not want me to have a retrial?

                         Mr. Ruby, I really can't see why you 
                         can't tell us now.

               Ruby catches the stern face of Sheriff Bill Decker from the 
               corner of his eye, the Assistant D.A. next to him.

                         When are you going back to Washington, 
                         sir?

                         I am going back very shortly after 
                         we finish this hearing - I am going 
                         to have some lunch.

                                     RUBY
                         Can I make a statement?  If you 
                         request me to go back to Washington 
                         with you right now, that is if you 
                         want to hear further testimony from 
                         me, can you do that?  Can you take 
                         me with you?

                         No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby.  
                         There are a good many things involved 
                         in that.

                         Well, the public attention it would 
                         attract.  And we have no place for 
                         you there to be safe, we're not law 
                         enforcement officials, and many things 
                         are at stake in this affair, Mr. 
                         Ruby.

                         be any way of knowing.  Consequently 
                         a whole new form of government is 
                         going to take over this country, and 
                         I know I won't live to see you another 
                         time.  My life is in danger here.  
                         Do I sound screwy?

                         Mr. Ruby, because I don't know what 
                         you anticipate we will encounter.

                                     RUBY
                         Then you don't stand a chance, Mr. 
                         Chief Justice, you have a lost cause.  
                         All I want is a lie detector test, 
                         and you refuse to give it to me.  
                         Because as it stands now - and the 
                         truth serum - how do you pronounce 
                         it - Pentothal - whatever it is.  
                         They will not give it to me, because 
                         I want to tell the truth... And then 
                         I want to leave this world.

               The camera pauses on Ruby's face.  The men rise and leave in 
               the shadows.

               PARKLAND MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - (1967)

               Jack Ruby is escorted out of the infirmary, dead of cancer.

               BROUSSARD'S RESTAURANT - NEW ORLEANS - (1967)

               The puffy, smiling face of Dean Andrews, framed by huge black 
               glasses, talks in a Louisiana hippie argot of the 50's.  The 
               restaurant has a fancy French decor, mirrored walls, marble - 
               it serves the cream of Louisiana society.

                                     ANDREWS
                         Why you keep dancing on my head for, 
                         my man?  We been thicker'n molasses 
                         pie since law school.

                         Because you keep conning me, Dean.  
                         I read your testimony to the Warren 
                         Commission and...

                                     ANDREWS
                         There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two 
                         sides to every coin.

                                     JIM
                         You tell them the day after the 
                         assassination you were called on the 
                         phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and 
                         asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee 
                         Oswald's layer.

                                     ANDREWS
                         Right.

                                     JIM
                         Now that's pretty important, Dean.  
                         You also told the FBI when you met 
                         him, he was six foot two.  Then you 
                         tell the Commission he was five foot 
                         eight.  How the hell did the man 
                         shrink like that, Dean?

                                     ANDREWS
                         They put the heat on, my man, just 
                         like you're doing.  I gave'em anything 
                         that popped into my cabeza.  Truth 
                         is, I never met the dude.

               Sudden FLASHBACK to Andrews' office on a day in 1963.  Clay 
               Bertrand sits, back to us, talking to Andrews.  He has close-
               cropped white hair.  He is the same patrician man we've seen 
               earlier with Oswald on Canal Street and in Banister's office.  
               Andrews is evidently lying.

                                     ANDREWS
                         I don't know what the cat looks like 
                         and furthermore I don't know where 
                         he's at.  All I know is sometimes he 
                         sends me cases.  So one day he's on 
                         the phone talkin' to me about going 
                         to Dallas and repping Oswald...
                              (notices a woman, in 
                              present)
                         Hey, pipe the bimbo in red.  What 
                         ever happened to that little gal you 
                         was dating in the Quarter - from 
                         Opelousas, y'know, elevator didn't 
                         go to the top floor but tits could 
                         smother gumbo with.

               Jim, in present, looking briefly - a pretty girl walking in.

                              (remembering)
                         Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but 
                         not half as cute as you, Deano.  You 
                         shoulda tried a legitimate line of 
                         business.

                                     ANDREWS

                         You can't ever say crime don't pay 
                         in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good 
                         as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't 
                         it?

                         this Bertrand?

                                     ANDREWS
                              (bored)
                         Oh, I first heard these street cats 
                         jiving about him back in '56, '57 
                         when I lived down in the Quarter.

                                     JIM
                         Street cats?

                                     ANDREWS
                         Swishes.  They swish, y'know.  Young 
                         fags, you know.  They'd come into my 
                         bureau needing help, no bread, and 
                         I'd say, hey man, I ain't Rockefeller, 
                         who gonna back you up?  These 
                         cornmuffins go to the phone and 
                         dial...

               FLASHBACK TO Andrews' office on another day in 1963.  We 
               catch a glimpse of a young swish sitting in Andrew's office 
               talking on the phone.  Andrews is also on the phone to 
               Bertrand, unseen, on the other end.

                                     ANDREWS
                         The dude on the other end says...

                         I'm Clay Bertrand.  Whatever they 
                         owe, I guarantee.

                                     ANDREWS
                         Hey, suits me fine, Daddy Warbucks - 
                         how do I get in touch with you?

                         And that's how I first heard of Clay 
                         Bertrand.

                         What was his voice like?

                                     ANDREWS
                         You knew you weren't talking to some 
                         low life fag, you know.  He had 
                         command of the king's English.

                                     JIM
                         Did he pay?

                         Always - like tits on a pig.  I wish 
                         I had a million of those bimbettes.

                                     JIM
                         And Oswald?

                              hesitation)
                         Like I told to the Washington boys, 
                         Bertrand called that summer and asked 
                         me to help the kid upgrade his Marine 
                         discharge...

                                     JIM
                         So you saw Oswald how many times?

                                     ANDREWS
                         Three, four.  He came in with a few 
                         Cubano swishes one time I remember...

               FLASHBACK TO a third day at Andrew's office in 1963.  Oswald 
               is in the office with two young boys.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Recall any names?

                         you and I wear clothes.  Today the 
                         name is Candy, tomorrow it's Butsie.  
                         I wish I could help you, Jim.

                                     JIM
                         Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas?

                                     ANDREWS
                              (knee-jerk reaction)
                         Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat 
                         right off, this isn't my scene, man.  
                         I deal with muni court, I'm a hack 
                         in nigger town, that kid needs a hot 
                         dog.

                                     JIM
                         Then how the hell did you get in the 
                         Warren Commission, Dean?  Except 
                         through the phone records in the 
                         Dallas jail?

                                     ANDREWS
                              (nervous moment)
                         There were no phone records.

                                     JIM
                         Of course there weren't. 'Cause they 
                         disappeared.  And yet the Commission 
                         found you, Dean.

                                     ANDREWS
                         I don't know how they got to me.  
                         Maybe cause I repped him here.  The 
                         Feebees run background checks.  On 
                         my mama's breasts, man, that's all I 
                         got.
                              (pauses, adjusts)
                         There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If 
                         there were, why the hell didn't Bobby 
                         Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney 
                         General, he was his brother for 
                         Chrissake.  How the fuck three people 
                         could keep a secret like that, I 
                         don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was 
                         a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated 
                         this country.

               As Andrews resumes eating his crabmeat Louie with gusto, Jim 
               reaches over and grabs the fork in mid-air.

                                     JIM
                         Dean, I think we're having a 
                         communication problem.  I know you 
                         know who Clay Bertrand is.  Now stop 
                         eating that damn crabmeat for a minute 
                         and listen.
                              (gets Dean's attention)
                         I'm aware of our long friendship, 
                         but I want you to know I'm going to 
                         call you in front of a grand jury.  
                         I took nine judges on, Deano, right 
                         here in New Orleans, and I beat 'em 
                         all.  If you lie to the grand jury 
                         as you've been lying to me, I'm going 
                         to charge you with perjury.  Now, am 
                         I communicating with you?

               Andrews puts down the fork, shaken, silent for a moment.

                                     ANDREWS
                         Is this off the record, Daddy-o?
                              (Jim nods)
                         In that case, let me sum it up for 
                         you real quick.  If I answer that 
                         question you keep asking me, if I 
                         give you the name of the "Big 
                         Enchilada", y'know, then it's bon 
                         voyage, Deano - I mean like permanent.  
                         I mean like a bullet in my head.  
                         You dig?  Does that help you see my 
                         problem a little better?  You're a 
                         mouse fighting a gorilla.  Kennedy's 
                         dead as that crab meat.  The 
                         government's still breathing.  You 
                         want to line up with a dead man?

               At a nearby table, a waiter has just poured brandy on Crepe 
               Suzettes.  A blue flame hovers in the air as Jim leans forward 
               across the table, speaking deliberately.

                                     JIM
                         Read my lips, Deano.  Either you 
                         dance into the Grand Jury with the 
                         real identity of Clay Bertrand or 
                         your fat behind is going to the 
                         slammer.  Do you dig me?

               Andrews stands suddenly.

                                     ANDREWS
                         You're just as crazy as your mama.  
                         Goes to show it's in the genes!  Do 
                         you have any idea what you're getting 
                         into, my man?  You think Jack Ruby 
                         just up and died of cancer in four 
                         weeks after he gets a retrial?  That's 
                         some kinda new cancer - I'd say that's 
                         a "going out of business cancer".  
                         You got the right ta-ta, but the 
                         wrong ho-ho.  The government's gonna 
                         jump all over your head, Jimbo, and 
                         go "cock-a-doodledoo!"

               Andrews drops his pink napkin in the crabmeat and waddles 
               out.  Jim now feels closer to the truth than ever.

               ANGOLA PRISON - LOUISIANA COUNTRYSIDE - (1967)

               From the point of view of an approaching car, the prison 
               looms over the swamp, dogs patrolling the wire.

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         District Attorney Garrison to see 
                         Prisoner 5388, Ward Block 237B.

                                     GUARD'S VOICE (V.O.)
                         Send him on in.

               PRISON DORMITORY - (1967)

               A chief guard walks Jim and Bill into a circus-like 
               atmosphere.  In Louisiana the prisoners can wear any outfit 
               they choose, which makes this prison look like Mardi Gras.  
               There are many transvestites.

                                     GUARD
                              (with evident pride)
                         ...we don't need no gates out there, 
                         sir, we got the "swamp".  Many of 
                         'em gone in there but none come out... 
                         Hey, Willie!

               Willie O'Keefe, a handsome, muscled, young chickenhawk with 
               an earring, bandana, colorful clothes, an aura of burned 
               truth in his intense, staring brown eyes and thick country 
               accent, sashays over.

                                     GUARD
                         You got some company, wants to talk 
                         wid you.  You behave now, boy, y'hear.

               TIMECUT TO the prison work area, where Willie talks, leaning 
               against a tree looking out on a mangrove swamp.  It's lunch 
               break and other prisoners move in the background, eating, 
               socializing.

                                     JIM
                         I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, 
                         for this time.

                                     O'KEEFE
                         Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' 
                         but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, 
                         hours, days, years of'em.  Time just 
                         stands still here like a snake sunnin' 
                         itself in the road...

                                     BILL
                         Clay Bertrand, Willie?

                                     O'KEEFE
                         Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in 
                         June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar.  
                         Dave Ferrie took me there, for the 
                         express reason to meet him.

                                     JIM
                         For sexual purposes?

                                     O'KEEFE
                         Well... yeah.

               FLASHBACK TO the Masquerade Bar in the French Quarter.  It's 
               nighttime and Ferrie, Bertrand and O'Keefe sit at a back 
               booth.  Bertrand, as seen earlier, is an imposing, white-
               haired patrician man, over six feet tall, heavily defined 
               bones and eyelids, in his late 40's or early 50's.

                                     BILL (V.O.)
                         Did he pay you for this?

                                     O'KEEFE (V.O.)
                         Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, 
                         it's no secret.  That's what I'm 
                         here for.

               They rise to leave.  Bertrand with a slight limp.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Anything else unusual about him you'd 
                         be able to describe in a court of 
                         law, Willie?

                                     O'KEEFE (V.O.)
                         I remember he had some kinda thing 
                         wrong with his left leg.  He limped.  
                         Don't get me wrong, he's not one of 
                         those, you know, limp wrists.  He's 
                         a butch John.  You'd meet him on the 
                         street, you'd never snap.  You could 
                         go fishing with him, play poker with 
                         him, you'd never snap in a million 
                         years.  So one night we were over at 
                         Ferrie's place.  Having a party.  
                         Sometime in the late summer of '63.

               FLASHBACK TO Dave Ferrie's apartment on a night in 1963.  
               The place is filled messy bricabrac, including two dozen 
               mouse cages for Ferrie's cancer experiments.  Ferrie, 
               Bertrand, O'Keefe, and four Cubans in battle fatigues are 
               laughing and fooling around.  Oswald is in a corner cleaning 
               a .22 rifle with a scope on it.  He looks different, unkempt, 
               unshaven.  A record player grinds out a speech in Spanish by 
               Castro.  Some other people are there as well - it's a beatnik 
               scene: sandals, hanging out, only one woman.  Ferrie is taking 
               pictures throughout of the group horsing around, photographing 
               Oswald.

                                     O'KEEFE
                         ...there were about nine or ten 
                         people, Cubans, friends of Dave doing 
                         some stuff in the bush with him.  
                         Place was a mess.  Dave's mind was a 
                         mess,
                              (laughs)
                         Y'know he had all those mice cages 
                         around cause he's working on this 
                         cure for cancer... Dave's smart -
                         real smart - speaks five languages, 
                         knows philosophy, medicine, military 
                         history, politics.  He wanted to be 
                         a priest but they defrocked him 'cause 
                         he was queer...

                                     BILL (V.O.)
                         And that's where you met Oswald for 
                         the first time?

                                     O'KEEFE (V.O.)
                         Yeah, strange guy.  Dave introduced 
                         him as...

                                     FERRIE
                         Willie, say hello to Leon Oswald.

                                     O'KEEFE
                              (over the racket)
                         How ya doing?

                                     OSWALD
                              (sullen, to Ferrie)
                         What the fuck's he doing here?

                                     O'KEEFE
                         Fuck you, man.

               Ferrie separates them.  Oswald seems to resent an outsider 
               being there.

                                     FERRIE
                              (to O'Keefe)
                         Leon's in a bad mood, don't get 
                         excited, he's all right.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Would you say this "Leon" was actually 
                         Lee Harvey Oswald?

                                     O'KEEFE
                              (in present)
                         Fuck, yes.  Hell, I'm already in 
                         jail.  I got no reason to lie to 
                         you.  I ain't no nigger.

                                     BILL
                         Go on, Willie.

                                     O'KEEFE
                              (present merging to 
                              past)
                         ...well the party got crazier and 
                         crazier, one of those, y'know

                              (to O'Keefe)
                         We're having a little meeting here.
                              (indicates the second 
                              player)
                         That's Castro.  Sounds like Hitler 
                         doesn't he?  Sonofabitch is going to 
                         go.  Real soon.

                                     CUBANS
                         Muerte a Fidel!  Muerte!

                                     BERTRAND
                              (irritated at the 
                              noise)
                         Oh, stop it already!  What are all 
                         these people doing here anyway?  I 
                         can't bear all this infernal noise.

                                     FERRIE
                         Clara, don't be so sensitive.

                                     BERTRAND
                         I didn't come here for a pep rally.  
                         Get all this riffraff out of here.

                                     FERRIE
                         Okay, okay.

               TIMECUT TO later that night, when only O'Keefe, Ferrie, 
               Bertrand, Oswald and three Cubans are left.

                                     O'KEEFE (V.O.)
                         ...finally they got out of there and 
                         I found myself alone with Dave and 
                         this Leon, two of the Cubans, and 
                         this guy Bertrand.  Dave pulled out 
                         his clippings which he was always 
                         carrying around.  He'd been obsessed 
                         with Castro and Kennedy for months 
                         and he started in again...

                                     FERRIE
                              (waving a clipping, 
                              drunk)
                         Kennedy fucked us in '61, '62, and 
                         he's fuckin' us now!  And that fuckin' 
                         zealot Bobby Kennedy is the fuckee!  
                         The nerve of that little asswipe 
                         closing the camps.  Took all our C-
                         4!  Took ten thousand rounds, 3,000 
                         pounds of gunpowder, all our weapons.  
                         Next we'll be living in a world where 
                         only the cocksucking Reds will have 
                         all the weapons and we'll be 
                         surrounded.  If we want a free Cuba, 
                         we gotta whack out the fucking beard.

                                     CUBAN
                         That faggot Kennedy won't let us.  
                         Our hands are empty - how can we 
                         kill him?

                                     BERTRAND
                              (moving with a drink, 
                              walks with a slight 
                              limp)
                         It's a real problem getting at him.  
                         Castro's got informers on every block.

                                     FERRIE
                              (pointing to a map of 
                              Cuba on the wall)
                         Bullshit!  There's all kinds of new 
                         stuff.  I heard about rockets in an 
                         umbrella - they're tested at Fort 
                         Detrick?  I can show you a dozen 
                         poisons.  Stick it in his food, he'll 
                         die in three days, no trace.  We can 
                         put something in his beard, make it 
                         fall out, he'll look fuckin' 
                         ridiculous without his beard.

                                     CUBAN
                              (drunk)
                         Why don't we just take care of the 
                         main problem?  Which is that piece 
                         of shit Kennedy.  He's doing all 
                         kinds of deals!  Kissing Khrushchev's 
                         ass.  I wouldn't even call him 
                         President Kennedy.

                                     O'KEEFE (V.O.)
                         ...then the Cubans left and the 
                         bullshitting was going on, Dave was 
                         drunk, really drunk and he starts in 
                         with Kennedy again.

                                     FERRIE
                         See, what Kennedy done, with him you 
                         should take a knife and stab and 
                         kill the fucker where he is now.  I 
                         mean it.  This is true.  But I tell 
                         you something.  I hope I get a week's 
                         notice.  I'll kill.  Right in the 
                         fuckin' White House.  Somebody's got 
                         to get rid of this fucker.

               Oswald looks up, listens quietly.

                                     O'KEEFE
                         Oh, c'mon, Dave, you're never gonna 
                         get that sonofabitch.

                                     FERRIE
                         No?  It won't be long, mark my words.  
                         That fucker'll get what's coming to 
                         him.  And it can be blamed on Castro.  
                         Then the whole country'll want to 
                         invade Cuba.  All we got to do is 
                         get Kennedy in the open.

               Bertrand with his arms around O'Keefe, laughs, tries to change 
               the subject.

                                     BERTRAND
                         David, David, always some harebrained 
                         scheme or another... Oh?  What do I 
                         see here?  Oooooh, let's have some 
                         more champagne, shall we!

                                     O'KEEFE
                              (interested in Ferrie's 
                              proposal)
                         What about the Secret Service, the 
                         cops?

                                     FERRIE
                              (pacing, hyper)
                         No problem if it's planned right.  
                         Look how close they got with de 
                         Gaulle.  Eisenhower was always riding 
                         around in an open top.  I know 
                         somebody who actually went up and 
                         touched Eisenhower once.  We need to 
                         have three mechanics at three 
                         different locations.  An office 
                         building with a high-powered rifle.  
                         Triangulation of crossfire is the 
                         key.  You get the diversionary shot 
                         gets the Secret Service looking one 
                         way - Boom!  You get the kill shot.  
                         The crucial thing is one man has to 
                         be sacrificed, then in the commotion 
                         of the crowd the job gets done and 
                         the others fly out of the country to 
                         someplace with no extradition.  I 
                         could do that myself.  I could fly 
                         to Mexico, and then Brazil.

               Oswald listens, playing with his rifle.  Bertrand suddenly 
               turns cold, flashing a look at Ferrie.

                                     BERTRAND
                         Why don't we drop this subject... 
                         it's one thing to engage in badinage 
                         with these youngsters, but this sort 
                         of thing could be so easily 
                         misunderstood.
                              (he squeezes Ferrie)

                                     FERRIE
                         Ouch!

                                     O'KEEFE (V.O.)
                         I didn't think much about it at the 
                         time.  Just bullshit, y'know, 
                         everybody likes to make themselves 
                         out to be something more than they 
                         are.  Specially in the homosexual 
                         underworld.  But then when they got 
                         him
                              (merging to the present)
                         I got real scared, y'know.  Real 
                         scared.  And that's when I got popped.

               BACK TO the prison work area.  Jim and O'Keefe continue 
               talking.

                                     JIM
                         Willie, are you willing to repeat 
                         your statements under sodium 
                         pentothal?  Under the supervision of 
                         a doctor?

                                     O'KEEFE
                         Fuck, yeah!  I told you so.  And you 
                         can tell'em all I told you so.

                                     JIM
                         You realize the things you're saying, 
                         Willie, are going to be attacked by 
                         a lot of different people.

                                     O'KEEFE
                         Bring on all the motherfuckers!  
                         Bring their college degrees in here!  
                         I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't 
                         buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't 
                         even need the parole.  This is about 
                         the truth coming out.  You're a 
                         goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you 
                         don't know shit, cause you never 
                         been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is 
                         here now, Facism is...

                                     JIM
                         No one's trying to buy you, Willie.  
                         It's important to know why you're 
                         telling us this.

                                     O'KEEFE
                              (pauses)
                         You wanna know why?  'Cause that 
                         mother fucker Kennedy stole that 
                         fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon 
                         was gonna be one of the great 
                         Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this 
                         fuckin' country.  Got niggers all 
                         over the fuckin' place asking for 
                         their rights, where do you think we 
                         got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause 
                         Kennedy promised 'em too damned much.  
                         Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming 
                         back.  I tell ya this - the day that 
                         Communist sumbitch died was a great 
                         day for this country.  I jes' hate 
                         to think they're blaming it on some 
                         silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know 
                         shit anyway.  People should know why 
                         that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he 
                         was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, 
                         go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn 
                         story, I'm proud of it, don't matter 
                         fuck all to me, things don't change.

               As he talks, Jim shares a sickened look with Bill.  Whatever 
               truth he may be telling is necessarily compromised by an 
               attitude that could be destroyed in court.

               GARRISON HOME - NIGHT(1967)

               Jim, Lou, Al, Susie, and Numa sit around the table having an 
               after hours conference.  The kids run in and out of the room, 
               playing.  Susie is doing the talking, showing new paperwork 
               and photos.

                                     SUSIE
                         Your hunch was right, boss, but it's 
                         even spookier than we thought.  
                         Starting in September '63 on, two 
                         months before the assassination, 
                         there are sightings of Oswald all 
                         over Dallas, buying ammunition, 
                         getting a telescopic sight fixed, 
                         going to rifle ranges... Early 
                         November, a Dallas downtown Lincoln-
                         Mercury dealership where he tells 
                         the salesman Albert Bogard...

               FLASHBACK TO the Lincoln-Mercury dealership.  Oswald is 
               deliberately kept in half or three quarter shots - a mystery 
               figure.  He kicks the tires on a used red Mercury Comet, 
               cocky.

                                         "OSWALD"

               Let's take it out for a test drive.

               The salesman, Bogard, is hesitant.  "Oswald" doesn't look 
               like he's got a dime to his name.

                                         "OSWALD"

                                     (SENSING BOGARD'S HESITANCY)
                         Hey, I got a lotta money coming in 
                         the next two weeks.

               In the next scene we see the car, driven by "Oswald", zooming 
               up the ramp and disappearing onto the freeway.

                         ...despite the fact he has no license 
                         and from what marina says, does not 
                         know how to drive, he hits the curves 
                         like Mario Andretti at the Indy 500.  
                         Bogard later told his boss he drove 
                         "like a madman."

               Resume the scene at the dealership.

                                     BOGARD
                         Three hundred bucks down, Mr. Oswald, 
                         you can drive outta here with it.

               "Oswald", unhappy, starts to leave.

                                     "OSWALD"
                         Who you kidding!  For this heap?  
                         Forget it...  No honest working man 
                         can afford a car anymore in the 
                         goddamn country!  Maybe I'll have to 
                         go back to Russia to buy a car...

                         A real moron.  He walks out.  The 
                         salesman remembers him as about 5'7", 
                         but we know from his draft card he 
                         was about 5'11"...

                         ...several witnesses see him on 
                         several separate days at different 
                         firing ranges.

               FLASHBACK TO a Dallas firing range in 1963.

                         ...one time, November 9, he decides

                         something really dumb to the guy,

                                     "OSWALD"
                         Hey, sorry, buddy.  I just thought 
                         it was that sonofabitch Kennedy, 
                         y'know.  I couldn't help myself.

                         ...about as subtle as a cockroach 
                         crawling across a white rug.

                         I'll go you one better, Lou.  He 
                         shows up at Silvia Odio's, a Cuban 
                         lady in Dallas working in the anti-
                         Castro underground - remember that 
                         name, a solid witness.  The two Cubans 
                         introduce him as "Leon Oswald".

               FLASHBACK TO the corridor of Silvia Odio's apartment in Dallas 
               on a night in 1963.  Oswald drags behind two Cubans - one is 
               "the Bull", heavyset with a scar over his left eye, who we 
               saw at the Canal Street incident, and the other, "the Indian", 
               is quiet and cold.  The men ring the doorbell and talk to a 
               concerned Silvia as Oswald hangs back, watching, in the 
               shadows.  The men give her intimate information about her 
               father, who is imprisoned in Cuba.  The men chatter ad lib 
               in Spanish.

                                     SUSIE
                         ...the Cubans want Silvia, whose 
                         parents are political prisoners in 
                         Cuba, to help them raise money to 
                         assassinate Castro.  Something about 
                         the men bothers her.  She tells them 
                         she doesn't want anything to do with 
                         violence... about 48 hours later one 
                         of the Cubans calls her back...

               We see a shot of Silvia on the phone in her apartment intercut 
               with a shot of "the Bull" in a gas station phone booth, on a 
               night in 1963.

                                     THE BULL
                              (on the phone, in 
                              Spanish)
                         This guy Leon Oswald's great, he's 
                         kinda nut...  he told us we don't 
                         any guts, us Cubans, cause Kennedy 
                         should've been whacked after the Bay 
                         of Pigs, and some Cubans should've 
                         done that, it's easy to do, he says -
                         you know he's a Marine, an expert 
                         shooter...

               Silvia Odio is surprised to hear this information volunteered.  
               "The Bull's" eyes are on "Oswaldo", outside the booth with 
               "the Indian".  They're hanging out, talking to a mystery 
               man, an Anglo.

                         It's like he's giving her information 
                         she doesn't even ask for.  She's 
                         scared, doesn't see them again till 
                         she sees Oswald's picture in the 
                         paper.  But the Warren Commission 
                         says she has bad eyesight because 
                         they have Oswald in Mexico at this 
                         time, trying to get back into Cuba.  
                         The Cubans think he's a double agent 
                         so they won't take him.  The CIA has 
                         a camera outside the Cuban Embassy 
                         and says this is Oswald in Mexico.
                              (hands over a picture)
                         You figure it.

               Jim looks at the famous photo... the camera closes in on a 
               heavyset man who looks nothing like Oswald.  Liz has come 
               back in and overhears.

                                     AL
                         If this is Oswald, it must be our 
                         third Oswald.

                         The interesting thing is the extent 
                         to which the Warren Commission went 
                         to make him a Communist.  They got 
                         almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of 
                         the report on this Mexico trip and 
                         the picture doesn't even match.  I'm 
                         beginning to think the point of the 
                         Mexican episode was to lay the blame 
                         at Castro's door.  If Oswald, or 
                         someone purporting to be Oswald, had 
                         gotten into Cuba, come back, then 
                         killed the President, the American 
                         public once again would've screamed 
                         for a Cuban invasion...

               Susie picks up the famous Life magazine cover shot of Oswald 
               holding a rifle in his backyard.

                         I even have doubts about this photo, 
                         boss.  It pretty much convicted Oswald 
                         in the public mind.  Well, according 
                         to Captain Fritz, Oswald told him 
                         during his interrogation the photo 
                         was fake.

               FLASHBACK TO the Dallas Homicide Office in 1963.  Oswald is 
               being interrogated by Will Fritz, Dallas Homicide Chief, who 
               shows him the original of the photo from the Williams garage.

                                     OSWALD
                         That's not me.

                         It came from Janet William's garage.

                         Well, I never saw that picture.  It 
                         is my face, but my face has been 
                         super-imposed - the rest of the 
                         picture is not me at all.  I've done 
                         a lot of photographic work, and that 
                         picture was made by someone else.

                                     FRITZ
                         So who the hell are you?  Alex Hidell 
                         or Oswald?

                                     OSWALD
                         Well, you're the policeman, you work 
                         it out.

                         Oswald, who worked for Jaggars-Chiles-
                         Stovall, did know spy photography 
                         pretty well.  I took this picture to 
                         two experts.  Look at the way the 
                         shadows on the nose fall in a straight 
                         line like it's high noon.  But the 
                         shadow here on the ground reads like 
                         late afternoon or early morning.  
                         It's not the same time.  Also look 
                         at the crop marks across the chin.  
                         It seems like his head is pasted on 
                         somebody else's body implicating him 
                         with this rifle and gun.

               We see a blowup of the photo - the shadows, the crop mark.

               Broussard walks past a jazz wake leaving the cemetery - black

                         ...now it gets positively spooky.  
                         In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, 
                         at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when 
                         the Oswald we know is in Russia - 
                         there is a man using the name "Oswald" 
                         to buy trucks for the Friends of 
                         Democratic Cuba.  The salesman never 
                         saw him again, but guess who's on 
                         the articles of incorporation of the 
                         Friends of Democratic Cuba?  Guy 
                         Banister.
                              (reactions from the 
                              others)
                         Banister has someone using the name 
                         "Oswald" to buy the trucks.  Hoover, 
                         at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 
                         1960, that there could be someone 
                         using Oswald's passport and identity.

                                     JIM
                         Goddamn!  They put Oswald together 
                         from Day One!  Like some dummy 
                         corporation in the Bahamas - you 
                         just move him around a board.  Sent 
                         him to Russia, in and out, no passport 
                         problems.  You got the word 
                         "microdots" in his notebook, you got 
                         the Minox camera and the electronic 
                         devices they find in his possessions, 
                         the sealed DIZ201 personnel file.  
                         For all we know, there could be a 
                         dozen Oswalds in different cities, 
                         countries - all of them leaving a 
                         trail of incriminating evidence that 
                         could easily be traced to a scapegoat 
                         after the assassination.  Does the 
                         real Oswald know he's been put 
                         together?  Who knows.  It doesn't 
                         matter, does it?  He's a low level 
                         spy, he doesn't know who he really 
                         works for...

                                     (PAUSE)
                         Let's call it a night.
                              (to Lou)
                         Anything new on Ruby?

               The staff members, anxious to go home, have all risen... and 
               now sigh.

                                     LOU
                         Mobbed up all the way.  Tight with 
                         the Dallas cops.  I'm digging, chief.  
                         I just need 10 more men and some 
                         more dollars.

                                     JIM
                         I know you do, Lou.  I'm doing three 
                         more lectures this month.  You're 
                         all doing an incredible job, Sue, 
                         Al, Numa.  But this is one where if 
                         you don't nail the other guy, you're 
                         dead.
                              (he pulls a book from 
                              the bookcase for Lou)
                         How did Jack Ruby dies so quick?  Of 
                         what?  Cancer, right?  A history of 
                         Nazi Germany, Lou.  They were studying 
                         viral cancers as a weapon in the 
                         30's.  We learned a lot more than 
                         you think from the Nazis.  Read this.  
                         Our biological warfare lab is in 
                         Fort Detrick, Maryland.  Close to 
                         where the National Cancer Institute 
                         is located.  Think about it.  Think 
                         the unthinkable - question everything.  

                                     NUMA
                         Even my own wife, chief,
                              (looking at his watch)
                         Who's wondering where I am?

                                     JIM
                              (looking at Liz)
                         Even your own wife, Numa.  Any of 
                         you want to quit, do me a favor... 
                         put us out of our misery.

               They all raise their hands as Bill walks in, excited.

                                     BILL
                         I fould Clay Bertrand.

               They all stop, look.

                                     SUSIE
                         Who?

                                     BILL
                         Grab your socks and pull... Clay 
                         Bertrand is Clay Shaw...

                                     SUSIE
                              (stunned)
                         No!... Shaw!  Director of The Trade 
                         Mart?  This is incredible.

                                     NUMA
                         Pillar of the community by day, gay 
                         bars at night.

               Liz Garrison is the most shaken, as she pours a fresh pot of 
               coffee.

                                     JIM
                         Can you get some sworn statements?

                                     BILL
                         That's gonna be tough.  Nobody's 
                         talking.

                                     JIM
                         I think we should have him in for a 
                         little talk.

                                     LIZ
                         Do you have any evidence against 
                         him, Jim?  Clay Shaw's done so much 
                         for the city with all that restoration 
                         in the Quarter.  He's well connected, 
                         all his friends, the money, people, 
                         be careful, Jim.

                                     JIM
                         It'll be off the record, honey.  
                         I'll bring him in on a Sunday.  A 
                         quiet little chat between gentlemen.

               Liz walks out of the room silent.  There is a tense pause.

               GARRISON'S LIVING ROOM - EASTER SUNDAY(1967)

               The TV is on to the latest Vietnam Reports - combat footage.

                                     NEWSMAN 10
                              (announcer)
                         In heavy fighting in Vietnam today, 
                         seven more American soldiers died 
                         and 23 were wounded.  The body count 
                         for this week now stands at 67 
                         Americans and 626 enemy soldiers 
                         killed in action.

               Liz plays with the kids looking for Easter eggs.  The dog is 
               barking - it's a scene of commotion.  Jim is getting ready 
               to go out.

                                     LIZ
                         Jim, come on, honey, get down on 
                         your hands and knees and hunt for 
                         Jasper's Easter egg.

                                     JIM
                         You know I don't like these tribal 
                         rituals, Freckle Face.  I'm 
                         interviewing Clay Shaw this morning.

                                     NEWSMAN 10
                              (as TV cuts to 
                              President Johnson)
                         President Johnson, meanwhile at an 
                         informal press conference, said he 
                         regretted that there is no end in 
                         sight to the war in Vietnam, where 
                         500,000 American troops are now 
                         fighting.  "We face more cost, more 
                         loss, and more agony."  In his 
                         proposal to raise taxes, Johnson...

                                     LIZ
                              (surprised)
                         But Jim, we're going to Antoine's 
                         with the kids - like we do every 
                         year.

                                     JIM
                         No.  I told you I was going to talk 
                         to Shaw.

                                     LIZ
                         But why in the Lord's name would you 
                         do it in the middle of Easter Sunday 
                         when you knew we were...

                                     JIM
                              (annoyed with her 
                              look)
                         Because when I scheduled it I didn't 
                         realize it was a holiday.  You were 
                         there, why didn't you say something?

                                     LIZ
                         Look at the calendar, for Christ's 
                         sake.  You said a Sunday, not Easter 
                         Sunday.

                                     JIM
                         I'm sorry, but it's important.  Clay 
                         Shaw is important.  I'm sorry.

                                     LIZ
                         You're missing most of your life, 
                         Jim, and you don't even know it.  
                         The kids are missing out too.
                              (harder)
                         It's not just you making the sacrifice 
                         here, honey.

                                     JIM
                         Look, I'll rush and be there by two, 
                         I promise.  Go ahead without me.

               As he leaves, the camera holds on Liz.

               GARRISON OFFICE - (1967)

               Clay Shaw ("Bertrand"), in an elegant white summer suit, is 
               shown in.  Indeed, there is a slight limp to his gait which 
               Jim notices right away.

               He shares a look with Bill.  Susie is also in the room.  
               Shaw's rich bassoon voice drips with dialect.  Imperiously 
               smoking a Gaulois, Shaw has about him an air of authority 
               matched only by Jim's.

                                     CLAY SHAW
                         Mr. Garrison - what can I do for you 
                         on Easter Sunday?

                                     JIM
                         I'm sorry, Mr. Shaw, to interrupt 
                         this holiday, but I feel this is a 
                         conversation we might better have 
                         out of the everyday bustle in this 
                         office...

                                     SHAW
                              (sitting)
                         I'm not sure I understand.

                         Well... in an investigation we're 
                         conducting your name has come up a 
                         number of times.

                         I wouldn't imagine where.

                                     JIM
                         We recently talked to a number of 
                         men who claim to know you.  Are you 
                         acquainted with a David Logan?

                                     SHAW
                         No.  Never heard of him.

                                     JIM
                         A Perry Russo?

                                     SHAW
                         No.

                                     JIM
                         A Willie O'Keefe?

                                     SHAW
                         No, I don't believe I know anyone by 
                         that name.

                                     JIM
                         Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at 
                         the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarter 
                         and several evenings later you had 
                         him over for dinner at your apartment 
                         on Dauphine Street.  Do you recall 
                         that?

               FLASHBACK TO Clay's Dauphine Street residence, in the Quarter, 
               at night in 1962.  The butler opens the door and O'Keefe is 
               admitted to the townhouse.  Shaw appears behind the butler.

                                     SHAW (V.O.)
                              (in present)
                         Of course not.  I don't know this 
                         man.  Obviously then, I wouldn't 
                         have him to dinner.  Incidentally, I 
                         do not live in an apartment.  It's 
                         an 1860's house built by Gallier.  
                         I've restored it faithfully.  You 
                         know I am quite an advocate of 
                         restoration.

               At Shaw's house, dinner is served at a long table by the 
               black butler.  The table is decorated by a sumptuous setting 
               of silver and candelabra.

               Shaw uses a bell to summon the butler.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Perhaps a few more details about the 
                         evening will refresh your memory.  
                         Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served 
                         by a uniformed waiter - a colored 
                         man.  He particularly remembers that 
                         you sat at one end and he at the 
                         other - which he found rather unusual 
                         because the table was so long.  Does 
                         that bring back memories of Willie 
                         O'Keefe?

                                     SHAW
                              (in present)
                         Not at all.  But on the other hand, 
                         I do have a lovely Chippendale dining 
                         table and I often have a friend over 
                         sitting at one end while I sit at 
                         the other.  That is precisely the 
                         point of a long dining table.  The 
                         splendor of the meal adds to the 
                         enjoyment of it.

                                     JIM
                         I would imagine a uniformed waiter 
                         helps.

                                     SHAW
                         It adds a taste of elegance for which 
                         I must confess a weakness for now 
                         and then.  I call him Smedley.  His 
                         real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I 
                         could hardly imagine anything more 
                         uncouth during dinner than my turning 
                         toward the kitchen and hollering 
                         "Frankie!" .. Where is this leading 
                         to, Mr. Garrison?

               Willie O'Keefe and Clay Shaw leave the dining table.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         After dinner you paid him to have 
                         sex with you.

                                     SHAW (V.O.)
                              (laughing)
                         Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The 
                         Quarter is filled with vivid 
                         imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - 
                         grimy young hoodlums who'll say and 
                         do anything.  As you well know.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         ...in the course of that night, Mr. 
                         O'Keefe said a man named David Ferrie 
                         stopped by the house... along with 
                         another young man...

               At Shaw's townhouse, we see Ferrie coming in, with another 
               young chicken.

                                     SHAW (V.O.)
                         Who?

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         David Ferrie.

                                     SHAW (V.O.)
                         No.  I have never known anyone by 
                         that name.  Of course never having 
                         met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have 
                         met Mr. Ferrie...

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         ...and that the four of you partied 
                         early into the morning hours...

               We see the four men in drag, smiling for the flash camera, 
               champagne bottles in hand.  Ferrie sniffs some poppers, then 
               shoves a popper in Shaw's face.

                                     FERRIE
                              (to Shaw)
                         You're mine, Mary.  Go get the fucking 
                         tools out, bitch.  Now!  I want some 
                         ass.

               Ferrie forces more poppers on Shaw.  The camera movies to 
               Shaw's bedroom, where Ferrie scatters a drawer full of leather 
               tools.

                                     FERRIE
                              (to Shaw)
                         Come here, bitch.
                              (Ferrie grabs Shaw by 
                              the hair)
                         You want this?  The only way you get 
                         this is do what I say.
                              (Ferrie whacks Shaw)
                         I'm the man.  Don't ever forget it.
                              (Shaw begs and whines)
                         You want it?  You want it?
                              (Ferrie spits on Shaw)
                         Fuck you and your rich friends.  
                         You're nothing but a rich whore!  
                         You're my woman!  Get the cat!
                              (to young man)
                         Strip!  Now, woman.  I want to see 
                         skin.

               BACK TO Garrison's office.

                                     JIM
                              (in present)

                              (he hands Shaw a

                                     SHAW
                              (in present)
                         No.  I'm sure I've never met anyone 
                         of such a bizarre appearance.

                                     JIM
                         Does the name Clay Bertrand mean 
                         anything to you?

                                     SHAW
                         Clay Bertrand?  Clay Bertrand?  I 
                         believe there was a man with a name 
                         similar to that who worked at the 
                         Chamber of Commerce.  Is that the 
                         man you had in mind?

                                     JIM
                         No, it was not.  Do you know an 
                         attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?

                                     SHAW
                         One meets so many attorneys in my 
                         business.  No, I don't believe I 
                         know Dean Andrews.

               Jim is getting incredibly irritated.  He feels Shaw is lying.

               CUT TO Antoine's Restaurant, where Liz and all five kids 
               look at menus.

                                     SNAPPER
                         I'm hungry!  When're we gonna eat!

                                     LIZ
                         We're going to start without him and 
                         he'll be here for dessert.  Snapper, 
                         you put that back!

                                     VIRGINIA
                         I want a Shirley Temple!

                         Me, too.

                                     JASPER
                              (disappointed)
                         When's Daddy coming, Mama?

                                     LIZ
                         Soon.  He's real sorry he can't start 
                         with us but he's promised to be here.

               BACK TO Garrison's office later that day.  Everyone looks 
               tired as the questioning goes on.  Shaw sucks on endless 
               Gauloises.

                                     JIM
                              (handing a photo to 
                              Shaw)
                         Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?

                                     SHAW
                         Naturally.
                              (he looks up)
                         Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that 
                         Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?

                                     JIM
                              (humorless)
                         Mr. Shaw, did you ever meet Lee Harvey 
                         Oswald?

                                     SHAW
                         You really have me consorting with a 
                         cast of sordid characters, don't 
                         you, Mr. Garrison.

                                     JIM
                         Please answer the question.

                                     SHAW
                         Of course not!  Such a pity, that 
                         assassination.  In fact, I admired 
                         President Kennedy.  A man with true 
                         panache, and a wife with impeccable 
                         taste.

               Jim shows Shaw a newspaper clipping.

                                     JIM
                         Mr. Shaw, this is an Italian newspaper 
                         article saying you were a member of 
                         the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale 
                         in Italy, that this company was a 
                         creature of the CIA for the transfer 
                         of funds in Italy for illegal 
                         political-espionage activities.  It 
                         says that this company was expelled 
                         from Italy for those activities.

                                     SHAW
                         I'm well aware of this asinine 
                         article.  And I am thinking very 
                         seriously of suing this rag of a 
                         newspaper.

                                     JIM
                         It says that this company has heavily 
                         Fascist ties to the French secret 
                         army organization that tried to 
                         assassinate de Gaulle in 1960.

                                     SHAW
                         Nonsense.  What next?

                                     JIM
                         ...and that this company is linked 
                         to the Schlumber tool company here 
                         in Houma, Louisiana - which is where 
                         their arms may have come from to 
                         David Ferrie and his Cubans...

                                     SHAW
                         Mr. Garrison, you're reaching.  I am 
                         an international businessman.  The 
                         Trade Mart which I founded is 
                         America's commercial pipeline to 
                         Latin America.  I trade everywhere.  
                         I am accused, as are all businessmen, 
                         of all things.  I somehow go about 
                         my business, make money, help society 
                         the best I can and try to promote 
                         free trade in this world.

                                     JIM
                         Mr. Shaw, have you ever been a 
                         contract agent with the Central 
                         Intelligence Agency?

               Shaw glares at him.  Silence.

                                     SHAW
                              (with powerful contempt)
                         And if I was, Mr. Garrison... do you 
                         think I would be here today... talking 
                         to somebody like you?

                                     JIM
                         No, people like you don't have to, I 
                         guess - people like you walk between 
                         the raindrops.

                                     SHAW
                              (rising)
                         May I go?  Regardless of what you 
                         may think of me, Mr. Garrison, I am 
                         a patriot first and foremost.

                                     JIM
                         I've spent half my life in the United 
                         States military serving and defending 
                         this great country, Mr. Shaw, and 
                         you're the first person I ever met 
                         who considered it an act of patriotism 
                         to kill his own president.

                                     SHAW
                         Now just a minute, sir!  You're way 
                         out of line!

               Susie and Bill quiet Jim down.

                                     BILL
                         Come on, chief.
                              (as he shows Shaw to 
                              the door)
                         I'm sorry, Mr. Shaw, it's getting 
                         late.  That's all the questions we 
                         have.  Thank you for your honesty 
                         and for coming in today.

                                     SHAW
                         I enjoyed meeting with you gentlemen, 
                         and you, Miss Cox.  It was most 
                         pleasant.  I wish to extend to each 
                         of you - and to each of your families - 
                         my best wishes for a happy Easter.
                              (he exits.)

                         "One may smile and smile and be a 
                         villain."  Goddammit!  We got one of 
                         'em!

               GARRISON'S HOME THAT NIGHT (1967)

               Jim walks in, contrite.  Liz is shutting down the house.  
               Some of the kids are still up.

                                     JASPER
                         Daddy!  Where have you been?

                                     JIM
                              (kisses Liz)
                         Hi, Freckle Face.

                                     LIZ
                              (seething)
                         Hi.

                                     JIM
                         Tough day.

                                     LIZ
                         My sympathies.

                                     JIM
                         Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting 
                         went much longer than expected.

                                     LIZ
                         We waited for you... hours, Jim.  
                         You could have telephoned, for God's 
                         sake.  It's Easter!  You promised, 
                         Jim.

                                     JIM
                         I don't know what to say except I'm 
                         sorry.  I just don't have rabbits on 
                         my mind.

                                     LIZ
                         I think you care more about John 
                         Kennedy than your family!  All day 
                         long the kids are asking, "Where's 
                         Daddy?"  What am I supposed to tell 
                         your kids, Jim!

                                     JIM
                         I don't know what to tell them.  How 
                         'bout the truth - I'm doing my job 
                         to make sure they can grow up in a 
                         country where justice won't be an 
                         arcane, vanished idea they read about 
                         in history books, like the dinosaurs 
                         or the lost continent of Atlantis.

                                     LIZ
                         That sounds dandy, but it doesn't 
                         replace a father and a husband on 
                         Easter Day.

                                     JIM
                              (angry, turns away)
                         It's going to get worse, honey.

               GARRISON'S OFFICE HALLWAY - MORNING(1967)

               Jim, is coming down the corridor with Broussard, is confronted 
               by some 20 local journalists and TV crew members.  We hear a 
               hubbub of fierce questioning - ad libs but Jim, puzzled, 
               brushes by, seeking refuge in his office.  Lou, Al, Numa and 
               Susie are all waiting for him.  The regular staff - some 30 
               people - are looking, wondering.  Lou presents him with the 
               front page of the New Orleans States-Item.

                                     LOU
                         Congratulations, Boss - you're page 
                         one!

               We see a close-up of the headline: "D.A. LAUNCHES FULL J.F.K. 
               DEATH PLOT PROBE - Mysterious Trips Cost Large Sums."

                              (striding into his 
                              office reading the

                         They went to the public records and

                         We didn't talk to Ruby 'cause of 
                         them and they're on our asses for a 
                         measly $8,000!

               Jim, at his desk, finishes reading the article.  A huge 
               picture of him is on the front page.  He puts down the paper, 
               reaching for a long, gold pen that is part of the desk set.

                         They hunted down the news, it's their 
                         business.  Getting angry doesn't 
                         accomplish a damned thing, but this 
                         changes everything.  We either pull 
                         out now or we go through some heavy 
                         flack together.

               They look at each other.

                         affect the rest of your careers,

                         There it is then.  Thank you.  It 
                         means very much to me.  I'm giving 
                         this office $6,000 from my National 
                         Guard savings so we can continue.  I

                         pick up additional money.  Some local 
                         businessmen are putting together a 
                         fund for us and...

                              (coming in)
                         Mr. Garrison, what shall I tell them?  
                         They're piling up outside the door.  
                         They want a statement, the phones 
                         are going crazier than bugs on a 
                         cake.

               Everyone waits.  Jim stands, repacks his briefcase with papers 
               and reference books and heads for the back door elevator.

                                     JIM
                         Neither confirm, deny, nor discuss,

                         I'm going home where I can get a 
                         decent day's work done.

               LOU IVON'S APARMTENT - NEW ORLEANS -(1967)

               Lou drinks a beer in front of the TV news in his small 
               bachelor apartment.  A fan is blowing.

                              (editorial)
                         Mr. Garrison's own silence on the 
                         subject has raised some interesting 
                         questions.  With taxpayer money has 
                         he uncovered some valuable new 
                         evidence or is he merely saving the 
                         information which will gain for him 
                         exposure on a national level?  Mr. 
                         Garrison it seems, should have some 
                         explanation.

               The phone rings and Ivon picks it up.

                         only straight shooter in that fuckin' 
                         office, I'd like an answer from you.  
                         Did you plant it?

                                     LOU
                         Dave, do you think we're out of our 
                         minds?  The whole building's been a 
                         zoo since that broke.  We can't get 
                         a thing done.  Reporters crawling 
                         everywhere.  You think we want that?

               We see Ferrie in a phone booth on the street outside his 
               apartment house in the French Quarter.  He's a nervous wreck, 
               watching the reporters and TV cameras surrounding his place, 
               waiting for him.

                                     FERRIE
                              (yelling)
                         Somebody planted that fucking story!  
                         And somebody tipped off the press 
                         I'm one of Garrison's fucking 
                         suspects.  I can't go home.
                         I'm out on the street.  The maggots 
                         are everywhere!  Do you know what 
                         you've done to me?  It's all over 
                         the national news now.  You know 
                         what you've done to me?

                                     LOU
                         Calm down, Dave, what?

                         I'm a dead man!  From here on, believe 
                         me, I'm a dead man.

                                     LOU
                         What are you talking about, Dave?  
                         You weren't mentioned in the story.  
                         Don't jump to conclusions.

                                     FERRIE
                         You think your investigation's been 
                         all that secret?  You know, when you 
                         talk to people, they talk to other 
                         people.

                                     LOU
                         What did they...

                                     FERRIE
                         You still questioning any Cubans?

                                     LOU
                         Dave, you know that's where this 
                         road leads.

                                     FERRIE
                         It leads farther than that.

                                     LOU
                         Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in 
                         the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 
                         minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved 
                         for you under an assumed name.

                                     FERRIE
                              (unsure)
                         The Fontainbleau?  20 minutes?

                                     LOU
                              (hopeful)
                         Yeah.  Come on, Dave, come on our 
                         side.  I guarantee you the boss'll 
                         protect you...
                              (there's a long silence 
                              as Ferrie, torn, 
                              agonizes)
                         Dave?

                                     FERRIE
                              (dreamy)
                         ...give me protection?

                                     LOU
                         Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He 
                         likes you.  Your mind.

                                     FERRIE
                         I got no place to sleep.  I'll meet 
                         you in 20 minutes.

               Ferrie hangs up.  Pause.  At his end, Lou Ivon hangs up, 
               excited.

               GARRISON'S HOME - NIGHT(1967)

               The phone rings.  Liz picks it up.  Jim is watching the TV 
               news:  Martin Luther King is delivering a speech against the 
               Vietnam War.

                                     KING
                              (on TV)
                         President Kennedy said on one 
                         occasion, "Mankind must put an end 
                         to war, or war will put an end to 
                         mankind."  I pray God that America 
                         will hear this before it's too late, 
                         because today we're fighting a war 
                         I'm convinced is one of the most 
                         unjust wars that has ever been fought 
                         in the history of the world.

                                     LIZ
                              (on the phone 
                              meanwhile, testy)
                         No, he's not here now.  And he would 
                         not take calls here if he were!  So 
                         please call the office number.  Thank 
                         you.
                              (hangs up)
                         Two of them even had the gall to 
                         come to the door this afternoon, one 
                         all the way from England.

                                     JIM
                         Did they live?

                                     LIZ
                         It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.

                                     JIM
                         Don't be.  Nothing to be scared about, 
                         honey, I been through four years of 
                         war - this is nothing.

               The phone rings again.

                                     KING
                              (on TV)
                         ...sending them 8,000 miles away to 
                         guarantee liberties in Southeast 
                         Asia which they have not found in 
                         Southwest Georgia or East Harlem.  
                         So we have been repeatedly faced 
                         with the cruel irony of watching 
                         Negro and white boys on TV screens 
                         as they kill and die for a nation 
                         that has been unable to seat them 
                         together in the same school.

                                     LIZ
                         I haven't, Jim.

                                     JIM
                         Nothing is going to happen to you.  
                         I won't let it.

                                     LIZ
                         Leave us ALONE for God's sake!
                              (recognizes the voice)
                         ...Oh, it's Lou.

               FONTAINBLEAU HOTEL SUITE - THAT NIGHT

               Jim and Lou watch as Ferrie paces wildly, speeding.

                                     FERRIE
                         I'm caught in the middle.  They're 
                         after me.  It's almost over.

                                     LOU
                         Listen, Dave, why don't we order 
                         some room service, have a bite, relax.  
                         I'll stay as long as you want.

                                     FERRIE
                         I don't know who to trust anymore.  
                         Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot 
                         coffee and a few packs of Camels.  
                         You got anything new in the 
                         investigation?

               As Lou picks up the phone and orders room service, Jim 
               answers.

                                     JIM
                         You mean about the Cubans getting 
                         trained north of the lake?

                                     FERRIE
                              (incoherent)
                         Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet 
                         project.  Getting paid by the 
                         government to work against the 
                         government.  Beautiful.  What a mind 
                         he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all 
                         those files.

                                     JIM
                         Who was paying you, Dave?

                                     FERRIE
                         You think I was a getaway pilot for 
                         the assassination, don't you?

                                     JIM
                         I don't know.  Were you?
                              (Dave laughs)
                         Who you scared of, Dave?

                                     FERRIE
                         Everybody!  The Agency.  The Mob.  
                         The Cubans.  Yeah, follow the Cubans.  
                         Check them out.  Here, in Dallas, 
                         Miami.  Check out a guy named Eladio 
                         del Valle.  My paymaster when I flew 
                         missions into Cuba - he's somewhere 
                         in Miami.  You're on the right track.

               Lou writes it down.  Seeing him writing makes Ferrie even 
               more paranoid.

                                     FERRIE
                         Hold it!  Hold it!  I'm not 
                         cooperating with anyone.  There's a 
                         death warrant for me, don't you get 
                         it?  Wait a minute.  You're not 
                         bugged, are you?

               He feels Lou for bugs, but out of a sense of hierarchy, 
               ignores Jim.  He checks around the room - the phone, behind 
               paintings, flower vase, light fixtures - as the batty 
               conversation continues:

                                     LOU
                         Dave, I always play square.  No bugs.  
                         I'd love you to go on the record, 
                         but I"m in no hurry.  Whenever you're 
                         ready.

                                     FERRIE
                              (checking the room)
                         I don't have much time.  They don't 
                         even need bugs anymore.  They got 
                         these fuckin' satellite waves.  They 
                         put a bug in a friend of mine when 
                         he was born, right up his nostrils, 
                         subcutaneous, between his eyes.  He 
                         was one of those products of a 
                         crossbreading experiment.  A Nazi 
                         rocket scientist father and a Commie 
                         spy mother.  You'd never believe 
                         half the shit the Agency does.
                              (holding his neck)
                         I'm so fuckin' tired.  Haven't slept 
                         since that shit article came out.  
                         Why'd you guys have to go and get me 
                         involved with this?

                                     LOU
                         Did we involve you, Dave, or did 
                         Clay Shaw?

                                     FERRIE
                         That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got 
                         me by the balls.

                                     LOU
                         What do you mean?

                                     FERRIE
                         Photographs - compromising stuff.  
                         And he'll use 'em.  The Agency plays 
                         for keeps...
                              (checks the room for 
                              bugs)
                         I knew Oswald.  He was in my Civil 
                         Air Patrol unit.  I taught him 
                         everything.  A "wanna be," y'know, 
                         nobody really liked him cause he was 
                         a snitch.  I treated him good.  He'd 
                         talk about his kid, y'know, really 
                         wanted her to grow up with a chance, 
                         but... He got a raw deal.  The Agency 
                         fucked him.  Just like they're gonna 
                         fuck me.

                                     JIM
                         Let me get this straight, now.  Clay 
                         Shaw is blackmailing you?

                                     FERRIE
                         Fuckin' A.  How do you think the 
                         Agency gets people to do their 
                         bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got 
                         on Oswald!

               Room service knocks, and Ferrie jumps and rushes to the 
               bathroom.

                                     FERRIE
                         Who is it?

                                     BELLHOP (V.O.)
                         Room service.

               Jim whispers something and Lou goes to the door, takes the 
               service table without letting the bellhop in.  Jim, excited 
               but trying to stay even, continues with Ferrie.

                                     JIM
                         Was it the same Oswald, Dave, that 
                         was in Dallas, or was it an 
                         impersonator.

                                     FERRIE
                         Same one.  I didn't know no 
                         impersonator.

               FLASHBACK TO Ferrie at the party with Oswald (obscured) per 
               Willie O'Keefe's witness.  Jim, in the present, doesn't feel 
               right about it.

                         Did you take a good look at the TV 
                         when they had Oswald?

                         Shit.  I'm so exhausted.  My neck is 
                         killing me.  I've got cancer.  Had 
                         it for years.  I been working with 
                         mice, y'know, trying to come up with 
                         a cure.

                                     JIM
                         Dave, can I just ask you this 
                         directly?  Did you ever work for the 
                         CIA?

                         fuckin' experience in ancient history.  
                         Man, you never leave the Agency.  
                         Once they got you, you're in for 
                         life.

                         Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in 
                         Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run 
                         guns to Castro when he was still on

                         Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then 
                         we tried to whack him.  Everybody's 
                         flipping sides all the time.  It's 
                         fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.

                         What about the mob, Dave?  How do 
                         they figure in this?

                         you dream.  FBI fucking hates the 
                         CIA.  Navy Intelligence got something

                         the bagman at Ruby's club.  I heard

                         Then who killed the President?

                                     FERRIE
                         Oh man, why don't you stop.  This is 
                         too fuckin' big for you!  Who did 
                         Kennedy?  It's a mystery wrapped in 
                         a riddle inside an enigma.  Even the 
                         shooters don't fuckin' know!  Don't 
                         you get it yet?  I can't be talking 
                         like this.  They're gonna kill me.  
                         I'm gonna die!
                              (he sits down, 
                              cracking, sobbing)
                         I don't know what happened.  All I 
                         wanted in the world was to be a 
                         Catholic priest - live in a monastery, 
                         study ancient Latin manuscripts, 
                         pray, serve God.  But I had this one 
                         terrible, fatal weakness.  They 
                         defrocked me.  And then I started to 
                         lose everything.

               He bows his head, holding it in his hands, and his wig starts 
               to come off in his hands.

                         Shit!  Forgot to glue this fuckin' 
                         rug today.  You know, at one time I 
                         even had a full head of hair like 
                         everyone else.  And then I lost that.  
                         That fuckin' Clay Shaw.  I hate the 
                         bastard.  All I got left is in his 
                         rotten, bloody hands.  He tipped the 
                         newspapers - I know it.  That's how 
                         the Agency works.  They use people, 
                         chew them up, spit 'em out.  Now 
                         it's my turn.

                         Dave, it's going to be okay.  Just 
                         talk to us on the record and we'll 
                         protect you.  I guarantee it.

               There's a long silence.  Ferrie, spent, stares at Jim.  He's 
               about to crack, but...

                                     FERRIE
                         They'll get to you, too - they'll 
                         destroy you... They're untouchable, 
                         man...

                         I'm so fucking exhausted I can't see 
                         straight.

                                     JIM
                         Get some rest, Dave, and you'll feel 
                         better in the morning.  We'll talk 
                         then.

                                     FERRIE
                         Yeah, yeah.  But leave me alone for 
                         awhile.  I got to make some calls.

               His eyes are going again.  Deals... intrigue - thru the tears.

                         Whatever you say, Dave.  I'll be 
                         home.  Okay?

               Lou and Jim share a look.

               CORRIDOR OF GARRISON'S OFFICE - A FEW DAYS LATER(1967)

               A mob scene.  Press from the U.S. and all over the world are 
               filling the corridor.  A French reporter tries to get past 
               the receptionist as Numa passes him with a stack of mail.  
               Also in the hall are many individual citizens who have come 
               to give tips and theories.  One of them is dressed as Satan 
               in a red jump suit with mask, horns, tail and a pitchfork.

               A mailman, black, comes through lugging three sacks of mail.

                         You know who killed the President?  
                         Mr. Garrison is busy but his 
                         assistant...

               A camera moves by into the interior offices.

               MONTAGE OF OFFICE SHOTS:

                                     BILL BROUSSARD'S OFFICE
                         A man with the demeanor of Julius 
                         Caesar walks into Bill's office.

                                     CAESAR

                         And you, too, my friend.

               Bill escorts him out before he gets the chance to sit down, 
               and then heads for Jim's office.

                                     JIM GARRISON'S OFFICE
                         Numa joins Jim with a stack of new 
                         mail.

                         Love a duck!  It takes twenty minutes 
                         to get into this office these days.  
                         Are we famous or what?

               Jim is reading Newsweek, deeply hurt.  There are newspapers 
               all over his desk.

                                     JIM
                         Notorious is more like it.  "Jim 
                         Garrison is right.  There has been a 
                         conspiracy in New Orleans - but it's 
                         a plot of Garrison's own making"... 
                         and this - "one of the D.A.'s 
                         investigators offered an unwilling 
                         witness $3000 if only he would fill 
                         in the facts of the alleged meeting 
                         to plot the death of the President"... 
                         How can they write that?  Where did 
                         they come up with this? ...

               Bill has come in during this, completely frazzled.

               Numa pulls a dollar bill from the envelope.

                         there's a hundred of these.

               Jim is moved.  Bill is not.

                         That's fine, Numa, but what about 
                         all the people who aren't writing 
                         letters.  They're sitting home reading 
                         all these lies.  I just heard NBC 
                         crew's in town to do a "White Paper" - 
                         not on the Kennedy killing, but on 
                         us.  One of their top guys, Harry 
                         Stoner, is talking to everybody he 
                         can find about you, boss...

                                     JIM
                         Oh Jesus, Stoner!... Why doesn't he 
                         call me?

                                     NUMA
                              (to Bill)
                         What do you want to do, Bill - fold 
                         up and close the store?  You sound 
                         like it.

                                     BILL
                         Look, this is bigger than all of us.  
                         We can't try a case in this 
                         atmosphere.

               Sharon has come in during this, signalling to Jim.

                                     SHARON
                         Mr. Miller's been waiting.

                                     JIM
                              (remembering)
                         Oh!  Send him in.
                              (to Numa)
                         Denver oilman wants to support the 
                         investigation.
                              (specifically to Bill)
                         Bill, I know what you're thinking, 
                         but sometimes when it makes no sense 
                         that's exactly when you just gotta 
                         stick to it, head down.

               Sharon shows in Mr. Miller, the Denver oilman.  He's a self-
               assured, impressive man in his 50's with a western accent, 
               cowboy boots and hat, and a well-cut gabardine suit.

                                     JIM
                         Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison.  
                         Would you care for some coffee?

                                     MILLER
                         Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your 
                         coffee's almost Turkish down here 
                         but I could get used to it.

               Numa leaves.  Bill indicates he'd like to sit in.  Jim nods 
               okay.  Miller pays no attention to Bill.

                                     MILLER
                         I'm glad you could find time to see 
                         me.  I flew down from Denver this 
                         morning on my private jet.

                                     JIM
                         Yes, your letter indicated you were 
                         in he oil business up there.

                                     MILLER
                         I've done quite well in Denver, Mr. 
                         Garrison, but I have to admire someone 
                         like you - and I have the means to 
                         back up what I say.

                                     JIM
                         We can use all the support we can 
                         get.  I think these might interest 
                         you.

               Jim has gathered together a group of photos of the shooting.  
               Sharon bringing the coffee.

                                     JIM
                         They've been enlarged and show a lot 
                         of detail...

                                     MILLER
                         Splendid, love to see them.

               He glances at the photo but continues on across the room, 
               looking at the pictures on the walls.

                                     MILLER
                         Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?

                                     JIM
                         Germany.

                                     MILLER
                         You were lucky.  I spent three years 
                         in the Pacific.
                              (he looks out the 
                              blinds at Tulane 
                              Avenue)
                         I've never seen an avenue with such 
                         a profusion of bail-bonding companies.  
                         Why is that?

                                     JIM
                              (nettled by Miller's 
                              moving around)
                         I imagine because this is the Criminal 
                         District Court Building
                              (showing a photo)
                         This is an enlargement of a potential 
                         shooter standing behind the picket 
                         fence.  We...

               We see a blurry blowup of something behind the picket fence.  
               Miller takes the photo, glances at it and sits down.

                                     MILLER
                         I know about that shot.  A terrible 
                         tragedy.
                              (Puts the photo back 
                              on the desk)
                         How much do you have for carrying on 
                         your investigation?

                                     JIM
                         If you must know, virtually nothing.

                                     MILLER
                         How many men are working with you on 
                         this?

                                     JIM
                         Less than you would guess.  Most 
                         days two to three assistant D.A.'s.  
                         A handful of police investigators.

                                     MILLER
                         That's all you've had all this time?

                                     JIM
                         That's it.

               Jim expectant of some help.  A pause.  Then:

                                     MILLER
                         I admire you, Mr. Garrison.  How did 
                         you manage to make your way into Guy 
                         Banister's operation?

               The clock is ticking.  Jim shares a look with Bill.  The 
               cards are on the table.

                                     JIM
                         That was never in he newspapers, Mr. 
                         Miller.

               Miller smiles, stands, paces the room.  He continues to ignore 
               Bill completely.

                                     MILLER
                         I'm going to be very frank with you.  
                         You've done a great job, an astounding 
                         job considering the limited resources 
                         available to you.  But the best you 
                         can ever hope for is to stir up a 
                         lot of confusion.  You're not going 
                         to do this country any good, and 
                         you're not going to do yourself any 
                         good.
                              (he sits back down 
                              and looks directly 
                              at Jim)
                         You don't belong here.  On this Mickey 
                         Mouse street with that cheap strip 
                         of bail bond shops.

                                     JIM
                         The job manages to keep me pretty 
                         busy.

                                     MILLER
                         Nonsense.  You should be in a job 
                         where you can make decisions that 
                         have impact, affect the world.  Here 
                         you're trying to climb up the steep 
                         side of Mount Everest.

               He leans forward across Jim's desk, tapping his manicured 
               index finger on the desk.  Clearly visible to Jim and to us 
               (in a close-up) is Miller's Annapolis ring tapping.

                                     MILLER
                         I propose you accept an appointment 
                         to the bench in Federal District 
                         Court and move into a job worthy of 
                         your talent.
                              (he leans back and 
                              pauses)
                         Do you have any idea, do you have 
                         any conception of how easily such an 
                         appointment can be arranged?

                                     JIM
                         And what would I have to do?

                                     MILLER
                         Stop your investigation... it was a 
                         magnificent effort but it's over and 
                         done with.  The press is already on 
                         your behind and that's only the 
                         beginning, my boy, only the beginning.

                                     JIM
                         How long do you think it would take 
                         me to be appointed?

               Jim's eyes go to Bill.  He could be wrong, but it's almost 
               as if Bill were going along with the idea now.

                                     MILLER
                              (smiling, thinking 
                              Jim is hooked)
                         Well, ordinarily these things take a 
                         long time.  But in your case, with 
                         your record it can be expedited - 
                         easily.  I guarantee it.

               Jim leans back, puts his feet up on the corner of the desk, 
               waving them like fans.  Bill waits.

                                     JIM
                         Who are you, Mr. Miller?
                              (no answer - just the 
                              sound of the overhead 
                              fan)
                         You see that helmet over there?
                              (the Nazi helmet with 
                              a bullet hole on his 
                              desk)
                         I picked that up at the Dachau 
                         concentration camp when we liberated 
                         it in 1945.  It was the most 
                         horrifying sight I've ever seen, Mr.  
                         Miller.  Pyramids of decaying, 
                         stinking bones and skin one on top 
                         of the other.  I don't enjoy looking 
                         at that swastika every day, Mr. 
                         Miller, but I keep it there to remind 
                         me of what can happen when a country 
                         turns from free democratic principles 
                         to Fascism, when a few madmen turn 
                         human beings into digits and millions 
                         sit in silence and do nothing about 
                         it.

               Miller waits.  Bill waits.  Jim comes forward with his reply.

                                     JIM
                         Mr. Miller, you and I have met under 
                         a great misunderstanding.  I haven't 
                         the remotest interest in becoming a 
                         Federal Judge.  And nothing is going 
                         to keep me from going ahead with my 
                         investigation of John Kennedy's 
                         murder.

               Miller's entire demeanor tightens into a corkscrew of anger 
               and danger.

                                     JIM
                         Bill, Mr. Miller and I have finished 
                         our conversation.  Would you show 
                         him out?

               Bill has a strange reaction - a sudden exhalation of breath 
               as if an entire house of cards were collapsing.  He rises, 
               but Miller goes first, leaving silently.  Once he's gone, 
               Bill turns wearily to Jim.

                                     JIM
                         Those bastards!  That's proof enough 
                         right there of what we're up against.  
                         The whole goddamn Federal Government, 
                         Bill!

                                     BILL
                         Well, they offered you the carrot, 
                         and you turned it down... you know 
                         what's coming next, don't you, boss?

               GARRISON'S CONFERENCE ROOM - ANOTHER DAY(1967)

               The staff is assembled.  We see the headline in the Times-
               Picayune, which says: "FERRIE CALLS GARRISON PROBE A WITCH 
               HUNT."

                                     LOU
                         Boss, I tell you something or somebody 
                         is putting tremendous heat on David 
                         Ferrie.  If we sit on our behinds 
                         any longer, I don't think the guy's 
                         going to hold on.

                                     SUSIE
                              (raps the newspaper)
                         Look at this bullshit!  He keeps 
                         changing what he says.  We can't 
                         possibly call him to a Grand Jury.

                                     JIM
                         Susie, watch the language, would you 
                         please.

                                     AL
                         My instinct is that Ferrie is going 
                         to keep on deteriorating, and we'll 
                         end up getting more out of him when 
                         he finally cracks.  If we call him 
                         now, he might freeze up and we could 
                         lose the best shot we've ever had.

                                     LOU
                         You don't get it, guys - he can't go 
                         down any further.  We got to protect 
                         him full time.

                                     JIM
                              (rises, looks at his 
                              watch)
                         I have a plane to catch... going to 
                         Washington.  An interesting lead, 
                         says he's closely connected to these 
                         events, but he won't come down here...  
                         I know what you're going through 
                         with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk 
                         tomorrow.

                                     LOU
                         I'm onto Ferrie's Cuban paymaster, 
                         Eladio del Valle, in Miami.  I gotta 
                         get him in, boss.  I need more men - 
                         I can't even pull the teams to watch 
                         Ferrie... This is our case!

               Numa rushes in with a young investigator, Williams - 
               displaying a miniature microphone.

                                     NUMA
                         HOLD IT, CHIEF...

                                     JIM
                              (to Lou)
                         You just need some sleep, Lou.  It 
                         won't look so bad when...

               Numa makes violent signals to shut up - not to talk - sticking 
               the microphone in front of Jim.  Williams searches the walls 
               for the bug.  Numa signals everyone outside.

                                     GARRISON'S MAIN OFFICE
                         The staff comes out into the office 
                         with Him, disturbed.

                                     JIM
                         What the hell is...

                                     NUMA
                         Williams found this in your office... 
                         We think the conference room is also 
                         bugged.  And maybe the phones.  The 
                         whole place needs debugging.

               The whole staff from the conference room reacts.  Jim looks 
               stunned.

                                     JIM
                         I don't believe it!

                                     SUSIE
                         Bugging the District Attorney's office 
                         of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!

               Sharon has been standing there trying to get Lou's attention.

                                     SHARON
                         It's urgent for you, Mr. Ivon.

               Lou goes to the phone.

                                     NUMA
                         Well, believe what you want, boss, 
                         but we got to be more careful.  All 
                         these new volunteers, any one of 
                         them could be...

                                     JIM
                         Okay, you handle it, Numa.  I don't 
                         have time for this nonsense.
                              (to the hidden mikes 
                              loudly)
                         We've obviously got the bastards 
                         worried now.  I'm going to Washington.

               Everyone laughs, but the camera goes to the look of shock on 
               Lou's face as he holds the receiver.  They all look over at 
               him; feeling the bad news before they hear it.

                                     LOU
                         Dave Ferrie's dead.  The body was 
                         found at his apartment two hours 
                         ago.

               Jim's look says "There goes the case."

               OUTSIDE FERRIE'S APARTMENT - FRENCH QUARTER(1967)

               Jim and his staff storm into the area, which is cordoned off 
               by police.

               Members of the press are all over, yelling questions at Jim.

                                     JIM
                              (to chief police 
                              officer)
                         This case is in our jurisdiction.  I 
                         don't want anyone from a Federal 
                         agency in here without an explicit 
                         Federal court order.  You got that, 
                         Hank?
                              (Hank looks at him 
                              weirdly)

                                     NEWSMAN 10
                         Was Ferrie murdered, Mr. Garrison?  
                         Do you have any leads?

               INSIDE FERRIE'S APARTMENT

               The apartment is filthy and sinister.  Hundreds of mice squeal 
               in their cages, upset by the invasion of men and light.  
               Nothing seems to have been washed in years.  There is an 
               accumulation of furniture, college pennants, photos of young 
               boys in training, books everywhere, ammunition, guns, a piano, 
               maps, fake college degrees on the walls.  Ferrie's naked 
               body lies on the couch with a sheet over it.  He is unwigged, 
               his eyebrows unpainted, false teeth next to him.  Jim studies 
               the corpse as the coroner comes alongside.

                                     JIM
                         What's it look like, Nick?

                                     CORONER
                         I don't see any violence, Jim.  Heart 
                         attack, maybe an aneurysm.  Looks 
                         like natural causes.

               Jim picks several empty, capless medicine bottles on a table 
               next to the sofa and looks at them.  Lou and Bill come over 
               with a typed suicide note.

                                     BILL
                         It's addressed to no one and no 
                         signature.  "To leave this life is, 
                         for me, a sweet prospect.  I find 
                         nothing in it that is desirable and 
                         on the other hand, everything that 
                         is loathsome."

                                     LOU
                         Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.

               The words from the note hang there weirdly, as Jim paces on 
               into the apartment, one of them medicine bottles in his hand.  
               The music grows, and a sinister feel of danger and death 
               pervades the atmosphere.  Then the sounds drop away.

                                     FERRIE'S BEDROOM
                         Jim hands Lou the medicine bottle.

                                     LOU
                         Proloid?

                                     JIM
                         I took it once for a low thyroid 
                         condition...
                              (he walks away)
                         It raises the metabolism, Lou.
                              (pause)
                         Did David Ferrie strike you as the 
                         kind of person who had a low 
                         metabolism?

                                     LOU
                         I'd say the opposite - hypertension.

               CLOSET IN FERRIE'S APARTMENT

               Jim runs an eye through Dave's closet, cluttered with shabby 
               jackets.

               His eye falls on a neat but faded lace and satin, some sort 
               of garment of priestly origin, he takes it in his hand.

                                     JIM
                         Ferrie was the only one to express 
                         some kind of remorse about this whole 
                         thing.  I think it got him killed.

               Susie Cox walks in, a new message written on her face.

                                     SUSIE
                         Boss, we just got bad news from Miami.  
                         They found Ferrie's Cuban friend - 
                         Eladio del Valle - this morning, 
                         hacked to death with a machete in 
                         his car.  He was tortured, shot in 
                         the heart at point-blank range and 
                         his skull was split open with an 
                         axe...

                                     LOU
                         Jesus - if that ain't the Devil's 
                         piss!  Those bastards!

               Jim's mood darkens, and he heads back into the living room 
               as Ferrie's corpse is being trundled out the door.  The 
               sickness is everywhere; an oppressive mood.  Bill comes up.

                                     BILL
                         Found another note, same thing, no 
                         name, no signature.  "When you receive 
                         this, I will be quite dead, so no 
                         answer will be possible.  I offered 
                         you love.  All I got in return in 
                         the end was a kick in the teeth."

                                     JIM
                         Jesus, they must've been hard pressed 
                         to come up with that one.

               Jim, feeling ill, wanting to leave, stops the coroner before 
               he exits...

                                     JIM
                              (gives the coroner 
                              the empty bottle)
                         Nick, what would happen if a man 
                         suffering from hypertension were to 
                         take an entire bottle of Proloid?

                                     CORONER
                         He'd die pretty quick, either a heart 
                         storm or a ruptured blood vessel in 
                         the brain.

                                     JIM
                         Can you ascertain if there's Proloid 
                         in his system?

                                     CORONER
                         Not in a routine autopsy, but if we 
                         looked at the spinal fluid, there 
                         might be a high level of iodine, but 
                         it's difficult to know.  Whatcha 
                         thinkin', Jim?

                                     JIM
                         Well, it doesn't make sense, Nick - 
                         he was afraid of dying, then he kills 
                         himself in a way that leaves no trace, 
                         but he leaves two unsigned suicide 
                         notes.

                                     CORONER
                              (shrugs, skeptical)
                         If it's a suicide, I seen weirder, 
                         Jim.
                              (exits)

                                     BILL
                         The fact is he's gone, chief, and 
                         so's our case.

                                     LOU
                         Not unless we go for Shaw now.

                                     BILL
                         With whose testimony?  Willie O'Keefe?  
                         A male prostitute.  Jack Martini?  A 
                         drunk?  Vernon Bundy?  A dope fiend.  
                         Shaw's got respect, the newspaper 
                         editors, the American Bar Association - 
                         they're not...

                         I'm afraid I'm with Bill on this 
                         one.  We haven't got the goods yet.

                                     LOU
                         We wait, Shaw's gonna get whacked.  
                         Oswald, Ruby, Ferrie, del Valle, 
                         Banister, Bowers...  how many corpses 
                         you lawyers gotta see to figure out 
                         what's going on?

                                     JIM
                         All right, all right.  Break it up.

                                     BILL
                         Where you going, boss?

                                     JIM
                         I don't know, Bill, I just don't 
                         know.

               OUTSIDE FERRIE'S APARTMENT THAT SAME NIGHT

               As Jim, questioned by reporters, gets in his car and leaves, 
               Bill waves goodbye to Lou and walks toward his own car, 
               dejected.  The area is cordoned off and humming with activity.  
               Frank, an FBI man who knows Bill from previous cases, 
               approaches him out of the crowd.  He wears a hat, suit, and 
               tie.

                                     FRANK
                         Bill.

                                     BILL
                         Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're 
                         wasting your time here.  Big Jim 
                         gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.

                                     FRANK
                         It's you I want to talk to, Bill.

                                     BILL
                              (laughs)
                         Boss would fry me in hog fat if he 
                         knew...
                              (motions to car)

                                     FRANK
                              (getting in the car)
                         Your boss got a serious problem, 
                         Bill.  Real serious.  We know what's 
                         been going on at your office

                                     BILL
                              (smiles)
                         Yeah, I guess you do.

                                     FRANK
                         You've got nothin', Bill.  I'm talking 
                         as a friend now.  You're riding on 
                         the Titanic.  Time to jump off before 
                         you get destroyed along with Garrison.

                                     BILL
                         Frank, I don't want to hear it.

                                     FRANK
                         Senator Long set your boss up, my 
                         friend.

               This gets Bill's attention.

                                     FRANK
                         Who do you think fed him that 
                         information?  Garrison's going down.  
                         We're talking your career here, Bill, 
                         your life.  You're a young guy... we 
                         know you're working that Castro thing.

                                     BILL
                         No, I'm not...

                                     FRANK
                         Yes, you are.  Look we know Oswald 
                         didn't pull that trigger.  Castro 
                         did.  But if that comes out, there's 
                         gonna be a war, boy - millions of 
                         people are gonna die.  That's a hell 
                         of a lot more important than Jim 
                         Garrison.
                              (suddenly)
                         Goddammit, look at me when I talk to 
                         you!  You're too goddamn self-
                         opinionated, now shut up.  If you 
                         got a brain in that thick skull of 
                         yours, listen to me.  Listen real 
                         hard.

               Bill, taken aback, listens.

               WASHINGTON D.C. - PARK(1967)

               Jim walks down from the Lincoln Memorial, where he is met 
               unobtrusively by a military man in his 50's in casual 
               clothing, hat on his head, an erect posture.  They walk 
               towards the Mall, with the Capitol building looming in the 
               background.

                                     X
                         Jim Garrison?

                                     JIM
                         Yes.

                                     X
                              (shakes hands)
                         I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about 
                         the precautions.

                                     JIM
                         Well, I just hope it was worth my 
                         while, Mr...

               The man doesn't answer.  Jim, after his meeting with Miller 
               and loss of Ferrie, is testy and suspicious.

                                     X
                         I could give you a false name, but I 
                         won't.  Just call me X.

                                     JIM
                         I've already been warned by the 
                         Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is 
                         another type of threat, I don't...

                                     X
                         I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison, 
                         and I assume if you've come this 
                         far, what I have to say interests 
                         you.  But I'm not going to name names, 
                         or tell you who or what I represent.  
                         Except to say - you're close, you're 
                         closer than you think...

               Something about his manner speaks of authority, knowledge, 
               and above all, old-fashioned honesty - the eyes looking at 
               you straight on.  He indicates a bench.

                                     X
                         Everything I'm going to tell you is 
                         classified top secret...
                              (significant look)
                         I was a soldier, Mr. Garrison.  Two 
                         wars.  I was one of those secret 
                         guys in the Pentagon that supplies 
                         the military hardware - the planes, 
                         bullets, rifles - for what we call 
                         "black operations" - "black ops", 
                         assassinations, coup d'etats, rigging 
                         elections, propoganda, psych warfare 
                         and so forth.  World War II - Rumania, 
                         Greece, Yugoslavia, I helped take 
                         the Nazi intelligence apparatus out 
                         to help us fight the Communists.  
                         Italy '48 stealing elections, France 
                         '49 breaking strikes - we overthrew 
                         Quirino in the Philippines, Arbenz 
                         in Guatemala, Mossadegh in Iran.  
                         Vietnam in '54, Indonesia '58, Tibet 
                         '59 we got the Dalai Lama out - we 
                         were good, very good.  Then we got 
                         into the Cuban thing.  Not so good.  
                         Set up all the bases for the invasion 
                         supposed to take place in October 
                         '62.  Khrushchev sent the missiles 
                         to resist the invasion, Kennedy 
                         refused to invade and we were standing 
                         out there with our dicks in the wind.  
                         Lot of pissed-off people, Mr.  
                         Garrison, you understand?  I'll come 
                         to that later... I spent much of 
                         September '63 working on the Kennedy 
                         plan for getting all U.S.  personnel 
                         out of Vietnam by the end of '65.  
                         This plan was one of the strongest 
                         and most important papers issued 
                         from the Kennedy White House.  Our 
                         first 1,000 troops were ordered home 
                         for Christmas.  Tensions were high.  
                         In November '63, one week after the 
                         murder of Vietnamese President Diem 
                         in Saigon, and two weeks before the 
                         assassination of our President...

               FLASHBACK TO the Pentagon offices in 1963.  X strides down a 
               busy hall and into the offices of one of his superiors, Major 
               General Y, a lean, cold warrior, battlefield handsome, 
               civilian clothes, and several advisors.  There's a U.S. flag 
               on the wall.  The status of Y is only clear by the sing on 
               the desk, the name blocked by a passing figure.

                                     X
                         ...a strange thing happened.  I was 
                         sent by my superior officer, call 
                         him Y, to the South Pole as the 
                         military escort for a group of 
                         international VIP's.  This trip had 
                         nothing to do with my nine years of 
                         work in Special Operations.  It was 
                         sort of a "paid vacation".

               We hear vague ad-lib mutterings on the soundtrack indicating 
               a friendly atmosphere, and we see stock footage of a C-130 
               transport flying to Antarctica and ice floes on the surface 
               of the sea.

               Then, at a New Zealand airport, we see X, in a uniform, at a 
               newsstand reading of Kennedy's assassination.  The banner 
               headline of an "Extra" edition of The Christchurch Star 
               screams out "KENNEDY SHOT DEAD."

                                     X
                         It wasn't until I was on my way back 
                         in New Zealand that I read of the 
                         President's murder.  That was 2 in 
                         the afternoon the next day New Zealand 
                         time, but already the papers had the 
                         entire history of an unknown 24-year-
                         old man, Oswald - a studio picture, 
                         detailed biographical data, Russian 
                         information - and were pretty sure 
                         of the fact he'd killed the President 
                         alone, although it took them four 
                         more hours to charge him with the 
                         murder in Texas.  It felt as if, 
                         well, a cover story was being put 
                         out like we would in a black op.

               Back at the Pentagon office, we see X returning and meeting 
               Y.  The atmosphere is cordial, but Y is slightly different 
               from before - more harried, more nervous.  He turns away to 
               light a cigarette, he doesn't want the usual conversation.

                                     X
                         Anyway, after I came back I asked 
                         myself why was I, the chief of special 
                         ops, selected to travel to the South 
                         Pole at that time to do a job that 
                         any number of others could have done?  
                         One of my routine duties if I had 
                         been in Washington would've been to 
                         arrange for additional security in 
                         Texas.  The Secret Service is 
                         relatively small, and by custom the 
                         military will augment them.  I checked 
                         it out when I got back and sure 
                         enough, I found out someone had told 
                         the 112th Military Intelligence Group 
                         at 4th Army Headquarters at Fort Sam 
                         Houston to "stand down" that day, 
                         over the protests of the unit 
                         Commander, a Colonel Reich...

               We see an outdoor shot of the Texas Army Headquarters on a 
               day in 1963.  Inside, on the same day, Col. Reich is on the 
               phone, puzzled.

                                     X
                         Now this is significant, because it 
                         is standard operating procedure, 
                         especially in a known hostile city 
                         like Dallas, to supplement the Secret 
                         Service.  Even if we had not allowed 
                         the bubbletop to be removed from the 
                         limousine, we'd've put at least 100 
                         to 200 agents on the sidewalks, 
                         without question!  There'd already 
                         been several attempts on de Gaulle's 
                         life in France.  Only a month before 
                         in Dallas UN Ambassador Adlai 
                         Stevenson had been spit on and hit.  
                         We'd have arrived days ahead of time, 
                         studied the route, checked all the 
                         buildings...
                         We never would've allowed all those 
                         wide-open empty windows overlooking 
                         Dealey... never...  We would have 
                         had our own snipers covering the 
                         area.  The moment a window went up 
                         they'd have been on the radio.  We 
                         would've been watching the crowds - 
                         packages, rolled up newspapers, a 
                         coat over an arm, never would have 
                         let a man open an umbrella along the 
                         way - Never would've allowed that 
                         limousine to slow down to 10 miles 
                         per hour, much less take that unusual 
                         curve at Houston and Elm.  You would 
                         have felt an Army presence in the 
                         streets that day, but none of this 
                         happened.  It was a violation of the 
                         most basic protection codes we have.  
                         And it is the best indication of a 
                         massive plot in Dallas.  Who could 
                         have best done that?  People in my 
                         business, Mr. Garrison.  People like 
                         my superior officer could've told 
                         Col. Reich, "Look - we have another 
                         unit coming from so and so providing 
                         security.  You'll stand down."  That 
                         day, in fact, there were some 
                         individual Army Intelligence people 
                         in Dallas and I'm still trying to 
                         figure out who and why.  But they 
                         weren't protecting the client.  One 
                         of them, by the way, was caught in 
                         the Book Depository after police 
                         sealed it off.

               In Dealey Plaza, 1963, we see an Army intelligence man taking 
               a shot with a Minolta camera.

                         Army Intell had a "Harvey Lee Oswald" 
                         on file, but all those files have 
                         been destroyed.  Many strange things 
                         were happening that day, and Lee 
                         Harvey Oswald had nothing to do with 
                         them.  We had the entire Cabinet on 
                         a trip to the Far East.  We had a 
                         third of a combat division returning 
                         from Germany in the air above the 
                         United States at the time of the 
                         shooting, and at 12:34 P.M., the 
                         entire telephone system went dead in 
                         Washington for a solid hour, and on 
                         the plane back to Washington, word 
                         was radioed from the White House 
                         Situation Room to Lyndon Johnson 
                         that one individual performed the 
                         assassination.  Does that sound like 
                         a bunch of coincidences to you, Mr. 
                         Garrison?  Not for one moment.  The 
                         cabinet was out of the country to 
                         get their perception out of the way.  
                         The troops were in the air for 
                         possible riot control.  The phones 
                         didn't work to keep the wrong stories 
                         from spreading if anything went wrong 
                         with the plan.  Nothing was left to 
                         chance.  I bet you there were even 
                         backup teams and cars on the other 
                         side of the underpass in the event 
                         that Kennedy got through wounded.  
                         They would have moved in with vehicles 
                         like they did with de Gaulle.  He 
                         could not be allowed to escape alive.

                         I never though things were the same 
                         after that.  Vietnam started for 
                         real.  There was an air of, I don't 
                         know, make-believe in the Pentagon 
                         and the CIA.  Those of us who'd been 
                         in secret ops since the beginning 
                         knew the Warren Commission was 
                         fiction, but there was something... 
                         deeper, uglier.  And I knew Allen 
                         Dulles very well.  I briefed him 
                         many a time in his house.  He was 
                         also General Y's benefactor.  But 
                         for the life of me I still can't 
                         figure out why Dulles was appointed 
                         to investigate Kennedy's death.  The 
                         man who had fired him.  I got out in 
                         '64.  I retired from the U.S. Air

                         I never realized Kennedy was so 
                         dangerous to the establishment.  Is 
                         that why?

                         That's the real question, isn't it - 
                         "Why?" - the "how" is just "scenery" 
                         for the suckers...  Oswald, Ruby,

                         like a parlor game, but it prevents 
                         them from asking the most important 
                         question - Why?  Why was Kennedy 
                         killed?  Who benefitted?  Who has 
                         the power to cover it up?... You 
                         know in '61 right after the Bay of 
                         Pigs - very few people know about 
                         this - I participated in drawing up 
                         National Security Action Memos 55, 
                         56, and 57.  These are crucial 
                         documents, classified top secret, 
                         but basically in them Kennedy 
                         instructs General Lemnitzer, Chairman 
                         of the Joint Chiefs, that from here 
                         on forward...

               FLASHBACK TO the Pentagon offices on a day in 1961.  A 
               document is moved by hand into Lemnitzer's office where we 
               see a set of hands holding it while it's read.  There's a 
               look of surprise on Lemnitzer's face.

                         be wholly responsible for all covert 
                         paramilitary action in peacetime.  
                         This basically ended the reign of 
                         the CIA - "splintered it", as J.F.K. 
                         promised he would, into a "thousand 
                         pieces", - and now was ordering the 
                         military to help.  This was 
                         unprecedented.  I can't tell you the 
                         shock waves this sent along the 
                         corridors of power in Washington.

                         Kennedy's directives were never really 
                         implemented, because of bureaucratic 
                         resistance, but one of the results 
                         was that the Cuban operation was 
                         turned over to my department as 
                         "Operation Mongoose", which meant 
                         that people like my superior officer, 
                         General Y, took over the Cuban 
                         personnel that were being trained to 
                         invade Cuba - and the bases like the 
                         training camp at Pontchartrain in 
                         your home state that were closed 
                         down by Kennedy... and that's how 
                         the "black ops" people, people like 
                         General Y, ended up taking the rules 
                         of covert warfare they'd used abroad 
                         and brought'em into this country.

                         assassinations.  Harvey was also

                         the First National Bank of Boston 
                         approached the CIA about developing

                         be spent before it ends.  In 1950 it 
                         was $13 billion.  No war, no money.  
                         Sometimes I think the organizing 
                         principle of any society is for war.  
                         The authority of the state over it's

                         Even Eisenhower - military hero of 
                         WWII - warned us about it: "beware 
                         the military - industrial complex", 
                         he said.  Kennedy wanted to end the 
                         Cold War in his second term.  He 
                         wanted to call of the moon race in 
                         favor of cooperation with the Soviets.  
                         He signed a treaty with the Soviets 
                         to ban nuclear testing, he refused 
                         to invade Cuba in '62, and he set 
                         out to withdraw from Vietnam.  But 
                         that all ended on November 22, 1963.

                         Security Memo 273, which essentially 
                         reversed Kennedy's new withdrawal 
                         policy and gave the green light to 
                         the covert operations against North 
                         Vietnam that provoked the Gulf of 
                         Tonkin incident.  In that document 
                         lay the Vietnam War.

               In the park with X, Jim is staggered by all this information.  
               X ceases walking and looks at Jim.

                                     JIM
                         I don't... I can't believe it.  They 
                         killed him because he wanted to change 
                         things.  In our time - in our country?

                                     X
                              (shrugging)
                         Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison.  
                         Politics is power, nothing more.  
                         But don't believe me.  Don't trust 
                         me.  Do your own work, your own 
                         thinking.

                                     JIM
                         The size of this is... beyond me.  
                         Testify?

                                     X
                         No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison.  
                         I'd be arrested and gagged, declared 
                         insane and hospitalized... maybe 
                         worse.  You, too.  I can only give 
                         you background, you got to find the 
                         foreground, the little things... 
                         Keep digging.  Y'know you're the 
                         only person to ever bring a trial in 
                         the murder of John Kennedy.  That's 
                         important - it's historic.

                                     JIM
                         I haven't yet.  I don't have much of 
                         a case.

                                     X
                              (rising to leave)
                         But you don't have a choice anymore.  
                         You've become a significant threat 
                         to the national security structure.  
                         They would've killed you already, 
                         but you got a lot of light on you.  
                         Instead, they're gonna destroy your 
                         credibility; they already have in 
                         many circles in this town.  You're 
                         some kinda ego-crazed southern 
                         caricature to many folks.  Be honest - 
                         the best chance you got is come up 
                         with a case, something, anything, 
                         make arrests, stir the shitstorm.  
                         You gotta hope to reach a point of 
                         critical mass where other people 
                         will come forward and the government 
                         will crack.  Remember, fundamentally 
                         people are suckers for the truth, 
                         and the truth is on your side, 'bubba.  
                         I hope you get a break...

               Jim watches this mystery man walking away.  The figure 
               vanishes in the Washington breeze.  Flags flap over some 
               distant memorial to some distant history of the Republic.  
               Jim rises, a decision made.

               EXTERIOR OF CLAY SHAW'S HOUSE - NEW ORLEANS(1967)

               Jim, Lou, Al, Numa and several policemen stand at the door 
               as Clay Shaw comes to it.

                                     LOU
                         Mr. Shaw, you're under arrest, charged 
                         with conspiracy and entering into an 
                         agreement with other persons for the 
                         specific purpose of committing the 
                         crime of murder of President John F. 
                         Kennedy in violation of...

               The voice dropping away as the devastated look on Shaw's 
               face spreads, sickly, undone, his arrogant public composure 
               gone, face now filled with terror, disbelief.

                                     LOU
                         ...we have a warrant to search the 
                         premises.

               The policemen take Shaw while the D.A. staff moves into the 
               carriage house past the butler, Frankie Jenkins.

                                     INSIDE SHAW'S HOUSE
                         In the bedroom, Numa points out to 
                         Jim the hooks screwed into the 
                         ceiling.  Al pulls out five whips, 
                         several lengths of chain, a black 
                         hood and matching black cape.  Dried 
                         blood is on one whip.

                                     NUMA
                         It's either a Mardi Gras outfit, or 
                         we got the Marquis de Sade here, 
                         chief.

                                     JIM
                         I don't care if he was doing it with 
                         giraffes in the zoo, Numa, it's none 
                         of our business.  Let's keep this 
                         side of it quiet, shall we?

                                     AL
                         When you're in a war, boss, you use 
                         every weapon you got.

                                     JIM
                         Not one word.  That's an order.

               NEW ORLEANS POLICE STATION

               Shaw is being fingerprinted.  He seems rattled.  Police 
               officers try to get the press under control.

                                     OFFICER
                         Name?  First, middle, last.

                         Clay Lavergne Shaw.

                                     SHAW
                         1313 Dauphine, New Orleans.

                         Clay Bertrand.

               Habighorst notes it as routinely as Shaw seems to have said 
               it, without thinking, possibly preoccupied by thoughts of 
               press people pushing in.

                                     OFFICER HABIGHORST

               MONTAGE - NEWSREEL MUSIC

               We see a shot of the exterior of the Justice Department in 
               1967.

               JUSTICE DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM

               The acting Attorney General speaks to the press.

                                     ATTORNEY GENERAL
                         Yes, Mr. Shaw was included in our 
                         investigation and there was no 
                         connection found at all between Shaw 
                         and the President's assassin.

               GARRISON'S OFFICE - CONFERENCE ROOM(1967)

               Jim confronts a packed room.  Bill is with him.

                                     JIM
                         If Mr. Shaw had no connection to the 
                         assassination, why did the FBI 
                         investigate him?  And why, if they 
                         did, is his name not mentioned once 
                         in the entire 26 volumes of the Warren 
                         Report, even it if is to clear his 
                         name?  I doubt this Attorney General 
                         would qualify for my staff.

               We see a shot of the Supreme Court building in Washington, 
               D.C. and then a corridor inside the building.  A Chief 
               Justice, looking gray and wise like Earl Warren, moves along 
               the corridor in his black robe delivering his verdict to the 
               press.

                                     CHIEF JUSTICE
                         No, I don't think so.  Mr. Garrison 
                         has presented absolutely nothing 
                         publicly to contradict our findings.  
                         As yet I have not heard one fact to 
                         refute the Commission determination 
                         that Lee Oswald was the lone killer.

               In his own office, Jim responds to Justice Warren.

                                     JIM
                         I congratulate Mr. Shaw.  Most 
                         witnesses have to wait for trial 
                         before they're allowed to produce 
                         sacred cows like the Chief Justice 
                         of the land as a character witness, 
                         who is of course not under oath and 
                         free from the laws of perjury.

                                     NEWSMAN 13
                         Mr. Garrison, if what you say is 
                         even partly true in this case, you 
                         realize you are damaging the 
                         credibility of our government, 
                         possibly destroying it?

                                     JIM
                         Let me ask you... is a government 
                         worth preserving when it lies to the 
                         people?  It has become a dangerous 
                         country, sir, when you can't trust 
                         anyone anymore, when you can't tell 
                         the truth.  I say let justice be 
                         done, though the heavens fall.

               It doesn't play with the press.  They shuffle off, quiet, 
               whispering.

               GARRISON'S HOUSE(1967)

               Liz and Jim watch, silently devastated, as the NBC "WHITE 
               PAPER" unfolds, attacking Jim.  They can do nothing.  Liz 
               leaves the room, upset.

               HOTEL SUITE - NEW ORLEANS(1967)

               Julia Ann Mercer, 28, looks at Jim with sincere eyes.  Her 
               husband, a prosperous Republican businessman, watches from 
               the corner.  Jim - along with Al - has her testimony in front 
               of him.

                                     JIM
                         In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, 
                         it says you were at Dealey Plaza two 
                         hours before the assassination but 
                         that...

                                     MERCER
                         Yes, it was about 11 in the morning.  
                         I was driving west on Elm Street 
                         toward the Triple Underpass, in a 
                         rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll 
                         never forget that day.

               FLASHBACK TO Dealey Plaza in 1963.  It's a normal scene - 
               cars, traffic, people starting to arrive for Kennedy's 
               appearance.  We catch a glimpse of Julia Ann Mercer, 23, 
               driving, then stopping traffic.

                                     MERCER
                         ...there was quite a bit of traffic 
                         and I was stopped alongside a green 
                         pickup truck.  It was very noticeable 
                         because it was blocking traffic and 
                         it was parked with two wheels on the 
                         curb.  When I saw the gun, I thought - 
                         the Secret Service is not very secret.

               She glances over at the man in the driver's seat.  It's Jack 
               Ruby, wearing a green jacket.  Then she sees a young white 
               man in his mid - 20's, in a gray jacket, brown pants, plaid 
               shirt and wool stocking hat, getting out of the passenger 
               side, going to the rear of the van, opening a tool compartment 
               and removing a package that looks like a rifle wrapped in 
               paper.  He walks up the embankment in the direction of the 
               picket fence.  Ruby looks over and stares at Julia Ann, who 
               turns away and notices three police officers standing near a 
               motorcycle on the overpass bridge.  Her eyes lock with Ruby's 
               a second time and as the traffic moves, she drives on.

                                     MERCER
                         The next morning, Saturday, I went 
                         to the FBI office and the agents 
                         showed me photographs...

               In the Dallas FBI office, Mercer sits at a table looking at 
               photos.  Two FBI agents stand near her showing her photos.  
               She shakes her head "no" several times, until they put a 
               shot of Jack Ruby in front of her.  She holds it up.

                                     MERCER
                         I picked out three pictures that 
                         looked generally like the driver of 
                         the truck and then...

                                     MERCER
                         That's the man.

                                     FBI AGENT
                              (to Second Agent)
                         Jack Ruby.

                                     SECOND AGENT
                         What about these others?  You said 
                         they might be him.

                                     MERCER
                         They look a little like him.  But 
                         no,
                              (holding up the Ruby 
                              photo)
                         I'm sure this is the man.

               Back in the present, Jim continues to question Mercer.

                                     JIM
                         You mean you identified him on 
                         Saturday, the day before Ruby shot 
                         Oswald?

                                     MERCER
                         That's right.  When I saw him on TV, 
                         I was shocked.  I said to my family, 
                         "that was the man I saw in the truck."

                                     JIM
                              (skeptical)
                         But you didn't seem nearly so sure 
                         in your statement to the Warren 
                         Commission.

                                     MERCER
                         That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison.  
                         You see, they've been altered.  My 
                         statements...

               Jim is silent.  Mercer picks up the report and finds the 
               pertinent paragraphs:

                                     MERCER
                         This says "Mercer could not identify 
                         any of the photographs as being 
                         identical with the person she had 
                         observed slouched over the wheel of 
                         a green Ford pickup truck."  That's 
                         not true.  I recognized him and I 
                         told them so... They also said it 
                         was a dark green air conditioning 
                         truck, which it was not.  And here...
                              (she goes to another 
                              report)
                         ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report.  
                         This is really strange.  See that 
                         notarized signature on the bottom of 
                         each page?  That's not my signature.  
                         And there never was any notary present 
                         during any of my questioning.
                              (she hands the papers 
                              back to Jim)
                         I guess that's all...

                                     JIM
                         Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, 
                         it's difficult to accept this.

                                     MERCER
                         I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is 
                         just not doing their job.

                                     HUSBAND
                         I'm a Republican, Mr. Garrison, and 
                         I don't go in for this kind of 
                         government bashing, but I must tell 
                         you something's not right when they 
                         don't even bother to call Julia in 
                         front of the Warren Commission.

                                     JIM
                         They didn't call a lot of people, 
                         Mr. Mercer.  I think it's safe to 
                         say the Warren Report is a work of 
                         fiction.

               DALLAS CLUB - NIGHT(1967)

               BEVERLY, a woman of ample proportions and a big, cute Texas 
               face, ex-club singer, meets with Jim and Lou Ivon in a 
               nightclub not unlike Ruby's Carousel.

                                     LOU
                         Beverly, tell Mr. Garrison about the 
                         Carousel club.

                                     BEVERLY (V.O.)
                         Oh yes, I used to go over there a 
                         lot to see Jack and especially my 
                         friend Jada who danced there.  It 
                         was the real swinging spot in town.  
                         Everybody came.  Businessmen, 
                         politicians from Austin, Lyndon 
                         Johnson's friends... Dallas was a 
                         slow town back then.  You chewed 
                         toothpicks, played dominos, spit and 
                         dated policemen.  But Jack's was 
                         exciting.  There were always cops 
                         there.  Jack liked 'em around, but 
                         he used to throw the drunks out 
                         himself, 'cause he was kinda a violent-
                         tempered man... it seemed everybody 
                         in those days knew Jack was with the 
                         Mob.  The cops were "bad" back then - 
                         they'd shake you down for the money 
                         in your pocket.  They put a lotta 
                         people in the cemetery, especially 
                         colored people.

                                     LOU
                         Beverly, what about Lee?

               Jada and Beverly sit down at the table with Ferrie, Oswald, 
               and Jack, with Jack doing the buying.  It's too loud to hear 
               anything.

                                     BEVERLY (V.O.)
                         Oh, yeah.  One time I came in, Jack 
                         introduces me to these two guys.  He 
                         said, "Beverly, this is my friend 
                         Lee..." and I didn't catch the other 
                         guy's name.  He was a weird-looking 
                         guy with those funny little eyebrows.  
                         The other guy, Lee, didn't make much 
                         of an impression either.  He wasn't 
                         good-looking or nuthin', he didn't 
                         look like he had any money, and he 
                         was in a bad mood, so I didn't pay 
                         him much mind.  Well, I might not 
                         remember a name, but I always remember 
                         a face.  When I saw him tow weeks 
                         later on the television, I screamed, 
                         "Oh, my God - that's him!  That's 
                         Jack's friend!"  I knew right then 
                         it had something to do with the 
                         Mafia... Well, about a week later, 
                         after she told the newspapers she'd 
                         met this guy Lee with Jack, Jada 
                         disappears off the face of the 
                         Earth...

               THE CAMERA MOVES IN ON JADA

                                     BEVERLY (V.O.)
                         Never knew what happened to her till 
                         Herman offered to sell me her 
                         wardrobe.  I said, "but Jada's coming 
                         back," and I remember the way he 
                         smiled... and I knew she was never 
                         coming back.

               BACK TO the 1967 scene.

                                     JIM
                         Will you testify,  Beverly?

                                     BEVERLY
                         I don't think so, sir.

                                     LOU
                         I thought when we came here, we had 
                         an agreement.

                                     BEVERLY
                         I just don't want to become another 
                         statistic like her.  If they can 
                         kill the President, do you think 
                         they're gonna think twice about a 
                         two-bit showgirl like me?

                                     LOU
                         We could call you in, Beverly.

                                     JIM
                         I know the pressure you're under, 
                         Beverly.  Don't think I don't.
                              (as he exits)
                         I understand.

               DISSOLVE TO DEALEY PLAZA(1967)

               Our view is from the roof of the building on the extreme 
               south side of the Plaza.  J.C. Price, the building engineer, 
               in hat and overalls, points for Jim and Lou.

                                     PRICE (V.O.)
                         ...yes, sir, right here on this spot.  
                         The shots came from near that wooden 
                         fence over there, near the overpass.

               The camera tightens on the picket fence.

                                     PRICE
                         I saw a man run from this spot and 
                         go behind the Book Depository - 30 
                         minutes later I gave this information 
                         to the Sheriff.

               On the overpass near Dealey Plaza, S.M. Holland, a tan, 
               elderly, leather-faced signal supervisor, points to the picket 
               fence for Jim and Lou.  His accent is thick and rural.  We 
               saw him before, briefly, when Jim was reading the Warren 
               Report.

                                     HOLLAND
                         I made it very clear to the Warren 
                         people one of the shots came from 
                         behind that picket fence.  I heard 
                         the report and saw the smoke come 
                         out about 6 or 8 feet above the 
                         ground, right out from under those 
                         trees.  There is no doubt whatsoever 
                         in my mind...

               FLASHBACK TO the restaged shooting.  The smoke hangs under 
               the trees.

               CUT TO Richard Dodd on the overpass.  He's a cowboy type 
               with a hat and an even thicker accent than Holland.

                                     DODD
                              (pointing)
                         ...we, all four of us, all railroad 
                         men, standing here, seen about the 
                         same thing.  The smoke came from 
                         behind the hedge - and a motorcycle 
                         policeman dropped his cycle in the 
                         street and run up the embankment...

               FLASHBACK to the motorcycle...

               BACK TO 1967.  Jim and Lou walk with Dodd and Holland near 
               the picket fence.  We feel the emptiness of the area now and 
               see the normal amount of traffic driving by.

                                     HOLLAND
                         ...we came around here to look for 
                         tracks.  It rained that morning and 
                         we found a bunch of cigarette butts.  
                         Someone'd been standing about here...

               The camera shows the "spot" and Lou sighting.

                                     LOU
                         This is a good spot, chief, for the 
                         head shot.

               Jim looks, reliving the moment.

               Later Jim and Lou stand on the south side of Elm Street in 
               Dealey Plaza talking to Jean Hill, an attractive, 30-ish 
               teacher.  Her demeanor has a rock-solid Texas back-country 
               conviction to it; she's a woman not easily frightened.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         I was standing here next to my friend 
                         Mary Mooman, who took the photograph 
                         when he was killed...

               We see a flash of the Moorman photograph - a blurry Polaroid 
               with the President in the foreground and the picket fence in 
               background.  We will return to this photograph in more detail 
               later.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         I jumped out in the street and yelled, 
                         "Hey Mr. President, look over here, 
                         we wanna take your picture."  He 
                         looked up and then shots rang out.  
                         Mary fell to the ground right away, 
                         shouting, "Get down, they're shooting, 
                         get down, they're shooting." I knew 
                         it but I was moving to get closer to 
                         him.  The driver had stopped - I 
                         don't know what was wrong with that 
                         driver.  And then, out of the corner 
                         of my eye, I saw this flash of light, 
                         in the bushes and that last shot... 
                         just ripped his head off, I mean, 
                         blood, brains, just blew everything...

               FLASHBACK TO the day of the shooting.  We hear the sound of 
               shots and see the Grassy Knoll from Jean's point of view.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         I looked up and saw smoke from the 
                         Knoll.  And everything was frozen - 
                         seemed like people wasn't even 
                         breathing, like you're looking at a 
                         picture - except this one guy.  I 
                         saw this one guy running from the 
                         Book Depository towards the railroad 
                         tracks.  And that was the same man I 
                         saw on TV two days later shooting 
                         Oswald.  That was Jack Ruby.  No 
                         question about it.

               Blurry image - we're not at all sure what or who or if... 
               but a seed is planted.  We see smoke - the same smoke Bowers 
               saw... then Jack Ruby in a brown coat running from the Book 
               Depository toward the railroad tracks.  Then we see Jean's 
               view as she runs toward the Knoll along with others.  there 
               are yells, shouts, and general confusion.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         It was him I was chasing up the Grassy 
                         Knoll, thinking our guys had shot 
                         back and maybe we got one of them.  
                         I don't know what I would have done 
                         if I had caught him, but I knew 
                         something terrible had happened and 
                         somebody had to do something.

               At the picket fence, we see blurry images of police officers, 
               railroad workers, cigarette butts, buddy footprints, 
               confusion...

                                     *JEAN HILL
                         I never did catch him.  All I saw in 
                         that parking area were railroad 
                         workers and Dallas' finest.

               Two Secret Service types approach her suddenly, and one of 
               them puts an arm on her shoulder.

                                     FIRST AGENT
                         Secret Service, ma'am.  You're coming 
                         with us.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         Oh no, I'm not.  I don't know you.  
                         We gotta catch this shooter - don't 
                         you realize?

                                     SECOND AGENT
                              (grabbing her other 
                              shoulder)
                         I said you're coming with us.  I 
                         want the pictures in your pocket.

                                     JEAN HILL (V.O.)
                         ...he put a hurt on me but good.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         I don't have any pictures!  I have 
                         to go back and find my friend Mary.  
                         Lemme alone!

               The two agents hustle her away.

                                     FIRST AGENT
                         Hush!  Just smile and keep walking.

               Hill, 32 years old that day, is shown into a third floor 
               office of the County Courts Building - which has a view of 
               the assassination area.  Other Secret Service agents are 
               there.  Some 18 people are detained there.

               TIME CUT TO two men interrogating Hill.

                                     JEAN HILL (V.O.)
                         These new people never identified 
                         themselves.  They musta been watching 
                         the whole thing 'cause they knew 
                         everything Mary and me had been doing 
                         that day.  I guess I wasn't too hard 
                         to find - wearing that red raincoat.

                                     MAN
                         How many shots you say you heard?

                                     JEAN HILL
                         Four to six.

                                     MAN
                         That's impossible.  You heard echoes 
                         ...echoes.  We have three bullets 
                         and three shots which came from the 
                         Book Depository and that's all we're 
                         willing to say.

                                     JEAN HILL (V.O.)
                         ...which is strange 'cause this is 
                         less than 20 minutes after the 
                         assassination.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         No, I saw a guy shooting from over 
                         there.  He was behind that fence.  
                         What are you going to do about it?

                                     MAN
                         We have that taken care of.  You 
                         only heard three shots and you are 
                         not to talk to anyone about this.  
                         No one, you hear?

                                     JEAN HILL (V.O.)
                         I was scared.  It was all kinda queer, 
                         but it sure felt like two and two 
                         was coming up three... and then they 
                         took Mary's five snapshots from me, 
                         sent them to Washington, and when 
                         they returned them weeks later, two 
                         of them had the backgrounds 
                         mutilated... The only one we saved 
                         was in Mary's camera.  I didn't want 
                         to go to Washington when the Warren 
                         Commission subpoenaed me... so the 
                         lawyer come down here and interviewed 
                         me at Parkland Hospital.

               In a Parkland Hospital office in 1964, a lawyer interviews 
               Jean Hill.  A female stenographer takes notes.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         He asked me why I thought I was in 
                         danger and I said:

                                     JEAN HILL
                         Well if they can kill the President, 
                         they can certainly get me.

                                     LAWYER
                         That doesn't make sense, Mrs. Hill.  
                         We have the man that killed the 
                         President.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         No, you don't!

                                     JEAN HILL
                         He kept trying to get me to change 
                         my story about the shots.  He was 
                         getting hot under the collar, and 
                         telling the woman not to write when 
                         he wanted.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         Look, do you want the truth, or just 
                         what you want me to say?

                                     LAWYER
                         I want the truth.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         The truth is that I heard between 
                         four and six shots.  I'm not going 
                         to lie for you.

                                     LAWYER
                         ...you heard echoes.

                                     JEAN HILL
                         No.  I had guns all my life.  I used 
                         to go turtle shooting.

                                     LAWYER
                         I realize you're under a great deal 
                         of stress .. it's clouded your 
                         judgement.

                                     JEAN HILL (V.O.)
                         So off the record, he starts talking 
                         about my family, and even mentioned 
                         my marriage was in trouble like I 
                         didn't know it or something.  He got 
                         angrier and angrier and then:

                                     LAWYER
                         Look, we can put you in a mental 
                         institution.  We can make you look 
                         crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and 
                         everybody knows how crazy she is.

                                     JEAN HILL (V.O.)
                         I knew something was crooked as a 
                         dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is 
                         just taking a deposition gets that 
                         involved and angry... sure enough, 
                         when I finally read my testimony as 
                         published by the Warren Commission, 
                         it was a fabrication from start to 
                         finish.

                                     JIM
                         Are you willing to testify, Mrs. 
                         Hill?

               Back at the Knoll.

                                     JEAN HILL
                              (without hesitation)
                         Damned right I would.  Somebody's 
                         got to tell the truth around here 
                         'cause the Government sure ain't 
                         doing it.

               DISSOLVE TO a scene inside the Texas School Book Depository 
               in 1967.  Jim and Lou walk the floor and look out the windows.  
               Lou has a Mannlicher-Carcano in his hand with a sight and 
               clip.  We see Oswald's supposed view of the limousine as he 
               pulls the trigger.  Now, innocuous traffic goes by, but the 
               iris of the camera tightens into a sniper's scope.

                                     LOU
                         The Zapruder film establishes 3 shots 
                         in 5.6 seconds.  Here.  I'm Oswald.  
                         Time me.

               Lou cocks the Mannlicher for the first shot.  Jim looks at 
               this watch.

               Lou assumes the Oswald pose, crouched at the window aiming 
               out.

                                     JIM
                         Go!

               Lou pulls, quickly recharges the bolt, fires, recycles, fires.

                                     LOU
                         Time?

                                     JIM
                         Between six and seven seconds.

                                     LOU
                         The key is the second and third shots 
                         came right on top of each other, and 
                         it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to 
                         recycle this thing.
                              (he recycles the bolt 
                              for firing)
                         The other problem is there was a 
                         tree right there...
                              (he points)
                         Blocking the first two shots at the 
                         time they occur in the Zapruder film.

                                     JIM
                         Didn't Hoover say something about 
                         that?  The leaves had fallen off in 
                         November?

                                     LOU
                         It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.
                              (he shakes his head)
                         It sheds it's leaves the first week 
                         of March.  You try to hit a moving 
                         target at 88 yards through heavy 
                         foliage with this cheap 13-dollar 
                         sucker, the world's worst shoulder 
                         weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two 
                         sets of tests and not one of their 
                         sharpshooters could match Oswald's 
                         performance.  Not one.  And Oswald 
                         was at best a medium shot.  The scope 
                         was defective on it, too.  I mean 
                         this is the whole essence of the 
                         case to me.  The guy couldn't do the 
                         shooting.  Nobody could.  And they

                         The Zapruder film is the proof they 
                         didn't count on, Lou.  We gotta get 
                         our hands on it.

                                     LOU
                         That means we gotta subpoena Time-
                         Life on it.

                              (looks out the window)
                         Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up 
                         Houston?  There's plenty of time - 
                         he's out in the open - a frontal 
                         shot?

               Jim points the Carcano south, right up Houston Street, 
               following a car that happens to be passing by - a convertible 
               with an unknown woman driving.

                                     LOU
                         I asked myself the same thing.  Common 
                         sense.  Even if you miss the first 
                         shot, if he accelerates you still 
                         got him for a second shot.  No... 
                         the only reason for waiting to get 
                         him on Elm is you got him in a 
                         triangulated crossfire.  You got him 
                         on a flat low trajectory from the 
                         front at the fence there.

               The camera swings to the Grassy Knoll and the picket fence 
               as seen from the sixth floor of the Depository.

                                     LOU
                         ...you put a third team there - in 
                         that building, on a low floor.

               The camera swings to the Daltex Building across the street.

                                     LOU
                         When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, 
                         it's a turkey shoot.

                                     JIM
                              (aiming)
                         How many men?

                                     LOU
                         One shooter.  One spotter on a radio.  
                         Maybe three teams.  I'd say these 
                         were professional riflemen, chief, 
                         serious people.  Hunters...  patient.  
                         It takes skill to kill with a rifle, 
                         that's why there's been no execution 
                         of an executive with one in 200 
                         years... "3-2-1...  green!"
                              (he taps Jim on the 
                              shoulder)
                         Or else "Abort!  Abort!"

               Jim pulls the dead trigger, reliving the moment through the 
               scope on a passing car.

                                     LOU
                         Main Street's over there - the 
                         original parade route on the way to 
                         the Trade Mart.  Too far right?  
                         Impossible shot.

               Jim swings the scope up to confront Main Street.  Another 
               car is in his sight.  Too far.

                                     LOU
                         So they changed the route to bring 
                         it this way.

               Moving at a normal 25 mph, they knew the motorcade would 
               have to slow to about 10 miles per hour to make this turn.  
               That's where you get him.

               The camera swings to the Houston and Main intersection.

                         route?

                         Service.  Dallas police.  They did a 
                         dry run with Chief Curry a few days 
                         before.  But they didn't bother 
                         running through Dealey.  They stopped 
                         right there, said something like, 
                         "and afterwards there's only the 
                         freeway," and went home.

                         General Charles Cabell.  Deputy 
                         Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy 
                         in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs 
                         fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, 
                         called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he 
                         came to New Orleans to address the 
                         Foreign Policy Association, you know

                         Head of the CIA since '53.  Kennedy 
                         fired them both.  Cabell was his 
                         deputy for nine years.

               Lou walks to another window in the empty Book Depository 
               where Oswald supposedly did his dirty deed and looks out 
               over the plaza, with all its ghosts.  Jim and Lou are two 
               men - with only two men's power.  A terrible aloneness 
               pervades their minds.

                                     JIM
                         Maybe we should just call it a day, 
                         Lou.  Go home.  While we're still a 
                         little behind.  We got two people 
                         killed, maybe more we never thought 
                         about.

                                     LOU
                         You never got anyone killed, boss.  
                         Their actions killed them years 
                         before.  If we stopped now, it'd be 
                         even more wrong.

               FLASHBACK TO 1963 - the sixth floor of the Texas School Book 
               Depository - the same place Jim and Lou are now.  Jim looks 
               around and sees one shooter and one spotter with a lunchbox 
               radio, in repairman clothes.  Jim is watching.  Neither of 
               these men is Oswald.  We hear the sounds of the motorcade 
               below.  The shooter pulls the trigger on the Carcano.  A 
               loud frightening sound snaps Jim back to the present.

                         lot of 'em!

               GARRISON'S OFFICE - 9 MONTHS LATER - 1968

               We see another smoke-filled conference of assistants.  
               Paperwork is stacked in the corners almost to the ceiling; 
               there are coffee cups and doughnuts on desks.  The 
               disorganization and lack of resources are apparent.  The 
               staff working on this project now numbers some eleven people, 
               and there are some new investigators and assistants.  We 
               sense that the trial is drawing closer.

                         voter registration drive.

                         liar.  Keep on it, Bill.

                         This is interesting - are you ready 
                         for this?  Oswald went to see the 
                         FBI two weeks before the 
                         assassination.  It seems Special 
                         Agent Hosty made three routine visits 
                         to his house, supposedly to keep an 
                         eye on Marina Oswald.

               FLASHBACK TO Dallas FBI Office in 1963.  Oswald is at the 
               counter addressing the female receptionist.

                         I want to see Special Agent Hosty.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         I'm sorry, he's not in.  Can someone 
                         else help you?

                                     OSWALD
                         Can I use a pen?

                         He left a note.  Hosty told a Dallas 
                         newspaperman it was a warning to him 
                         to stop questioning Marina at their 
                         home when Oswald was not present.  
                         She was not a citizen, so possibly 
                         he was threatening to deport her 
                         back to Russia.

               TIMECUT TO FBI James Hosty confronting his agitated superior, 
               FBI Agent Shanklin in one of his cubicles.

                         But what the note really said no one 
                         knows because his boss Shanklin told 
                         Hosty...

                                     SHANKLIN
                              (reading the note)
                         Oswald's dead now.  There's no trial.  
                         Get rid of it.  I don't even want 
                         this in the office.  Get rid of it, 
                         Hosty.
                              (he gives it back to 
                              Hosty)

                         Hosty tore it up and flushed it down 
                         the toilet.  Waggoner Carr, the 
                         Attorney  General of Texas, says he 
                         had evidence from the Dallas Sheriff's 
                         office that Oswald had been employed 
                         as an undercover informant for the 
                         FBI at a salary of $200 a month, 
                         beginning more than a year before 
                         the murder.

                              (in present)
                         This is just speculation, people, 
                         but what if the note was describing 
                         the assassination attempt on J.F.K.?
                              (the staff seem 
                              surprised by the 
                              thought)
                         Come on guys, think - that's the 
                         only reason to destroy it, because 
                         if it was any kind of threat, like 
                         Hosty said, they would've kept it 
                         'cause it makes their case against 
                         the "angry lone nut" stronger!  
                         Remember the New Orleans meeting 
                         with Agent Quigley the day he got 
                         busted?

               FLASHBACK TO Oswald, under arrest, meeting with Quigley.

                                     JIM
                         ...there again Quigley destroyed the 
                         notes of the meeting.  I think we 
                         can raise the possibility that Oswald 
                         not only was an informant but that 
                         he may well have been the original 
                         source for the telex we have dated 
                         November 17 warning of the Kennedy 
                         assassination in Dallas on November 
                         22.

                         William Walter, the night clerk on 
                         duty here in the FBI office, gave me 
                         a copy of this.  It went all over 
                         the country.  Nothing was done, and 
                         the motorcade went ahead on schedule - 
                         and this wasn't even mentioned in 
                         the Warren Report!  Read it, Al.

                         22-23.  Information received by the 
                         Bureau has determined that a militant 
                         revolutionary group may attempt to

                         proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, 
                         etc..."

               FLASHBACK TO New Orleans FBI office in 1963.  Walter, the 
               night clerk, receives the teletype, reads it, and runs it.

                         ...shortly after the assassination, 
                         Walter says, the telex was removed 
                         from all the files in all cities, as 
                         an obvious embarrassment to the 
                         Bureau.  I believe Oswald was sending 
                         information through Hosty...

               FLASHBACK TO a Dallas safe house in 1963.  Oswald, Ruby, and 
               several Cubans including the Bull and the Indian are talking.

                                     JIM
                         I have a hunch that from the get go, 
                         Oswald had infiltrated this group, 
                         probably Cubans or right-wing 
                         extremists.  He was at the Book 
                         Depository that day, told to be there 
                         by their handlers, either to prevent 
                         the assassination or to take part in 
                         it.  They coulda told him anything, 
                         either 1) they were going to close 
                         down the plotters that day, or 2) 
                         they were going to fake an attack on 
                         Kennedy to whip up public opinion 
                         against Russia or Cuba and reverse 
                         his policies - it doesn't really 
                         matter what they told him, 'cause he 
                         was under orders, he was a foot 
                         soldier.

               Underneath the voice-over we hear and see Oswald, with a 
               floor plan of the Book Depository, at the center of the group.  
               Jack Ruby, Bull, and the Indian, two or three young Cubans 
               and a young white shooter - the man in the plaid shirt 
               described by Julia Ann Mercer - are also there.

                         I can get you in and up there.  This 
                         is a shot out the southeast window 
                         of the sixth floor.  That floor will 
                         be unoccupied between noon and one.

                         I can close it off.  The only access 
                         is a stairwell.

                         We get them in as an air-conditioning 
                         unit.

                                     RUBY
                         No.  A floor refurbishing group.  
                         Got the van, the uniforms...

                         ...if we can get the motorcade to 
                         turn from Main onto Houston, that'll 
                         do the trick, 'cause it'll slow down 
                         to make the turn here.  You can't 
                         miss.

                         He's a dead duck.

               Ruby shares a look with Bull unbeknownst to Oswald, and then 
               we see the looks on the faces of Jim's team.

                         I don't buy it, chief - why would 
                         the FBI cover it up?  You're talking 
                         the whole FBI here.  A telex that 
                         disappears from every single FBI 
                         office in the country?

                         keep a secret in this room between

                         but as a covert operator in my book 
                         he's wide open for blackmail 'cause 
                         of his homosexuality.

                         Well, you're gonna lose!  We should 
                         be investigating all our Mafia leads 
                         here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, 
                         Santos Trafficante - I can buy that 
                         a hell of a lot easier than the 
                         Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows 
                         Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - 
                         Trafficante - Marcello, they hire 
                         some guns and they do Kennedy and 
                         maybe the Government doesn't want to 
                         open up a whole can o'worms there 
                         because it used the Mob to get to 
                         Castro.  Y'know, Castro being 
                         assassinated sounds pretty wild to 
                         John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the 
                         book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to 
                         me.

                         I don't doubt their involvement, 
                         Bill, but at a low level.  Could the 
                         Mob change the parade route, Bill, 
                         or eliminate the protection for the 
                         President?  Could the Mob send Oswald 
                         to Russia and get him back?  Could 
                         the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and 
                         the Dallas Police to make a mess of 
                         the investigation?  Could the Mob 
                         appoint the Warren Commission to 
                         cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck 
                         the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence 
                         the national media to go to sleep?  
                         And since when has the Mob used 
                         anything but .38's for hits, up close?  
                         The Mob wouldn't have the guts or 
                         the power for something of this 
                         magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, 
                         orders, times, schedules.  This was 
                         a military-style ambush from start 
                         to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon 
                         Johnson waiting in the wings.

                                     BILL
                         Oh, now you're saying Lyndon Johnson 
                         was involved?  The President of the 
                         United States?

               His voice is challenging.  There's a pause.  The men exchange 
               looks and wait.

                         I know this, Bill - Lyndon Johnson 
                         got $1 billion for his Texas friends, 
                         Brown and Root, to dredge Cam Ranh 
                         Bay for the military in Vietnam.  
                         That's just for openers.

                                     BILL
                         Boss, are you calling the President 
                         a murderer?

                                     JIM
                         If I'm so far from the truth, why is 
                         the FBI bugging our offices?  Why 
                         are our witnesses being bought off 
                         and murdered?  Why are Federal 
                         agencies blocking our extraditions 
                         and subpoenas when we were never 
                         blocked before?

                                     BILL
                         Maybe 'cause there's some rogue 
                         element in the Government!

               The others in the room groan at the reasoning.  Bill feels 
               embittered, cornered.

                                     JIM
                         With a full-blown conspiracy to cover 
                         it up?  Y'ever read your Shakespeare, 
                         Bill?

                         Senators.  All it takes is one Judas,

                         everything.

               GARRISON'S LIVING ROOM - (1968)

               It's after dinner and toys scattered around the living room.  
               Snapper is chasing his sister Elizabeth around.  Virginia, 
               6, runs to the ringing phone in the living room, as her mother 
               and Mattie, stunned, watch the news of Martin Luther King's 
               death on TV.

                                     MATTIE

                         Your daddy has entered you in a beauty 
                         contest.  Would you like to be in a

               CUT TO Jim's study, where Jim also watches the news in horror.  
               We see TV images of Martin Luther King on the motel balcony, 
               dead.

                         To repeat - 39-year-old Martin Luther 
                         King, who preached non-violence and 
                         won the Nobel Peace Prize, was cut 
                         down earlier today by a sniper's 
                         bullets while standing on the porch 
                         of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, 
                         Tennessee.  He was surrounded by his 
                         closest aides.  The police say they 
                         have no suspects at this time.  Mr. 
                         King...

               Jim, visibly shaken, slams his book down on the desk in 
               frustration.

                         sweetheart, nothing is going to 
                         happen.

                                     LIZ
                         How do you know?  How do you even 
                         know what goes on in this house 
                         anymore!  You're too busy making 
                         speeches, stirring up every crazed 
                         Klansman in Louisiana after us!

                                     JIM
                         Get a hold of yourself.

                                     LIZ
                         I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids 
                         and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it 
                         anymore.

               The kids, hearing the shouting, come to watch from the door 
               of the study.

                                     JIM
                         Honey, come on.  The government wants 
                         you to be scared.  They want everybody 
                         to be scared to speak out.  They 
                         count on it.  But there's nothing to 
                         be scared of.

                                     LIZ
                         You and your government!  What's the 
                         matter with you?  Don't you have any 
                         feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind 
                         of man are you?

               Jim controls himself, shoos the kids out, closes the door.

                                     JIM
                         I'll take them up to my mother's if 
                         it'll make you feel better.  Spend a 
                         week.  I'll change the locks, the 
                         phone lines, I'll even get a 
                         bodyguard, all right?  Elizabeth, 
                         get a hold of yourself.

                                     LIZ
                         Jim, before this Kennedy thing, 
                         nothing mattered to you in this life 
                         more than your children.  The other 
                         night Jasper tried to show you a 
                         drawing.  You didn't even notice he 
                         was there.  He came to me bawling 
                         his little eyes out.  Jim, he's 
                         sensitive - he needs more from you.

                                     JIM
                         I promise I'll make more time for 
                         Jasper.

                                     LIZ
                         Is it such a chore?  I don't 
                         understand you.

                                     JIM
                         Damn it, if I say I'll spend more 
                         time with him, I'll spend more time 
                         with him.  I can't fight you and the 
                         world too, Liz.

                                     LIZ
                         I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just 
                         trying to reach you.  You've changed.

                                     JIM
                         Of course, I've changed!  My eyes 
                         have opened, and once they're open, 
                         believe me, what used to look normal 
                         seems insane!  And now King.  Don't 
                         you think this has something to do 
                         with that?  Can't you see?

                                     LIZ
                              (she explodes)
                         I don't want to see, goddammit!  I'm 
                         tired.  I've had enough!  They say 
                         you don't have anything anyway!  
                         Everybody in town's talking.  You're 
                         ruining this man Shaw's life!  You're 
                         attacking him because he's homosexual!  
                         Going ahead with this stupid "trial"!  
                         Did you ever once stop and consider 
                         what he's going through?

                                     JIM
                              (astounded)
                         That's not why I'm attacking him!  
                         You don't believe me - all this time 
                         you never believed me.

                                     LIZ
                         Oh, I don't know anymore!  I believe 
                         there was a conspiracy, but not the 
                         government.  I just want to raise 
                         our children and live a normal life!  
                         I want my life back!

               The children press in at the door.  Mattie, ignoring them, 
               is enraged as she watches King's eulogy on TV.  Riots are 
               already breaking out.

                                     JIM
                         Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I!  
                         I had a life too, y'know - I had a 
                         life, too.  But you just can't bury 
                         your head in the sand like some 
                         ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's 
                         not just about you - and your well-
                         being and your two cars and your 
                         kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes 
                         fine honey."  While our kids grow up 
                         into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm 
                         not "fine" about that, I'm angry.  
                         My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours 
                         is, too!  And if you don't want to 
                         support me I can understand that but 
                         don't you go start making threats of 
                         taking the children away.

                                     LIZ
                         You never talked to me this way 
                         before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making 
                         any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm 
                         taking the kids to my mother's.  I 
                         am - I am.

               She runs out, past the stunned kids, sobbing as she goes up 
               the stairs.  Jim pursues her like an angry spirit, yelling 
               up the stairs at her.

                                     JIM
                         Go on then, get out!  Go hide 
                         someplace.  Join the rest of them!  
                         They'll tell you I'm crazy.  You got 
                         plenty of people'll tell you Jim 
                         Garrison's crazy.  You won't have a 
                         problem filing your divorce papers 
                         on me ...somebody's got to try, 
                         goddammit, somebody!

               The kids move away, fearful.  Quaking with rage and hurt, 
               Jim stands there at the bottom of the stairs, strangled with 
               pain.  He takes a law dictionary in his hand and throws it 
               across the room.  Jasper and Virginia come over to him.

                                     JASPER
                         Are we going away, Daddy?

                                     JIM
                         Well, it looks like it, Jasper.

                                     JASPER
                         Because of Kennedy?
                              (a beat.  Jim doesn't 
                              answer)
                         Are the same people gonna kill us, 
                         Daddy?

                                     JIM
                         No, Jasper, nobody's gonna kill us.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         Do you love us?

                                     JIM
                         Yes, of course I do, honey.

                                     VIRGINIA
                         No.  I mean like mommy loves us.  
                         She really loves us.

                                     JASPER
                         I'm scared.

                                     JIM
                              (bending down)
                         There's nothing wrong with feeling a 
                         little scared, Jasper, Virginia.  
                         Telling the truth can be a scary 
                         thing.  It scared President Kennedy, 
                         but he was a brave man.  If you let 
                         yourself be too scared, then you let 
                         the bad guys take over the country, 
                         don't you - and then everybody gets 
                         scared.

                                     JASPER/VIRGINIA
                         Stay with Mom, Daddy... please.

               JERRY JOHNSON SHOW - (1968)

               The band strikes up "When the Saints Go Marching In" 
               introducing Jim, who strides in from the wings to shake hands 
               with Jerry Johnson, the friendly-looking host.

                                     SIDEKICK
                         And now, Jerry, here's Big Jim 
                         Garrison, District Attorney of New 
                         Orleans, Louisiana.

               The audience is enthusiastic.  Jim smiles and waves, then 
               sits down next to Johnson.

                                     JOHNSON
                         Welcome, District Attorney Garrison.  
                         May I call you Jim?

                                     JIM
                         I've been called everything under 
                         the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever 
                         you like.

               He reads from a script on the desk.

                                     JOHNSON
                         First we had your charge that the 
                         Cuban exiles killed the President, 
                         then the Mob, then you said the oil 
                         billionaires did it, then you said 
                         the Minutemen and the Ku Klux Klan 
                         collaborated to do it, now your latest 
                         theory seems to be that the CIA and 
                         the FBI and the Pentagon and the 
                         White House all combined in some 
                         elaborate conspiracy to kill John 
                         Kennedy.  Let me ask you, is there 
                         anyone besides Lee Harvey Oswald who 
                         you think did not conspire to kill 
                         the President?

               He fixes his eyes on Jim, waiting for a reply.  A weariness 
               has set in on Jim.  Once more into the slaughter.

                                     JIM
                         How many hours do I have to answer 
                         that one?  Well let's just say this, 
                         Jerry - I've stopped beating my wife.
                              (the audience laughs)
                         Or maybe you should ask Lyndon 
                         Johnson.  We know he has some answers.

               The audience, loving it, cheers.  Johnson looks at Jim 
               blankly, and reads the next question on his list.

                                     JOHNSON
                         There have been a number of reports 
                         in reputable news media - Time, 
                         Newsweek, our own NBC - that you 
                         have gone way beyond the legal means 
                         available to a prosecutor, that you've 
                         intimidated and drugged witnesses, 
                         bribed them, urged them to commit 
                         perjury.  What is your response?

                                     JIM
                         Your faith in the veracity of the 
                         major media is touching, Jerry.  It 
                         indicates that the Age of Innocence 
                         is not yet over.  But seriously, 
                         Jerry, people aren't interested in 
                         Jim Garrison - they want the hard 
                         evidence!  They want to know why he 
                         was killed and what forces were 
                         opposed to...

                                     JOHNSON
                              (interrupting)
                         Some people would say you're paranoid.

                         Well, if I am, why is the Government 
                         concealing evidence?

                                     JOHNSON
                         Are they?  Why would they?

                                     JIM
                              (pulling out his 
                              briefcase)
                         That's exactly my question, Jerry.  
                         Maybe I'd better show you some 
                         pictures so you can begin to 
                         understand what I am talking about.

               He pulls out a large blowup of the Allen photo of the three 
               hoboes and starts to hold it up in front of the camera.

                                     JIM
                         These arrests were photographed 
                         minutes after the assassination, and 
                         were never shown to the American 
                         public.  They show...

               It takes Johnson a few moments to realize what's happening.  
               When he does, he lunges like a cobra for the photographs, 
               pulling Jim's arm down so the pictures are out of the camera's 
               view.

                                     JOHNSON
                              (sharply)
                         Pictures like this don't show up on 
                         television!

                                     JIM
                              (holding the picture 
                              up again)
                         Sure they do.  The camera can pick 
                         this up.

                                     JOHNSON
                              (yanking his arm down)
                         No, it can't!

               Jim swings the picture up a third time, but the stage director 
               gives a "cut" signal - finger across the throat - and the 
               red light on the camera blinks off.  The monitor shows another 
               camera panning the audience.

                                     JIM
                              (quickly realizes 
                              he's about to be cut 
                              off)
                         Those men you just saw were arrested 
                         in Dallas minutes after the 
                         assassination.  They were never seen 
                         again.  No record of arrest, no 
                         fingerprint, no mugshot, nothing.  
                         They all got away.

               The director frantically gives Johnson the "cut" sign.

                                     JOHNSON
                         We'll be back after these messages.

               The audience cheers as the commercial comes on.

               GARRISON'S HOME - (1968)

               Jim comes home.  His wife and two of the children are waiting 
               in the doorway.  They kiss.  Al Oser interrupts.

                                     AL
                         Jim, bad news.  Bill's turned, boss.  
                         I think he's given everything we've 
                         got to the Feds.

                         We studied the memos - there was 
                         nothing there, chief, nothing!  When 
                         we went to confront him, the landlady 
                         said that sonofabitch just took off, 
                         left everything.

                         I know.

                              (to Jim)
                         I'm sorry.

                         Something sure scared him.

                                     JIM
                         Bill doesn't scare that easy.  
                         Somebody got to his thinking.  He 
                         was never that good a thinker.

               On the TV, the news is on.

                                     NEWSMAN 9
                         Much is at stake tonight in 
                         California.  Public opinion polls 
                         show Senator Robert Kennedy of New 
                         York leading Senator Eugene McCarthy 
                         of Minnesota.  Their anti-Vietnam 
                         War message is obviously striking a 
                         chord with the voters, and whoever 
                         wins tonight will certainly emerge 
                         as the favorite over Vice-President 
                         Humphrey to win the nomination in 
                         Chicago in August.  That man now 
                         seems to be Senator Kennedy.

               We see a shot of Robert Kennedy in Los Angeles with his 
               supporters.

                                     NUMA
                         Sure sounds like he's winning.

                                     JIM
                         He'll never make it.  If he wins, 
                         they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge 
                         his brother.  He'll stop that war.  
                         No, they'll kill him before they let 
                         him become President.

               Liz shares a look with Al and Numa.

                                     AL
                         Boss, with Broussard they have 
                         everything.  All our witnesses, our 
                         strategy for the trial.  We'd have 
                         to doublecheck all his work, there 
                         could be false leads... we gotta 
                         rethink this trial.

               We don't have a choice.

                                     JIM
                         I don't think so, Al.  You remember 
                         the Hemingway story, "The Old Man 
                         and the Sea"?
                              (Al nods)
                         The old fisherman manages to catch 
                         this great fish - a fish so huge he 
                         has to tie it to the side of the 
                         boat to get it back in.  But by the 
                         time he reached shore, the fish had 
                         long since been picked apart by sharks 
                         and nothing was left but the skeleton.

                         Then what are we going through all 
                         this trouble for?

                                     JIM
                         It's a means to an end.  This war 
                         has two fronts - in the court of 
                         law, we hope, against the odds, to 
                         nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge.  
                         In the court of public opinion, it 
                         could take another 25 or 30 years 
                         for the truth to come out, but at 
                         least we're going to strike the first 
                         blow.

                                     LIZ
                         And if you're wrong?

                              (rising)
                         I never doubted for a second that I 
                         was.

                         I don't think so, Jim...

               She walks out.

               We see the outside of Jim's house and hear crickets chirping - 
               the purr of the suburb.  Inside, the TV election results are 
               still on.

                                     NEWSMAN 1
                         With 53% of the precincts reporting, 
                         Senator Kennedy continues to hold a 
                         lead of 48% to 41% over Senator 
                         McCarthy.  CBS News has projected 
                         Senator Robert Kennedy the winner of 
                         the crucial California primary.

               Jim is in the kitchen fixing himself a sandwich.  There's a 
               strange feeling in the house.  We hear the wind - a shutter 
               sighing.  Jim suddenly doesn't feel alone in the kitchen.

                                     ROBERT KENNEDY
                              (voice over on TV)
                         ...and that is what has been going 
                         on within the United States over the 
                         last three years - the division, the 
                         violence, the disenchantment, whether 
                         it's between blacks and whites, 
                         between poor and the more affluent, 
                         or between age groups or the war in 
                         Vietnam - we can start to work 
                         together.  We are a great country, 
                         an unselfish country and a 
                         compassionate country.  I intend to 
                         make that my basis for running.

               He waves and leaves the podium, going back through the kitchen 
               of the hotel.  Jim is frozen in his spot, shaken.  The ghost 
               of Jack Kennedy - as he was before the killing - stares at 
               him through the kitchen, as if encased in a hologram.  The 
               hooded eyes watch Jim without expression.  They're 
               communicating, in some strange subliminal way.  Suddenly 
               shots ring out from the television and there's pandemonium.

                              (shaken)
                         SENATOR KENNEDY HAS BEEN SHOT!  WE 
                         DO NOT KNOW HOW SERIOUS IT IS YET.  
                         SENATOR KENNEDY HAS BEEN SHOT.

               The television shows a scene of confusion.  Jim walks out, 
               looking at the TV, struck down with his foreknowledge and 
               his inability to do anything about it.

               In their bedroom upstairs that night, Jim gently wakes Liz 
               and holds her.

                                     JIM
                         They killed him, honey.

                              (strangled)
                         He won... and they killed Robert 
                         Kennedy.  They shot him down.

                         can't believe it.  Both of them, 
                         both brothers, oh my God!

               She clings to him, horrified.  He caresses her hair.  They 
               look in each other's eyes.

                                     LIZ
                         You're right, it hasn't ended, has 
                         it?

               He kisses her gently - They start to make love, numbed, 
               needing each other, needing their love in an increasingly 
               terrifying world.

                                     JIM

                         I wish I could've loved you more... 
                         I feel sometimes like I didn't ever.. 
                         love you or the children enough... 
                         I'm sorry.

               OUTSIDE THE COURTS BUILDING - NEW ORLEANS -(JAN. 1969)

               The scene is like a circus.  Armed, uniformed guards with 
               walkie-talkies are everywhere.  Guards with rifles are on 
               the rooftop.  There are crowds of reporters from around the 
               world and many onlookers.  Everyone going into the courtroom 
               is frisked by electronic metal detectors.

               INSIDE THE COURTROOM

               Jim, accompanied by Mattie, the maid, but not his wife, forges 
               his way through a tightly packed crowd to the prosecution 
               table, joining Al, Susie, Numa, and others from his team.  
               Young law student have come to watch.  The crowd is noisy to 
               the point of unruliness.  Suddenly there's a hush as everyone 
               cranes their necks to see Clay Shaw and his attorneys, Irvin 
               Dymond and two others, enter the court.  Shaw, impeccably 
               dressed, his high handsome cheekbones sucking on an ever- 
               present cigarette in a porcelain filter (smoking in court 
               was allowed then), smiles to those who greet him as if they 
               were not really there and limps past Jim with a stony 
               indifference.

               The clerk starts pounding the gavel to call the court to 
               order as Judge Edward Aloysius Haggerty sweeps in and takes 
               the bench.  He's a stocky little Jimmy Cagney look alike 
               with fierce blue eyes under bushy brows.  The jurors - nine 
               white men and three black men - all dressed in suits and 
               ties, look on.

               CUT TO Willie O'Keefe pointing out Clay Shaw.

                                     O'KEEFE
                         That's Clay Bertrand.  That's the 
                         man I saw at David Ferrie's.

               Irvin Dymond cross-examines O'Keefe.

                                     DYMOND
                              (words wafting)
                         That's who you say you saw... a 
                         confessed homosexual, convicted of 
                         solicitation, pandering... a man who 
                         has lied about most everything, who...

               TIME CUT TO Vernon Bundy, a poor black man, who points at 
               Shaw.

                                     BUNDY
                         It was that man there, yessir.  He 
                         was at the Pontchartrain wall with 
                         the man who shot the President.  I 
                         remember him cause o' his limp there.

                                     DYMOND
                         A heroin addict, injecting himself 
                         at the wall, barely conscious...

               TIME CUT TO Jim looking over at a strange man, Matthews, a 
               kind of lawyer, making notes and conferring with Shaw and 
               Dymond.  Matthews seems to have some authority over both 
               men.

               Corrie Collins, a black woman who is one of the CORE workers 
               from Clinton, is on the stand.

                                     COLLINS
                              (pointing at Shaw)
                         ...that was the man there.  He dropped 
                         Oswald off on the voter line.  I 
                         remember 'cause they were the only 
                         white strangers around that morning.  
                         That big, black Cadillac of his made 
                         me think they might be FBI.

               TIME CUT TO the Town Marshall on the stand.

                                     TOWN MARSHALL
                              (looking at Shaw)
                         ...said he was a representative of 
                         one International Trade Mart in New 
                         Orleans.

                                     DYMOND
                         ...more than five years ago, for two 
                         minutes.  It's fair to say you could 
                         be mistaken, isn't it?

               TIME CUT TO Dymond cross-examining Dean Andrews, shaking his 
               head.

                                     ANDREWS
                         ...figment of my imagination... The 
                         cat's stewing me, the oyster's 
                         shucking me I told him, you got the 
                         right at-at but the wrong oh-oh...  
                         Bertrand is not Shaw, scout's honor 
                         and you can tell him I said so...

                                     SUSIE
                              (counter-arguing)
                         Objection, your Honor.  This office 
                         has won a conviction of perjury 
                         against Dean Andrews on this matter.

                                     DYMOND
                         Exception taken.  That case is on 
                         appeal!

               Arguments follow.

               TIME CUT TO Charles Goldberg, a mild-looking New York 
               accountant, on the stand with Dymond cross-examing.

                                     DYMOND
                              (relishing this)
                         Mr. Goldberg, you claim you met David 
                         Ferrie and Clay Shaw while on a 
                         vacation here from your accounting 
                         business in New York, you had drinks 
                         and, under the influence discussed 
                         killing Kennedy, is that not so?

                                     GOLDBERG
                         I did.

                                     DYMOND
                         Why?

                                     GOLDBERG
                         Well, I wanted to make sure she's 
                         the same girl I sent.

                                     DYMOND
                         I see... and why are you experiencing 
                         this paranoia?

                                     GOLDBERG
                              (launching into his 
                              explanation)
                         Well, you see, I've been subject to 
                         hypnosis and psychological warfare 
                         ever since 1948, when I was in 
                         Korea...

               We see the faces of people in the courtroom... the judge's 
               face... obviously Goldberg is disturbed (or maybe he is 
               telling the truth, but it doesn't play well)... Jim looks at 
               Al sickly.

                                     AL
                         He was one of Broussard's witnesses, 
                         chief.  I'm sorry.  He was totally 
                         sane when we took his affidavit.

                                     SUSIE
                         But how does Dymond know what to 
                         ask?  FUCK!  We're dead.

                                     GOLDBERG
                         When someone tries to get your 
                         attention - catch your eye - that's 
                         a clue right off.

               TIME CUT TO Jim calling Officer Habighorst to testify.

                                     GARRISON
                         Your Honor, I call police officer 
                         Aloysisus Habighorst to the stand.

               Habighorst, the clean-cut police officer who booked Clay 
               Shaw on the day of his arrest, starts forward.

                                     JUDGE HAGGERTY
                         I'm going to have to ask the jury to 
                         leave the courtroom.

                                     GARRISON
                         What?

               This is an ugly surprise for Jim.  We see him at the bench 
               arguing loudly with the judge.  Susie, Dymond and Al are 
               also there.

                                     JUDGE HAGGERTY
                         I'm sorry, Jim, but the defendant 
                         did not have his lawyer present when 
                         asked.

               FLASHBACK TO 1967, in the New Orleans police station.  Shaw 
               is being booked.  The press is there and Habighorst is 
               questioning him.

                                     HABIGHORST
                         Any alias?

                                     SHAW
                         Clay Bertrand.

               We see a close-up on Habighorst typing this in.

                                     GARRISON (V.O.)
                         Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's 
                         been standard booking procedure to 
                         ask an alias.  You know that.  There's 
                         no constitutional requirement that 
                         says a lawyer has to be present for 
                         routine questions.

                                     JUDGE HAGGERTY
                         I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm 
                         ruling it inadmissible.

                                     GARRISON
                         That's our case!

                                     JUDGE HAGGERTY
                         If that's your case, you didn't have 
                         a case.  I wouldn't believe whatever 
                         Habighorst said, anyway.

                                     GARRISON
                         I can't believe you're saying this 
                         in the courtroom.

                                     JUDGE HAGGERTY
                              (feistier)
                         Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the 
                         jury.

                                     AL
                         We're filing for a writ to the 
                         appellate court.

                                     JUDGE HAGGERTY
                         You do that.

               Dymond goes back to Shaw, very please.  Shaw smokes, icy.  
               Jim, devastated, sits, feeling it's over.

               CUT TO Clay Shaw on the stand.  Dymond cross-examines him.

                                     DYMOND
                         ...Oswald?

                                     SHAW
                         No, I did not.

                                     DYMOND
                         ...ever called Dean Andrews?

                                     SHAW
                         No, I did not.

                                     DYMOND
                         ...and have you ever met David Ferrie?

                                     SHAW
                              (with a smirk of 
                              amusement)
                         No, I would not even know what he 
                         looked like except for the pictures 
                         I've been shown.

                                     DYMOND
                         ...did you ever use the alias Clay 
                         Bertrand?

                                     SHAW
                         No, I did not.

                                     DYMOND
                         Thank you... Mr. Shaw.

               Jim rises slowly out of his chair.

                                     JIM
                         Well, a very great actor has just 
                         given us a great performance, Your 
                         Honor, but we are nowhere closer to 
                         the truth.  Let it be noted, my office 
                         is charging Clay Shaw with outright 
                         perjury on the fifteen answers he 
                         has given, not one word of this...

                                     JUDGE HAGGERTY
                         You're out of order, Jim Boy, now 
                         sit down.  Strike those remarks!!

               CUT TO later in the trial.  A movie screen has been installed 
               for the jury.  Jim paces dramatically, as if waiting, casting 
               looks at the door.  Members of the press pack the hot room, 
               and a fan turns overhead.

                                     JIM
                         To prove their was a conspiracy 
                         involving Clay Shaw we must prove 
                         there was more than one man involved 
                         in the assassination.  To do that, 
                         we must look at the Zapruder film, 
                         which my office has subpoenaed.  The 
                         American public has not seen that 
                         film because it has been kept locked 
                         in a vault in the Time-Life Building 
                         in New York City for the last five 
                         years.  There is a reason for that.  
                         Watch.

               The Zapruder film (8mm) now rolls.  We have seen pieces of 
               it before in the opening of the film, but now we see it whole.  
               It is crucial that this piece of film be repeated several 
               times during the trial to drive home a point that is easily 
               lost on casual viewing.  The first viewing is silent except 
               for the sound of the clanky projector.  It lasts about 25 
               seconds, and then the lights come on.  The jury is shaken.  
               The judge is shaken.  The people in the courtroom murmur.  
               Even Clay Shaw is surprised at what he has seen.  Jim says 
               nothing, letting the truth of it sink in.  Then:

                                     JIM
                         A picture speaks a thousand words.  
                         Yet sometimes the truth is too simple 
                         for some...  The Warren Commission 
                         thought they had an open and shut 
                         case: three bullets, one assassin - 
                         but two things happened that made it 
                         virtually impossible: 1)the Zapruder 
                         film which you just saw, and 2)the 
                         third wounded man, Jim Tague, who 
                         was nicked by a fragment down by the 
                         Triple Underpass.  The time frame of 
                         5.6 seconds established by the 
                         Zapruder film left no possibility of 
                         a fourth shot from Oswald's rifle, 
                         but the shot or fragment that left a 
                         superficial wound on Tague's cheek 
                         had to come from a bullet that missed 
                         the car entirely.  Now they had two 
                         bullets that hit, and we know one of 
                         them was the fatal head shot.  So a 
                         single bullet remained to account 
                         for all seven wounds in Kennedy and 
                         Connally.  But rather than admit to 
                         a conspiracy or investigate further, 
                         the Commission chose to endorse the 
                         theory put forth by an ambitious 
                         junior counsellor, Arlen Specter.  
                         One of the grossest lies ever forced 
                         on the American people, we've come 
                         to know it as the "magic bullet" 
                         theory.

               CUT TO a drawing which has been put on a chair for the Jury.  
               Jim has also moved Al, acting as J.F.K., into a chair directly 
               behind the larger Numa, acting as Governor Connally.  He 
               demonstrates with a pointer.

                                     JIM
                         The magic bullet enters the 
                         President's back, headed downward at 
                         an angle of 17 degrees.  It then 
                         moves upward in order to leave 
                         Kennedy's body from the front of his 
                         neck - his neck wound number two - 
                         where it waits 1.6 seconds, turns 
                         right and continues into Connally's 
                         body at the rear of his right armpit - 
                         wound number three.  Then, the bullet 
                         heads downward at an angle of 27 
                         degrees, shattering Connally's fifth 
                         rib and leaving from the right side 
                         of his chest - wounds four and five.  
                         The bullet continues downward and 
                         then enters Connally's right wrist - 
                         wound number six - shattering the 
                         radius bone.  It then enters his 
                         left thigh - wound number seven - 
                         from which it later falls out and is 
                         found in almost "pristine" condition 
                         on a stretcher in a corridor of 
                         Parkland Hospital.
                              (he shows a mock-up 
                              of the "pristine" 
                              bullet)
                         That's some bullet.  Anyone who's 
                         been in combat can tell you never in 
                         the history of gunfire has there 
                         been a bullet like this.
                              (the court laughs)
                         The Army Wound Ballistics experts at 
                         Edgewood Arsenal fired some comparison 
                         bullets and not one of them looked 
                         anything like this one.
                              (he shows mock-ups of 
                              comparison bullets)
                         Take a look at CE 856, an identical 
                         bullet fired through the wrist of a 
                         human cadaver - just one of the bones 
                         smashed by the magic bullet.  Yet 
                         the government says it can prove 
                         this with some fancy physics in a 
                         nuclear laboratory.  Of course they 
                         can.  Theoretical physics can prove 
                         an elephant can hang from a cliff 
                         with it's tail tied to a daisy, but 
                         use your eyes - your common sense -
                              (he holds the bullet)
                         Seven wounds, skin, bone.  This single 
                         bullet explanation is the foundation 
                         of the Warren Commission's claim of 
                         a lone assassin.  And once you 
                         conclude the magic bullet could not 
                         create all seven of those wounds, 
                         you have to conclude there was a 
                         fourth shot and a second rifleman.  
                         And if there was a second rifleman, 
                         there had to be a conspiracy, which 
                         we believe involved the accused Clay 
                         Shaw.  Fifty-one witnesses, gentlemen 
                         of the jury, thought they heard shots 
                         coming from the Grassy Knoll, which 
                         is to the right and front of the 
                         President.

               Jim walks to a drawing of an overhead view of Dealey Plaza.  
               On it are dots representing locations of the witnesses. He 
               points to each portion.  He pauses and looks out into the 
               courtroom - Liz has entered accompanied by Jasper.  Quietly 
               she takes a seat.  Jim is unbelieving at first, then very 
               moved.  He takes a beat, then:

                         whatsoever one or more shots came 
                         from behind the picket fence!  Twenty 
                         six trained medical personnel at 
                         Parkland Hospital saw with their own 
                         eyes the back of the President's 
                         head blasted out.

                         ...a large 7 cm opening in the right 
                         occipitoparietal area, a considerable 
                         portion of the brain was missing

                         ...almost a fifth or perhaps a quarter 
                         of the back of the head - this area 
                         here...

                              head)
                         ...had been blasted out along with 
                         the brain tissue there.  The exit 
                         hole in the rear of his head was 
                         about 120 mm. across.  There was 
                         also a large piece of skull attached 
                         to a flap of skin in the right 
                         temporal area.

               FLASHBACK TO: Parkland Hospital Emergency Room on that day 
               in 1963.  The doctors work on the President.  The wounds on 
               the back of his head are evident but will change later in 
               the autopsy.  He is placed in a bronze casket.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Not one of the civilian doctors who 
                         examined the President at Parkland 
                         Hospital regarded his throat wound 
                         as anything but a wound of entry.  
                         The doctors found no wounds of entry 
                         in the back of the head.  But the 
                         body was then illegally moved to 
                         Washington for the autopsy.

               CUT TO: the Secret Service team preparing to wheel the casket 
               out.  The Dallas Medical Examiner, Dr. Rose, backed by a 
               justice of the peace, bars the way.  A furious wrestling 
               match ensues.

                         Texas Law, sir, requires the autopsy 
                         be done here.  You're not taking him 
                         with you!

                         what to do!  Get the hell outta the 
                         way!

               The Secret Service agents put the doctor and judge up against 
               the wall at gunpoint and sweep out of the hospital.

                         Because when a coup d'etat has 
                         occurred there's a big difference 
                         between an autopsy performed by 
                         civilian doctors and one by military 
                         doctors working for the government.

                         The departure of Air Force One from 
                         Love Field that Friday afternoon was 
                         not so much a takeoff as it was a

                         please bottle the acid.

               FLASHBACK TO: the Bethesda autopsy room in 1963.  The room 
               is crammed with military officers, Secret Service men and, 
               at the center, three intimidated doctors.  Pictures are being 
               taken as they remove bullet fragments.

                         The three Bethesda Naval Hospital 
                         doctors picked by the Military left 
                         something to be desired inasmuch as 
                         none of them had experience with 
                         combat gunfire wounds.  Through their 
                         autopsy we have been able to justify 
                         eight wounds - three to Kennedy, 
                         five to Connally - from just two 
                         bullets, one of these bullets the 
                         "magic bullet".

               CUT TO: Jim in court with a series of drawings indicating 
               with arrows entry and exit wounds to Kennedy's neck and head.

                         Colonel Finck, are you saying someone 
                         told you not to dissect the neck?

                                     FINCK
                         I was told that the family wanted 
                         examination of the head.

                         As a pathologist it was your 
                         obligation to explore all possible 
                         causes of death, was it not?

                         I had the cause of death.

                         Your Honor, I would ask you to direct 
                         the witness to answer my question.  
                         Why did Colonel Finck not dissect 
                         the track of the bullet wound in the 
                         neck?

                                     ARMY GENERAL
                         I am.

                                     FINCK (V.O.)
                         I don't remember his name.  You must 
                         understand it was quite crowded, and 
                         when you are called in circumstances 
                         like that to look at the wound of 
                         the President who is dead, you don't 
                         look around too much to ask people 
                         for their names and who they are.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         But you were a qualified pathologist.  
                         Was this Army general a qualified 
                         pathologist?

                                     FINCK (V.O.)
                         No.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         But you took his orders.  He was 
                         directing the autopsy.

                                     FINCK (V.O.)
                         No, because there were others.  There 
                         were admirals.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         There were admirals.

                                     FINCK (V.O.)
                         Oh yes, there were admirals - and 
                         when you are a lieutenant colonel in 
                         the Army you just follow orders, and 
                         at the end of the autopsy we were 
                         specifically told - as I recall it 
                         was Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon 
                         General of the Navy - we were 
                         specifically told not to discuss the 
                         case.

                                     KENNEY
                              (in Bethesda scene)
                         Gentlemen, what you've seen in this 
                         room is intensely private to the 
                         Kennedy family and it is not our 
                         business to...

               Jim turns away from the jury.  His point is made.  Finck is 
               no longer on the stand.

                                     JIM
                         In addition to which, 1) the chief 
                         pathologist, Commander Humes, by his 
                         own admission voluntarily burned his 
                         autopsy notes, 2)never released the 
                         autopsy photos to the public, 3) 
                         President Johnson ordered the blood 
                         soaked limousine filled with bullet 
                         holes and clues to be immediately 
                         washed and rebuilt, 4) sent John 
                         Connally's bloody suit right to the 
                         cleaners, and 5) when my office 
                         finally got a court order to examine 
                         President Kennedy's brain in the 
                         National Archives in the hopes of 
                         finding from what direction the 
                         bullets came, we were told by the 
                         government the President's brain had 
                         disappeared!

               There's a pause, and then a murmur from the court.  Jim is 
               on a roll and knows it.  The faces in the courtroom are with 
               him, absorbed, horrified.  The law students are still there, 
               they have been since day one.  But it is Liz's interest that 
               touches him the most.

                                     JIM
                         So what really happened that day?  
                         Let's just for a moment speculate, 
                         shall we?  We have the epileptic 
                         seizure around 12:15 P.M.... 
                         distracting the police, making it 
                         easier for the shooters to move into 
                         their places.  The epileptic later 
                         vanished, never checking into the 
                         hospital.  The A Team gets on the 
                         6th floor of the Book Depository...

               FLASHBACK TO: the Book Depository, 1963.  A shooter and two 
               spotters dressed as working men move into the Oswald spot.  
               One spotter produces the Mannlicher-Carcano.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         They were refurbishing the floors in 
                         the Depository that week, which 
                         allowed unknown workmen in and out 
                         of the building.  The men move quickly 
                         into position just minutes before 
                         the shooting.

               The camera takes the shooter's point of view: we see down 
               the street through a scope.  His spotter wears a radio 
               earpiece.  The second spotter is working out of the southeast 
               window.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         The second spotter is probably calling 
                         all the shots on a radio to the two 
                         other teams.  He as the best overall 
                         view - "the God spot".

               Inside the Dal-Tex Building, a shooter and a spotter dressed 
               as air-conditioning men move into a small second-story textile 
               storage room.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         B Team - one rifleman and one spotter 
                         with a headset, with access to the 
                         building - moves into a low floor of 
                         the Dal-Tex Building.

               At the picket fence a shooter in a Dallas Police uniform 
               moves into place, aiming up Elm Street.  His spotter has a 
               radio to his ear.  Another man in a Secret Service suit moves 
               further down the fence.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         The third team, the C Team, moves in 
                         behind the picket fence above the 
                         Grassy Knoll, where the shooter and 
                         the spotter are first seen by the 
                         late Lee Bowers in the watchtower of 
                         the railyard.  They have the best 
                         position of all.  Kennedy is close 
                         and on a flat low trajectory.

               Part of this team is a coordinator who's flashed security 
               credentials at several people, chasing them out of the parking 
               lot area.

               An "agent" in tie and suit moves on the underpass, keeping 
               an eye out.

               In the crowd on Elm Street, we catch brief glimpses of the 
               umbrella man and the Cuban, neither of them watching Kennedy, 
               both looking around to their teams.  There is a third man, 
               heavyset, in a construction helmet.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Probably two to three more men are 
                         down in the crowd on Elm... ten to 
                         twelve men... three teams, three 
                         shooters.  The triangulation of fire 
                         Clay Shaw and David Ferrie discussed 
                         two months before.  They've walked 
                         the Plaza, they know every inch.  
                         They've calibrated their sights, 
                         practiced on moving targets.  They're 
                         ready.  It's going to be a turkey 
                         shoot.  Kennedy's motorcade makes 
                         the turn from Main onto Houston.

               J.F.K. waves and turns in slow motion.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Six witnesses see two gunmen on the 
                         sixth floor of the Depository moving 
                         around.  Some of them think they're 
                         policemen with rifles.

               From Houston Street we look up at the sixth floor of the 
               Book Depository and see the shooter moving around.  Arnold 
               Rowland points him out to his wife.

                                     ARNOLD
                              (under)
                         ...probably a security agent.

               In the Dallas County Jail, Johnny Powell is one of many 
               convicts housed on the sixth floor - the same height as the 
               men in the Book Depository.  We look across to the Depository 
               through cell bars.  Johnny and various cell mates are watching 
               two men in the sixth floor of the Depository.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         John Powell, a prisoner on the sixth 
                         floor of the Dallas County Jail, 
                         sees them.

                                     POWELL
                              (under)
                         ...quite a few of us saw them.  
                         Everybody was hollering and yelling 
                         and that.  We thought is was security 
                         guys...

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         ...they don't shoot him coming up 
                         Houston, which is the easiest shot 
                         for a single shooter in the Book 
                         Depository, but they wait till he 
                         gets to the killing zone between 
                         three rifles.  Kennedy makes the 
                         final turn from Houston onto Elm, 
                         slowing down to some 11 miles per 
                         hour.

               All the shooters tighten, taking aim.  It's a tense moment.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         The shooters across Dealey Plaza 
                         tighten, taking their aim across 
                         their sights...  waiting for the 
                         radio to say "Green Green!" or "Abort 
                         Abort!"

               The camera is on Kennedy waving.  A MONTAGE follows - all 
               the faces in the square that we've introduced in the movie 
               now appear one after the other, watching - the killers, the 
               man with the umbrella, the Newman family, Mary Moorman 
               photographing, Jean Hill, Abraham Zapruder filming it, S.M. 
               Holland, Patrolman Harkness... INTERCUT with the Zapruder 
               and Nix films on J.F.K. in the final seconds coming abreast 
               of the Stemmons Freeway sign.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         The first shot rings out.

               CUT TO the Dal-Tex shooter firing.  We see the back of 
               Kennedy's through his gun sight.  Kennedy (stand in) reacts 
               in the Zapruder film.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Sounding like a backfire, it misses 
                         completely... Frame 161, Kennedy 
                         stops waving as he hears something.  
                         Connally turns his head slightly to 
                         the right.

               Everything goes off very fast now.  Repeating intercuts are 
               slowed down with shots of Kennedy reacting in the Zapruder 
               film.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Frame 193 - the second shot hits 
                         Kennedy in the throat from the front.  
                         Frame 225 - the President emerging 
                         from the road sign.  He obviously 
                         has been hit, raising his arms to 
                         his throat.

               CUT TO: the picket fence shooter hitting him from the fence.  
               We see Kennedy (stand in) from the point of view of his 
               telescopic sight.  In the Zapruder film, we see Kennedy clutch 
               his throat.

                                     JIM
                         Frame 232, the third shot - the 
                         President has been hit in the back, 
                         drawing him downward and forward.  
                         Connally, you will notice, shows no 
                         signs at all of being hit.  He is 
                         visibly holding his Stetson which is 
                         impossible if his wrist has been 
                         shattered.

               CUT TO: the Dal-Tex shooter.  We see Kennedy from his point 
               of view, and the Zapruder film in slow motion.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Connally's turning now here.  Frame 
                         238... the fourth shot misses Kennedy 
                         and takes Connally in the back.  
                         This is the key shot that proves two 
                         rifles from the rear.  This is 1.6 
                         seconds after the third shot, and we 
                         know no manual bolt action rifle can 
                         be recycled in that time.  Connally 
                         is hit, his mouth drops, he yells 
                         out, "My God, they're going to kill 
                         us all"... Here...

               CUT TO: the sixth floor shooter firing rapidly and missing 
               Kennedy but hitting Connally (stand in).

                         ...the umbrella man is signalling 
                         "He's not dead.  Keep shooting."  
                         James Tague down at the underpass is 
                         hit sometime now by another shot 
                         that misses.

               CUT TO: the umbrella man pumping his umbrella.  The Cuban is 
               looking off.  The man on the curb in the construction helmet 
               is looking not at J.F.K. but up at the Book Depository.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         The car brakes.  The fifth and fatal 
                         shot - frame 313 - takes Kennedy in 
                         the head from the front...

               CUT TO the picket fence shooter.  We see J.F.K. from his 
               point of view.  He fires, and then we see Kennedy in the 
               Zapruder film flying backwards and to his left in a ferocious, 
               conclusive spray of blood and brain tissue.  We repeat the 
               shot.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         This is the key shot.  Watch it again.  
                         The President going back to his left.
                         Shot from the front and right.  
                         Totally inconsistent with the shot 
                         from the Depository.  Again - 
                         (repeats)... back and two the left.  
                         (he repeats it like a mantra)... 
                         back and to the left...  back and to 
                         the left.

               Kennedy's car speeds off.  Jackie is like a crawling animal 
               in a pillbox hat on the back of the car.  The people on the 
               other side of the underpass wave innocently as the car speeds 
               through with it's horrifying contents.  Pigeons fly off the 
               rooftop of the Book Depository.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         What happens then?  Pandemonium.  
                         The shooters quickly disassemble 
                         their various weapons, all except 
                         the Oswald rifle.

               CUT TO: sixth floor spotter dumping the Mannlicher - Carcano 
               in a corner as he leaves... and then to the Dal-Tex spotter 
               and shooter, who break down the gun and move out... and then 
               to the spotter with the fence shooter, who quickly breaks 
               down the weapon, throwing it in the trunk of a car parked at 
               the fence.  He walks away.  The fence shooter, dressed as a 
               policeman, blends with the crowd.

               CUT TO: the umbrella man and the Cuban sitting quietly 
               together on the north side of the curb of Elm Street.

               CUT TO: stunned, confused, people in the crowd - some lying 
               on the ground, some running for the Grassy Knoll.

               Back in the courtroom, patrolman Joe Smith is on the stand.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Patrolman Joe Smith rushed into the 
                         parking lot behind the fence.  He 
                         smelled gunpowder.

               FLASHBACK TO: the picket fence area where, with his gun drawn, 
               Smith rushes across to a man standing by a car who reacts 
               quickly, producing credentials.  He is one of the hoboes.  
               There's a strange moment when the camera moves from Smith's 
               eyes to the man's fingernails.

                                     SMITH (V.O.)
                         ...the character produces credentials 
                         from his pocket which showed him to 
                         be Secret Service.  So I accepted 
                         that and let him go and continued 
                         our search.  But I regretted it, 
                         'cause this guy looked like an auto 
                         mechanic.  He had on a sports shirt 
                         and pants, but he had dirty 
                         fingernails.  Afterwards it didn't 
                         ring true, but at the time we were 
                         so pressed for time.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Yet all Secret Servicemen in Dallas 
                         that day are accounted for.  None 
                         were on foot in Dealey Plaza before 
                         or after the shooting, till Dallas 
                         Secret Service Chief Forrest Sorrels 
                         returned at 12:55.

               Back in the courtroom, Liz is totally absorbed.  Jim exchanges 
               looks with her.  The camera movies in for a close - up of 
               Jim.

                                     JIM
                              (pausing for effect)
                         What else was going on in Dealey 
                         Plaza that day?  At least 12 other 
                         individuals were taken into custody 
                         by Dallas police.  No records of 
                         their arrests.  Men acting like hoboes 
                         were being pulled off trains, marched 
                         through Dealey Plaza, photographed, 
                         and yet there is no records of their 
                         arrests.

               FLASHBACK TO: the three hoboes being arrested ... marching 
               across Dealey Plaza.  The hoboes look familiar now.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Men identifying themselves as Secret 
                         Service Agents were all over the 
                         place.  But who was impersonating 
                         them?

               FLASHBACK TO: men in suits, ties, and hats moving people out 
               of the parking lot area ... turning a policeman back.

               FLASHBACK TO: the Cuban, putting away a radio, and the 
               umbrella man, who now rise and leave the area in opposite 
               directions.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         And where was Lee Oswald?  Probably 
                         in the second floor snack room.  
                         Eddie Piper and William Shelly saw 
                         Oswald eating lunch in the first 
                         floor lunch room around twelve.  
                         Around 12:15, on her way out of the 
                         building to see the motorcade, 
                         secretary Carolyn Arnold saw Oswald 
                         in the second floor snack room, where 
                         he said he went for a Coke...

               In the second floor lunchroom of the Book Depository we see 
               Carolyn Arnold, a pregnant secretary, crossing past Oswald, 
               who is in a booth.

                                     CAROLYN ARNOLD (V.O.)
                         He was sitting in one of the booths 
                         on the right hand side of the room.  
                         He was alone as usual and appeared 
                         to be having lunch.  I did not speak 
                         to him but I recognized clearly.  I 
                         remember it was 12:15 or later.  It 
                         coulda been 12:25, five minutes before 
                         the assassination, I don't exactly 
                         remember.  I was pregnant and I had 
                         a craving for a glass of water.

               On the sixth floor of the depository, Bonnie Ray Williams is 
               eating a chicken lunch, alone.

                                     JIM
                              (VO)
                         At the same time, Bonnie Ray Williams 
                         is supposedly eating his chicken 
                         lunch on the sixth floor, at least 
                         until 12:15, maybe 12:20 ... he sees 
                         nobody.

               On the street, Arnold Rowland and his wife look up at the 
               sixth floor windows and we see, from their point of view, 
               two shadowy figures...

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Down on the street, Arnold Rowland 
                         was seeing two men in the sixth floor 
                         windows... presumably after Bonnie 
                         Ray Williams finished his lunch and 
                         left.

               We see footage of J.F.K. coming up Houston - waving.

               Oswald walks into the second floor lunchroom as policeman 
               Marrion Baker runs in, gun at his side.  He is about 30 feet 
               from Oswald.  Roy Truly, the superintendent, runs in a moment 
               later.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Kennedy was running five minutes 
                         late for his appointment with death.  
                         He was due at 12:25.  If Oswald was 
                         the assassin, he was certainly pretty 
                         non-chalant about getting himself 
                         into position.  Later he told Dallas 
                         police he was standing in the second 
                         floor snackroom.  Probably told to 
                         wait there for a phone call by his 
                         handler.  The phones were in the 
                         adjacent and empty second floor 
                         offices, but the call never came.  A 
                         maximum 90 seconds after Kennedy is 
                         shot, patrolman Marrion Baker runs 
                         into Oswald in that second story 
                         lunchroom.

                                     BAKER
                         Hey you!
                              (to Truly)
                         Do you know this man?  Is he an 
                         employee?

                                     TRULY
                         Yes he is.
                              (as Baker moves on)
                         The President's been shot!

               Oswald reacts as if hearing it for the first time.  Truly 
               and Baker continue running up the stairs.  Oswald proceeds 
               to get a Coke and continues out of the room.

               CUT TO: the sixth floor, where we see Oswald as the shooter.  
               After firing, he runs full speed for the stairs, stashing 
               the rifle on the other side of the loft.  Our camera follows 
               him roughly down stairs - we hear the loud sound of his shoes 
               banging on the hollow wood - to the lunchroom, where Patrolman 
               Baker and Superintendent Truly run in.  Then they start to 
               repeat the same action as seen in the previous scene.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         ...but what the Warren Report would 
                         have us believe is that after firing 
                         3 bolt action shots in 5.6 seconds, 
                         Oswald then leaves three cartridges 
                         neatly side by side in the firing 
                         nest, wipes the rifle clear of 
                         fingerprints, stashes the rifle on 
                         the other side of the loft, sprints 
                         down five flights of stairs, past 
                         witnesses Victoria Adams and Sandra 
                         Styles who never see him, and then 
                         shows up cool and calm on the second 
                         floor in front of Patrolman Baker -
                         all this within a maximum 90 seconds 
                         of the shooting.  Is he out of breath?  
                         According to Baker, absolutely not.

               CUT TO: the second floor.  Oswald ambles past Mrs. Reid, a 
               secretary in the second floor office, on his way out, Coke 
               bottle in hand and wearing his usual dreamy look... there's 
               a lingering close - up on his face.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Assuming he is the sole assassin, 
                         Oswald is now free to escape from 
                         the building.  The longer he delays, 
                         the more chance the building will be 
                         sealed by the police.  Is he guilty?  
                         Does he walk out the nearest 
                         staircase?  No, he buys a Coke and 
                         at a slow pace, spotted by Mrs. Reid 
                         in the second floor office, he strolls 
                         out the more distant front exit, 
                         where the cops start to gather...

               Outside, we see Oswald stroll out the door of the Book 
               Depository into the crowd.  He heads for the bus stop to the 
               east.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Oddly, considering three shots are 
                         supposed to have come from there, 
                         nobody seals the Depository for ten 
                         more minutes.  Oswald slips out, as 
                         do several other employees.  Of 
                         course, when he realized something 
                         had gone wrong and the President 
                         really had been shot, he knew there 
                         was a problem.  He may even have 
                         known he was the patsy.  An intuition 
                         maybe - the President killed in spite 
                         of his warning.  The phone call that 
                         never came.  Perhaps fear now came 
                         to Lee Oswald.  He wasn't going to 
                         stand around for roll call.

               Back in the courtroom, Jim continues speaking:

                         The story gets pretty confusing now - 
                         more twists in it than a watersnake.  
                         Richard Carr says he saw four men 
                         take off from the Book Depository in 
                         a Rambler that possibly belongs to 
                         Janet Williams.  Deputy Roger Craig 
                         says two men picked up Oswald in the 
                         same Rambler a few minutes later.  
                         Other people say Oswald took a bus 
                         out of there, and then because he 
                         was stuck in traffic, he hopped a 
                         cab to his rooming house in Oak 
                         Cliff...

               FLASHBACK TO: Oswald's boarding house.  Oswald enters his 
               room, passing Earlene Roberts, the heavyset white housekeeper.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         ...we must assume he wanted to get 
                         back in touch with his intell team, 
                         probably at a safehouse or at the 
                         Texas Theatre, but how could he be 
                         sure?  He didn't know who to trust 
                         anymore...

                                     ROBERTS
                              (watching TV)
                         My God, did you see that, Mr. Lee?  
                         A man shot the President.

               The camera closes in on Oswald's perplexed face.  Earlene 
               peeks out the shades as she hears two short honks on a horn.

               Outside is a black police car driven by Tippit.  Also in the 
               car is the fence shooter, dressed as a Dallas policeman.  
               The car drives by, honks twice, waits, then moves away.  
               During this visual, we see the fence shooter changing his 
               uniform into civilian clothes.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Oswald returns to this rooming house 
                         around 1 P.M., half hour after the 
                         assassination, puts on his jacket, 
                         grabs his .38 revolver, leaves at 
                         1:04... Earlene Roberts, the 
                         housekeeper, says she heard two beeps 
                         on a car horn and two uniformed cops 
                         pulled up to the house while Oswald 
                         was in his room, like it was a signal 
                         or something... Officer Tippit is 
                         shot between 1:10 and 1:15 about a 
                         mile away.  Though no one actually 
                         saw him walking or jogging, the 
                         Government says Oswald covered that 
                         distance.  Incidentally, that walk, 
                         if he did it, is in a straight line 
                         toward Jack Ruby's house.  Giving 
                         the government the benefit of the 
                         doubt, Oswald would have had to jog 
                         a mile in six to eleven minutes and 
                         commit the murder, then reverse 
                         direction and walk 3/5 of a mile to 
                         the Texas Theatre and arrive sometime 
                         before 1:30.  That's some walking.

               On a street, Oswald walks alone, fast.  A police car pulls 
               up alongside him on 10th Street.  Oswald leans on the 
               passenger side of the window.  Officer Tippit, suspicious, 
               gets out to question him.  Oswald pulls his .38 revolver and 
               shoots him down in the street with 5 shots.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         It's also a useful conclusion.  After 
                         all, why else would Oswald kill 
                         Officer Tippit, unless he just shot 
                         the President and feared arrest?  
                         Not one credible witness could 
                         identify Oswald as Tippit's killer.

               Domingo Benavides, hidden in his truck only a few yards away, 
               watches as another unidentified man (not seen before) shoots 
               and walks away.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Domingo Benavides, the closest witness 
                         to the shooting, refused to identify 
                         Oswald as the killer and was never 
                         taken to a lineup.

               We see Acquilla Clemons, a black woman, looking on.  She 
               watches as two men kill Tippit.  One of them resembles the 
               fence shooter.  The other one is a mystery figure, seen before 
               in the fringes.  The men walk off quickly in opposite 
               directions.  We notice a policeman's uniform hanging in the 
               back seat of Tippit's car.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Acquilla Clemons saw the killer with 
                         another man and says they went off 
                         in separate directions.  Mrs. Clemons 
                         was never taken to lineup or to the 
                         Warren Commission.  Mr.  Frank Wright, 
                         who saw the killer run away, stated 
                         flatly that the killer was not Lee 
                         Oswald.  Oswald is found with a .38 
                         revolver.  Tippit is killed with a 
                         .38 automatic.  At the scene of the 
                         crime Officer J.M. Poe marks the 
                         shells with his initials to record 
                         the chain of evidence.

                         Those initials are not on the three 
                         cartridge cases which the Warren 
                         Commission presents to him.

               On a Dallas avenue near the Texas Theatre, Oswald moves along, 
               spooked.  Police cars roar by with sirens blaring.  Johnny 
               Brewer, in a shoestore, spots him and follows him.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         Oswald is next seen by shoe salesman 
                         Johnny Brewer lurking along Jefferson 
                         Avenue.  Oswald is scared.  He begins 
                         to realize the full implications of 
                         this thing.  He goes into the Texas 
                         Theatre, possibly his prearranged 
                         meeting point, but though he has $14 
                         in his pocket, he does not buy the 
                         75-cent ticket.  Brewer has the 
                         cashier call the police.

               Outside the Texas Theatre Oswald walks past the cashier, who 
               is out on the sidewalk watching the police cars go by.  A 
               double feature is playing - Cry of Battle with Van Heflin 
               and War is Hell.  He goes in.

               CUT TO: 30 officers arriving at the theatre in a fleet of 
               patrol cars.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         In response to the cashier's call, 
                         at least thirty officers in a fleet 
                         of patrol cars descend on the movie 
                         theatre.  This has to be the most 
                         remarkable example of police intuition 
                         since the Reichstag fire.  I don't 
                         buy it.  They knew - someone knew - 
                         Oswald was going to be there.  In 
                         fact, as early as 12:44, only 14 
                         minutes after the assassination, the 
                         police radio put out a description 
                         matching Oswald's size and build.  
                         Brewer says the man was wearing a 
                         jacket, but the police say the man 
                         who shot Tippit left his jacket 
                         behind.  Butch Burroughs, theatre 
                         manager, says Oswald bought some 
                         popcorn from him at the time of the 
                         Tippit slaying.  Burroughs and witness 
                         Bernard Haire also said there was an 
                         Oswald look - alike taken from the 
                         theatre.  Perhaps it was he who 
                         sneaked into the theatre just after 
                         1:30.

               Inside the theatre, Cry of Battle is on the screen.  Twelve 
               to fourteen spectators sit scattered between the balcony and 
               ground floor.  Brewer leads the officers onto the stage and 
               the lights come on.  He points to Oswald.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         In any case, Brewer helpfully leads 
                         the cops into the theatre and from 
                         the stage points Oswald out...

               The cops advance on Oswald, who jumps up, as if expecting to 
               be shot.

                                     OSWALD
                         This is it!

                         Kill the President, will you?

               Scared, Oswald takes a swing at a policeman.  He pulls out 
               his gun.  The officers close in on him from the rear and 
               front.  A wrestling and shoving match ensues.  One officer 
               gets a chokehold on Oswald and another one hits him.

                                     JIM (V.O.)
                         The cops have their man!  It was 
                         already been decided - in Washington.

               Outside the theatre, Oswald, his eye blackened, is led out 
               by the phalanx of officers.  They are surrounded by an angry 
               crowd.

                         Dr. Best, Himmler's right hand man 
                         in the Gestapo, once said "as long 
                         as the police carries out the will 
                         of the leadership, it is acting 
                         legally."  That mindset allowed for 
                         400 political murders in the Weimar 
                         Republic of 1923 - 32, where the 
                         courts were controlled and the guilty 
                         acquitted.  Oswald must've felt like 
                         Josef K in Kafka's "The Trial".  He 
                         was never told the reason of his 
                         arrest, he does not know the unseen 
                         forces ranging against him, he cries 
                         out his outrage in the police lineup 
                         just like Josef K excoriates the 
                         judge for not being told the charges 
                         against him.  But the state is deaf.  
                         The quarry is caught.  By the time 
                         he is brought from the theatre, a 
                         large crowd is waiting to scream at 
                         him.  By the time he reaches police 
                         headquarters, he is booked for 
                         murdering Tippit...

               At the Dallas police station, Dallas Police Captain Will 
               Fritz takes a call from a high official in Washington.  In 
               the background we notice Lee Oswald continuing to be 
               questioned by federal agents.  We hear Johnson's distinctive 
               Texas drawl but we never see him.

                         doing our best.

                         hound dog down there to get this 
                         mess wrapped up, but I gotta tell 
                         you there's too much confusion coming 
                         out of Dallas now.  The TVs and the 
                         papers are full of rumour 'bout 
                         conspiracies.  Two gunmen, two rifles, 
                         the Russkies done it, the Cubans 
                         done it, that kinda loose talk, it's 
                         carin' the shit outta people, bubba'.  
                         This thing could lead us into a war 
                         that could cost 40 million lives.  
                         We got to show'em we got this thing 
                         under control.  No question, no 
                         doubts, for the good of our country... 
                         you hear me?

                                     FRITZ
                         Yes, sir.

                         investigation's over, that's what 
                         people want to hear.

               The camera closes in on Oswald in the background.  He turns 
               to an unseen Deputy, sad.

                         By the time the sun rose the next 
                         morning, he is booked for murdering 
                         the President.  The whole country - 
                         fueled by the media - assumes he's 
                         guilty.

               In an underground police garage, we see Jack Ruby being 
               allowed in via an interior staircase by his police contact.  
               He moves towards the outer edge of reporters, nervous.

               Oswald comes out with his two guards.  We see a repeat of 
               the assassination in stop time... Ruby's eyes, Oswald's... 
               do they recognize each other?

                         Under the guise of a patriotic 
                         nightclub owner out to spare Jackie 
                         Kennedy from having to testify at a 
                         trial, Jack Ruby is shown into the 
                         underground garage by one of his 
                         inside men on the Dallas Police Force, 
                         and when he's ready Oswald is brought 
                         out like a sacrificial lamb and nicely 
                         disposed of as an enemy of the people.  
                         By early Sunday afternoon, the autopsy 
                         has been completed on him.  Who 
                         grieves for Lee Harvey Oswald?  Buried 
                         in a cheap grave under the name 
                         "Oswald"?  No one.

               We see Oswald dying on the floor of the police station.  A 
               paramedic pushes in and starts administering artificial 
               respiration, which only aggravates the internal hemorrhaging.

               At a Texas cemetery, Oswald's mother weeps.  Oswald is buried 
               with a few people present, but there are no details, no dates.  
               We see Marina whisked out by agents.

                         The Official Legend is created and 
                         the media takes it from there.  The 
                         glitter of official lies and the 
                         epic splendor of the thought-numbing

                         Hitler always said "the bigger the 
                         lie, the more people will believe 
                         it."  Lee Oswald - a crazed, lonely 
                         man who wanted attention and got it 
                         by killing a President, was only the 
                         first in a long line of patsies.  In 
                         later years Bobby Kennedy and Martin 
                         Luther King, men whose commitment to 
                         change and to peace would make them 
                         dangerous to men who are committed 
                         to war, would follow, also killed by 
                         such "lonely, crazed men," who remove 
                         our guilt by making murder a 
                         meaningless act of a loner.  We have 
                         all become Hamlets in our country - 
                         children of a slain father - leader 
                         whose killers still possess the 
                         throne.  The ghost of John F. Kennedy 
                         confronts us with the secret murder 
                         at the heart of the American dream.  
                         He forces on us the appalling 
                         questions:  Of what is our 
                         Constitution made?  What is our 
                         citizenship, and more, our lives 
                         worth?  What is the future of a 
                         democracy where a President can be 
                         assassinated under conspicuously 
                         suspicious circumstances while the 
                         machinery of legal action scarcely 
                         trembles?  How many political murders, 
                         disguised as heart attacks, cancer, 
                         suicides, airplane and car crashes, 
                         drug overdoses will occur before 
                         they are exposed for what they are?

                         "Treason doth never prosper," wrote 
                         an English poet, "What's the reason?  
                         For if it prosper, none dare call it 
                         treason."  The generals who sent 
                         Dreyfus to Devils Island were among 
                         the most honorable men in France, 
                         the men who killed Caesar were among 
                         the most honorable men in Rome.  And 
                         the men who killed Kennedy, no doubt, 
                         were honorable men.  I believe we 
                         have reached a time in our country, 
                         similar to what life must've been 
                         like under Hitler in the 30's, except 
                         we don't realize it because Fascism 
                         in our country takes the benign 
                         disguise of liberal democracy.  There 
                         won't be such familiar signs as 
                         swastikas.  We won't build Dachaus 
                         and Auschwitzes.  We're not going to 
                         wake up one morning and suddenly

                         will come with the mass media

                         camp of the mind.  The super state

                         best of all possible worlds, and in

                         fundamental power from the hands of 
                         the American people and validates

                         d'etat.  Its most direct and tragic 
                         result was a reversal of President 
                         Kennedy's commitment to withdraw 
                         from Vietnam.  War is the biggest 
                         business in America worth $80 billion 
                         a year.  The President was murdered 
                         by a conspiracy planned in advance 
                         at the highest levels of the United 
                         States government and carried out by

                         Hoover and Lyndon Johnson, whom I

                         assassination - your former President 
                         Lyndon Baines Johnson and your new 
                         President, Richard Nixon - to release

                         Oswald and Jack Ruby, or the secret 
                         CIA memo on Oswald's activities in 
                         Russia that was "destroyed" while

                         who might be too disturbed to face 
                         this reality, because you might lynch

                         documents for another 75 years.  I'm 
                         in my 40's, so I'll have shuffled 
                         off this mortal coil by then, but 
                         I'm already telling my 8 year - old 
                         son to keep himself physically fit 
                         so that one glorious September morning

                         Archives and find out what the CIA 
                         and the FBI knew.  They may even 
                         push it back then.  It may become a 
                         generational affair, with questions 
                         passed down from father to son, mother 
                         to daughter, in the manner of the 
                         ancient runic bards.  Someday 
                         somewhere, someone might find out 
                         the damned Truth.  Or we might just 
                         build ourselves a new Government 
                         like the Declaration of Independence 
                         says we should do when the old one

                         thought that justice came into being 
                         automatically, that virtue was its

                         fact."  Individual human beings have 
                         to create justice and this is not 
                         easy because truth often presents a 
                         threat to power and we have to fight 
                         power often at great risk to 
                         ourselves.  People like Julia Ann 
                         Mercer, S.M. Holland, Lee Bowers, 
                         Jean Hill, and Willie O'Keefe have 
                         come forward and taken that risk.

                              of letters)
                         I have here some $8000 in these 
                         letters sent to my office from all 
                         over the country - quarters, dimes, 
                         dollar bills from housewives, 
                         plumbers, car salesmen, teachers, 
                         invalids ... These are the people 
                         who cannot afford to send money but 
                         do, these are the ones who drive the 
                         cabs, who nurse in the hospitals, 
                         who see their kids go to Vietnam.  
                         Why?  Because they care, because 
                         they want to know the truth - because 
                         they want their country back, because 
                         it belongs to us the people as long 
                         as the people got the guts to fight 
                         for what they believe in!  The truth 
                         is the most important value we have 
                         because if the truth does not endure, 
                         if the Government murders truth, if 
                         you cannot respect the hearts of 
                         these people...
                              (shaking the letters)
                         ...then this is no longer the country 
                         in which we were born in and this is 
                         not the country I want to die in...  
                         And this was never more true than 
                         for John F. Kennedy whose murder was 
                         probably the most terrible moment in 
                         the history of our country.  You the 
                         people, you the jury system, in 
                         sitting in judgement on Clay Shaw, 
                         represent the hope of humanity against 
                         Government power.  In discharging 
                         your duty, in bringing the first 
                         conviction in this house of cards 
                         against Clay Shaw, "Ask not what 
                         your country can do for you, but 
                         what you can do for your country."  
                         Do not forget your young President 
                         who forfeited his life.  Show the 
                         world this is still a government of 
                         the people, for the people, and by 
                         the people.  Nothing as long as you 
                         live will ever be more important.
                              (he stares into the 
                              camera)
                         It's up to you.

               He returns to the table and sits.  The courtroom is still.

               CUT TO: later in the same courtroom.  The jury files in, 
               having reached a verdict.  Jim, prepared, sits with his staff 
               and Liz.  The jury foreman enters the courtroom.

                                     JURY FOREMAN
                         We find Clay Shaw... not guilty on 
                         all counts.

               There's jubilation and commotion in the Court.  Shaw stands, 
               happily shaking hands all over... Members of the press run 
               for the phones.  In the corridor outside the courtroom, the 
               press interviews the jury foreman.

                                     FOREMAN
                         We believe there was a conspiracy, 
                         but whether Clay Shaw was a part of 
                         it is another kettle of fish.

               The camera moves to Jim, who walks out past the banks of 
               reporters.  TV lights are in his face.  Liz is by his side.

                                     ENGLISH REPORTER
                         Mr. Garrison, the American media is 
                         reporting this as a full vindication 
                         of the Warren Commission, do you...

                                     JIM
                         I think all it proves is you cannot 
                         run a trial even questioning the 
                         intelligence operations of the 
                         government in the light of day.

                         Picayune will call for your 
                         resignation - unfit to hold office.  
                         You've ruined Clay Shaw's reputation - 
                         are you going to resign?

                                     JIM
                         Hell, no.  I'm gonna run again.  And 
                         I'm gonna win.  Thank you very much.  
                         If it takes me 30 years to nail every 
                         one of the assassins, then I will 
                         continue this investigation for 30 
                         years.  I owe that not only to Jack 
                         Kennedy, but to my country.

               He and Liz squeeze hands as they walk on.

               DISSOLVE TO WASHINGTON, D.C. - (1970)

               Jim waits on the same park bench as earlier in the film, 
               overlooking the Mall or the Lincoln Monument... as X walks 
               up, a little grayer, a little more stooped, wearing ill 
               fitting civilian clothes.

                                     JIM
                         Well, thanks for coming.

                                     X
                         You didn't get that break you needed, 
                         but you went as far as any man could, 
                         bubba.
                              (he sits next to Jim)
                         What can I do for you?

                                     JIM
                         Just speculating, I guess.  How do 
                         you think it started?

                                     X
                         I think it started in the wind.  
                         Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon 
                         people, contractors, bankers, 
                         politicians like L.B.J. were committed 
                         to a war in Southeast Asia.  As early 
                         as '61 they knew Kennedy was going 
                         to change things... He was not going 
                         to war in Southeast Asia.  Who knows?  
                         Probably some boardroom or lunchroom 
                         somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, 
                         maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, 
                         it's international now.

               CUT TO: a New York lunch club or executive dining room.  
               From the window we have a towering view of the City.  Four 
               men in their 50's to 70's - old men, rich men, talk at a 
               quiet table.  Their figures are shadowy and we overhear their 
               conversation obliquely, across faces flared out by sun 
               bouncing off the skyscraper window.

                         with a few million dollars... and 
                         says something pretty direct like...

                                     RICH MAN 1
                         The sonofabitch is gonna get re-
                         elected by a bigger vote than ever 
                         in '64.  It's gonna be worse than 
                         Roosevelt.  The country won't survive 
                         as we know it.

                                     RICH MAN 2
                         I agree, Bob, it can't go on.
                              (he looks to Man 3)

                                     RICH MAN 3
                         ...and Bobby in '68?  Something's 
                         got to be done.

               Looks pass among them.  There's a pause, and then...

                                     RICH MAN 1
                         He's gotta go, Lou.  The election's 
                         gotta be stopped.

               There is a breathless moment with the thought in the air.

                                     RICH MAN 1
                         I talk to a lot of people.  I know 
                         I'm not the only one thinking this.

                         Jack?

               FLASHBACK TO: the Pentagon in 1962.

                                     X (V.O.)
                         ...so calls are made.  Down to 
                         Washington.  All over the world.  
                         They start talking about it.  A few 
                         people here, there.  Just 
                         conversations, nothing more...

               We see a general meeting with another general.  They talk.

                                     X (V.O.)
                         Generals, Admirals, CIA people, and 
                         probably some people on the inside 
                         of Kennedy's staff - young, brilliant 
                         Judases, ready to go to war in 
                         Southeast Asia...

               FLASHBACK TO: the White House, 1962.  A general talks to one 
               of Kennedy's staff - a bespectacled, bright young Harvard 
               type.

                                     X (V.O.)
                         ...and maybe a Vice-President getting 
                         separate memos from Vietnam, eager 
                         to get his backers the billions of 
                         dollars in contracts for Southeast 
                         Asia...

               In a White House office, Lyndon Johnson meets with a cabinet 
               member, a contractor, and two military men.

                                     X (V.O.)
                         Kennedy, like Caesar, is surrounded 
                         with enemies.  Something is underway 
                         but it has no face.  Yet everyone in 
                         the loop knows...

               The camera shows Washington, D.C. buildings from strange 
               angles.  The feeling is still, weird, angled, alien.  The 
               buildings are twisted.

                                     X (V.O.)
                         Money is at stake.  Big money.  A 
                         hundred billion.  The Kennedy brothers 
                         target voting districts for defense 
                         dollars.  They give TFX fighter 
                         contracts only to the counties that 
                         are going to make a difference in 
                         '64.  These people fight back.  Their 
                         way.  One day another call is made...

               In a Pentagon office, a man in civilian clothing is on the 
               phone, his back to the screen.  This is Mr. Y, X's superior 
               officer.  Shadows pervade the room.  An unshuttered window 
               overlooks the Potomac River and the White House.

                         ...maybe to somebody like my superior 
                         who's been running the "Mongoose" 
                         program out of Florida and who has 
                         no love for Kennedy.

                                     VOICE ON PHONE
                         Bill, we're going.  We need your 
                         help.

                         Everything's cellurized.  No one has 
                         said "he must die," there's been no 
                         vote, there's nothing on paper, 
                         there's no one to blame.  It's as 
                         old as the Crucifixion: the Mafia 
                         firing squad, one blank, no one's 
                         guilty because everyone in the Power 
                         Structure who knows anything has a 
                         plausible deniability.  There are no 
                         compromising connections except at 
                         the most secret point.  But what's 
                         paramount is that it must succeed.  
                         No matter how many die, how much it 
                         costs, the perpetrators must be on 
                         the winning side and never subject 
                         to prosecution for anything by anyone.

                         In the fall.  Probably in the south.

                         He's done it before.  Other countries.  
                         Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the 
                         Dominican Republic, he's working on 
                         Castro.  No big deal.  In September, 
                         Kennedy announces the Texas trip.  
                         At that moment, second Oswalds start 
                         popping up all over Dallas where 
                         they have the mayor and the cops in 
                         their pocket.  Y flies in the 
                         assassins, maybe from the special 
                         camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - 
                         pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, 
                         Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it 
                         really matter who shot from what 
                         rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The 
                         assassins by now are dead or well 
                         paid and long gone...

                         States!  That's entertainment!  And

                         straight answer.  General Y still

                         there that day in Dealey Plaza.  You 
                         know how I know?

               entrance of the Book Depository, Y, in a dark suit, is 
               nonchalantly walking past the hoboes, his back to us.  The 
               camera closes in on Y.

                         him.  The way he walked... arms at 
                         his side, military, the stoop, the 
                         haircut, the twisted left hand, the 
                         large class ring.  What was he doing 
                         there?  If anyone had asked him, 
                         he'd probably say "protection" but 
                         I'll tell you I think he was giving 
                         some kind of "okay" signal to those 
                         hoboes - they're about to get booked 
                         and he's telling 'em it's gonna be 
                         okay, they're covered.  And in fact 
                         they were - you never heard of them 
                         again.

               ON A BLACK SCREEN WE READ:

               ** In 1975, VICTOR MARCHETTI, former executive assistant to 
               the CIA's deputy director, stated that during high - level 
               CIA meetings during Shaw's trial in 1969, CIA director RICHARD 
               HELMS disclosed that CLAY SHAW and DAVID FERRIE had worked 
               for the Agency, and asked his assistants to make sure Mr. 
               Shaw received Agency help at his trial.

               ** In 1979, RICHARD HELMS, director of covert operations in 
               1963, admitted under oath that CLAY SHAW had Agency 
               connections.

               ** It is now known that in 1963, U.S. military intelligence 
               controlled more agents than the CIA and had almost as much 
               money to spend.  It surfaced in the 1970's that the Army had 
               long been conducting surveillance and keeping files on 
               thousands of private citizens in the name of national 
               security.  The prime targets were dissident-left-wingers of 
               the kind Oswald appeared to be.

               ** CLAY SHAW died in 1974 of supposed lung cancer.  No autopsy 
               was allowed.

               ** WILLIAM SULLIVAN, Assistant Director of the FBI, died in 
               the early morning hours of November 9,177 when he was mistaken 
               for a deer in an open field in New Hampshire.  Shortly before 
               his death, Sullivan had a preliminary hearing with the HSCA.

               ** GEORGE DE MOHRENSCHILDT committed suicide just hours after 
               HSCA investigator Gaeton Fonzi located him.

               ** In November, 1969 JIM GARRISON was re-elected to a third 
               term as District Attorney of Orleans Parish.  In June of 
               1971, he was arrested by Federal Agents on charges of allowing 
               payoffs on pinball gambling by organized crime.  In September 
               of 1973, after defending himself in Federal Court, he was 
               quickly found not guilty of charges that appear to have been 
               framed against him.  Less than six weeks later, he was 
               narrowly defeated for a fourth term as District Attorney.

               ** In 1978, Garrison was elected Judge of the Louisiana State 
               Court of Appeal in New Orleans.  He was re - elected in 1988.  
               To this date, he has brought the only public prosecution in 
               the Kennedy killing.

               ** ELIZABETH and Jim were divorced in 1978.  He now lives in 
               the same house he lived in with Elizabeth.  She lives a block 
               away.  Their five children are grown.

               ** SOUTHEAST ASIA: 58,000 American lives, 2 million Asian 
               lives, $220 billion spent, 10 million Americans air - lifted 
               there by commercial aircraft, more than 5,000 helicopters 
               lost, 6.5 million tons of bombs dropped.

               ** A Congressional Investigation from 1976 - 1979 found a 
               "probable conspiracy" in the assassination of John F. Kennedy 
               and recommended the Justice Department investigate further.  
               As of 1991, the Justice Department has done nothing.  The 
               files of the House Select Committee on Assassinations are 
               locked away until the year 2029.
