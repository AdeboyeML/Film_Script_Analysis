          INT KITTREDGE'S APARTMENT LIVING ROOM DAWN
          JOHN FLANDERS KITTREDGE and LOUISA KITTREDGE ("FLAN" and
          "OUISA") , an attractive couple in their 40s, in their night
          clothes are in an uncharacteristic state of shock.
          Some sort of horrible disaster has happened to them.
          THEY survey their living room which under normal
          circumstances would appear to be a serene haven.
          But why are they-so aghast? And terrified?
          Has the apartment been violated?
          The Fifth Avenue apartment, red and cozy, threadbare with
          the legacy of years of kids and dogs running in and out, is
          filled with beautiful objects chosen with care. Even though
          the apartment is 19th Century in feel, a lot of modern
          paintings hang on the walls.
          No. No visible disaster here.
          But then why FLAN and OUISA's emotional state? THEY run
          between the hall and the living room.

                         OUISA
          Is anything gone?
          OUISA opens the front closet with trepidation. But nothing
          leaps out. SHE sees a mink is still there..

                         FLAW
          How can I look? I'm shaking.

                         OUISA
          My god! The Kandinsky!
          0UISA runs into the living room. SHE can see by the
          discoloration on that wall that a painting is missing.

                         OUISA Y
          It's gone! Call the police!

                         FLAN
          There it is!
          An early abstract painting by Kandinsky leans against a
          Philadelphia Chippendale chair: the painting is wild and
          brilliantly colored.

                         0UISA
          Thank god!
          SHE picks the painting up and flips it around. It's a double
          sided painting. The artist, Kandinsky, had painted in
          different styles on either side of the canvas.

          One side of the painting is geometric and somber; the other
          side is all chaos and brilliant colors.
          OUISA replaces the framed canvas on the wall where it
          belongs, but the side she chooses to display is the
          geometric side. SHE admires it.
          FLAN opens the door from the hall into

          THE OFFICE.
          A computer. Calendars. File cabinets. Bulletin boards with
          prints of paintings tacked on. FLAN checks - the slide
          projector is there. FLAN opens and closes cabinet drawers.
          OUISA appears in the doorway of the office.

                         OUISA
          We could've been killed.

                         FLAN
          Don't say that. The silver Victorian inkwell!
          FLAN runs past OUISA down the hall back to the living room.
          OUISA follows HIM back into

          THE LIVING ROOM.
          FLAN looks on an antique table crowded with framed family
          photographs going way back in time and all kinds of
          mementoes.

                         OUISA
          How can you think of things? We could have been
          murdered.

                         FLAN
          I want to know if anything's gone?
          HE picks up an ornate Victorian inkwell capped by a silver
          beaver and looks at it with great objectivity..

                         FLAN
          There's the inkwell. Silver beaver. Why?
          OUISA, drained, looks out the window down onto Central Park.

                         OUISA
          Slashed ---our throats slashed.
          Go to bed at night happy and then murdered.
          Would we have-woken up?
          OUISA screams.

          But it's their pug dog licking her leg.
          OUISA picks up the dog and pets it.
          FLAN remembers something and buries his face in his hands.


                         FLAN
          We have to go to the wedding.

                         OUISA
          I am in no mood to go to any wedding.

          OUISA runs to HIM, terrified. HE holds HER.

          You don't call out Hello unless--
          THEY walk softly to the dark hall.

                         FLAN
          I think we could tell if someone else was here.

                         OUISA
          We didn't all night.

          We don't know where we are yet but it's certainly not the

          thunder and the soft cool jazz playing makes the air of this
          room with the white wall, wherever it is, claustrophobic,
          even erotic.
          A YOUNG BLACK MAN whose name is PAUL comes into frame and
          leans against this white wall. Right off, you say this
          YOUNG MAN is a winner.
          PAUL frowns, then smiles. Right into the camera.

          OUISA and FLAN run out of their apartment building, their
          clothes hastily pulled on, their faces swollen with shock.
          THEY run down the side street into

          Their car is waiting - a Mercedes - FLAN slips the

                         GEOFFREY
          Wonderful view.

                         OUISA
          The phrase - striking coal miners - I see all
           these very striking coal miners modelling the
          fall fashions.

                         GEOFFREY
          Where should we?

                         FLAN
          There's good Szechuan. And Hunan.

                         OUISA
          The sign painter screwed up the sign. Instead
          of The Hunan Wok, he painted The Human Wok.

                         GEOFFREY
          God! The restaurants! New York has become the
          Florence of the Sixteenth Century. Genius on
          every corner.

                         OUISA
          I don't think genius has kissed the Human Wok.
          THEY finish off their drinks.

                         GEOFFREY
          The new Italian looked cheery.
          FLAN and OUISA
          Good.

                         FLAN
          We made reservations.
          FLAN looks at the slide projector.

                         FLAN
          Geoffrey, I'd like to show -
          FLAN'S sentence hangs in mid-air as GEOFFREY follows OUISA

                         INTO

          THE HALL.
          OUISA burrows in the closet getting her coat and
          GEOFFREY's coat out of the hall closet stuffed with tennis
          rackets and skis and boots.

          like salt water taffy.
          FLAN appears behind HER to help HER.
          THEY both wrestle the coats out of the closet.

                         FLAN
          Six on a plate for a few hundred dollars.
          And FLAN gets the coats. A clatter of tennis rackets
          falling. GEOFFREY takes his topcoat.

                         GEOFFREY
          You have to come to South Africa so
          I can pay you back. I'll take you on my plane
          into the Okavango Swamps -

                         OUISA
          Did you hear - to take back to Johannesburg.

          Dean and DeLuca -
          FLAN helps OUISA on with her coat.

                         OUISA
          one of the Dean and DeLuca look alikes. Gets a
          pack of cigarettes and an ice cream bar. Goes
          up front. Sees there's a line at the register.
          Slaps down two twenty dollar bills and goes out.
          GEOFFREY doesn't get the anecdote.

                         FLAN
          We sent it to the Times.
          GEOFFREY smiles politely.
          FLAN and OUISA press a little bit too hard.

                         OUISA
          They have the joke page of things
          around New York.

          THE CHUMS listen enrapt. OUISA is serious.

          Million dollars Two Million dollars.

                         FLAN

           OUISA and FLAN laugh brightly. THE FRONT DOORBELL rings.
           OUISA and FLAN look at each other. Who is that?
          OUISA goes into the hall.

                         OUISA
          What ever you do, don't think about elephants.

          FLAN rapidly steers GEOFFREY to a chair, closes the living
          room door, then wheels a projector with a carousel tray into
          place.

          FLAN switches off the room's lights and clicks on the
          projector. The slide projection of a beautiful green
          landscape by Cezanne fills the wall by the door.

          Mid-period. Landscape of a dark green forest.
          In the far distance you see the sunlight. One
          of his first uses of a pale color being forced
          to carry the weight of the picture. The
          experiment that would pay of f in the apples. A
          burst of color asked to carry so much-- The
          Japanese don't like anything about it except
          it's a Cezanne--
          And suddenly the door in the wall opens up.
          A YOUNG BLACK MAN supported by the ELEVATOR MAN, (EDDIE)
          appears in the Cezanne forest holding his eyes against the
          projector's light. And OUISA behind HIM.
          FLAN clicks off the projector.
          OUISA switches on the living room lights.
          THE YOUNG BLACK MAN - PAUL - is in his early twenties, very
          handsome, very preppy. His shirt front is ripped and
          bloodied. Fresh blood. EDDIE helps PAUL to the sofa,
          OUISA following at a loss.

          shirt.

          His shirt's bleeding.

          PAUL sits on the side of the tub.
          PAUL takes off his blazer and pulls off his ripped shirt.
          His tie is still around his neck. There is a good sized
           knife slash in his side by his rib cage. OUISA and FLAN
          cringe. FLAN opens the medicine cabinet.

          bedroom. PAUL watches OUISA as she goes into

          THE MASTER BEDROOM.
          OUISA rummages through her book case and finds her Red
          Cross manual. OUISA turns and sees PAUL sitting on the edge
          of the tub staring at HER.

          Kittredges are kind. So after the muggers left,
          I looked up and saw these Fifth Avenue

          mantlepiece and looks at a dark abstract painting.

                         PAUL
           They described this apartment in detail. This
          is a Kandinsky! - a double. One painted on
          either side. May I see - ?
          OUISA lifts the painting off the wall and turns it around.
          Even GEOFFREY is taken by the painting.

          What makes it valuable is Kandinsky painted on
          either side of the canvas in two wildly
          different styles. One side is geometric and
          somr=r. The other side is wild and vivid.

                         GEOFFREY

          We flip it around for variety.
          OUISA happily turns the painting back and forth to show off
          its two sides. The SCREEN is filled with the bright colors
          then the dark colors.

          Chaos? Control?
          SHE puts on a goofy happy face for the chaotic side and a
          dopey tragic face for the geometric. Yes. We've been here
          before, through OUISA's memory, at the wedding.

                         PAUL

          Wassily Kandinsky. Born 1866 Moscow. Blue
          Rider Exhibition 1914. He said "It is clear
          that the choice of object that is one of the
          elements in the harmony of form must be decided
          only by a corresponding vibration in the human

          PAUL, leaning against the wall, talks with great vivacity to
          that OFF SCREEN PRESENCE who is the POV of the camera.

                         PAUL
          Sidney Poitier, the future Jackie Robinson of
          films, was born the twenty fourth of February
          1927 in Miami during a visit his parents made to
          Florida - legally? -to sell tomatoes they had
          grown on their farm in the Bahamas. He grew up
          on Cat Island, "so poor they didn't even own
          dirt" he has said. Neglected by his family, my
          father would sit on the shore, and, as he told
          me many times, "conjure up the kind of worlds
          that were on the other side and what I'd do in
           them." He arrived in New York City from the
           Bahamas in the winter of 1943 at age fifteen and
           a half and lived in the pay toilet of the bus
           station across from the old Madison Square
           Garden at Fiftieth and Eighth Avenue. He moved
           to the roof of the Brill building, commonly
           known as Tin Pan Alley. Washed dishes at the
           Turf restaurant for $4.11 a night. He taught
          0 himself to read by reading the newspaper. In the
           Black newspaper, the theater page was opposite
           the Want Ad page. Among his 42 films are No Way
           Out 1950/ Cry the Beloved Country 1952/
           Blackboard Jungle 1955/ The Defiant Ones 1958/
           Raisin in the Sun 1961/ Lilies of the Field
           1963/ In the Heat of the Night 1967/ To Sir With
           Love 1967/ Shoot to Kill 1988 and, of course,

                         PAUL (LAUGHS)
          He won the Oscar for Lilies of the Field and
          was twice named top male box-office star in
          the country. My father made no films from 1977
          to 1987 but worked as director and author. Dad
          said to me once "I still don't fully understand
          how all that came about in the sequence it came
          about".
          And we hear the OFF SCREEN PRESENCE applauding.
          PAUL bows, happily.
          HE kicks his shoe off into the camera.

          BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S KITCHEN
          THE KITCHEN is large, was built in the 205 when people had
          big dinners at home.
          PAUL opens the refrigerators and freezers.
          PAUL'S actions are synchronous with the words.

                         FLAN (VO)
          We watched him cook.

          It's all dazzling and rapid. FLAN opens the wine. OUISA
          takes dishes and silver out and hands them to GEOFFREY.
          EVERYONE is in a picnic spirit. PAUL fills a large pot with
          water from the tap.

          Johannesburg.
          PAUSE. PAUL Studies GEOFFREY. OUISA and FLAN freeze.
          Is it a tense moment?
          PAUL takes a breath. PAUL puts the water on the fire, eyes
          never off GEOFFREY. Then PAUL resumes chopping onions
          briskly and dropping them into the frying pan.

                         PAUL
          My dad took me to a movie shot in South Africa.
          The camera moved from this vile rioting in the

                         
          streets to a villa where people picked at lunch
          on a terrace, the only riot the flowers and the
          birds-- gorgeous plumage and petals. And I
          didn't understand. And Dad said to me "You meet
          these young blacks who are having a terrible
          time. They've had a totally inadequate
          education and yet in '76 - the year of the
          Soweto riots - they took on a tremendous
          political responsibility. It just makes you
          wonder at the maturity that is in them."
          PAUL opens a cabinet and takes out a Haitian candelabra that
          obviously hasn't been used since it was brought home as a
          souvenir. PAUL dusts it off.

                         PAUL
          it makes you realize that the 'crummy childhood'
          theory, that everything can be blamed in a
          Freudian fashion on the fact that you've had a
          bad upbringing, just doesn't hold water. May I?

          puts it in the microwave.

                         PAUL
          My problem is I've never felt American.
          I grew up in Switzerland. Boarding school.
          Villa Rosey.

                         OUISA
          There is a boarding school in Switzerland that
          takes you at age eighteen months.

                         PAUL
          That's not me. I've never felt people liked me
          for my connections. Movie star kid problems.
          None of those.
          THE WATER boils. HE dumps in pasta.
          The microwave timer goes off. PAUL removes the glass dish.

                         PAUL
          But I never knew I was black in that racist way
          0 till I was sixteen and came back here. Very
          protected. White servants. After the divorce we
          moved to Switzerland. My mother, brother and Z.
          I don't feel American. I don't even feel black.
          I suppose that's very lucky for me even though
          Freud says there's no such thing as luck. Just
          what you make.
          PAUL takes the pasta off the boil and drains it, plopping
          the pasta into a brightly colored bowl.
          OUISA, FLAN and GEOFFREY sit at the counter, transfixed.

                         OUISA
          Does Freud say that?
          PAUL holds out three dishes heaped with food.

          The overhead chandelier is very bright and harsh.
          A sewing machine is in the corner there.
          Bookkeeping items at one end of the long table.
          Nineteenth century Victorian mythological paintings hang.on
          the walls. FLAN adjusts the rheostat to dim the lights in
          the chandelier.

          Don't look at the sewing machine.
          FLAN sweeps the bill things off the table onto a chair.
          OUISA opens the sideboard and takes out four linen place
          mats and silverware and quickly sets the table.
          PAUL takes out matches and lights the Haitian card"e'Yabra.
          FLAN runs into the living room and returns with a vase of

          to play a lumberjack up in the Yukon. Now, I've
          been trained as a Preacher, but my church fell

          I want to get back to my wife. Out of this

          in tears and I say Pop, this i:. not a real
           event, this is some script that was sent to
          you. And my father says ' I' m trying it out to
          see how it fits on me.' But he has no life--he
          has no memory--only the scripts producers send
          him in the mail through his agents. That's his

          A substitute teacher out on Long Island was
          dropped from his job for fighting with a
          student. A few weeks later, the teacher
          returned to the classroom, shot the student
          unsuccessfully, held the class hostage and then
          shot himself. Successfully. This fact caught my
          eye: last sentence. Times. A neighbor
          described the teacher as a nice boy. Always
          reading Catcher In the Rye.
          The nitwit - Chapman - who shot John Lennon said
          he did it because he wanted to-`draw the
          attention of the world to Catcher In the Rye and
          the reading of that book would be his defense.
          And young Hinckley, the whiz kid who shot Reagan
          and his press secretary said if you want my
          defense all you have to do is read catcher in
          the Rye. It seemed to be time to read it again.

          I borrowed a copy from a young friend of mine
          because I wanted to see what she had underlined
          and I read this book to find out why this
          touching, beautiful, sensitive story published
          in July 1951 had turned into this manifesto of
          hate.
          I started reading. : It's exactly as I
          remembered. Everybody's a phoney. Page two: "My
          brother's in Hollywood being a prostitute."
          Page three: "what a phony slob his father was."
          Page nine: "People never notice anything."
          Then on page twenty two my hair stood up.
          Remember Holden Caulfield--the definitive
          sensitive youth--wearing his red hunter's cap.
          "A deer Hunter hat? Like hell it is. I sort of
          closed one eye like I was taking aim at it.
          This is a people shooting hat. I shoot people
          in this hat."

          Hmmm, I said. This book is preparing people for
          bigger moments in their lives than I ever
          dreamed of.
          Then on p. 89 "I'd rather push a guy out the
           window or chop his head off with an ax than sock
          him in the jaw. I hate fist fights...what
          scares me most is the other guy's face..."
          I finished the book. It's a touching story,
          comic because the boy wants to do so much and
          can't do anything. Hates all phoniness and only
          lies to others. Wants everyone to like him, is
          only hateful, and is completely self involved.
          In other words, a pretty accurate picture of a
          male adolescent.
          FLAN, OUISA, .GEOFFREY are transfixed.
           And what alarms me about that book--not the book
           so much as the aura about it--is this: the book
           is primarily about paralysis. The boy can't
           function. And at the end before he can run
          away and start a new life, it starts to rain and
          he folds. Now there's nothing wrong in writing
          about emotional and intellectual paralysis. It
          may indeed thanks to Chekhov and Samuel Beckett
          be the great modern theme.
          The extraordinary last lines of Waiting For
          Godot--"Let's go." "Yes, let's go." Stage
          directions: They do not move.
          But the aura around this book of Salinger's--
          which perhaps should be read by everyone ut
          young men---is this: It mirrors like a fun
          house mirror and amplifies like a distorted
          speaker one of the great tragedies of our times-
          --the death of the imagination.
          Because what else is paralysis?

          imaginative summer recipe--and Star wars! So
          imaginative and Star Trek--so imaginative! And
          Lord of the Rings--all those dwarves--so

                         IMAGINATIVE---
          The imagination has moved out of the realm of
          being our link, our most personal link, with our
          inner lives and the world outside that world--
          this world we share--what is schizophrenia but a
          horrifying state where what's in here doesn't
          match up with what's out there?
          Why has imagination become a synonym for style?
          I believe that the imagination is the passport
          we create to take us into the real world.
          I believe the imagination is another phrase for
          what is most uniquely Is.

                         
          Jung says the greatest sin is to be unconscious.
          Our boy Holden says "what scares me most is the
          other guy's face--it wouldn't be so bad if you
          could both be blindfolded"--most of the time the
          faces we face are not the other guys' but our
          own faces. And it's the worst kind of
          yellowness to be so scared of yourself you put
          blindfolds on rather than deal with yourself.
          To face ourselves.
          That's the hard thing.
          The imagination.
          That's God's gift to make the act of self-
          examination bearable.

          But I'll get it back to you tomorrow. I want my

          You see how easy it is.

          Sure. If Paul does the cooking.
          FLAN, OUISA and PAUL laugh.
          OUISA goes into the bathroom and fills a glass with water
          and puts it on the night table.

          FLAN and OUISA get ready for bed, undressing, hanging jacket
          and trousers up neatly. OUISA undoes her dress.
          THEY are in and out of bathroom and bedroom, -brushing
          teeth.

          FLAN putting on pajamas, OUISA her nightgown.

                         FLAN
          I don't want to lose our life here. I don't
          want all the debt to pile up and crush us.

                         OUISA
          It won't. We're safe.
          OUISA in bed turns off the light.
           FLAN looks out the window onto the park.

                         FLAN
          For a while. We almost lost it. If I didn't

          Cezanne. It would've gone. I had nowhere to
          get it.

                         OUISA
          I dreamt of Sidney Poitier and his rise to
          acclaim. I dreamt that Sidney Poitier sat at
          the edge of my bed and I asked him what troubled
          him? Sidney? What troubles you? Is it right
          to make a movie of Cats?

                         

          BACK IN THE MASTER BEDROOM
          FLAN is asleep on his side of the bed. OUISA is wide awake,
          staring at A MAN in dinner clothes, who sits on the edge of
          her bed. His back is to the camera. Is it SIDNEY POITIER?
          THE CAMERA drifts in to OUISA, who is transfixed by this
          apparition.
          "SIDNEY" (very comforting)
          I'll tell you why I have to make a movie of
          Cats. I know what Cats is, Louisa. May I call
          you Louisa?
          (OUISA nods Yes)
          I have no illusions about the merits of Cats.
          But the world has been too heavy with all the
          right to lifers. Protect the lives of the
          unborn. Constitutional amendments. Marches!
          When does life begin? Or the converse. The end
          of life. The Right To Die. Why is life at this
          point in the 20th century so focussed on the
          very beginning of life and the very end of life?
          What about the eighty years we have to live
          between those two inexorable book ends?
          THE CAMERA closes on OUISA. Her face, seen over "SIDNEY's"
          shoulder, is all wonder.

          "SIDNEY'S" face. ï¿½,.
          It is PAUL.

                         PAUL/SIDNEY

                         OUISA
          Thank you. Thank you. You shall.
          THE CAMERA circles off PAUL to OUISA. She is asleep.
          CUT BACK to reveal
          No one is sitting on the bed.
          THE CAMERA moves onto FLAN's face, sleeping.
          Slides of paintings by Matisse, Picasso, De Kooning, Pollock
          appear over his face.

                          FLAN (VO)
           This is what I dreamt. I didn't dream so much
           as realize this. I felt so close to the
           paintings. I wasn't just selling like pieces
           of meat. I remembered why I loved paintings in
           the first place - what had got me into this -
           and I thought - dreamed - remembered-

           INT AIRPLANE HANGAR
           FLAN happily sits in the bright vast empty space at a slide
           carousel projecting slides of paintings into the air.

                          FLAN (VO)
           How easy it is for a painter to lose a
           painting. He can paint and paint - work on a
           canvas for months and one day he loses it - just
           loses the structure - loses the sense of it -
           you lose the painting.
          A BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT shines on FLAN who turns to see
          A TEACHER, in her forties, very pure and happy, hanging
          beautiful and brilliantly colored children's drawings in the
          air. FLAN'S VOICE echoes in this vast space.

          Secret? I don't have any secret. I just know
          when to take their drawings away from them.
          THE TEACHER hangs pink shapes like paper versions of PAUL'S
          button down shirt on a clothes line stretching to the end of
          the hangar.

          you up and says this is what I'm afraid of. Do
          not listen to me at your peril. The
          imagination is the noon voice that sees clearly
          and says yes this is what I want for my life.
          It's there to sort out your nightmare, to show
          you the exit from the maze of-your nightmare, to
          transform the nightmare into dreams that become
          your bedrock. If we don't listen to that voice,

          DR. FINE puts the key in the door. The COP with HIM has his
          gun drawn. DR. FINE and THE COP enter

          THE BROWNSTONE.
          THEY hear a Debussy quartet playing.
          PAUL sits in the living room wearing a silk robe, swirling a
          snifter of brandy, listening to the music.
          PAUL smiles when HE sees DR. FINE, but when the COP appears
          with the gun, PAUL rolls over on his side out of the chair.

          DR. FINE
          Arrest him!
          DR. FINE snaps off the radio.

          rest back into the bottle. And I've used
          electricity listening to the music, but I think
          you'll find that nothing's taken from the house.
          PAUL takes off the silk robe and neatly places it on the
          table.

          degrees of separation. Between us and everybody
          else on this planet. The President of the
          United States. A. gondolier in Venice. Fill in

          Chinese water torture that we're so close.
          Because you have to find the right six people to
          make the connection. It's not just big names.
          It's anyone. A native in a rain forest. A
          Tierra del Fuegan. An Eskimo. I am bound to
          everyone on this planet by a trail of six
          people. It's a profound thought. How Paul found
          us. How to find the man whose son he pretends to
          be. Or perhaps j& his son, although I doubt it.
          How every person is a new door, opening up into
          other worlds. Six degrees of separation between
          me and everyone else on this planet. But to
          find the right six people.

                         RICK
          Your brothers and sisters?

                         PAUL (BITTER)
          They go to Andover and Exeter and Harvard and
          Yale. The awful thing is my father started out
          good. My mother says there is a good man inside
          s J. Flanders Kittredge.

                         ELIZABETH
          He'll see you if he is that good. He can't
          forget you entirely.

                         PAUL
          I call him. He hangs up.

                         RICK
          Go to his office -

                         PAUL
          He doesn't have an office. He works out of
          there. They won't even let me in the elevator.

                         RICK
          Dress up as a messenger.

                         ELIZABETH

          You love each other? a

          A lot.
          RICK and ELIZABETH touch each other's hands.
          PAUL (standing up to go)
          I hope we can meet again.

                         RICK
          Where do you live?
          PAUL looks around HIM and makes a hopeless grand gesture.

                         PAUL
          Live? I'm,home.
          PAUL picks up two plastic shopping bags which are filled
          with clothing.

                         

                         ELIZABETH

                         PAUL
          You're such assholes. Where would I live?
          PAUL shrugs his shoulders and leaves.
          RICK and ELIZABETH look at each other then follow him down
          the path leading through the park to the carousel.
          THE CAROUSEL calliope plays merrily.

                         RICK
          Stay with us.

                         ELIZABETH
          We just have a railroad flat in a tenement --
          PAUL looks at a bank of daffodils planted by the carousel.
          HE begins picking a bouquet of daffodils.
          RICK and ELIZABETH are being as persuasive as they can.

                         RICK
           It's over a roller disco. The last of the
           roller discos but it's quiet by five AM and a
          great narrow space -

          INT RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT DAY
          RICK and ELIZABETH'S tenement is disastrously crummy and
          probably violates every building code. But, yes, light
          does flow in through that one narrow window.
          PAUL puts the bouquet of daffodils into a jelly jar and sets
          it down on a board that covers the tub.

          ELIZABETH composes herself.
          OUISA pours ELIZABETH a glass of water.

                         ELIZABETH
           He stayed for a few weeks. He taught
          us so much. We even thought he was the
          reason for coming to New York. He opened
          up a new world for us. That's all anybody
          wants, isn't it? A new world?
          OUISA looks at FLAN.

          RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT
          RICK and ELIZABETH listen intently to PAUL.

                         PAUL
          This is the way you must speak.
          Hear my accent. Hear my voice.
          Never say you're going horse back riding.
          You say You're going Riding. And don't
          say Couch. Say Sofa. And you say bodd-ill.
          It's bottle. Say bottle of beer.

          Hello hello!
          SHE opens the beers. PAUL regards RICK for a moment.
          PAUL takes the bottle of beer.
          RICK and ELIZABETH share the other.

                         PAUL
          Bottle of beer. And never be afraid of rich
          people. You know what they love? A fancy pot
          of jam. That's all. Get yourself a patron.
          That's what you need. You shouldn't be waiting
          tables. You're going to wake up one day and the
          temporary job you picked up to stay alive is
          going to be your full time life.
          ELIZABETH is struck by his advice and embraces PAUL
          gratefully.

          water. FLAN takes OUISA's hand.

          RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT
          RICK and ELIZABETH have made love and lay on their backs in
          bed and dream.

                         RICK
          I'll tell you all the parts I want to play.
          Vanya in Uncle Vanya.

          RICK'waits to see that ELIZABETH is through, then:

                         RICK
          I'd like a shot at Laertes. I think
          it's a much better part.
          ELIZABETH gazes in a mirror that- SHE holds close to her
          face.

                         ELIZABETH
          Do you think it'll hurt me?

                         RICK
           What'll hurt you?

                         ELIZABETH
          My resemblance to Liv Ullmann.
          PAUL runs into the loft.

                         PAUL
          He wrote me! I wrote him and he _
          wrote me back! He's going to give
          me a thousand dollars! And that's
          just for starters! He sold a Cezanne
          to the Japanese and made millions and
          he can give me money without her knowing it.
          PAUL lets out a whoop and leaps up onto the bed with RICK
          and ELIZABETH in it and begins jumping up and down.

                         ELIZABETH
          I knew it!
          PAUL goes to a corner which contains a single mattress on
          the floor and begins to pack his few things back in the
          plastic bags.

          PAUL hugs THEM.

                         PAUL
          But I am going to give you the money to put on a
          showcase of any play you want and you'll be in
          it and agents will come see you and you'll be
          seen and you'll be started. And when you win
          your Oscars - both of you - you'll look in the
          camera and thank me -
          ELIZABETH loves the moment and weeps her acceptance speech.

                         ELIZABETH
          I want to thank Paul Kittredge.

                         RICK

          THEY all hug each other and that's real.

                         PAUL
          One hitch. I'm going to meet him in Maine. He's
          up there visiting his parents in Dark Harbor.
          My grandparents whom I've never met. He's
          finally going to tell my grandparents about me.
          He's going to make up for lost time. He's going
          to give me money. I can go back home. Get my
          momma that beauty parlor she's wanted all her
          life. One problem. How am I going to get to
          Maine? The wife checks all the bills. He has
          to account for the money. She handles the purse
          strings. Where the hell am I going to get two
          hundred and fifty dollars to get to Maine?

          RICK - always laid back - is suddenly quite angry.

          I'll meet you both after work. If your father
          loves you, he'll get you the ticket up there.

           FLAN and OUISA have come to this Broadway Italian restaurant
          after the theater with a MAN and WOMAN who from their dress
          and manner are obviously in the theater: ANDREW and ZEANNIE.
          FLAN and OUISA are in mid-story.

          No! Let me explain. Paul found some extra
           money of his own and he wanted to thank us for
           staying here! He would've treated you but you
           had to work or else we would've . We rented
          these tuxedos! Isn't it a gas! He's going to
          give us the money back! And then I'm going to

          She'll have it back. With interest. Wonderful
          bouquet. Bouquet. That's what you call the
          taste of the wine. And I believe that wine from
          the even numbered years is generally the
          superior to the odd numbered years. Although

          SHE's in the LIVING ROOM.

          I'll knock em dead. But you've got to be careful
          in prison. You have to use condoms.

                         PAUL
          I won't have sex in prison. I only
          have sex when I'm happy.

          know you're special, they kill you.

          I don't think they kill you.
          PAUL puts the phone receiver over his head in a sudden
          gesture of fear. Then HE returns the receiver to his ear.

          PAUL beams as HE becomes the PAUL from that night. His
          imagination is off and running. The lights, from wherever
          HE is, shine on his face and reflect on the broken glass of

          Of all the PARTIES we've been to, this is the most luxurious
          of all, given by one of New York's legendary hostess's, a
          glamorous woman who must be in her late 80s, MRS. BANNISTER.
          OUISA and FLAN are here.
          This dinner is really a state occasion in honor of that
          United Nations type at MRS. BANNISTER'S right.
          But FLAN and OUISA have captured the table.

          We weren't family. We didn't know Paul's name.

          I went to the District Attorney's office.
          we weren't family. We didn't know Paul's name.

          EXT THE CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING

                         OUISA (VO)
          I called the Criminal Courts.
          I wasn't family. I didn't know Paul's name.

          THE FORMAL DINING ROOM

                         OUISA
          You see, I read today that a young man
          committed suicide in Riker's Island.
          Tied a shirt around his neck and hanged
          himself. Was it the pink shirt? This
          burst of color? The pink shirt. Was it Paul?
          We never found out who he was.

                         FLAN
          I'm sure it's not him.

          MRS. BANNISTER
          Yes. I agree. Isn't it amazing.

                         FLAN
          He'll be back. We haven't heard the last of
          him. The imagination. He'll find a way. Could
          we talk about something else? Our guest of
          honor tonight- it's such a pleasure to meet you-
          But.THE GUEST OF HONOR FROM THE UN leans forward.

          Why does it mean so much to you?

           He wanted to be us. Everything we are in the
          world, this paltry thing--our life--he wanted
          it. He stabbed himself to get into our lives.
          He envied us. We're not enough to be envied.

                         FLAN
          Like the papers said. We have hearts.

                         OUISA
          Having a heart is not the point. We were hardly
          taken in. We believed him -- for a few hours.
          He did more for us in a few hours than our
          children ever did. He wanted to be your
          child. Don't let that go. He sat out in that
          park and said that man is my father. He's in
          trouble and we don't know how to help him.

                         FLAN
          Help him? He could've killed me. And you.
          THE GUESTS agree.

                         OUISA
          You were attracted to him -

                         
          FLAN throws down his napkin in mock outrage. Almogj mock
          outrage.

                         FLAN
          Cut me out of that pathology! You are
          on your own -

                         OUISA
          Attracted by youth and his talent and the
          embarrassing prospect of being in the movie
          version of Cats. Did you put that in your Times
          piece? And we turn him into anecdote to dine out
          on. Like this. As we are right now. But it was
          an experience. I will not turn him into an
          anecdote. How do we fit what happened to us
          into life without turning it into an anecdote
          with no teeth and a punch line we'll mouth over
          and over for years to come. "Tell the story
          about the imposter who came into our lives---"
          "That reminds me of the time this boy--". And
          we become these human juke boxes spilling out
          these anecdotes. But it was an experience. How
          do we keep the experience?
          OUISA looks around the dinner table.
          THE GUESTS have decided to start on their dinners.

          That's why I love paintings. Cezanne. The
          problems he brought up are the problems painters
          are still dealing with. Color. Structure.
          Those are problems.
          OUISA (to herself)
          There is color in my life, but I'm not
          aware of any structure.

                         FLAN
          What are you saying, darling?
          OUISA looks at FLAN clinically. FLAN frowns and turns back
          to his dinner partner brightly.

                         FLAN
          Cezanne would leave blank spaces in his
          canvasses if he couldn't account for the brush
          stroke, give a reason for the color.

                         OUISA
          Then I am a collage of unaccounted-for brush
          strokes. I an all random.
           OUISA stands up from the dinner table.
          Her chair scrapes. There is an embarrassed rush.
          MRS. BANNISTER (an order)
          Sit down.
          OUISA leaves the dinner table.

          THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE FORMAL DINNER PARTY
          OUISA pushes the elevator button.
          FLAN comes into the hall.

          What kind of behavior is -

                         OUISA
          God, Flan, how much of your life
          can you account for?
          THE ELEVATOR DOOR opens.

                         FLAN
          Do you realize how important this woman is!
          SHE steps in the elevator. FLAN follows.

          FLAN follows OUISA through the lobby.

                         FLAN
          Are you drunk? What are you unhappy about? The
          Cezanne sale vent through. The Matisse went
          through. We are rich. Geoffrey's rich. Next
          month there's a Bonnard and after that -

          These are the times I would take a knife and dig
          out your heart. Answer me? How much of your -

                         FLAN
          - life can I account for! All! I am a gambler!
          OUISA smiles at the simplicity of her realization.

          We're a terrible match.

          She is a very important woman. I am hoping to
          do business! Did you see the paintings on her
          walls! She might want to sell! She
          FLAN glares at HER and turns back into the lobby and returns
          to the party.
          OUSIA moves to follow FLAN, then walks up PARK AVENUE, lost,
          agitated, unsure.
          OUISA walks on, remembering

          THE SISTINE CHAPEL.
          OUISA's hand completes the action.
          OUISA slaps the frescoed ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.
