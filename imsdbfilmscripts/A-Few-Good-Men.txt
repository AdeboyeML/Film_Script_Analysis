                                      July 15, 1991

                

               FADE IN:

               EXT. A SENTRY TOWER --

               -- in the middle of the night, in the middle of nowhere.

               Small beams of light coming from lamps attached to the tower 
               cut through the ground mist. We HEAR all the unidentifiable 
               sounds of night in the woods. We also HEAR, very, very 
               faintly, a slow, deliberate drum cadence. And as this starts, 
               we begin to MOVE SLOWLY UP THE TOWER, more becomes visible 
               now:... the sandbags on the ground piled ten-high... the 
               steel, fire escape-type stairway wrapping around the structure 
               and leading to the lookout post, and finally... THE LOOKOUT 
               POST, maybe forty feet off the ground.

               Standing the post is the silhouette of A MARINE. He's holding 
               a rifle and staring straight out.

               The drum cadence has been building slightly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A WIDER SHOT OF THE FENCELINE. And we see by the moonlight 
               that the tall wire-mesh fence winds its way far, far into 
               the distance.

               SUBTITLE: UNITED STATES NAVAL BASE GUANTANAMO BAY - CUBA.

               The drum cadence continues, and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A MARINE BARRACKS

               We HEAR two pairs of footsteps and then

                                                                    CUT TO:

               THE BARRACKS CORRIDOR

               where we see that the footsteps belong to DAWSON and DOWNEY, 
               two young marines who we'll get to know later. They stop 
               when they get to a certain door. The drum cadence is still 
               growing. DAWSON puts his hand on the doorknob and turns it 
               slowly.  He opens's the door and they walk into

               INT. SANTIAGO'S ROOM - NIGHT

               WILLY SANTIAGO, a young, very slight marine, lies asleep in 
               his bunk.

               DAWSON kneels down by the bed, puts his hand on SANTIAGO'S 
               shoulder and shakes him gently. SANTIAGO opens his yes, looks 
               at DAWSON, and for a moment there's nothing wrong --

               -- and then SANTIAGO's eyes fill with terror. He lunges out 
               of the bed -- but forget about it. In one flash DAWSON and 
               DOWNEY grab him out of bed, and before the scream can come 
               out, DOWNEY's shoved a piece of cloth into SANTIAGO's mouth.

               Everything that happens next occurs with speed, precision 
               and professionalism.

               -- A strip of duct tape is pulled, ripped, and slapped onto 
               his mouth and eyes --

               -- A length of rope is wrapped around his hands and feet.

                                     DOWNEY
                              (quietly)
                         You're lucky it's us, Willy.

               -- An arm grabs him tightly around the neck, not choking 
               him, just holding his head still --

               -- The drum cadence has built to a crescendo. We HEAR four 
               sharp blasts from a whistle and we

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               EXT. THE WASHINGTON NAVY YARD - DAY

               and the drum cadence we've been hearing has turned into Semper 
               Fidelis and it's coming from THE U.S. MARINE CORPS BAND, a 
               sight to behold in their red and gold uniforms and polished 
               silver and brass.

               The BAND is performing on the huge and lush parade grounds 
               before a crowd made up mostly of TOURISTS and DAY-CAMPERS.

               As the TITLES ROLL, we watch the BAND do their thing from 
               various angles. Incredible precision is the name of the game. 
               Each polished black shoe hitting the ground as if they were 
               all attached by a rod. Each drumstick raised to the same 
               fraction of a centimeter before striking. A RIFLE DRILL TEAM 
               that can't possibly be human. Flags, banners, the works.

               HIGH ANGLE of the entire band an we end credits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A RED BRICK BUILDING - DAY

               It's an important building, a main building. A few SAILORS 
               enter and exit and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A WOMAN

               as she walks across the courtyard toward the brick building.  
               The WOMAN is JOANNE GALLOWAY, a navy lawyer in her early 
               30's. She's bright, attractive, impulsive, and has a tendency 
               to speak quickly. If she had any friends, they'd call her 
               JO. As she walks, she mutters to herself ...

                                     JO
                         I'm requesting... I'm... Captain, 
                         I'd like to request that I be the 
                         attorney assigned to rep -- I'd like 
                         to request that it be myself who is 
                         assigned to represent --
                              (she stops)
                         "That it be myself who is assigned 
                         to represent"? ...Good, Jo, that's 
                         confidence inspiring.

               We follow JO, still muttering, as she walks into the brick 
               building which bears the seal of the

               UNITED STATES NAVY - JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL'S CORPS

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WEST'S OFFICE - DAY

               As JO  enters. CAPTAIN WEST and two other officers, GIBBS 
               and LAWRENCE, sit around a conference table.

                                     GIBBS
                         Jo, come on in.

                                     JO
                         Thank you, sir.

                                     GIBBS
                         Captain West, this is Lt. Commander 
                         Galloway. Jo, you know Mike Lawrence.

                                     JO
                         Yes sir.
                              (to WEST)
                         Captain, I appreciate your seeing me 
                         on such short notice.

                                     WEST
                         I understand there was some trouble 
                         over the weekend down in Cuba.

                                     JO
                         Yes sir... This past Friday evening.  
                         Two marines, Corporal Harold Dawson 
                         and Private Louden Downey, entered 
                         the barracks room of a PFC William 
                         Santiago and assaulted him. Santiago 
                         died at the base hospital 
                         approximately an hour later. The NIS 
                         agent who took their statements 
                         maintains they were trying to prevent 
                         Santiago from naming them in a 
                         fenceline shooting incident. They're 
                         scheduled to have a hearing down in 
                         Cuba at 4:00 this afternoon.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         What's the problem?

                                     JO
                         Dawson and Downey are both recruiting 
                         poster marines and Santiago was known 
                         to be a screw-up. I was thinking 
                         that it sounded an awful lot like a 
                         code red.

               Jo lets this sink in a moment.

                                     WEST
                              (under his breath)
                         Christ.

                                     JO
                         I'd like them moved up to Washington 
                         and assigned counsel. Someone who 
                         can really look into this. Someone 
                         who possesses not only the legal 
                         skill, but a familiarity with the 
                         inner workings of the military. In 
                         short, Captain, I'd like to suggest 
                         that... I be the one who, that it be 
                         me who is assigned to represent them.
                              (beat)
                         Myself.

               Jo looks around the room for a response.

                                     WEST
                         Joanne, why don't you get yourself a 
                         cup of coffee.

                                     JO
                         Thank you, sir, I'm fine.

                                     WEST
                         Joanne, I'd like you to leave the 
                         room so we can talk about you behind 
                         your back.

                                     JO
                         Certainly, sir.

               JO gets up and walks out.

                                     WEST
                         I thought this Code Red shit wasn't 
                         going on anymore.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         With the marines at GITMO? Who the 
                         hell knows what goes on down there.

                                     WEST
                         Well lets find out before the rest 
                         of the world does, this thing could 
                         get messy. What about this woman?

                                     LAWRENCE
                         Jo's been working a desk at internal 
                         affairs for what, almost a year now.

                                     WEST
                         And before that?

                                     GIBBS
                         She disposed of three cases in two 
                         years.

                                     WEST
                         Three cases in two years? Who was 
                         she handling, the Rosenbergs?

                                     GIBBS
                         She's not cut out for litigation.

                                     LAWRENCE
                         She's a hall of an investigator, 
                         Jerry --

                                     GIBBS
                         In Internal Affairs, sure. She can 
                         crawl up a lawyer's ass with the 
                         best of 'em, but when it comes to 
                         trial work --

                                     WEST
                         I know. All passion, no street smarts. 
                         Bring her back in.

               LAWRENCE goes to the door and motions for JO to come back 
               in.

                                     WEST
                              (continuing)
                         Commander, we're gonna move the 
                         defendants up here in the morning.

                                     JO
                         Thank you, sir.

                                     WEST
                         And I'll have Division assign them 
                         counsel...

                                     JO
                              (beat)
                         But... not me.

                                     WEST
                         From what I understand from your 
                         colleagues, you're much too valuable 
                         in your present assignment to be 
                         wasted on what I'm sure will boil 
                         down to a five minute plea bargain 
                         and a week's worth of paper work.

                                     JO
                         Sir --

                                     WEST
                         Don't worry about it. I promise you, 
                         division'll assign the right man for 
                         the job.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY

               THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB

               His name is LIEUTENANT JUNIOR GRADE DANIEL ALLISTAIR KAFFEE, 
               and it's almost impossible not to like him. At the moment 
               he's hitting fungoes to about a dozen LAWYERS who are spread 
               out on the softball field on a corner of the bass. The '27 
               Yankees they're not, but they could probably hold their own 
               against a group of, say, Airforce dentists.

               KAFFEE's in his late 20's, 15 months out of Harvard Law 
               School, and a brilliant legal mind waiting for a courageous 
               spirit to drive it. He is, at this point in his life, 
               passionate about nothing... except maybe softball.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (calling out to the 
                              team)
                         Alright, let's get two!

               He smacks one to the SECOND BASE. The ball bounces right 
               between his legs.

                                     SECOND BASE
                         Sorry!

                                     KAFFEE
                         Nothing to be sorry about, Sherby.  
                         Just look the ball into your glove.

               He smacks one out to the same place. It bounces off the heel 
               of SHERBY's glove and into center field.

                                     SECOND BASE (SHERBY)
                         Sorry!

                                     KAFFEE
                         You gotta trust me, Sherby. You keep 
                         your eyes open, your chances of 
                         catching the ball increase by a factor 
                         of ten.

               SPRADLING, a young naval officer, sweaty and out of breath, 
               walks up behind the backstop.

                                     SPRADLING
                         Kaffee!

                                     KAFFEE
                         Let's try it again.

                                     SPRADLING
                         Kaffee!!

                                     KAFFEE
                              (turning)
                         Dave. You seem upset and distraught.

                                     SPRADLING
                         We were supposed to meet in your 
                         office 15 minutes ago to talk about 
                         the McDermott case. You're stalling 
                         on this thing. Now we got this done 
                         and I mean now, or no kidding, Kaffee, 
                         I'll hang your boy from a fuckin' 
                         yardarm.

                                     KAFFEE
                         A yardarm?
                              (calling out)
                         Sherby, does the Navy still hang 
                         people from yardarms?

                                     SHERBY
                              (calling back)
                         I don't think so, Danny.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (back to SPRADLING)
                         Dave, Sherby doesn't think the Navy 
                         hangs people from yardarms anymore.
                              (back to the field)
                         Let's go, let's get two!

               He goes back to hitting fungoes.

                                     SPRADLING
                         I'm gonna charge him with possession 
                         and being under the influence while 
                         on duty. Plead guilty and I'll 
                         recommend 30 days in the brig with 
                         loss of rank and pay.

                                     KAFFEE
                         It was oregano, Dave, it was ten 
                         dollars worth of oregano.

                                     SPRADLING
                         Yeah, well your client thought it 
                         was marijuana.

                                     KAFFEE
                         My client's a moron, that's not 
                         against the law.

               Swapp! The THIRD BASEMAN takes one in the face.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Ow. That had to hurt.
                              (calling out)
                         Way to keep your head in the play, 
                         Lester. Walk it off!

                                     SPRADLING
                         I've got people to answer to just 
                         like you, I'm gonna charge him.

                                     KAFFEE
                         With what, possession of a condiment?

                                     SPRADLING
                         Kaffee --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Dave, I've tried to help you out of 
                         this, but if you ask for tall time, 
                         I'm gonna file a motion to dismiss.

                                     SPRADLING
                         You won't got it.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I will get it. And if the MTD is 
                         denied, I'll file a motion in liminee 
                         seeking to obtain evidentiary ruling 
                         in advance, and after that I'm gonna 
                         file against pre-trial confinement, 
                         and you're gonna spend an entire 
                         summer going blind on paperwork 
                         because a Signalman Second Class 
                         bought and smoked a dime bag of 
                         oregano.

                                     SPRADLING
                         B Misdemeanor, 20 days in the brig.

                                     KAFFEE
                         C Misdemeanor, 15 days restricted 
                         duty.

                                     SPRADLING
                         I don't know why I'm agreeing to 
                         this.

                                     KAFFEE
                         'Cause you have wisdom beyond your 
                         years. Dave, can you play third base?

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

               About 16 NAVY AND MARINE LAWYERS (several of whom are women) 
               are taking their seats around a large conference table.

               A PARALEGAL is handing out folders and some photocopied papers 
               to the LAWYERS.

               We might notice that one of the lawyers is Lieutenant Junior 
               Grade SAM WEINBERG. Sam's serious and studious looking. If 
               he weren't in uniform, you wouldn't guess that he was a naval 
               officer.

               CAPTAIN WHITAKER walks in.

                                     WHITAKER
                         'Morning.

                              (school class)
                         'Morning Captain Whitaker.

                                     WHITAKER
                         Sam, how's the baby?

                                     SAM
                         I think she's ready to say her first 
                         word any day now.

                                     WHITAKER
                         How can you tell?

                                     SAM
                         She just looks like she has something 
                         to say.

               KAFFEE walks in.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Excuse me, sorry I'm late.

                                     WHITAKER
                         I'm sure you don't have a good excuse, 
                         so I won't force you to come up with 
                         a bad one.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Thank you, Isaac, that's nice of 
                         you.

                                     WHITAKER
                         Sit-down, this first one's for you.

               He hands KAFFEE some files.

                                     WHITAKER
                              (continuing)
                         You're moving up in the world, Danny, 
                         you've been requested by Division.

               "Oooh"'s and "Ahhh"'S from the other LAWYERS. (Subtle Note: 
               Kaffee doesn't want to move up in the world.)

                                     KAFFEE
                         Requested to do what?

               WHITAKER hands him a file.

                         Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A marine 
                         corporal named Dawson illegally fires 
                         a round from his weapon over the 
                         fenceline and into Cuban territory.

                         Sam?

                                     SAM
                         A big wall separating the good guys 
                         from the bad guys.

                         PFC William Santiago threatens to 
                         rat on Dawson to the Naval 
                         investigative Service. Dawson and 
                         another member of his squad, PFC 
                         Louden Downey, they go into Santiago's 
                         room, tie him up, and stuff a rag 
                         down his throat. An hour later, 
                         Santiago's dead. Attending physician 
                         says the rag was treated with some 
                         kind of toxin.

                                     KAFFEE
                         They poisoned the rag?

                         Not according to them.

                         What do they say?

                                     WHITAKER
                         Not much. They're being flown up 
                         here tomorrow and on Thursday at 
                         0600 you'll catch a transport down 
                         to Cuba for the day to find out what 
                         you can. Meantime, go across the 
                         yard and see Lt. Commander Joanne 
                         Galloway. She's the one who had 'em 
                         brought up here. She'll fill you in 
                         on whatever she has. Any questions?

                         It seems important to Division that 
                         this one be handled by the book, so 
                         I'm assigning co-counsel. Any 
                         volunteers?

               JO sits behind her desk. KAFFEE and SAM stand in the doorway. 
               KAFFEE knocks politely.

               JO looks up.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Hi.
                              (beat)
                         I'm Daniel Kaffee. I was told to 
                         meet with --
                              (checks notes)
                         -- Commander Galloway.

               JO is staring at him. KAFFEE doesn't know why.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         About a briefing.

               JO is finding this hard to believe.

                                     JO
                         You're the attorney that Division 
                         assigned?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm lead counsel. This is Sam 
                         Weinberg.

                                     SAM
                         I have no responsibilities here 
                         whatsoever.

               JO's deeply puzzled.

                                     JO
                              (beat)
                         Come in, please, have a seat...

               KAFFEE and SAM come into the office and sit.

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
                         Lieutenant, how long have you been 
                         in the Navy?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Going on nine months now.

                                     JO
                         And how long have you been out of 
                         law school?

                                     KAFFEE
                         A little over a year.

                                     JO
                              (beat)
                         I see.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Have I done something wrong?

                                     JO
                         No. It's just that when I petitioned 
                         Division to have counsel assigned, I 
                         was hoping I'd be taken seriously.

               KAFFEE and SAM exchange a look.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to JO)
                         No offense taken, if you were 
                         wondering.

                                     SAM
                         Commander, Lt. Kaffee's generally 
                         considered the best litigator in our 
                         office. He's successfully plea 
                         bargained 44 cases in nine months.

                                     KAFFEE
                         One more, and I got a set of steak 
                         knives.

                                     JO
                         Have you ever been in a courtroom?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I once had my drivers license 
                         suspended.

                                     SAM
                         Danny --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Commander, from what I understand, 
                         if this thing goes to court, they 
                         won't need a lawyer, they'll need a 
                         priest.

                                     JO
                         No. They'll need a lawyer.

               During this, she'll hand KAFFEE a series of files, which 
               KAFFEE will pass To SAM without even glancing at them.

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
                         Dawson's family has been contacted.  
                         Downey's closest living relative is 
                         Ginny Miller, his aunt on his mother's 
                         side, she hasn't been Contacted yet.

               None of this really means anything to KAFFEE.

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
                         Would you like me to take care of 
                         that?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Sure, if you feel like it.

               JO takes another beat to size this guy up.

                                     JO
                         One of the people you'll be speaking 
                         to down there is the barracks C.O., 
                         Colonel Nathan Jessep, I assume you've 
                         heard of him.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         Who hasn't?

                                     SAM
                              (to KAFFEE)
                         He's been in the papers lately. He's 
                         expected to be appointed Director of 
                         Operations for the National Security 
                         Counsel.

               Passing KAFFEE another file --

                                     JO
                         These are letters that Santiago wrote 
                         in his 8 months at GITMO --

                                     SAM
                              (whispering to kaffee)
                         Guantanamo Bay.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I know that one.

                                     JO
                         He wrote to his recruiter, the fleet 
                         commander, HQ, Atlantic, even his 
                         senator. He wanted a transfer. Nobody 
                         was listening. You with me?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes.

                         This last letter to the Naval 
                         investigative Service --

               She hands it to KAFFEE who hands it to Sam --

                         Corporal Dawson's fenceline shooting 
                         in exchange for a transfer, was just 
                         a last ditch effort.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Right. Is that all?

                         Lieutenant, this letter makes it 
                         look like your client had a motive 
                         to kill Santiago.

                              (to JO)
                         Am I correct in assuming that these 
                         letters don't paint a flattering 
                         picture of marine corps life in 
                         Guantanamo Bay?

                         And am I further right in assuming 
                         that a protracted investigation of 
                         this incident might cause some 
                         embarrassment for the security counsel 
                         guy.

                         You haven't talked to a witness, you 
                         haven't looked at a piece of paper.

                         Commander, do you have some sort of 
                         jurisdiction here that I should know 
                         about?

                         My job is to make sure you do your 
                         job. I'm special counsel for Internal 
                         Affairs, so my jurisdiction's pretty 
                         much in your face. Read the letters. 
                         You're not under any obligation, but 
                         I'd appreciate a report when you get 
                         back from Cuba.

                         Sure.

               KAFFEE gets up without waiting for JO to say --

                         You're dismissed.

                         Sorry, I always forget that.

               KAFFEE's gone. SAM's standing in the doorway.

               And while we HEAR the letter read in V.O., what we're seeing 
               is this: SANTIAGO's life in Guantanimo Bay over the last 8 
               months. He had a rough time of it.

               THE SHOTS SHOULD INCLUDE:

               -- SANTIAGO running along at the rear of a group of MARINES.  
               It's been over seven miles and he's matted with sweat. A 
               SERGEANT runs up along side, grabs his back, and pushes him 
               to keep up with the group. SANTIAGO falls, struggles to get 
               back up and keep running, and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ROCKY HILL - DAY

               -- SANTIAGO running with the squad of MARINES again, this 
               time down a rocky hill. It's hot as hell and it looks like 
               he's gonna pass out.

               He stumbles, and the SERGEANT picks him up and pushes him 
               down the hill. He rolls about 30 feet before he stops. Over 
               this, we HEAR

                                     SANTIAGO (V.O.)
                         "...My name is PFC William T. 
                         Santiago. I am a marine stationed at 
                         Marine Barracks, Rifle Security 
                         Company Windward, Second Platoon 
                         Delta. I am writing to inform you of 
                         my problems with my unit here in 
                         Cuba and to ask for your help. I've 
                         fallen out on runs before for several 
                         reasons such as feeling dizzy or 
                         nauseated, but on May 18th, I'd fallen 
                         back about 20 or 30 yards going down 
                         a rocky, unstable hill. My sergeant 
                         grabbed me and pushed me down the 
                         hill. Then I saw all black and the 
                         last thing I remember is hitting the 
                         deck. I was brought to the hospital 
                         where I was told I just had heat 
                         exhaustion and was explained to by 
                         the doctor that my body has trouble 
                         with the hot sun and I hyperventilate. 
                         I ask you to help me. Please sir. I 
                         just need to be transferred out of 
                         RSC. Sincerely. PFC William T. 
                         Santiago. U.S. Marine Corps."

               At this point, with SANTIAGO's letter still in V.O., we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.  JESSEP'S OFFICE - DAY

               THE LETTER - DAY

               It's the last paragraph of the letter we've been hearing, 
               and at the moment, we can't see the hands that are holding 
               it.

                                     SANTIAGO (V.O.)
                         "P.S. In exchange for my transfer 
                         off the base, I'm willing to provide 
                         you with information about an illegal 
                         fenceline shooting that occurred the 
                         night of August 2nd."

               And as these last words are spoken, we PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
               COLONEL NATHAN R. JESSEP, who drops the letter he's been 
               reading on his desk, where it joins a stack of other letters 
               just like it.

               JESSEP's a born leader, considered in many circles to be one 
               of the real fair-haired boys of the Corps. He's smart as a 
               whip with a sense of humor to match. As soon as he drops the 
               letter, he says

                                     JESSEP
                         Who the fuck is PFC William T. 
                         Santiago.

               He's talking to his two senior officers. CAPTAIN MARKINSON 
               is in his late 40's. He's a career marine and a nice guy in 
               a world where nice guys may not finish last, but they sure 
               as shit don't finish first. Lt. JONATHAN JAMES KENDRICK is 
               26, from Georgia, and an Academy graduate.

               If you asked him he'd tell you that the gates to heaven are 
               guarded by the U.S. Marine Corps.

                                     KENDRICK
                         Sir, Santiago is a member of Second 
                         Platoon, Delta.

                                     JESSEP
                         Yeah, well, apparently he's not very 
                         happy down here at Shangri-La, cause 
                         he's written letters to everyone but 
                         Santa Claus asking for a transfer. 
                         And now he's telling tales about a 
                         fenceline shooting.

               He tosses the letter over to MARKINSON. MARKINSON is looking 
               it over. JESSEP is waiting for a response.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         Matthew?

                                     MARKINSON
                         I'm appalled, sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         You're appalled? This kid broke the 
                         Chain of Command and he ratted on a 
                         man of his unit, to say nothing of 
                         the fact that he's a U.S. Marine and 
                         it would appear that he can't run 
                         from here to there without collapsing 
                         from heat exhaustion. What the fuck's 
                         going on over at Windward, Matthew?

                                     MARKINSON
                         Colonel, I think perhaps it would be 
                         better to hold this discussion in 
                         private.

                                     KENDRICK
                         That won't be necessary, Colonel, 
                         I'll handle the situation.

                                     MARKINSON
                         The same way you handled the Curtis 
                         Barnes incident? You're doing 
                         something wrong, Lieutenant this --

                                     KENDRICK
                         My methods of leadership are --

                                     MARKINSON
                         Don't interrupt me, I'm still your 
                         superior officer.

                                     JESSEP
                         And I'm yours, Matthew.

               The room calms down for a moment.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         I want to know what we're gonna do 
                         about this.

                                     MARKINSON
                         I think Santiago should be transferred 
                         off the base. Right away.

                                     JESSEP
                         He's that bad, huh?

                                     MARKINSON
                         Not only that, but word of this 
                         letter's bound to get out. The kid's 
                         gonna get his ass kicked.

                                     JESSEP
                         Transfer Santiago. Yes I suppose 
                         you're right. I suppose that's the 
                         thing to do. Wait. Wait. I've got a 
                         better idea. Let's transfer the whole 
                         squad off the base. Let's -- on second 
                         thought -- Windward. The whole 
                         Windward division, let's transfer 
                         'em off the base. Jon, go on out 
                         there and get those boys down off 
                         the fence, they're packing their 
                         bags.
                              (calling out)
                         Tom!

               The ORDERLY cones in from the outer office.

                                     ORDERLY
                         Sir!

                                     JESSEP
                         Got me the President on the phone, 
                         we're surrendering our position in 
                         Cuba.

                                     ORDERLY
                         Yes sir!

                                     JESSEP
                         Wait a minute, Tom.

               The ORDERLY stops.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         Don't call the President just yet. 
                         Maybe we should consider this for a 
                         second. Maybe -- and I'm just spit 
                         balling here -- but maybe we as 
                         officers have a responsibility to 
                         train Santiago. Maybe we as officers 
                         have a responsibility to this country 
                         to see that the men and women charged 
                         with its security are trained 
                         professionals. Yes. I'm certain I 
                         once read that somewhere. And now 
                         I'm thinking that your suggestion of 
                         transferring Santiago, while 
                         expeditious, and certainly painless, 
                         might not be in a manner of speaking, 
                         the American way. Santiago stays 
                         where he is. We're gonna train the 
                         lad. You're in charge, Jon. Santiago 
                         doesn't make 4.1 on his next fitness 
                         report, I'm gonna blame you. Then 
                         I'm gonna kill you.

                                     KENDRICK
                         Yes sir.

                                     MARKINSON
                         I think that's a mistake, Colonel.

                                     JESSEP
                         Matthew, I believe I will have that 
                         word in private with you now. Jon, 
                         that's all. Why don't you and I have 
                         lunch at the "O" club, we'll talk 
                         about the training of young William.

                                     KENDRICK
                         Yes sir, I'd be delighted to hear 
                         any suggestions you have.

                                     JESSEP
                         Dismissed.

               KENDRICK is gone.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         Matthew, sit, please.

               MARKINSON sits.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         What do you think of Kendrick?

                                     MARKINSON
                              (beat)
                         I don't know that --

                                     JESSEP
                         I think he's kind of a weasel, myself. 
                         But he's an awfully good officer, 
                         and in the end we see eye to eye on 
                         the best way to run a marine corps 
                         unit. We're in the business of saving 
                         lives, Matthew. That's a 
                         responsibility we have to take pretty 
                         seriously. And I believe that taking 
                         a marine who's not yet up to the job 
                         and packing him off to another 
                         assignment, puts lives in danger.

               MARKINSON starts to stand --

                              (continuing)
                         Matthew, siddown.
                              (beat)
                         We go back a while. We went to the 
                         Academy together, we were commissioned 
                         together, we did our tours in Vietnam 
                         together. But I've been promoted up 
                         through the chain with greater speed 
                         and success than you have. Now if 
                         that's a source of tension or 
                         embarrassment for you, well, I don't 
                         give a shit. We're in the business 
                         of saving lives, Captain Markinson. 
                         Don't ever question my orders in 
                         front of another officer.

               JESSEP grabs his hat and walks out, leaving MARKINSON sitting 
               all alone, and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WASHINGTON NAVY YARD - MAIN GATE - DAY

               It's maybe a little hazier today than it was yesterday. An 
               M.P. is waving a procession of three Military Police sedans 
               and a fourth unmarked car through the gate. The cars drive 
               through and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE BRIG - DAY

               Another red-brick building. A few M.P.Is stand out front as 
               the cars pull up. As soon as they come to a stop, all the 
               doors swing open and various uniformed and non-uniformed 
               officers hop out and move to the unmarked sedan where they 
               escort DAWSON and DOWNEY, in handcuffs, out of the car.  
               HAROLD DAWSON's a handsome, young, black corporal. Intense, 
               controlled, and utterly professional.

               LOUDEN DOWNEY's a 19-year-old kid off an Iowa farm. He's 
               happiest when someone is telling him exactly what to do.

               DAWSON's his hero.

               The two prisoners stand still for a moment. They might as 
               we'll be in Oz.

                                     DOWNEY
                         Hal?

               DAWSON doesn't say anything.

                                     DOWNEY
                              (continuing)
                         Is this Washington, D.C.?

                                     M.P.
                         Alright, let's move.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT.  SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY

               and KAFFEE's at it again.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Alright, let's get tough out there!

               JO walks up from behind the backstop.

                                     JO
                         Excuse me.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You want to suit up? We need all the 
                         help we can get.

                                     JO
                         No, thank you, I can't throw and 
                         catch things.

                                     KAFFEE
                         That's okay, neither can they.

                                     JO
                         I wanted to talk to you about Corporal 
                         Dawson and Private Downey.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Say again?

                                     JO
                         Dawson and Downey.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         Those names sound like they should 
                         mean something to me, but I'm just 
                         not --

                                     JO
                         Dawson! Downey! Your clients!

                                     KAFFEE
                         The Cuba thing! Yes! Dawson and 
                         Downey.
                              (beat)
                         Right.
                              (pause)
                         I've done something wrong again, 
                         haven't I?

                                     JO
                         I was wondering why two guys have 
                         been in a jail cell since this morning 
                         while their lawyer is outside hitting 
                         a ball.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We need the practice.

                                     JO
                         That wasn't funny.

                                     KAFFEE
                         It was a little funny.

                                     JO
                         Lieutenant, would you feel very 
                         insulted if I recommended to your 
                         supervisor that he assign different 
                         counsel?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Why?

                                     JO
                         I don't think you're fit to handle 
                         this defense.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You don't even know me. Ordinarily 
                         it takes someone hours to discover 
                         I'm not fit to handle a defense.

               Jo just stares.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Oh come on, that was damn funny.

               Jo moves close to KAFFEE to say this with a degree of 
               confidentiality.

                                     JO
                         I do know you. Daniel AlliStair 
                         Kaffee, born June 8th, 1964 at Boston 
                         Mercy Hospital. Your father's Lionel 
                         Kaffee, former Navy Judge Advocate 
                         and Attorney General, of the United 
                         States, died 1985. You went to Harvard 
                         Law on a Navy scholarship, probably 
                         because that's what your father wanted 
                         you to do, and now you're just 
                         treading water for the three years 
                         you've gotta serve in the JAG Corps, 
                         just kinda layin' low til you can 
                         get out and get a real job. And if 
                         that's the situation, that's fine, I 
                         won't tell anyone. But my feeling is 
                         that if this case is handled in the 
                         same fast-food, slick-ass, Persian 
                         Bazaar manner with which you seem to 
                         handle everything else, something's 
                         gonna get missed. And I wouldn't be 
                         doing my job if I allowed Dawson and 
                         Downey to spend any more time in 
                         prison than absolutely necessary, 
                         because their attorney had pre-
                         determined the path of least 
                         resistance.

               KAFFEE can't help but be impressed by that speech.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Wow.
                              (beat)
                         I'm sexually aroused, Commander.

                                     JO
                         I don't think your clients murdered 
                         anybody.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What are you basing this on?

                                     JO
                         There was no intent.

                                     KAFFEE
                         The doctor's report says that Santiago 
                         died of asphyxiation brought on by 
                         acute lactic acidosis, and that the 
                         nature of the acidosis strongly 
                         suggests poisoning.
                              (beat)
                         Now, I don't know what any of that 
                         means, but it sounds pretty bad.

                                     JO
                         Santiago died at one a.m. At three 
                         the doctor was unable to determine 
                         the cause of death, but two hours 
                         later he said it was poison.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Oh, now I see what you're saying.  
                         It had to be Professor Plum in the 
                         library with the candlestick.

                                     JO
                         I'm gonna speak to your supervisor.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Okay. You go straight up Pennsylvania 
                         Avenue. It's a big white house with 
                         pillars in front.

                                     JO
                         Thank you.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I don't think you'll have much luck, 
                         though. I was assigned by Division, 
                         remember? Somebody over there thinks 
                         I'm a good lawyer. So while I 
                         appreciate your interest and admire 
                         your enthusiasm, I think I can pretty 
                         much handle things myself.

                                     JO
                         Do you know what a code red is?

               KAFFEE doesn't, but he doesn't say anything.

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
                         What a pity.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               And an M.P. is leading KAFFEE and SAM down to DAWSON and 
               DOWNEY's cell.

                                     M.P.
                         Officer on deck, ten-hut.

               DAWSON and DOWNEY come to attention. Through the following, 
               the M.P. will unlock the call door and let the lawyers in.

                         Someone hasn't been working and 
                         playing well with others, Harold.

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir, yes sir!

                                     DOWNEY
                         Sir, PFC Louden Downey.

                         I'm Daniel Kaffee, this is Sam 
                         Weinerg, you can sitdown.

               DAWSON and DOWNEY aren't too comfortable sitting in the 
               presence of officers, but they do as they're told. KAFFEE's 
               pulled out some documents, SAM's sitting on one of the cots 
               taking notes.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing; to DAWSON)
                         Is this your signature?

                                     DAWSON
                         Yes sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You don't have to call me sir.
                              (to DOWNEY)
                         Is this your signature?

                                     DOWNEY
                         Sir, yes sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And you certainly don't have to do 
                         it twice in one sentence. Harold, 
                         what's a Code Red?

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir, a Code Red is a disciplinary 
                         engagement.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What does that mean, exactly?

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir, a marine falls out of line, 
                         it's up to the men in his unit to 
                         get him back on track.

                         What's a garden variety Code Red?

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Harold, you say sir and I turn around 
                         and look for my father. Danny, Daniel, 
                         Kaffee. Garden variety; typical. 
                         What's a basic Code Red?

                         Sir, a marine has refused to bathe 
                         on a regular basis. The men in his 
                         squad would give him a G.I. shower.

                         What's that?

                                     DAWSON

                         wool...

                         Beautiful.

                         Was the attack on Santiago a Code 
                         Red?

                                     DAWSON
                         Yes sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to DOWNEY)
                         Do you ever talk?

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir, Private Downey will answer any 
                         direct questions you ask him.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Swell. Private Downey, the rag you 
                         stuffed in Santiago's mouth, was 
                         there poison on it?

                                     DOWNEY
                         No sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Silver polish, turpentine, anti-
                         freeze...

                                     DOWNEY
                         No sir. We were gonna shave his head, 
                         sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         When all of a sudden...?

                                     DOWNEY
                         We saw blood drippinq out of his 
                         mouth. Then we pulled the tape off, 
                         and there was blood all down his 
                         face, sir. That's when Corporal Dawson 
                         called the ambulance.

               KAFFEE tries not to make too big a deal out of this last 
               piece of news.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to DAWSON)
                         Did anyone see you call the ambulance?

                                     DAWSON
                         No sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Were you there when the ambulance 
                         got there?

                                     DAWSON
                         Yes sir, that's when we were taken 
                         under arrest.

               KAFFEE kinda strolls to the corner of the cell to think for 
               a moment.

                                     SAM
                              (to DAWSON)
                         On the night of August 2nd, did you 
                         fire a shot across the fenceline 
                         into Cuba?

                                     DAWSON
                         Yes sir.

                                     SAM
                         Why?

                                     DAWSON
                         My mirror engaged, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to SAM)
                         His mirror engaged?

                                     SAM
                         For each American sentry post there's 
                         a Cuban counterpart. They're called 
                         mirrors. The corporal's claiming 
                         that his mirror was about to fire at 
                         him.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Santiago's letter to the NIS said 
                         you fired illegally. He's saying 
                         that the guy, the mirror, he never 
                         made a move.

               DAWSON says nothing.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Oh, Harold?

               SAM is staring at DAWSON.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         You see what I'm getting at? If 
                         Santiago didn't have anything on 
                         you, then why did you give him a 
                         Code Red?

                                     DAWSON
                         Because he broke the chain of command, 
                         sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         He what?

                                     DAWSON
                         He went outside his unit, sir. If he 
                         had a problem, he should've spoken 
                         to me, sir. Then his Sergeant, then 
                         Company Commander, then --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yeah, yeah, alright. Harold, did you 
                         assault Santiago with the intent of 
                         killing him?

                                     DAWSON
                         No sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What was your intent?

                                     DAWSON
                         To train him, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Train him to do what?

                                     DAWSON
                         Train him to think of his unit before 
                         himself. To respect the code.

                                     SAM
                         What's the code?

                                     DAWSON
                         Unit Corps God Country.

                                     SAM
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     DAWSON
                         Unit Corps God Country, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         The Goverrment of the United States 
                         wants to charge you two with murder. 
                         You want me to go to the prosecutor 
                         with unit, corps, god, country?

               DAWSON stares at KAFFEE.

                                     DAWSON
                         That's our code, sir.

               KAFFEE takes a long moment. He picks up his briefcase and he 
               and SAM move to the door.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We'll be back. You guys need anything? 
                         Books paper, cigarettes, a ham 
                         sandwich?

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir. No thank you. Sir.

               KAFFEE smiles at DAWSON.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Harold, I think there's a concept 
                         you better start warming up to.

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm the only friend you've got.

               And as KAFFEE and SAM walk out the open cell door, DAWSON 
               and DOWNEY come to attention and snap a salute.

               They hold the salute until KAFFEE and SAM are well out of 
               sight, and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.  KAFFEE'S OFFICE - DAY

               He's packing up stuff into his briefcase at the end of the 
               work day. Lt. JACK ROSS, a marine lawyer maybe two years 
               older than Kaffee, opens the door and walks in..

                                     ROSS
                         Welcome to the big time.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You think so?

                                     ROSS
                         I hope for Dawson and Downey's sake 
                         you practice law better than you 
                         play softball.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Unfortunately for Dawson and Downey, 
                         I don't do anything better than I 
                         play softball. What are we lookin' 
                         at?

                                     ROSS
                         They plead guilty to manslaughter, 
                         I'll drop the conspiracy and the 
                         conduct unbecoming. 20 years, they'll 
                         be home in half that time.

                         I want twelve.

                                     ROSS
                         Can't do it.

                                     KAFFEE
                         They called the ambulance, Jack.

                                     ROSS
                         I don't care if they called the Avon 
                         Lady, they killed a marine.

                         The rag was tested for poison.  The 
                         autopsy, lab report, even the initial 
                         E.R. and C.O.D. reports. They all 
                         say the same thing: Maybe, maybe 
                         not.

                         says he's sure.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What do you know about Code Reds?

               ROSS smiles and shakes his head.

                                     ROSS
                         Oh man.

               He closes the office door.

                                     ROSS
                              (continuing)
                         Are we off the record?

                                     KAFFEE
                         You tell me.

                                     ROSS
                              (pause)
                         I'm gonna give you the twelve years, 
                         but before you go getting yourself 
                         into trouble tomorrow, you should 
                         know this: The platoon commander Lt. 
                         Jonathan Kendrick, had a meeting 
                         with the men. And he specifically 
                         told them not to touch Santiago.

               KAFFEE holds for a moment. Dawson and Downey neglected to 
               mention this... He packs up his briefcase and cleats.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'll talk to you when I get back.

                         going tomorrow night. When does your

               It's dusk and people on the base are going home from work.  
               We can see the flag being lowered in the background.

               KAFFEE's walking toward his car. JO intercepts him and starts 
               walking along with him.

                                     JO
                         Hi there.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Any luck getting me replaced?

                                     JO
                         Is there anyone in this command that 
                         you don't either drink or play 
                         softball with?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Commander --

                                     JO
                         Listen, I came to make peace. We 
                         started off on the wrong foot. What 
                         do you say? Friends?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Look, I don't --

                                     JO
                         By the way, I brought Downey some 
                         comic books he was asking for. The 
                         kid, Kaffee, I swear, he doesn't 
                         know where he is, he doesn't even 
                         know why he's been arrested.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Commander --

                                     JO
                         You can call me Joanne.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Joanne --

                                     JO
                         or Jo.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jo?

                                     JO
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jo, if you ever speak to a client of 
                         mine again without my permission, 
                         I'll have you disbarred. Friends?

                                     JO
                         I had authorization.

                                     KAFFEE
                         From where?

                                     JO
                         Downey's closest living relative, 
                         Ginny Miller, his aunt on his mother's 
                         side.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You got authorization from Aunt Ginny?

                                     JO
                         I gave her a call like you asked. 
                         Very nice woman, we talked for about 
                         an hour.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You got authorization from Aunt Ginny.

                                     JO
                         Perfectly within my province.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Does Aunt Ginny have a barn? We can 
                         hold the trial there. I can sew the 
                         costumes, and maybe his Uncle Goober 
                         can be the judge.

               Jo steps aside and lets KAFFEE got into his car.

                                     JO
                         I'm going to Cuba with you tomorrow.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And the hits just keep on comin'.

               HOLD on KAFFEE and Jo. JO smiles.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SIDEWALK NEWSSTAND - DUSK

               KAFFEE IN HIS CAR

               He's driving down a Washington street and pulls over at a 
               sidewalk newsstand.

               He gets out of his car, leaving the lights flashing, and 
               runs up to the newsstand.

               As he plunks his 35 cents down and picks up a newspaper, he 
               engages in his daily ritual with LUTHER, the newsstand 
               operator.

                                     KAFFEE
                         How's it goin', Luther?

                                     LUTHER
                         Another day, another dollar, captain.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You gotta play 'em as they lay, 
                         Luther.

                                     LUTHER
                         What comes around, goes around, you 
                         know what I'm sayin'.

                                     KAFFEE
                         If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

                                     LUTHER
                         Hey, if you've got your health, you 
                         got everything.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Love makes the world go round. I'll 
                         see you tomorrow, Luther.

               And we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               A baby sleeping in a crib pull rack to reveal SAM is standing 
               over the crib. KAFFEE's sitting on a beer.

                                     SAM
                         When Nancy gets back, you're my 
                         witness. The baby spoke. My daughter 
                         said a word.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Your daughter made a sound, Sam, I'm 
                         not sure it was a word.

                                     SAM
                         Oh come on, it was a word.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Okay.

                                     SAM
                         You heard her. The girl sat here, 
                         pointed, and said "Pa". She did. She 
                         said "Pa".

                                     KAFFEE
                         She was pointing at a doorknob.

                                     SAM
                         That's right. Pointing, as if to 
                         say, "Pa, look, a doorknob".

               SAM joins KAFFEE in the living room.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jack Ross came to see me today. He 
                         offered me twelve years.

                                     SAM
                         That's what you wanted.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I know, and I'll... I guess, I mean --
                              (beat)
                         I'll take it.

                                     SAM
                         So?

                                     KAFFEE
                         It took albout 45 seconds. He barely 
                         put up a fight.

                                     SAM
                              (beat)
                         Danny, take the twelve years, it's a 
                         gift.

               KAFFEE finishes off his beer, and stands.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You don't believe their story, do 
                         you? You think they ought to go to 
                         jail for the rest of their lives.

                                     SAM
                         I believe every word they said. And 
                         I think they ought to go to jail for 
                         the rest of their lives.

               KAFFEE nods and puts down the empty beer bottle.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'll see you tomorrow.

               Sam opens the front door for him and they stand out on the 
               stoop for a moment.

                                     SAM
                         Remember to wear your whites, it's 
                         hot down there.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I don't like the whites.

                                     SAM
                         Nobody likes the whites, but we're 
                         going to Cuba in August. You got 
                         Dramamine?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Dramamine keeps you cool?

                                     SAM
                         Dramamine keeps you from throwing 
                         up, you get sick when you fly.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I get sick when I fly because I'm 
                         afraid of crashing into a large 
                         mountain, I don't think Dramamine'll 
                         help.

                                     SAM
                         I've got some oregano, I hear that 
                         works pretty good.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yeah, right.

               KAFFEE starts toward his car, then turns around.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         You know, Ross said the strangest 
                         thing to me right before I left. He 
                         said the platoon commander Lieutenant 
                         Jonathan Kendrick had a meeting with 
                         the men and specifically told them 
                         not to touch Santiago.

                                     SAM
                         So?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I never mentioned Kendrick. I don't 
                         even know who he is.
                              (beat)
                         What the hell.
                              (beat)
                         I'll see you tomorrow.

               We hold for a moment on KAFFEE as he walks to his car, then

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE AIRSTRIP AT GUANTANAMO BAY - DAY

               The whole place, in stark contrast to the Washington Navy 
               Yard, is ready to go to war. Fighter jets line the tarmac. 
               Ground crews re-fuel planes. Hurried activity.

               A 36 seat Airforce Jet rolls to a stop on the tarmac and a 
               stair unit is brought up.

               HOWARD, a marine corporal, is waiting by the stairway as the 
               passengers begin to got off. Mostly MARINES, a few SAILORS, 
               a couple of CIVILIANS, and KAFFEE, JO and SAM. KAFFEE and 
               SAM are wearing their summer whites, JO is in khakis.

               KAFFEE and SAM stare out at what they see: They're not in 
               Kansas anymore.

               HOWARD shouts over the noise from the planes.

                         Yeah.

                         escort you to the Windward side of 
                         the base.

                         I've got some camouflage jackets in 
                         the back of the jeep, sirs, I'll 
                         have to ask you both to put them on.

                         Regulations, sir. We'll be riding 
                         pretty close to the fenceline. The 
                         Cubans see an officer wearing white, 
                         they think it's someone they might 
                         wanna take a shot at.

               KAFFEE turns and glares at SAM.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Good call, Sam.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CUBAN ROAD - THE JEEP - DAY

               Tearing along down the road, and now we see a beautiful 
               expanse of water, maybe 1000 yards across. It's a section of 
               Guantanamo Bay.

                                     HOWARD
                              (shouting)
                         We'll just hop on the ferry and be 
                         over there in no time.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (shouting)
                         Whoa! Hold it! We gotta take a boat?!

                                     HOWARD
                         Yes sir, to get to the other side of 
                         the bay.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Nobody said anything about a boat.

                                     HOWARD
                              (shouting)
                         Is there a problem, sir?

                                     KAFFEE
                              (shouting)
                         No. No problem. I'm just not that 
                         crazy about boats, that's all.

                                     JO
                              (shouting)
                         Jesus Christ, Kaffee, you're in the 
                         Navy for cryin' out loud!

                                     KAFFEE
                              (shouting)
                         Nobody likes her very much.

                                     HOWARD
                              (shouting)
                         Yes sir.

                         Thank you. I'm Daniel Kaffee, I'm 
                         the attorney for Dawson and Downey.

                         Pleased to meet you, Commander.

                         Sam Weinberg. He has no responsibility 
                         here whatsoever.

                                     JESSEP
                         I've asked Captain Markinson and Lt.  
                         Kendrick to join us.

                                     MARKINSON
                         Lt. Kaffee, I had the pleasure of 
                         seeing your father once. I was a 
                         teenager and he spoke at my high 
                         school.

               KAFFEE smiles and nods.

                                     JESSEP
                         Lionel Kaffee?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         Well what do you know. Son, this 
                         man's dad once made a lot of enemies 
                         down in your neck of the woods. 
                         Jefferson vs. Madison County School 
                         District. The folks down there said 
                         a little black girl couldn't go to 
                         an all white school, Lionel Kaffee 
                         said we'll just see about that. How 
                         the hell is your dad?

                                     KAFFEE
                         He passed away seven years ago, 
                         colonel.

                                     JESSEP
                              (pause)
                         Well... don't I feel like the fuckin, 
                         asshole.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Not at all, sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         Well, what can we do for you, Danny.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Not much at all, sir, I'm afraid. 
                         This is really a formality more than 
                         anything else. The JAG Corps insists 
                         that I interview all the relevant 
                         witnesses.

                                     JO
                         The JAG Corps can be demanding that 
                         way.

               JESSEP smiles.

                                     JESSEP
                         Jonanthan'll take you out and show 
                         you what you wanna see, then we can 
                         all hook up for lunch, how does that 
                         sound?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Fine, sir.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT.  THE FENCELINE - DAY

               A SQUAD OF MARINES jogs by as a jeep carrying KENDRICK and 
               the three LAWYERS cruises down the road.

               We FOLLOW the jeep.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I understand you had a meeting with 
                         your men that afternoon.

                                     KENDRICK
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What'd you guys talk about?

                                     KENDRICK
                         I told the men that there was an 
                         informer among us. And that despite 
                         any desire they might have to seek 
                         retribution, Private Santiago was 
                         not to be harmed in any way.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What time was that meeting?

                                     KENDRICK
                         Sixteen-hundred.

               KAFFEE turns around and looks at SAM.

                                     SAM
                              (leaning forward)
                         Four o'clock.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE BARRACKS CORRIDOR - DAY

               KENDRICK leads the LAWYERS down the corridor to Santiago's 
               room.

               Two strips of tape which warn DO NOT ENTER - AT ORDER OF THE 
               MILITARY POLICE are crisscrossed over the closed door. They 
               open the door and step under the tape and walk into

               INT. SANTIAGO'S ROOM - DAY

               The room is exactly an it was left that night. The un-made 
               bed, the chair knocked over... The LAWYERS look around for a 
               moment. The room is sparse.

               Kaffee goes to the closet and opens it: A row of uniforms 
               hanging neatly. He thumbs through then for a second, but 
               there's nothing there.

               He opens the footlocker: Socks, underwear... all folded to 
               marine corp precision... A shaving kit, a couple of 
               photographs, a pad of writing paper and some envelopes...

               Kaffee closes the footlocker.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Sam, somebody should see about getting 
                         this stuff to his parents. We don't 
                         need it anymore.

                                     KENDRICK
                         Actually, the uniforms belong to the 
                         marine corps.

               The LAWYERS take a moment.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Lt. Kendrick -- can I call you Jon?

                                     KENDRICK
                         No, you may not.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         Have I done something to offend you?

                                     KENDRICK
                         No, I like all you Navy boys. Every 
                         time we've gotta go someplace and 
                         fight, you fellas always give us a 
                         ride.

                                     JO
                         Lt. Kendrick, do you think Santiago 
                         was murdered?

                                     KENDRICK
                         Commander, I believe in God, and in 
                         his son Jesus Christ, and because I 
                         do, I can say this: Private Santiago 
                         is dead and that's a tragedy. But 
                         he's dead because he had no code. 
                         He's dead because he had no honor. 
                         And God was watching.

               SAM turns to KAFFEE.

                                     SAM
                         How do you feel about that theory?

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         Sounds good. Let's move on.

               SAM and KENDRICK walk out the door. JO stops KAFFEE.

                                     JO
                         You planning on doing any 
                         investigating or are you just gonna 
                         take the guided tour?

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         I'm pacing myself.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE OFFICERS CLUB - DAY

               JESSEP, MARKINSON, KENDRICK and the LAWYERS are seated at a 
               table in the corner.

               Stewards clear the lunch dishes and pour coffee. Jessep is 
               finishing a story.

                                     JESSEP
                         ...And they spent the next three 
                         hours running around, looking for 
                         Americans to surrender to.

               JESSEP laughs. KENDRICK joins him. SAM and KAFFEE force a 
               laugh.

               MARKINSON forces a smile. JO remains silent.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing; to the

                         That was delicious, men, thank you.

                         Our pleasure, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Colonel just need to ask you a couple 
                         of questions about August 6th.

                                     JESSEP
                         Shoot.

                                     KAFFEE
                         On the morning of the sixth, you 
                         were contacted by an NIS angent who 
                         said that Santiago had tipped him 
                         off to an illegal fenceline shooting.

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Santiago was gonna reveal the person's 
                         name in exchange for a transfer. An 
                         I getting this right?

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         If you feel there are any details 
                         that I'm missing, you should free to 
                         speak up.

               JESSEP's not quite sure what to say to this Navy Lawyer 
               Lieutenant-Smartass guy who just gave him permission to speak 
               freely on his own base.

                                     JESSEP
                         Thank you.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Now it was at this point that you 
                         called Captain Markinson and Lt. 
                         Kendrick into your office?

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And what happened then?

                                     JESSEP
                         We agreed that for his own safety, 
                         Santiago should be transferred off 
                         the base.

               Here's something else KAFFEE didn't know. Neither did Jo. 
               SAM jots something down on a small notepad.

               MARKINSON doesn't flinch.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Santiago was set to be transferred?

                                     JESSEP
                         On the first available flight to the 
                         states. Six the next morning. Three 
                         hours too late as it turned out.

               KAFFEE nods.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yeah.

               There's silence for a moment.

               KAFFEE takes a sip of his coffee. Then drains the cup and 
               puts it down.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Alright, that's all I have. Thanks 
                         very much for your time.

                                     KENDRICK
                         The corporal's got the jeep outside, 
                         he'll take you back to the airstrip.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (standing)
                         Thank you.

                                     JO
                         Wait a minute, I've got some 
                         questions.

                                     KAFFEE
                         No you don't.

                                     JO
                         Yes I do.

                                     KAFFEE
                         No you don't.

                                     JO
                         Colonel, on the morning that Santiago 
                         died, did you meet with Doctor Stone 
                         between three and five?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jo --

                                     JESSEP
                         Of course I met with the doctor. One 
                         of my men was dead.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to JO)
                         See? The man was dead. Let's go.

                                     JO
                              (to JESSEP)
                         I was wondering if you've ever heard 
                         the term Code Red.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jo --

                                     JESSEP
                         I've heard the term, yes.

                                     JO
                         Colonel, this past February, you 
                         received a cautionary memo from the 
                         Naval Investigative Service, warning 
                         that the practice of enlisted men 
                         disciplining their own wasn't to be 
                         condoned by officers.

                                     JESSEP
                         I submit to you that whoever wrote 
                         that memo has never served on the 
                         working end of a Soviet-made Cuban 
                         Ml-Al6 Assault Rifle. However, the 
                         directive having come from the NIS, 
                         I gave it its due attention. What's 
                         your point, Jo?

                                     KAFFEE
                         She has no point. She often has no 
                         point. It's part of her charm. We're 
                         outta here. Thank you.

                                     JO
                         My point is that I think code reds 
                         still go on down here. Do Code Reds 
                         still happen on this base, colonel?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jo, the colonel doesn't need to answer 
                         that.

                                     JO
                         Yes he does.

                                     KAFFEE
                         No, he really doesn't.

                                     JO
                         Yeah, he really does. Colonel?

                                     JESSEP
                         You know it just hit me. She outranks 
                         you, Danny.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         I want to tell you something Danny 
                         and listen up 'cause I mean this: 
                         You're the luckiest man in the world. 
                         There is, believe me gentlemen, 
                         nothing sexier on earth than a woman 
                         you have to salute in the morning. 
                         Promote 'em all I say.

               JO's not upset. JO's not mad. But she's gonna ask her question 
               'til she gets an answer.

                                     JO
                         Colonel, the practice of code Reds 
                         is still condoned by officers on 
                         this base, isn't it?

                                     JESSEP
                         You see my problem is, of course, 
                         that I'm a Colonel. I'll just have 
                         to keep taking cold showers 'til 
                         they elect some gal President.

                                     JO
                         I need an answer to my question, 
                         sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         Take caution in your tone, Commander.  
                         I'm a fair guy, but this fuckin' 
                         heat's making me absolutely crazy. 
                         You want to know about code reds?  
                         On the record I tell you that I 
                         discourage the practice in accordance 
                         with the NIS directive. Off the record 
                         I tell you that it's an invaluable 
                         part of close infantry training, and 
                         if it happens to go on without my 
                         knowledge, so be it. I run my base 
                         how I run my base. You want to 
                         investigate me, roll the dice and 
                         take your chances. I eat breakfast 
                         80 yards away from 4000 Cubans who 
                         are trained to kill me. So don't for 
                         one second think you're gonna come 
                         down here, flash a badge, and make 
                         me nervous.

               A moment of tense silence before --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Let's go. Colonel, I'll just need a 
                         copy of Santiago's transfer order.

                                     JESSEP
                         What's that?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Santiago's transfer order. You guys 
                         have paper work on that kind of thing, 
                         I just need it for the file.

                                     JESSEP
                         For the file.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yeah.

                                     JESSEP
                              (pause)
                         Of course you can have a copy of the 
                         transfer order. For the file. I'm 
                         here to help anyway I can.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Thank you.

                                     JESSEP
                         You believe that, don't you? Danny? 
                         That I'm here to help anyway I can?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Of course.

                                     JESSEP
                         The corporal'll run you by Ordinance 
                         on your way out to the airstrip. You 
                         can have all the transfer orders you 
                         want.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to JO and SAM)
                         Let's go.

               The LAWYERS start to leave.

                                     JESSEP
                         But you have to ask me nicely.

               KAFFEE stops. Turns around. Sam and JO stop and turn.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     JESSEP
                         You have to ask me nicely. You see, 
                         Danny, I can deal with the bullets 
                         and the bombs and the blood. I can 
                         deal with the heat and the stress 
                         and the fear. I don't want money and 
                         I don't want medals. What I want is 
                         for you to stand there in that faggoty 
                         white uniform, and with your Harvard 
                         mouth, extend me some fuckin' 
                         courtesy. You gotta ask me nicely.

               KAFFEE and JESSEP are frozen. Everyone'staring at Kaffee; 
               The OFFICERS at their tables... KENDRICK... SAM... 
               MARKINSON... JO... KAFFEE makes his decision.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Colonel Jessep... if it's not too 
                         much trouble, I'd like a copy of the 
                         transfer order. Sir.

               JESSEP smiles.

                                     JESSEP
                         No problem.

               HOLD for a moment. JO's very disappointed.

               JESSEP stands there and watches the LAWYERS as they turn and 
               leave the Officer's Club.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         I hate casualties, Matthew. There 
                         are casualties even in victory. A 
                         marine smothers a grenade and saves 
                         his platoon, that marine's a hero. 
                         The foundation of the unit, the fabric 
                         of this base, the spirit of the Corps, 
                         they are things worth fighting for.

               MARKINSON looks at the ground.

                              (continuing)
                         Dawson and Downey, they don't know 
                         it, but they're smothering a grenade.

               MARKINSON looks up as we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ANDREWS AIRFORCE BASE - DUSK

               As a plane touches down on the runway. It's dusk in Washington 
               and

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - DAY

               A little one-bedroom. Just the essential furniture, barely 
               even that.

               KAFFEE's sitting and watching a baseball came on t.v. He's 
               holding a copy of The Baseball Encyclopedia, normally his 
               favorite reading material, but right now he's having trouble 
               keeping his mind in it. He's holding a baseball bat and 
               fiddling with it.

               The remnants of a pizza and Yoo-Hoo dinner sit next to him.  
               His white uniform in a pile in the corner. There's a BUZZ at 
               the door. KAFFEE's not expecting anyone. He goes to the door.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Who is it?

                                     JO (O.S.)
                         It's me.

               KAFFEE opens the door and JO walks in.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I've really missed you, Jo. I was 
                         just saying to myself, "It's been 
                         almost three hours since I last saw --
                         "

                                     JO
                         Markinson resigned his commission.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (pause)
                         When?

                                     JO
                         This afternoon. Sometime after we 
                         left.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'll talk to him in the morning.

                                     JO
                         I already tried, I can't find him.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You tried? Joanne, you're coming 
                         dangerously close to the textbook 
                         definition of interfering with a 
                         government investigation.

               JO hands KAFFEE the file she's been holding.

                                     JO
                         I'm Louden Downey's attorney.

               KAFFEE's stunned. He opens the file and begins to read.

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
                         Aunt Ginny. She said she feels like 
                         she's known me for years. I suggested 
                         that she might feel more comfortable 
                         if I were directly involved with the 
                         case. She had Louden sign the papers 
                         about an hour ago.

               KAFFEE looks up. Still too stunned to say anything. Then 
               finally...

                                     KAFFEE
                         I suppose it's way too much to hope 
                         that you're just making this up to 
                         bother me.

                                     JO
                         Don't worry, I'm not gonna make a 
                         motion for separation, you're still 
                         lead counsel.

               KAFFEE hands her back the file.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Splendid.

                                     JO
                         I think Kendrick ordered the Code 
                         Red.
                              (beat)
                         So do you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A HOLDING ROOM IN THE BRIG - NIGHT

               DAWSON and DOWNEY come to attention as KAFFEE and JO are led 
               in.

                                     DAWSON
                         Officer on deck, ten hut.

               KAFFEE starts in immediately.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did Kendrick order the code red?

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Don't say sir like I just asked you 
                         if you cleaned the latrine. You heard 
                         what I said. Did Lt. Kendrick order 
                         you guys to give Santiago a code 
                         red?

                                     DAWSON
                         Yes sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to Downey)
                         Did he?

                                     DOWNEY
                         Yes sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You mind telling me why the hell you 
                         never mentioned this before?

                                     DAWSON
                         You didn't ask us, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Cutie-pie shit's not gonna win you a 
                         place in my heart, corporal, I get 
                         paid no matter how much time you 
                         spend in jail.

                                     DAWSON
                         Yes sir. I know you do, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Fuck you, Harold.

               There's some understandable tension in the room, broken by --

                                     JO
                         Alright. Let's sort this out. There 
                         was a platoon meeting on August 6th 
                         at four in the afternoon. And Lt. 
                         Kendrick, he gave strict instructions 
                         that nothing was to happen to 
                         Santiago. Now is that true? I want 
                         you to speak freely.

                                     DAWSON
                         Ma'am, that's correct. But then he 
                         dismissed the platoon and we all 
                         went to our rooms.

                                     JO
                         And what happened then?

                                     DAWSON
                         Lt. Kendrick came to our room, ma'am.

                                     KAFFEE
                         When?

                                     DAWSON
                         About five minutes after the meeting 
                         broke, sir. About 16:20.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         And what happened then?

                                     DAWSON
                         Lt. Kendrick ordered us to give 
                         Santiago a Code Red.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

               ROSS is playing a game of full-court basketball with some 
               other OFFICERS.

               A door at the far end of the court opens and KAFFEE and JO 
               walk in. They head down the sideline toward Ross.

               KAFFEE shouts --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jack!

               But ROSS is into the game...

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Jack!!

                                     ROSS
                              (waving him off)
                         Hang on...

                                     KAFFEE
                         They were given an order.

               ROSS stops cold and looks over at Kaffee. The game flies by 
               him. He motions to the locker room door in the corner of the 
               gym and the three of them make their way to privacy.

                                     JO
                         How long have you known about the 
                         order?

                                     ROSS
                         I didn't --
                              (to KAFFEE)
                         Who is this?

                                     KAFFEE
                         This is Jo Galloway she's Downey's 
                         lawyer. She's very pleased to meet 
                         you.

                                     ROSS
                         What exactly are you accusing me of, 
                         commander?

                                     JO
                         I'm accusing you of --

               They're in the

               LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

               and KAFFEE slams the door shut behind them.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jack didn't know about the order. 
                         Because if he did and he hadn't told 
                         us, Jack knows he'd be violating 
                         about 14 articles of the code of 
                         ethics. As it is, he's got enough to 
                         worry about. God forbid our clients 
                         decide to plead not guilty and testify 
                         for the record that they were given 
                         an order.

                                     ROSS
                         Kendrick specifically told the men 
                         not to touch Santiago.

                                     KAFFEE
                         That's right. And then he went into 
                         Dawson and Downey's room and 
                         specifically told them to give him a 
                         code red.

                                     ROSS
                         That's not what Kendrick said.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Kendrick's lying.

                                     ROSS
                         You have proof?

                         Markinson.

                         You can try, but you won't find him.  
                         You know what Markinson did for the

                         No you're not.

                         Why not?

                         'Cause you'll lose, and Danny knows 
                         it. And he knows that if we go to 
                         court, I'll have to go all the way, 
                         they'll be charged with the whole 
                         truckload. Murder, Conspiracy, Conduct 
                         Unbecoming, and even though he's got 
                         me by the balls out here, Dan knows 
                         that in a courtroom, he loses this 
                         case. Danny's an awfully talented 
                         lawyer, and he's not about to send 
                         his clients go to jail for life when 
                         he knows they could be home in six

               INT. A HOLDING ROOM - NIGHT

               Kaffee and JO are sitting at a table. Dawson and Downey are 
               at parade rest. Kaffee lights a cigarette.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Here's the story: The Goverment's 
                         offering Assault and Conduct 
                         Unbecoming. Two years. You'll be 
                         home in six months.

               DAWSON and DOWNEY say nothing.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         "Wow, Kaffee, you're the greatest 
                         lawyer in the world. How can we ever 
                         thank you?" Fellas, you hear what I 
                         just said, you're going home in six 
                         months.

                                     DAWSON
                         I'm afraid we can't do that, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Do what?

                                     DAWSON
                         Make a deal, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What are you talking about?

                                     DAWSON
                         We did nothing wrong, sir. We did 
                         our job. If that has consequences, 
                         then I accept them. But'I won't say 
                         I'm guilty, sir.

               KAFFEE can't believe this. He looks over at JO.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did you --
                              (to DAWSON and DOWNEY)
                         Did she put you up to this?

                                     JO
                         No.

                                     DAWSON
                         We have a code, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Well zippity-doo-dah. You and your 
                         code plead not guilty and you'll be 
                         in jail for the rest of your life. 
                         Do what I'm telling you and you'll 
                         be home in six months.

               DAWSON just stares at him.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Do it, Harold. Six months. It's 
                         nothing. It's a hockey season.

                                     DAWSON
                         Permission to --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Speak!

                                     DAWSON
                         What do we do then, sir?

                                     KAFFEE
                         When?

                                     DAWSON
                         After six months. We'd be dishonorably 
                         discharged, right sir?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes.

                                     DAWSON
                         What do we do then, sir? We joined 
                         the corps 'cause we wanted to live 
                         our lives by a certain code. And we 
                         found it in the corps. And now you're 
                         asking us to sign a piece of paper 
                         that says we have no honor. You're 
                         asking us to say we're not marines. 
                         If a judge and jury decide that what 
                         we did was wrong, I'll accept whatever 
                         punishment they give. But I believe 
                         I was riqht, sir. I believe I did my 
                         job. And I won't dishonor myself, my 
                         unit, or the Corps, so that I can qo 
                         home in six months.
                              (beat)
                         Sir.

               HOLD ON the four of them for a moment, then

                                     KAFFEE
                         Commander, I want to talk to corporal 
                         Dawson alone for a minute.

               Jo waits Just a moment before she calls out --

                                     JO
                              (to Downey)
                         Let's go in another room. Louden, 
                         everything's gonna be alright.

               The M.P. has shown up and unlocked the cell door.

                                     JO
                              (continuing; to M.P.)
                         We're gonna go into a holding room.

                                     M.P.
                         Aye, aye, ma'am.

               JO, DOWNEY, and the M.P. are gone. KAFFEE paces a moment 
               before he says --

                                     KAFFEE
                         You don't like me that much, do you?
                              (beat)
                         Forget it, don't answer that, it 
                         doesn't matter.

               KAFFEE paces another moment, then sits on the cot. He's trying 
               to choose his tack carefully.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         You know, Downey worships you. He's 
                         gonna do whatever you do. Are you 
                         really gonna let this happen to him 
                         because of a code? Harold?

                                     DAWSON
                         Do you think we were right?

                                     KAFFEE
                         It doesn't matter what I --

                                     DAWSON
                         Do you think we were right?

               KAFFEE gets up.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         I think you'd lose.

                                     DAWSON
                              (beat)
                         You're such a coward, I can't believe 
                         they let you wear a uniform.

               KAFFEE stares at DAWSON.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm not gonna feel responsible for 
                         this, Harold. I did everything I 
                         could. You're going to Levenworth 
                         for the better part of your life, 
                         and you know what? I don't give a 
                         shit.

               KAFFEE calls out --

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         M.P.!

               KAFFEE and DAWSON are staring each other down. The M.P. shows 
               up and unlocks the cell door. KAFFEE steps out to leave.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         What happened to saluting an officer 
                         when he leaves the room?

               DAWSON holds on KAFFEE. Then DAWSON, a man who would rather 
               die than breach military protocol, takes his hands and puts 
               them in his pockets.

               The cell door closes and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE OFFICE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               One light is on at the end of the hall.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SAM has joined KAFFEE and JO. The mood is somber.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Dawson's gonna go to jail just to 
                         spite me. Fine. If he wants to jump 
                         off a cliff, that's his business. 
                         I'm not gonna hold his hand on the 
                         way down.
                              (to SAM)
                         I want to get him a new lawyer. How 
                         do I do it?

                                     SAM
                         You just make a motion tomorrow 
                         morning at the arraignment. The 
                         judge'll ask you if you want to enter 
                         a plea. You tell him you want new 
                         counsel assigned.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         Then that's that.

                              (beat)
                         Yeah. One thing, though. When you 
                         ask the judge for new counsel, Danny, 
                         be sure and ask nicely.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What do you want from me?

                                     JO
                         I want you to let 'em be judged! I 
                         want you to stand up and make an 
                         argument!

                                     SAM
                         An argument that didn't work for 
                         Calley at My Lai, an argument that 
                         didn't work for the Nazis at 
                         Nuremberg.

                                     KAFFEE
                         For Christ sake, Sam, do you really 
                         think that's the same as two teenage 
                         marines executing a routine order 
                         that they never believed would result 
                         in harm? These guys aren't the Nazis.

               There's a pause in the room.

                                     JO
                         Don't look now, Danny, but you're 
                         making an argument.

                              (pause)
                         Yeah.
                              (beat)
                         Tomorrow morning I'll get them a new 
                         attorney.

                                     JO
                         Why are you so afraid to be a lawyer? 
                         Were daddy's expectations really 
                         that high?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Please, spare me the psycho-babble 
                         father bullshit. Dawson and Downey'll 
                         have their day in court, but they'll 
                         have it with another lawyer.

                                     JO
                         Another lawyer won't be good enough. 
                         They need you. You know how to win.
                              (beat)
                         You know they have a case. And you 
                         know how to win. You walk away from 
                         this now, and you have sealed their 
                         fate.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Their fate was sealed the moment 
                         Santiago died.

                                     JO
                         Do you believe they have a defense?

                                     KAFFEE
                         You and Dawson both live in the same 
                         dreamland. It doesn't matter what I 
                         believe, it only matters what I can 
                         prove. So please don't tell me what 
                         I know and don't know. I know the 
                         law.

               JO looks at him, shakes her head, and turns to walk away.  
               She turns back.

                                     JO
                         You know nothing about the law. You're 
                         a used car salesman, Daniel. You're 
                         an ambulance chaser with a rank. 
                         You're nothing.
                              (beat)
                         Live with that.

               Jo walks off leaving KAFFEE alone. We HOLD on KAFFEE. He's 
               not having a good night.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A GEORGETOWN BAR - NIGHT

               KAFFEE sits at the bar. The place is crowded with YUPPIES 
               and STUDENTS. KAFFEE's been drinking there a while now. Next 
               to him is a YUPPIE LAWYER, regaling his FRIENDS with the 
               story of his latest brilliant maneuver in the world of high 
               stakes corporate law.

               We HOLD on a KAFFEE a moment longer, then

                                     YUPPIE LAWYER
                         ...So I told duncan if we leverage 
                         the acquisition of Biotech, the 
                         interrogatories would be there on 
                         demand. All I have to do is not pick 
                         up the phone and it'll run Flaherty 
                         ten thousand a day in court costs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A GEORGETOWN STREET - NIGHT

               KAFFEE sits on a bench in the night. He takes a sip from a 
               bottle he's holding in a brown paper bag.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE PARADE GROUNDS - DAY

               A bright, sunny morning. The BAND is performing for a group 
               of day campers.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE COURTROOM - DAY

               DAWSON and DOWNEY are at the defense table, ROSS is his place. 
               KAFFEE walks in and joins JO and SAM at their table. Papers 
               are being passed back and forth between ROSS and the SERGEANT 
               AT AMS. Quiet activity.

               The door in the back of the courtroom opens and RANDOLPH, a 
               marine colonel, enters and takes his place at the bench. We 
               can HEAR the band in the background.

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                         All rise.

               Everyone present in the courtroom stands.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Where are we?

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                         Docket number 411275. VR-5. United 
                         States versus Lance Corporal Harold 
                         W. Dawson and Private First Class 
                         Loudon Downey. Defendants are charged 
                         with Conspiracy to Commit Murder, 
                         Murder in the First Degree, and 
                         Conduct Unbecoming a United States 
                         Marine.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Does defense wish to enter a plea?

               KAFFEE stands.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yeah.
                              (pause)
                         They're not guilty.

               JO, SAM, ROSS, RANDOLPH... it's hard to say who's the most 
               surprised. It takes everything Jo's got to suppress a smile. 
               The silence is broken by ROSS, who takes the two files, drops 
               them into his briefcase, closes the lid, and snaps it shut.

               RANDOLPH looks at KAFFEE and ROSS, then turns to the SERGEANT 
               AT ARMS.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Enter a plea of not guilty for the 
                         defendants. We'll adjourn until ten- 
                         hundred, three weeks from today, at 
                         which time this Court will reconvene 
                         as a General Court-Martial.

               He raps the gavel.

               RANDOLPH walks out. ROSS walks up the aisle without a word 
               to anyone. The M.P.'s come to escort DAWSON and DOWNEY back 
               to their cell.

               KAFFEE and JO and SAM are the only ones remaining. SAM is 
               looking at KAFFEE with question marks in his eyes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Why does a junior grade with six 
                         months experience and a track record 
                         for plea bargaining get assigned a 
                         murder case?
                              (beat)
                         Would it be so that it never sees 
                         the inside of a courtroom?

               KAFFEE picks up his briefcase and begins heading toward the 
               door.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         We'll work out of my apartment.  
                         Every night, seven o'clock. Jo, before 
                         you come over tonight, pick up a 
                         carton of legal pads, a half-dozen 
                         boxes of red pens, a half-dozen boxes 
                         of black pens. Sam get a couple of 
                         desk lamps. I need you to start on a 
                         preliminary medical profile and Jo, 
                         we need all the fitness reports on 
                         Dawson, Downey and Santiago. The 
                         only thing I have to eat is Yoo-Hoo 
                         and SugarSnacks, so if you want 
                         anything else, bring it with you. 
                         Okay?

               Jo's still stunned.

                                     JO
                         Yeah.

               KAFFEE's at the door, stops, turns around, and takes it all 
               in for a moment.

                                     KAFFEE
                         So this is what a courtroom looks 
                         like.

               He walks out the door, and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Among the stuff, is a blackboard that's been hung on the 
               wall. Written across the top are three headings:

                    INTENT             CODE RED             THE ORDER

               Sam is on the floor, sorting papers into piles. KAFFEE comes 
               in from the kitchen with a fresh bottle of Yoo-Hoo and joins 
               Sam on the floor.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Were you able to speak to your friend 
                         at NIS?

                                     SAM
                         She said if Markinson doesn't want 
                         to be found, we're not gonna find 
                         him. She said I could be Markinson 
                         and you wouldn't know it.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Are you Markinson?

                                     SAM
                         No.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Well, I'm not Markinson, that's two 
                         down.

               SAM doesn't laugh.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         What.

                                     SAM
                              (pause)
                         I was wondering, now that Joanne's 
                         working on this... I was wondering 
                         if you still need me.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (pause)
                         They were following an order, Sam.

                                     SAM
                         An illegal order.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You think Dawson and Downey know it 
                         was an illegal order?

                                     SAM
                         It doesn't matter if they know, any 
                         decent human being would've refused 
                         to --

                                     KAFFEE
                         They're not permitted to question 
                         orders.

                                     SAM
                         Then what's the secret? What are the 
                         magic words? I give orders every 
                         day, and nobody follows them.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We have softball games and marching 
                         bands. They work at a place where 
                         you have to wear camouflage or you 
                         might get shot.

               Sam looks away. He doesn't buy it.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing; pause)
                         I need you. You're better at research 
                         than I am and you know how to prepare 
                         a witness.

               Jo lets herself in. She's carrying a huge stack of papers 
               under one arm, and a large brown paper bag under the other.  
               But we stay with KAFFEE and Sam a moment longer.

                                     JO
                         I've got medical reports and Chinese 
                         food. I say we eat first.

               KAFFEE's still looking at SAM. SAM nods his head.

                                     SAM
                         Did you get any dumplings?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KAFFEE'S APT. - LATER - NIGHT

               The remnants of the Chinese food is spread around. SAM and 
               JO are sitting and taking notes from KAFFEE. As he speaks, 
               he'll pace slowly around, carrying his baseball bat. He refers 
               to the blackboard.

                                     KAFFEE
                         This is our defense. Intent: No one 
                         can prove there was poison on the 
                         raq. Code Red: They're common and 
                         accepted in Guantanamo Bay. The Order:
                              (he writes)
                         A) Kendrick gave it. B) They had no

                         We're a little weak on motive. They 
                         had one.

                         doesn't mean --

                         I don't know what made Santiago die, 
                         I don't want to know. I just want to 
                         be able to show it could've been 
                         something other than poison. Jo, 
                         talk to doctors. Find out everything 
                         there is to know about lactic

                         know what killed Santiago, then he 
                         meets with Jessep, and at five o'clock 
                         he says it was poison? The doctor's 
                         covering up the truth.

                         Oh, that's a relief. I was afraid I 
                         wouldn't be able to use the "Liar, 
                         Liar, Pants on Fire" defense. We

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DAY

               A few M.P.Is are standing by the entrance. KAFFEE comes around 
               the corner and heads toward the courtroom. We're immediately 
               stricken by something:

               In his dress blue uniform he could easily be mistaken for a 
               real live naval officer. He opens the courtroom doors and 
               walks into

               INT. THE COURTROOM - DAY

               A few more M.P.'s are standing around. THE JURORS, nine 
               enlisted navy and marine men and women, are in their place, 
               Ross is at his table looking through some papers, and DAWSON 
               and DOWNEY, in handcuffs, are seated at the defense table. 
               The trial in a few moments from being underway and a few 
               people are milling about. KAFFEE walks down the aisle but is 
               stopped by a voice behind him.

                                     MAN (O.S.)
                         Lieutenant Kaffee?

               KAFFEE turns around to see a MAN and WOMAN who are clearly 
               Dawson's parents.

                                     MAN
                         You're gonna save our son, aren't 
                         you?

                                     KAFFEE
                              (pause)
                         I'll do my best.

               KAFFEE continues on and stops next to JO, who's talking with 
               a WOMAN in her mid-30's.

                                     JO
                         Danny, I want you to meet Ginny 
                         Miller, Louden's aunt.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You're Aunt Ginny?

                                     GINNY
                         Uh-huh.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm sorry, I was expecting someone  
                         older.

                                     GINNY
                         So was I.

               Not quite the words of inspiration KAFFEE was hoping to hear 
               before he does the hardest thing he's ever had to do.

               He walks over to ROSS.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Last chance. I'll flip you for it.

               RANDOLPH enters.

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                         All rise.

                                     ROSS
                         Too late.

               KAFFEE walks back to his table as

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                         All those having business with this 
                         general court-martial, stand forward 
                         and you shall be heard. Captain Julius 
                         Alexander Randolph is presiding. God 
                         save the United States of America.

               RANDOLPH raps the gavel.

               RANDOLPH without objection, the sworn confessions of the two 
               defendants have been read to the jury and entered into the 
               court record.

                                     ROSS
                         No objection, your honor.

                                     KAFFEE
                         No objection.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Is the Government prepared to make 
                         an opening statement?

                                     ROSS
                              (standing)
                         Yes sir.

               ROSS walks to the jury box.

                                     ROSS
                              (continuing)
                         The facts of the case are this: At 
                         midnight on August 6th, the defendants 
                         went into the barracks room of their 
                         platoon-mate, PFC William Santiago.  
                         They woke him up, tied his arms and 
                         legs with rope, and forced a rag 
                         into his throat. A few minutes later, 
                         a chemical reaction in Santiago's 
                         body called lactic acidosis caused 
                         his lungs to begin bleeding. He 
                         drowned in his own blood and was 
                         pronounced dead at 32 minutes past 
                         midnight. These are the facts of the 
                         case. And they are undisputed. That's 
                         right. The story I just told you is 
                         the exact same story you're going to 
                         hear from Corporal Dawson, and it's 
                         the exact same story you're going to 
                         hear from Private Downey. Furthermore, 
                         the Government will also demonstrate 
                         that the defendants soaked the rag 
                         with poison, and entered Santiago's 
                         room with motive and intent to kill.
                              (beat)
                         Now, Lt. Kaffee, is gonna try to 
                         pull off a little magic act, he's 
                         gonna try a little misdirection. 
                         He's going to astonish you with 
                         stories of rituals and dazzle you 
                         with official sounding terms like 
                         Code Red. He might even cut into a 
                         few officers for you. He'll have no 
                         evidence, mind you, none. But it's 
                         gonna be entertaining. When we get 
                         to the end, all the magic in the 
                         world will not have been able to 
                         divert your attention from the fact 
                         that Willy Santiago is dead, and 
                         Dawson and Downey killed him. These 
                         are the facts of the case.
                              (beat)
                         And they are undisputed.

               ROSS walks back to his seat.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Lt. Kaffee?

               Before KAFFEE's even stood up, these words are coming out of 
               his mouth.

                                     KAFFEE
                         There was no poison on the rag and 
                         there was no intent to kill and any 
                         attempt to prove otherwise is futile 
                         because it just ain't true.
                              (beat)
                         When Dawson and Downey went into 
                         Santiago's room that night, it wasn't 
                         because of vengeance or hatred, it 
                         wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't 
                         because they were looking for kicks 
                         on a Friday night. It's because it 
                         was what they were ordered to do.
                              (beat)
                         Let me say that again: It's because 
                         it was what they were ordered to do. 
                         Now, out in the real world, that 
                         means nothing. And here at the 
                         Washington Navy Yard, it doesn't 
                         mean a whole lot more. But if you're 
                         a marine assigned to Rifle Security 
                         Company Windward, Guantanamo Bay, 
                         Cuba, and you're given an order, you 
                         follow it or you pack your bags.
                              (beat)
                         Make no mistake about it, Harold 
                         Dawson and Louden Downey are sitting 
                         before you in judgement today because 
                         they did their job.

               KAFFEE walks back to the table and takes his seat.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Is the Government ready to call its 
                         first witness?

                                     ROSS
                         Please the Court, the Government 
                         calls Mr. R.C McGuire.

               While McCGUIRE, a civilian in his late 30's, is being sworn 
               in, KAFFEE has sat back down.

               He leans over to DAWSON and whispers.

                                     KAFFEE
                         How you doin'?

               DAWSON doesn't change his expression.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Good.

                         Mr. McGuire, would you state your 
                         full name and occupation for the 
                         record, please?

                         Mr. McGuire, did your office receive 
                         a letter from PFC William Santiago 
                         on 3 August of this year?

                                     MCGUIRE
                         We did.

                                     ROSS
                         What did the letter say?

                                     MCGUIRE
                         That a member of Private Santiago's 
                         unit had illegally fired his weapon 
                         over the fenceline.

                                     ROSS
                         Was that marine identified in the 
                         letter?

                                     MCGUIRE
                         No sir. I notified the barracks C.O., 
                         Colonel Jessep, that I would be coming 
                         down to investigate.

                                     ROSS
                         And what did you find?

                                     MCGUIRE
                         For the shift reported, only one 
                         sentry returned his weapon to the 
                         switch with a round of ammunition 
                         missing.

                         And who was that?

                                     MCGUIRE
                         Lance Corporal Harold Dawson.

                         Your witness.

               ROSS goes back to his table. KAFFEE stands.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Mr. McGuire, have you questioned 
                         Corporal Dawson about the fenceline 
                         shooting?

                                     MCGUIRE
                         Yes. He claims to have been engaged 
                         in some manner by the enemy.

                                     KAFFEE
                         But you don't believe him.

                                     MCGUIRE
                         It's not my place --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Corporal Dawson's been charged with 
                         a number of crimes, why wasn't he 
                         charged with firing at the enemy 
                         without cause?

                                     MCGUIRE
                         There wasn't enough evidence to 
                         support such a charge.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Thank you.

               KAFFEE sits.

                                     ROSS
                         Mr. McGuire, I don't understand what 
                         you mean when you say there wasn't 
                         enough evidence to support such a 
                         charge. You had Willy Santiago's 
                         letter.

                                     MCGUIRE
                         Santiago was the only witness, but I

                         informer in our group.  That Private

                         Corporal Hammaker, were you in Dawson 
                         and Downey's barracks room ten minutes 
                         after this meeting?

               HAMMAKER gets off the stand, and KAFFEE watches while walks 
               past DAWSON and DOWNEY. A barely perceptible exchange occurs

                         substantially as Corporal Hammaker

                         Is it possible to have a serious 
                         coronary condition, where the initial 
                         warning signals were so mild as to 
                         escape a physician during a routine 
                         medical exam?

                                     STONE
                         Possibly. There would still be 
                         symptoms though.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What kind of symptoms?

                                     STONE
                         There are hundreds of symptoms of a --

                         Chest pains?

                              (beat)
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Shortness of breath?

                                     STONE
                         Yes.

                         Fatigue?

                         Of course.

               KAFFEE has gone back to his table where JO has handed him 
               some documents. He shows then to STONE.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Doctor, is this your signature?

                                     STONE
                         Yes it is.

                         This in an order for Private Santiago 
                         to be put on restricted duty. Would 
                         you read your hand written remarks

                         Commander, isn't it possible that 
                         Santiago had a serious coronary 
                         condition, and it was that condition, 
                         and not some mysterious poison, that 
                         caused the accelerated chemical 
                         reaction?

                                     STONE
                         No. I personally give the men a 
                         physical examination every three 
                         months. And every three months Private 
                         Santiago got a clean bill of health.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And that's why it had to be, poison, 
                         right, Commander? 'Cause Lord knows, 
                         if you put a man with a serious 
                         coronary condition back on duty with 
                         a clean bill of health, and that man 
                         died from a heart related incident, 
                         you'd have a lot to answer for, 
                         wouldn't you, doctor?

                         Dr. Stone, you've held a license to 
                         practice medicine for 21 years, you 
                         are Board Certified in Internal 
                         Medicine, you are the Chief of 
                         Internal Medicine at a hospital which 
                         serves over 8000 men. In your 
                         professional opinion, was Willy 
                         Santiago poisoned?

               Jo stands.

                         Your Honor, we re-new our objection 
                         to Commander Stone's testimony, and 
                         ask that it be stricken from the 
                         record. And we further ask that the 
                         Court instruct the jury to lend no 
                         weight to this witness's testimony.

               KAFFEE and SAM are dying, but they're trying to keep their 
               poker-faces. RANDOLPH'S gonna try to be polite about this, 
               but he thought he made himself clear.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         The objection's overruled, counsel.

                         Sir, the defense strenuously objects 
                         and requests a meeting in chambers 
                         so that his honor might have an 
                         opportunity to hear discussion before 
                         ruling on the objection.

                         The objection of the defense has 
                         been heard and overruled.

                         Noted. The witness is an expert and 
                         the court will hear his opinion.

                                     ROSS
                         Doctor, in your expert, professional 
                         opinion, was Willy Santiago poisoned?

                                     STONE
                         Yes.

                                     ROSS
                         Thank you, sir, I have no more 
                         questions.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Commander, you may step down.

                         Please the Court, while we reserve 
                         the right to call rebuttal witnesses 
                         if the need arises, the Government 
                         rests.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         We'll stand in recess until ten-
                         hundred hours this Monday, the l9th 
                         at which time the defense will call 
                         it's first witness.

               RANDOLPH raps his gavel.

                         Ten hut.

               And the courtroom begins clearing out. KAFFEE, JO and SAM 
               are packing up their various papers.

                                     SAM
                         I strenuously object? Is that how it 
                         works? Objection. Overruled. No, no, 
                         no, no, I strenuously object. Oh, 
                         well if you strenuously object, let 
                         me take a moment to reconsider.

                                     JO
                         I got it on the record.

                                     SAM
                         You also got it in the jury's head 
                         that we're afraid of the doctor. You 
                         object once so they can hear you say 
                         he's not a criminologist. You keep 
                         after it and it looks like this great 
                         cross we did was just a bunch of 
                         fancy lawyer tricks. It's the 
                         difference between paper law and 
                         trial --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Sam --

                                     SAM
                         Christ, you even had the Judge saying 
                         Stone was an expert!

                                     KAFFEE
                         Sam, she made a mistake. Let's not 
                         relive it.

               There's an uncomfortable silence.

                                     SAM
                         I'm gonna go call my wife. I'll meet 
                         you tonight.

               Sam starts to leave. JO turns and says

                                     JO
                         Why do you hate them so much?

               Sam stops and turns around.

                                     SAM
                         They beat up on a weakling, and that's 
                         all they did. The rest is just 
                         smokefilled coffee-house crap. They 
                         tortured and tormented a weaker kid. 
                         They didn't like him. And they killed 
                         him. And why? Because he couldn't 
                         run very fast.

               A long silence. KAFFEE makes a decision.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Alright. Everybody take the night 
                         off.

                                     SAM
                              (continuing)
                         I apologize, I, --

                                     KAFFEE
                         It's alright. We've been working 20 
                         hour days for three and a half weeks 
                         straight. Take the night off. Go see 
                         your wife, see your daughter. Jo, do 
                         whatever it is you do when you're 
                         not here. What day is tomorrow?

                                     SAM
                         Saturday.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We'll start at ten.

               KAFFEE picks up his stuff and walks out.

               SAM and JO stand there uncomfortably for a moment. JO begins 
               packing up her things.

                                     SAM
                         Why do you like them so much?

                                     JO
                              (pause)
                         'Cause they stand on a wall.
                              (beat)
                         And they say "Nothing's gonna hurt 
                         you tonight. Not on my watch."

               Despite their differences, SAM likes this woman.

                                     SAM
                         Don't worry about the doctor. This 
                         trial starts Monday.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               A baseball game is on.

               KAFFEE's pacing slowly around, carrying his baseball bat. 
               He's looking at the blackboard as he walks around the room.

               He's studying it. Studying it hard. There's a knock on the 
               door. KAFFEE answers it. JO is standing in the doorway.

                                     JO
                         I'm sorry to bother you, I should've 
                         called first.

                                     KAFFEE
                         No, I was just watching a baseball 
                         game.

                                     JO
                         I was wondering if -- how you'd feel 
                         about my taking you to dinner tonight.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jo, are you asking me out on a date?

                                     JO
                         No.

                                     KAFFEE
                         It sounded like you were asking me 
                         out on a date.

                                     JO
                         I wasn't.

                         I've been asked out on dates before, 
                         and that's what it sounded like.

                         Do you like seafood? I know a good 
                         seafood place.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A SEAFOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               On the Virginia side of the Potomac. KAFFEE and JO are sitting 
               at a table, finishing up dinner.

                                     JO
                         My third case was a Drunk and 
                         Disorderly. The trial lasted nine 
                         weeks. I rounded up 31 people who 
                         were in the bar that night.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Nine weeks on a D and D? What was 
                         the prosecutor offering?

                                     JO
                         15 days.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (pause)
                         Well, you sure hustled the shit outta 
                         him.

                                     JO
                         After that, they moved me to internal 
                         affairs.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Tough to blame them.

                                     JO
                         Where I've earned two distinguished 
                         service medals and two letters of 
                         commendation.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Why are you always giving me your 
                         resume?

                                     JO
                         Because I want you to think I'm good 
                         lawyer.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I do.

                                     JO
                         No you don't.
                              (beat)
                         I think you're an exceptional lawyer. 
                         I watch the jurors, they respond to 
                         you, they like you. I see you 
                         convincing them. I think Dawson and 
                         Downey are gonna end up owing their 
                         lives to you.

                              (pause)
                         Jo... I think you have to prepare 
                         yourself for the fact that we're 
                         gonna lose.
                              (beat)
                         Ross's opening speech, it was all 
                         true.
                              (beat)
                         I mean, let's pretend for a minute 
                         that it would actually matter to 
                         this jury that the guys were given 
                         an order. We can't prove it ever 
                         happened.
                              (beat)
                         We'll keep doing what we're doing, 
                         and we'll put on a show, but at the 
                         end of the day, all we have is the 
                         testimony of two people accused of 
                         murder.

                         We'll find Markinson.

                         Jo, we're gonna lose. And we're gonna 
                         lose huge.

               We HOLD on then for a moment, and in VOICE OVER hear

                         Barracks Windward, Guantanamo Bay, 
                         Cuba.

               CORPORAL HOWARD, the young marine who drove the lawyers around 
               Cuba, is on the stand.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Corporal Howard, name some reasons 
                         why a marine would get a code red?

                                     HOWARD
                         Being late for platoon or company 
                         meetings, keeping his barracks in 
                         disorder, falling back on a run...

                                     KAFFEE
                         Have you ever received a code red?

                                     HOWARD
                         Yes sir. We were doing seven man 
                         assault drills, and my weapon slipped. 
                         It's just cause it was over a hundred 
                         degrees and my palms were sweaty and 
                         I'd forgot to use the resin like we 
                         were taught.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And what happened?

                                     HOWARD
                         That night the guys in my squad threw 
                         a blanket over me and took turns 
                         punching me in the arm for five 
                         minutes. Then they poured glue on my 
                         hands. And it worked, too, 'cause I 
                         ain't never dropped my weapon since.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Was Private Santiago ever late for 
                         platoon meetings?

                                     HOWARD
                         Yes sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Was his barracks ever in disorder?

                                     HOWARD
                         Yes sir.

                         Did he ever fall back on a run?

                                     HOWARD
                         All the time, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did he ever, prior to the night of 
                         August 6th, receive a code red?

                                     HOWARD
                         No sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         Never?

                                     HOWARD
                         No, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You got a code red 'cause your palms 
                         were sweaty. Why didn't Santiago, 
                         this burden to his unit, ever get 
                         one?

                                     HOWARD
                         Dawson wouldn't allow it, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Dawson wouldn't allow it.

                                     HOWARD
                         The guys talked tough about Santiago, 
                         but they wouldn't go near him. They 
                         were too afraid of Dawson, sir.

                                     ROSS
                         Object. The witness is characterizing.

                         I'll rephrase. Jeffrey, did you ever 
                         want to give Santiago a code red?

                                     HOWARD
                         Yes sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Why didn't you?

                                     HOWARD
                         'Cause Dawson'd kick my butt, sir.

                         Good enough. Lt. Ross is gonna ask 
                         you some questions now.

               ROSS takes three books out of his briefcase and puts them on 
               the table. He brings one to HOWARD.

                         Corporal Howard, I hold here The 
                         Marine Guide and General Information 
                         Handbook for New Recruits. Are you 
                         familiar with this book?

                                     HOWARD
                         Yes sir.

                                     ROSS
                         Have you read it?

                                     HOWARD
                         Yes sir.

                         Good.
                              (hands him the book)
                         Would you turn to the chapter that 
                         deals with code reds, please.

                                     HOWARD
                         Sir?

                                     ROSS
                         Just flip to the page in that book 
                         that discusses code reds.

                                     HOWARD
                         Sir, you see, Code Red is a term we 
                         use -- it's just used down at GITMO, 
                         sir. I don't know if it actually --

               ROSS has produced another book.

                                     ROSS
                         We're in luck, then. The Marine Corps

                         Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. I assume we'll 
                         find the term code red and its 
                         definition in this book, am I correct?

                                     HOWARD
                         No sir.

                                     ROSS
                         No? Corporal Howard, I'm a marine. 
                         Is their no book, no manual or 
                         pamphlet, no set of orders or 
                         regulations that let me know that, 
                         as a marine, one of my duties is to 
                         perform code reds?

                                     HOWARD

               ROSS sits. KAFFEE walks over to ROSS's table and picks up 
               one of the books. He brings it to HOWARD.

                         Corporal, would you turn to the page 
                         in this book that says where the 
                         enlisted men's mess hall is?

                                     HOWARD
                         Lt. Kaffee, that's not in the book, 
                         sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I don't understand, how did you know 
                         where the enlisted men's mess hall 
                         was if it's not in this book?

                                     HOWARD
                         I guess I just followed the crowd at 
                         chow time, sir.

                                     KAFFEE
                         No more questions.

               KAFFEE chucks the book back on ROSS's desk.

                         Corporal Howard, you can step down.

               INT. THE COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - DUSK

               It's the end of the day's session. KAFFEE walks down the 
               hall with SAM and JO.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Seven tonight, we'll do a final 
                         Kendrick review. I want to slam- 
                         dunk this guy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SIDEWALK STAND - NIGHT

               KAFFEE'S CAR

               as it drives along a street in the D.C. business district. 
               it's evening now and the windshield wipers are fighting 
               against a rain KAFFEE pulls over at his usual newsstand. He 
               hops out, leaving the lights flashing and the door open, and 
               runs to the stand.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Hey, Luther.

                         Admiral, how's the big case goin'?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Nose to the grindstone.

                                     LUTHER
                         No flies on you.

                                     KAFFEE
                         A rolling stone gathers no moss.

                                     LUTHER
                         Yeah, well it ain't over til the fat 
                         lady sings.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Ain't that the truth. Catch you 
                         tomorrow.

               He gets back in his car, tosses the newspaper on the passenger 
               seat, and turns on the ignition. And as soon as he does

               -- a hand is slapped over his mouth --

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         It's Matthew Markinson.

               -- and KAFFEE jumps out of his skin.

               Because sitting in the back seat, in civilian clothes, is 
               MARKINSON.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jesus fucking Christ!!--

                                     MARKINSON
                         You left the door unlocked.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Scared the shit outta me.

                                     MARKINSON
                         Drive.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Are you aware you're under subpoena?

                                     MARKINSON
                         Yes. I'm also aware that the lives 
                         of two marines are in your hands. If 
                         there was something I could do about 
                         that, I would, but since I can't, 
                         all I can do is help you. Why don't 
                         you drive, Lieutenant.

               KAFFEE begins driving down the street.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What do you know?

                                     MARKINSON
                         I know everything.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Was it a code red?

                                     MARKINSON
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did Kendrick give the order?

                                     MARKINSON
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did you witness it?

                                     MARKINSON
                         I didn't need to --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did you witness it?!

                                     MARKINSON
                         No.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Then how do you know?

                                     MARKINSON
                         I know.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You know shit.

                                     MARKINSON
                         He was never gonna be transferred 
                         off the base.

               And with this, KAFFEE screeches the car over to the side of 
               the road. He grabs the parking brake and pulls it up. He 
               turns to Markinson.

                                     MARKINSON
                              (continuing)
                         Jessep was going to keep him on the 
                         base. He said he wanted him trained.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We've got the transfer order. It's 
                         got your signature.

                                     MARKINSON
                         I know. I signed it the morning you 
                         arrived in Cuba. Six days after 
                         Santiago died.

               KAFFEE's wheels are spinning. He's pumped.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm gonna get you a deal. Some kind 
                         of immunity with the prosecutor. In 
                         about four days, you're gonna appear 
                         as a witness for the defense, and 
                         you're gonna tell the court exactly 
                         what you told me. Right now I'm gonna 
                         check you into a motel, and we're 
                         gonna start from the beginning.

                                     MARKINSON
                         I don't want a deal. And I don't 
                         want immunity.

               KAFFEE shakes his head and laughs.

                                     MARKINSON
                              (continuing)
                         I want you to know, I'm proud neither 
                         of what I've done nor what I'm doing.

               KAFFEE puts the car in gear and we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Where KAFFEE has just finished telling his story to an amazed 
               SAM and JO.

               There's silence.

               Then JO has a total adrenaline rush.

                                     JO
                         Where is he?

                                     KAFFEE
                         The Route 23 Best Western.

               JO picks up the phone.

                                     JO
                         I want him guarded.

                                     KAFFEE
                         That's probably a good idea.

                                     JO
                              (into phone)
                         This is Lt. Commander Joanne Galloway. 
                         My clearance code is 411273.

               KAFFEE is impressed. He turns to SAM --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Clearance code?

                                     JO
                         Thank you.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to SAM)
                         I don't have a clearance code. Do 
                         you have a --

                                     JO
                              (into phone)
                         It's Jo Galloway. I need to secure a 
                         witness.

               Jo continues giving information to the person on the phone, 
               while Kaffee keeps talking to the both of them. Sam is writing 
               down notes as fast as he can.

                                     KAFFEE
                         He also said that Jessep's lying 
                         about the transportation off the 
                         base. Jessep said six the next morning 
                         was the first flight Santiago could've 
                         left on, Markinson says there was a 
                         plane that left seven hours earlier.

               JO hangs up the phone.

                                     JO
                         Damn.

                                     KAFFEE
                         That was impressive. Did you hear 
                         what I just said about the flight?

                                     JO
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Sam, when a plane takes off from a 
                         base, there's gotta be some kind of 
                         record kept, right?

                                     SAM
                         We need the Tower Chief's Log for 
                         GITMO.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to SAM)
                         Get it.

                                     JO
                         We're gonna win.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Jo, don't get crazy about this. We 
                         don't know who Markinson is. We don't 
                         know what the log book's gonna say. 
                         You just concentrate on Downey. I'm 
                         gonna talk to Ross and tell him where 
                         we are.

                                     JO
                              (sing-song)
                         "Kaffee's got his case now, Kaffee's 
                         got his case now."

                                     KAFFEE
                         You are like seven of the strangest 
                         women I have ever met.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. A WASHINGTON SALOON - NIGHT

               A WAITRESS sets two drinks down in front of KAFFEE and ROSS, 
               who are sitting across from each other in a booth in the 
               back.

                                     ROSS
                         That was nice work today. The redirect 
                         on Howard.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I have Markinson.

               ROSS only takes a moment digest this.

                                     ROSS
                         Where is he?

                                     KAFFEE
                         A motel room in Arlington with 14 
                         Federal Marshals outside his door.  
                         Take a sip of your drink.

                                     ROSS
                         Damn.

                                     KAFFEE
                         The transfer order that Parkinson 
                         signed is phoney. And Jessep's 
                         statement that the six a.m. flight 
                         was the first available is a lie, 
                         we're checking the tower chief's 
                         log. But in the meantime I'm gonna 
                         put the Apostle Jon Kendrick on the 
                         stand and see if we can't have a 
                         little fun.

               ROSS takes another sip of his drink, then lays it on the 
               line for Kaffee..

                                     ROSS
                         I have an obligation to tell you 
                         that if you accuse Kendrick or Jessep 
                         of any crime without proper evidence, 
                         you'll be subject to Court-Martial 
                         for professional misconduct. And 
                         that's something that'll be stapled 
                         to every job application you ever

                         that I think the whole fuckin' bunch 
                         of you are certifiably insane. And 
                         this code of honor of yours makes me

                         the possible consequences involved 
                         in accusing a marine officer of a

               People are filing in. KENDRICK is standing at the entrance 
               to the courtroom. KAFFEE glides past him...

                         Batter up, J.J.

               INT. THE COURTROOM - DAY

               KENDRICK's on the stand. What drives Kaffee's entire 
               examination of Kendrick is this: Kaffee's got him. He's gonna 
               win. At least this round. All he has to do is not let his 
               emotions take control of his professional skill.

               SAM will have files and documents ready to hand Kaffee as he 
               needs them.

                         Lt. Kendrick, in your opinion, was 
                         Private Santiago a good marine?

                                     KENDRICK
                         I'd say he was about average.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Lieutenant, you signed three fitness 
                         reports on Santiago. On all three 
                         reports you indicated a rating of 
                         Below Average.

                                     KENDRICK
                         Yes. Private Santiago was Below 
                         Average I didn't see the need in 
                         trampling on a man's grave.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We appreciate that, but you're under 
                         oath now, and I think unpleasant as 
                         it may be, we'd all just as soon 
                         hear the truth.

                         I'm aware of my oath.

                         Lieutenant, these are the last three 
                         fitness reports you signed for Lance 
                         Corporal Dawson and PFC Downey. Downey 
                         received three straight marks of 
                         Exceptional. Dawson received two 
                         marks of Exceptional, but on this 
                         most recent report, dated June 9th 
                         of this year, he received a rating 
                         of Below Average. It's this last 
                         report that I'd like to discuss for 
                         a moment.

                                     KENDRICK
                         That's fine.

                         Lance Corporal Dawson's ranking after 
                         Infantry Training School was perfect. 
                         Records indicate that over half that 
                         class has since been promoted to 
                         full corporal, while Dawson has 
                         remained a lance corporal. Was 
                         Dawson's promotion held up because 
                         of this last fitness report.

                                     KENDRICK
                         I'm sure it was.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Do you recall why Dawson was given 
                         such a poor grade on this report?

                                     KENDRICK
                         I'm sure I don't. I have many men in 
                         my charge, Lieutenant, I write many 
                         fitness reports.

                         Do you recall an incident involving 
                         a PFC Curtis Barnes who'd been found 
                         stealing liquor from the Officer's 
                         Club?

                         Yes.

                         Did you report private Barnes to the

                         I have two books at my bedside, 
                         Lieutenant, the Marine Code of Conduct

                         have the record reflect your lack of

                         I remember thinking very highly of 
                         Private Barnes, and not wanting to 
                         see his record tarnished by a formal

                         You preferred it to be handled within 
                         the unit.

                         I most certainly did.

                         Have you ever ordered a code red?

                         Lieutenant, did you order Dawson and 
                         two other men to make sure that 
                         Private Barnes receive no food or 
                         drink except water for a period of 
                         seven days?

                         That's a distortion of the truth. 
                         Private Barnes was placed on barracks 
                         restriction. He was given water and 
                         vitamin supplements, and I assure 
                         you that at no time was his health 
                         in danger.

                         I'm sure it was lovely for Private 
                         Barnes, but you did order the barracks 
                         restriction, didn't you? And you did 
                         order the denial of food.

                                     KENDRICK
                         Yes.

                         Wouldn't this form of discipline be 
                         considered a code red?

                                     KAFFEE
                         And because he did, because he 
                         exercised his own set of values, 
                         because he made a decision about the 
                         welfare of a marine that was in 
                         conflict with an order of yours, he 
                         was punished, is that right?

                                     KENDRICK
                         Corporal Dawson disobeyed an order.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yeah, but it wasn't a order, was it? 
                         After all, it's peacetime. He wasn't 
                         being asked to secure a hill... or 
                         advance on a beachhead. I mean, surely 
                         a marine of Dawson's intelligence 
                         can be trusted to determine on his 
                         own, which are the really important 
                         orders, and which orders might, say, 
                         be morally questionable.

                              (beat)
                         Can he? Can Corporal Dawson determine 
                         on his own which orders he's gonna 
                         follow?

                                     KENDRICK
                         No, he can not.

                                     KAFFEE
                         A lesson he learned after the Curtis 
                         Barnes incident, am I right?

                                     KENDRICK
                         I would think so.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You know so, don't you, Lieutenant.

                         Lieutenant Kendrick, one final 
                         question: if you ordered Dawson to 
                         give Santiago a code red...

                                     ROSS

                         I told those men not to touch 
                         Santiago.

                                     KAFFEE
                         -- is it reasonable to think that he 
                         would've disobeyed you again?

                                     ROSS
                         Lieutenant, don't answer that.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You don't have to, I'm through.

               ROSS doesn't even wait before he says --

                                     ROSS
                         Lieutenant Kendrick, did you order 
                         Corporal Dawson and Private Downey 
                         to give Willy Santiaga code red?

               But KENDRICK isn't listening -- he's glaring at Kaffee.

                                     ROSS
                              (continuing)
                         Lt. Kendrick, did you --

                                     KENDRICK
                         No I did not.

                                     ROSS
                         Thank you.

               INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               JO and KAFFEE. KAFFEE's pumped and shooting baskets as Sam 
               walks in with some bound papers under his arm.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What's the word?

                                     SAM
                         This is the tower chief's log for 
                         that night. Jessep was telling the 
                         truth. The six a.m. flight was the 
                         first plane out.

               KAFFEE lets the ball drop out of his hands.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Let me see that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A MOTEL - NIGHT

               A SEDAN, with U.S. MARSHALL stenciled on the door, sits in 
               front of one of the rooms, and the two FEDERAL AGENTS inside 
               the car are reading the newspaper as KAFFEE'S CAR pulls next 
               to them and KAFFEE jumps out.

               AGENT #1 sticks his head out the window and calls to KAFFEE --

                                     AGENT #1
                         Workin' late, lieutenant?

               KAFFEE pays no attention and bangs on MARKINSON's door. The 
               door opens and KAFFEE walks into

               INT. MOTEL ROOM

               HE tosses the log book on the table.

                                     KAFFEE
                         There was no flight out at eleven 
                         o'clock. What the fuck are you trying 
                         to pull?

                                     MARKINSON
                         The first flight stateside left 
                         Guantanamo Bay at eleven and arrived 
                         at Andrews Airforce Base, Maryland, 
                         at a few minutes past two.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Then why the hell isn't it listed in 
                         the Tower Chief's log?!

                                     MARKINSON
                         Why the hell did you think it would 
                         be?!!

               KAFFEE is silent. And now it begins to sink in.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What are you telling me?
                              (beat)
                         He fixed the log book?

               Setback. Big setback.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Well, maybe he can make it so a plane 
                         didn't take off, but I can sure as 
                         hall prove that one landed. I'll get 
                         the log book from Andrews.

               MARKINSON says nothing. But his face says that KAFFEE was 
               born yesterday.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing; beat)
                         He made an entire flight disappear?

                                     MARKINSON
                         Nathan Jessep is about to be named 
                         Director of Operations for the 
                         National Security Council. You don't 
                         get to that position without knowing 
                         how to side-step a few land mines.
                              (beat)
                         And putting me on the stand isn't 
                         gonna make him step on one.

               KAFFEE stares at him.

               Then shakes his head, sighs, and picks the log book up off 
               the table, and heads for the door.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You're taking the stand. Thursday.

               KAFFEE leaves.

               HOLD on MARKINSON.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               KAFFEE'S APARTMENT later that night and SAM and J0 have just 
               heard the report him.

                                     KAFFEE
                         There's gotta be someone who can 
                         testify to the flight. A ground crew 
                         member. Someone.

                                     SAM
                         Do you have any idea how many planes 
                         take off and land every day? A kid 
                         from the ground crew isn't gonna 
                         remember a flight that landed four 
                         weeks ago.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Forget the flight. We'll put Markinson 
                         on the stand and we'll deal with 
                         Jessep's refusal to transfer Santiago 
                         and he'll testify to the forged 
                         transfer order. That'll be enough. 
                         That and Downey's testimony really 
                         oughta be enough.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Private Downey, why did you go into 
                         Santiago's room on the night of the 
                         6th?

                         To give Private Santiago a Code Red, 
                         ma'am.

                                     JO
                         And why did you give him a Code Red?

                                     DOWNEY
                         I was ordered to give him a Code Red 
                         by the Executive officer for Rifle

                                     MARKINSON (V.O.)
                         "Dear Mr. and Mrs. Santiago..."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MARKINSON'S ROOM - DAY

               MARKINSON is writing a letter and we HEAR it in V.O.

                                     MARKINSON (V.O.)
                         I was William's company commander.  
                         I knew your son vaguely, which is to 
                         say I knew his name...

               And while we continue to HEAR Markinson's voice writing the 
               letter, we begin a SERIES OF SHOTS: MARKINSON is getting 
               into his class A dress uniform, complete with medals, side 
               arm, and military dress sabre.

                                     MARKINSON (V.O.)
                         In a matter of time, the trial of 
                         the two man charged with your son's 
                         death will be concluded, and seven 
                         men and two women whom you've never 
                         met will try to offer you an 
                         explanation as to why William is 
                         dead. For my part, I've done as much 
                         as I can to bring the truth to light.

               MARKINSON is finished dressing. He stands in the middle of 
               the motel room.

                                     MARKINSON (V.O.)
                              (continuing)
                         And the truth is this: your son is 
                         dead for only one reason. I wasn't 
                         strong enough to stop it.

               MARKINSON takes a pistol out of his holster and cocks the 
               trigger.

                                     MARKINSON (V.O.)
                         Always, Captain Matthew Andrew 
                         Markinson.

               MARKINSON puts the pistol in his mouth --

               EXT. THE COURTROOM - DAY

               Kaffee is at the end of his examination of Downey.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Private, I want you to tell us one 
                         last time: Why did you go into Private 
                         Santiago's room on the night of August 
                         6th?

                                     DOWNEY
                         A code red was ordered by my platoon 
                         commander, Lt. Jonathan James 
                         Kendrick.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Thank you.
                              (to ROSS)
                         Your witness.

                                     ROSS
                         Private, for the week of 2 August, 
                         the switch log has you down at Post 
                         39, is that correct?

                                     DOWNEY
                         I'm sure it is, sir, they keep that 
                         log pretty good.

                                     ROSS
                         How far is it from Post 39 to the 
                         Windward barracks?

                                     DOWNEY
                         It's a ways, sir, it's a hike.

                                     ROSS
                         About how far by jeep?

                                     DOWNEY
                         About ten, fifteen minutes, sir.

                                     ROSS
                         Have you ever had to walk it?

                                     DOWNEY
                         Yes sir. That day, sir. Friday. The 
                         Pick-up Private -- sir, that's what 
                         we call the fella who drops us at 
                         our posts and picks us up... also, 
                         'cause he can get girls in New York 
                         City -- the Pick-up Private got a 
                         flat...

               At the defense table, KAFFEE, poker-faced, scribbles something 
               down on a piece of paper and slides it to JO. JO looks at 
               it:

               "Where's he going with this?" JO scribbles "?" And hands it 
               back to KAFFEE.

                                     DOWNEY
                              (continuing)
                         ...Right at 39. He pulled up and 
                         blam! ...A blowout-with no spare. 
                         The two of us had to double-time it 
                         back to the barracks.

                                     ROSS
                         And if it's ten or fifteen minutes 
                         by jeep, I'm guessing it must be a 
                         good hour by foot, am I right?

                                     DOWNEY
                         Pick-up and me did it in 45 flat, 
                         sir.

                                     ROSS
                         Not bad. Now you say your assault on 
                         Private Santiago was the result of 
                         an order that Lt. Kendrick gave in 
                         your barracks room at 16:20.

               KAFFEE knows what's coming. There's nothing he can do about 
               it. And he can't lose his cool in front of the jury.

                                     DOWNEY
                         Yes sir.

               JO. Helpless. Panicked.

                                     ROSS
                         But you just said that you didn't 
                         make it back to Windward Barracks 
                         until 16:45.

               DOWNEY's confused. These are questions he hasn't been asked 
               before.

                                     DOWNEY
                         Sir?

                                     ROSS
                         If you didn't make it back to your 
                         barracks until 16:45, then how could 
                         you be in your room at 16:20?

                                     DOWNEY
                              (pause)
                         You see sir, there was a flat tire.

                                     ROSS
                         Private, did you ever actually hear 
                         Lt. Kendrick order a Code Red?

               KAFFEE's world is falling down around him, and there's nothing 
               he can do about it. And he knows it.

                                     DOWNEY
                              (pause)
                         No, sir.

               Jo leaps to her feet.

                                     JO
                         Please the court, I'd like to request 
                         a recess in order to confer with my 
                         client.

                                     ROSS
                         Why did you go into Santiago's room?

                                     JO
                         The witness has rights.

                                     ROSS
                         The witness has been read his rights, 
                         commander.

                                     DOWNEY
                              (confused)
                         Hal?

                                     RANDOLPH
                         The question will be repeated.

                                     ROSS
                         Why did you go into Santiago's room?

                                     JO
                         Your honor --

                                     DOWNEY
                         Hal?

                                     ROSS
                         Did Corporal Dawson tell you to do 
                         it?

               Everyone is frozen.

                                     ROSS
                              (continuing)
                         He did, didn't he? Dawson told you 
                         to give Santiago a code red.

               DOWNEY looks at DAWSON.

                                     DOWNEY
                         Hal?

                                     ROSS
                         Don't look at him.

                                     DOWNEY
                         Hal?

                                     DAWSON
                         Private. Answer the Lieutenant's 
                         question.

               The room is still silent. DOWNEY does something we've never 
               seen him do before. He straightens himself up and says this 
               with the pride of a man who believes he's done the right 
               thing.

                                     DOWNEY
                         Yes, Lieutenant. I was given an order 
                         by my squad leader, Lance Corporal 
                         Harold W. Dawson of the U.S. Marine 
                         Corps. And I followed it.

               ROSS let's it hang. He looks over at KAFFEE. KAFFEE won't 
               meet his eyes.

               INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               JO and SAM are sitting in silence. It's dark outside.

                                     JO
                         Where do you think he is?

               SAM doesn't know. JO is beside herself, and trying to keep 
               it together.

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
                         As far as Downey was concerned, it 
                         was an order from Kendrick. It didn't 
                         matter that he didn't hear it first 
                         hand. He doesn't distinguish between 
                         the two.

               SAM understands, but he doesn't say anything. The door opens 
               and KAFFEE walks in.

                                     JO
                              (continuing)
                         Danny. I'm sorry.

               KAFFEE seems to be in an incredibly normal mood.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Don't worry about it.

                                     JO
                         Sam and I were just talking about 
                         how all we really have to do is call 
                         some witnesses who'll talk about 
                         implied orders... or maybe we put 
                         Downey back on the stand before we 
                         get to Dawson.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Maybe if we work at it we can get 
                         Dawson charged with the Kennedy 
                         assassination.

               JO studies KAFFEE for a moment.

                                     JO
                         Are you drunk?

                                     KAFFEE
                              (a simple answer)
                         Pretty much. Yeah.

                                     JO
                              (pause)
                         I'll make a pot of coffee. We have a 
                         long night's work ahead.

                                     KAFFEE
                         She's gonna make coffee. That's nice.
                              (beat)
                         He wasn't in his room.
                              (Kaffee's amazed)
                         He wasn't even there.
                              (beat)
                         That was an important piece of 
                         information, don't you think?

                                     JO
                              (pause)
                         Danny, it was just a setback. I'm 
                         sorry. But we'll fix it and then 
                         move on to Markinson.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Markinson's dead.

               JO and SAM are frozen.

               KAFFEE says this with no particular feeling one way or the 
               other.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         You really gotta hand it to those 
                         Federal Marshals, boy.
                              (he almost has to 
                              laugh)
                         It's not like he hanged himself by 
                         his shoelaces or slashed his wrists 
                         with a concealed butter knife. This 
                         guy got, into full dress uniform, 
                         stood in the middle of that room, 
                         drew a nickle plated pistol from his 
                         holster, and fired a bullet into his 
                         mouth.

               Jo and SAM don't say anything.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Anyway, since we seem to be out of 
                         witnesses, I thought I'd drink a 
                         little.

                                     JO
                         I still think we can win.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Then maybe you should drink a little.

                                     JO
                         Look, we'll go to Randolph in the 
                         morning and make a motion for a 
                         continuance. 24 hours.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         Why would we want to do that?

                                     JO
                         To subpoena Colonel Jessep.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What?

                                     JO
                         Listen for a second --

                                     KAFFEE
                         No.

                                     JO
                         Just hear me out --

                                     KAFFEE
                         No. I won't listen to you and I won't 
                         hear you out. Your passion is 
                         comforting, Jo. It's also useless. 
                         Private Downey needed a trial lawyer 
                         today.

                                     JO
                              (pause)
                         You chicken-shit. You're gonna use 
                         what happened today as an excuse to 
                         give up.

                                     KAFFEE
                         It's over!

                                     JO
                         Why did you ask Jessep for the 
                         transfer order?

                                     KAFFEE
                         What are you --

                                     JO
                         In Cuba. Why did you ask Jessep for 
                         the transfer order?

                                     KAFFEE
                         What does it matter --

                                     JO
                         Why?!

                                     KAFFEE
                         I wanted the damn transfer order!

                                     JO
                         Bullshit! You could've gotten it by 
                         picking up the phone and calling any 
                         one of a dozen departments at the 
                         Pentagon. You didn't want the transfer 
                         order. You wanted to see Jessep's 
                         reaction when you asked for the 
                         transfer order. You had an instinct. 
                         And it was confirmed by Markinson. 
                         Now damnit, let's put Jessep on the 
                         stand and end this thing!

                                     KAFFEE
                         What possible good could come from 
                         putting Jessep on the stand?

                                     JO
                         He told Kendrick to order the Code 
                         Red.

                                     KAFFEE
                         He did?! Why didn't you say so!? 
                         That's qreat! And of course you have 
                         proof of that.

                                     JO
                         I --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Ah, I keep forgetting: You were sick 
                         the day they taught law at law school.

                                     JO
                         You put him on the stand and you get 
                         it from him!

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes. No problem. We get it from him.
                              (to SAM)
                         Colonel, isn't it true that you 
                         ordered the Code Red on Santiago?

                                     SAM
                         Look, we're all a little --

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm sorry, your time's run out. What 
                         do we have for the losers, Judge? 
                         Well, for our defendants it's a 
                         lifetime at exotic Fort Levenworth. 
                         And for defense counsel Kaffee? That's 
                         right -- it's -- a court -- martial. 
                         Yes, Johnny, after falsely accusing 
                         a marine officer of conspiracy, Lt.  
                         Kaffee will have a long and prosperous 
                         career teaching typewriter maintenance 
                         at the Rocco Columbo School for Women.  
                         Thank you for playing "Should We or 
                         Should-We-Not Follow the Advice of 
                         the Galacticly Stupid".

               And with one motion, he knocks everything from his desk. A 
               ton of papers, books, files, etc., falls to the floor.

               There's dead silence. Maybe just the sound of KAFFEE breathing 
               after this exhausting outburst.

               Finally...

                                     JO
                         I'm sorry I lost you your set of 
                         steak knives.

               Jo picks up her purse and coat and walks out. The door slams 
               behind her.

               KAFFEE walks into the kitchen without a word.

               SAM gets down on the floor and begins picking up all the 
               stuff that Kaffee knocked off the desk.

               KAFFEE comes back in with a bottle of Jack Daniels.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Stop cleaning up.

               But Sam continues.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Sam. Stop cleaning up.

               SAM stops and sits in a chair. KAFFEE sits on the couch.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         You want a drink?

                                     SAM
                         Yeah.

               SAM takes a swig from the bottle.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Is your father proud of you?

                                     SAM
                         Don't do this to yourself.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'll bet he is. I'll bet he bores 
                         the shit outta the neighbors and the 
                         relatives. "Sam, made Law Review.  
                         He's got a big case he's making -- 
                         He's arguing making an argument."
                              (pause)
                         I think my father would've enjoyed 
                         seeing me graduate from law school.
                              (beat)
                         I think he would've liked that... an 
                         awful lot.

                                     SAM
                         Did I ever tell you that I wrote a 
                         paper on your father in college?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yeah?

                                     SAM
                         He was one of the best trial lawyers 
                         ever.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes he was.

                                     SAM
                         And if I were Dawson and Downey and 
                         I had a choice between you or your 
                         father to represent me in this case, 
                         I'd take you any day of the week and 
                         twice on Sunday. You should have 
                         seen yourself thunder away at 
                         Kendrick.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Would you put Jessep on the stand?

                                     SAM
                         No.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You think my father would've?

                                     SAM
                         With the evidence we've got? Not in 
                         a million years. But here's the thing --
                         and there's really no way of getting 
                         around this -- neither Lionel Kaffee 
                         nor Sam Weinberg are lead counsel 
                         for the defense in the matter of 
                         U.S. versus Dawson and Downey. So 
                         there's only one question. What would 
                         you do?

               We HOLD on the two of them for a moment, then

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

               JO is walking through the night at a brisk pace. She's doing 
               her best not to fall apart.

               TWO HEADLIGHTS appear coming down the street, and KAFFEE's 
               CAR, with SAM driving and KAFFEE riding shotgun, slows down 
               alongside JO. KAFFEE rolls down his window.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Joanne.

               JO ignores them and keeps walking. The car crawls along with 
               her.

               JO starts walking faster.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Jo, we look ridiculous.
                              (to SAM)
                         Stop the car.

               KAFFEE hops out and calls --

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Joanne.

               JO keeps walking.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         I apologize. I was angry and... I'm 
                         sorry about what I said.

               But JO'S still walking.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing; calling)
                         I'm gonna put Jessep on the stand.

               She stops. She turns around.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KAFFEE'S APARTMENT - LATER - AFTERNOON

               A nerf ball bounces off the wall.

               KAFFEE, JO and SAM are sprawled out in the living room. For 
               hours now they've been trying to come up with an idea.  
               KAFFEE's mind seems to be on his basketball game.

                                     JO
                         I say we hit him with the phoney 
                         transfer order.

                                     SAM
                         What's the transfer order without a 
                         witness?

                                     KAFFEE
                         We have a witness.

                                     SAM
                         A dead witness.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And in the hands of a lesser attorney, 
                         that'd be a problem.

                                     SAM
                         Look at this. Last night he was 
                         swimming in his Jack Daniels, now he 
                         can leap tall buildings in a single 
                         bound.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm getting my second wind. Siddown. 
                         Both of you.

               He sees that SAM and JO were already sitting down.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Good.
                              (beat)
                         Jessep told Kendrick to order a code 
                         red. Kendrick did, and our clients 
                         followed the order. The cover-up 
                         isn't our case. To win, Jessep has 
                         to tell the jury that he ordered the 
                         code red.

                                     SAM
                         And you think you can got him to 
                         just say it?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I think he wants to say it. I think 
                         he's pissed off that he's gotta hide 
                         from us. I think he wants to say 
                         that he made a command decision and 
                         that's the end of it. He eats 
                         breakfast 80 yards away from 4000 
                         Cubans who are trained to kill him, 
                         and no one's gonna tell him how to 
                         run his base. Least of all the pushy 
                         broad, the smart Jew, and the Harvard 
                         clown. I need to shake him and put 
                         him on the defensive.

               SAM and JO are silent for a moment.

                                     SAM
                         That's it? That's the plan?

                                     KAFFEE
                         That's the plan.

                                     SAM
                         You're gonna trip Jessep and he's 
                         gonna confess.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm not gonna trip him. I'm gonna 
                         lead him right where he's dying to 
                         go.

                                     SAM
                         And how are you gonna do that?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I have no idea. I need my bat.

                                     JO
                         What?

                                     KAFFEE
                              (looking around)
                         I need my bat. I think better with 
                         my bat. Where's my bat?

                                     JO
                         I put it in the closet.

                                     KAFFEE
                         You put it in the closet.

               KAFFEE heads to the closet.

                                     JO
                         I was tripping over it.

                                     KAFFEE (O.S.)
                         Don't ever put a bat in a closet.

                                     JO
                         He thinks better with his bat?

               And we go to KAFFEE AT THE CLOSET.

               OFFSCREEN WE HEAR

                                     SAM (O.S.)
                         I can understand that. I used to 
                         have stuffed panda named Mr. Boob. I 
                         could never do my home work without 
                         him.

               During this, KAFFEE's opened the closet door. He reaches in 
               to grab his bat when all of a sudden he notices something:

               His clothes.

               His uniforms and his civilian clothes. Hanging neatly along 
               the bar. He stares at this a moment, then suddenly heads 
               back through the living room towards the front door.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Stay here, I'm going to the office 
                         for a while.

               KAFFEE storms out.

                                     SAM
                         Boy, he does think better with that 
                         bat.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE COMPUTER ROOM - DUSK

               A small room at the end of a corridor at the office. KAFFEE 
               stands over a printer and watches it spit out something he's 
               been waiting for. He tears the printout off and we

               INT. KAFFEE'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING

               KAFFEE is looking over the computer printout. From what we 
               can tell, it resembles a large, military coded phone bill.

               KAFFEE picks up the phone and dials.

                                     KAFFEE

                         What's goin' on?

                         I've gotta go out to Andrews.

               The day's session is going to begin in a few minutes. KAFFEE 
               comes around the corner and runs into Jo.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Is Sam here?

                         Not yet.

                         He's on his way.

                         Did he got the guys?

                         Yes. Listen, can I talk to you for a 
                         second?

                         How're you feeling?

                         I think he's gonna have his hands 
                         full today.

                                     JO

               KAFFEE takes that in. He picks up his briefcase and grabs 
               his jacket.

               Then he turns to JO.

                         Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

                                     ROSS
                         Thank you, sir, would you have a 
                         seat, please.

               JESSEP sits.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Colonel, when you learned of 
                         Santiago's letter to the NIS, you 
                         had a meeting with your two senior 
                         officers, is that right?

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         The Executive Officer, Lt. Jonathan 
                         Kendrick, and the Company Commander, 
                         Captain Matthew Markinson.

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And at present, Captain Markinson is 
                         dead, is that right?

                                     ROSS
                         Objection. I'd like to know just 
                         what defense counsel is implying?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm implying simply that, at present, 
                         Captain Markinson is not alive.

                                     ROSS
                         Surely Colonel Jessep doesn't need 
                         to appear in this courtroom to confirm 
                         that information.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I just wasn't sure if the witness 
                         was aware that two days ago, Captain 
                         Markinson took his own life with a 
                         .45 caliber pistol.

               And from the back of the room, SAM enters. He's escorting 
               two young AIRMEN in Airforce dress uniforms. SAM shows the 
               AIRMEN to a seat near the front, and takes his place at the 
               defense table.

               Over this we HEAR --

                                     RANDOLPH (O.S.)
                         The witness is aware, the Court is 
                         aware, and now the jury is aware. We 
                         thank you for bringing this to our 
                         attention. Move on Lieutenant.

               SAM scribbles something on a piece of paper, KAFFEE walks 
               over, looks at the paper on which are wrttten two names: 
               Cecil O'Malley and Anthony Perez, then turns back to RANDOLPH.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes sir. Colonel, at the time of 
                         this meeting, you gave Lt. Kendrick 
                         an order, is that right?

                                     JESSEP
                         I told Kendrick to tell his men that 
                         Santiago wasn't to be touched.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And did you give an order to Captain 
                         Markinson as well?

                                     JESSEP
                         I ordered Markinson to have Santiago 
                         transferred off the base immediately.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Why?

                                     JESSEP
                         I felt that his life might be in 
                         danger once word of the letter got 
                         out.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Grave danger?

                                     JESSEP
                         Is there another kind?

               KAFFEE holds up a document from his table.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We have the transfer order that you 
                         and Markinson co-signed, ordering 
                         that Santiago be lifted on a flight 
                         leaving Guantanamo at six the next 
                         morning. Was that the first flight 
                         off the bass?

                                     JESSEP
                         The six a.m. flight was the first 
                         flight off the base.

               KAFFEE nods and decides to move on.

               JESSEP steals a quick glance at the two AIRMEN sitting out 
               in the courtroom.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Colonel, you flew up to Washington 
                         early this morning, is that right?

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I notice you're wearing your Class A 
                         appearance in dress uniform for court 
                         today.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         As are you, Lieutenant.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did you wear that uniform on the 
                         plane?

                                     ROSS
                         Please the Court, is this dialogue 
                         relevant to anything in particular?

                                     KAFFEE
                         The defense didn't have an opportunity 
                         to depose this witness, your honor.  
                         I'd ask the Court for a little 
                         latitude.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         A very little latitude.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Colonel?

                                     JESSEP
                         I wore fatigues on the plane.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And you brought your dress uniform 
                         with you.

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And a toothbrush? A shaving kit? 
                         Change of underwear?

                                     ROSS
                         Your honor.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (to ROSS)
                         Is the Colonel's underwear a matter 
                         of national security?

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Gentlemen.
                              (to KAFFEE)
                         You better get somewhere fast with 
                         this, Lieutenant.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes sir. Colonel?

                                     JESSEP
                         I brought a change of clothes and 
                         some personal items.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Thank you.

               KAFFEE gets a document from his table.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         After Dawson and Downey's arrest on 
                         the night of the sixth, Santiago's 
                         barracks room was sealed off and its 
                         contents inventoried.

                         belts, 1 sweater --

                                     ROSS
                         Please the Court, is there a question 
                         anywhere in our future?

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Lt. Kaffee, I have to --

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm wondering why Santiago wasn't 
                         packed.

               That landed. On the JURY, RANDOLPH, ROSS...

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         I'll tell you what, we'll get back 
                         to that one in a minute.

               JO hands KAFFEE the computer printout.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         This is a record of all telephone 
                         calls made from your base in the 
                         past 24 hours. After being subpoenaed 
                         to Washington, you made three calls.

               Handing Jessep the printout --

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         I've highlighted those calls in 
                         yellow. Do you recognize those 
                         numbers?

                                     JESSEP
                         I called Colonel Fitzhuqhes in 
                         Quantico, Va. I wanted to let him 
                         know I'd be in town. The second call 
                         was to set up a meeting with 
                         Congressman Ramond of the House Armed 
                         Services Committee, and the third 
                         call was to my sister Elizabeth.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Why did you make that call, sir?

                                     JESSEP
                         I thought she might like to have 
                         dinner tonight.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         I'm gonna put a stop to this now.

               Jo's handed KAFFEE another printout and a stack of letters.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Your honor, these are the telephone 
                         records from GITMO for August 6th.  
                         And these are 14 letters that Santiago 
                         wrote in nine months requesting, in 
                         fact begging, for a transfer.
                              (to JESSEP)
                         Upon hearing the news that he was 
                         finally getting his transfer, Santiago 
                         was so excited, that do you know how 
                         many people he called? Zero. Nobody. 
                         Not one call to his parents saying 
                         he was coming home. Not one call to 
                         a friend saying can you pick me up 
                         at the airport. He was asleep in his 
                         bed at midnight, and according to 
                         you he was getting on a plane in six 
                         hours, yet everything he owned was 
                         hanging neatly in his closet and 
                         folded neatly in his footlocker. You 
                         were leaving for one day and you 
                         packed a bag and made three phone 
                         calls. Santiago was leaving for the 
                         rest of his life, and he hadn't called 
                         a soul and he hadn't packed a thing. 
                         Can you explain that? The fact is 
                         there was no transfer order. Santiago 
                         wasn't going anywhere, isn't that 
                         right, Colonel.

                                     ROSS
                         Object. Your Honor, it's obvious 
                         that Lt. Kaffee's intention this 
                         morning is to smear a high ranking 
                         marine officer in the desperate hope 
                         that the mere appearance of 
                         impropriety will win him points with 
                         the jury. It's my recommendation, 
                         sir, that Lt. Kaffee receive an 
                         official reprimand from the bench, 
                         and that the witness be excused with 
                         the Court's deepest apologies.

               RANDOLPH ponders this a moment.

                                     RANDOLPH
                              (pause)
                         Overruled.

                                     ROSS
                         Your honor --

                                     RANDOLPH
                         The objection's noted.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (beat)
                         Colonel?

               Jessep's smiling...

               ...and now he can't help but let out a short laugh.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Is this funny, sir?

                                     JESSEP
                         No. It's not. It's tragic.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Do you have an answer?

                                     JESSEP
                         Absolutely. My answer is I don't 
                         have the first damn clue. Maybe he 
                         was an early morning riser and he 
                         liked to pack in the nq. And maybe 
                         he didn't have any friends. I'm an 
                         educated man, but I'm afraid I can't 
                         speak intelligently about the travel 
                         habits of William Santiago.  What I 
                         do know is that he was set to leave 
                         the base at 0600. Now are these really 
                         the questions I was called here to 
                         answer? Phone calls and footlockers? 
                         Please tell me you've got something 
                         more, Lieutenant. Please tell me 
                         there's an ace up your sleeve. These 
                         two marines are on trial for their 
                         lives. Please tell me their lawyer 
                         hasn't pinned their hopes to a phone 
                         bill.
                              (beat)
                         Do you have any other questions for 
                         me, counselor?

               The courtroom is silenced. Jessep's slammed the door.

               KAFFEE looks around the room, sees that the world is waiting 
               for him to do something...

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Lt. Kaffee?

               KAFFEE says nothing. He glances over to AIRMEN O'MALLEY and 
               PEREZ.

                                     RANDOLPH
                              (continuing)
                         Lieutenant, do you have anything 
                         further for this witness?

               KAFFEE doesn't respond. JESSEP gets up to leave.

                                     JESSEP
                              (standing)
                         Thanks, Danny. I love Washington.

               And JESSEP starts to leave, but he's stopped by --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Excuse me, I didn't dismiss you.

               JESSEP turns around.

                                     JESSEP
                         I beg your pardon.

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm not through with my examination. 
                         Sit down.

                                     JESSEP
                         Colonel.

                                     KAFFEE
                         What's that?

                                     JESSEP
                              (to RANDOLPH)
                         I'd appreciate it if he addressed me 
                         as Colonel or Sir. I believe I've 
                         earned it.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Defense counsel will address the 
                         witness as Colonel or Sir.

                                     JESSEP
                              (to RANDOLPH)
                         I don't know what the hell kind of 
                         an outfit you're running here.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         And the witness will address this 
                         Court as Judge or Your Honor. I'm 
                         quite certain I've earned it. Take 
                         your seat, Colonel.

               Jessep goes back to the stand.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         What would you like to discuss now! 
                         My favorite color?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Colonel, the six a.m. flight, was 
                         the first one off the base?

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes.

                                     KAFFEE
                         There wasn't a flight that left seven 
                         hours earlier and landed at Andrews 
                         Airforce Base at 2 a.m.?

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Lieutenant, I think we've covered 
                         this, haven't we?

               KAFFEE gets the two log books from his table as well as the 
               piece of paper that SAM scribbled on.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Your Honor, these are the Tower 
                         Chief's Logs for both Guantanamo Bay 
                         and Andrews Airforce Base. The 
                         Guantanamo log lists no flight that 
                         left at eleven p.m., and the Andrews 
                         log lists no flight that landed at 2 
                         a.m. I'd like to admit them as Defense 
                         Exhibits "A" and "B".

                                     RANDOLPH
                         I don't understand. You're admitting 
                         evidence of a flight that never 
                         existed?

                                     KAFFEE
                         We believe it did, sir.
                              (glancing at the paper, 
                              then motioning to 
                              the AIRMEN)
                         Defense'll be calling Airman Cecil 
                         O'Malley and Airman Anthony Perez. 
                         They were working the ground crew at 
                         Andrews at two a.m. on the seventh.

                                     ROSS
                         Your Honor, these men weren't on the 
                         list. Rebuttal witnesses, Your Honor, 
                         called specifically to refute 
                         testimony offered under direct 
                         examination.

               If you looked closely at JESSEP, you could see a drop of 
               sweat.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         I'll allow the witnesses.

                                     JESSEP
                         This is ridiculous.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Colonel, a moment ago --

                                     JESSEP
                         Check the Tower Logs for christ's 
                         sake.

                                     KAFFEE
                         We'll get to the airmen in just a 
                         minute, sir. A moment ago said that 
                         you ordered Kendrick to order his 
                         men not to touch Santiago.

                                     JESSEP
                         That's right.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And Kendrick was clear on what you 
                         wanted?

                                     JESSEP
                         Crystal.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Any chance Kendrick ignored the order?

                                     JESSEP
                         Ignored the order?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Any chance he just forgot about it?

                                     JESSEP
                         No.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Any chance Kendrick left your office 
                         and said, "The 'old man's wrong"?

                                     JESSEP
                         No.

                                     KAFFEE
                         When Kendrick spoke to the platoon 
                         and ordered them not to touch 
                         Santiago, any chance they ignored 
                         him?

                                     JESSEP
                         Have you ever spent time in an 
                         infantry unit, son?

                                     KAFFEE
                         No sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         Ever served in a forward area?

                                     KAFFEE
                         No sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         Ever put your life in another man's 
                         hands, ask him to put his life in 
                         yours?

                                     KAFFEE
                         No sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         We follow orders, son. We follow 
                         orders or people die. It's that 
                         simple. Are we clear?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Yes sir.

                                     JESSEP
                         Are we clear?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Crystal.

               KAFFEE speaks with the quiet confidence that comes from 
               knowing you're about to drop your opponents

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing; beat)
                         Colonel, I have just one more question 
                         before I call Airman O'Malley and 
                         Airman Perez: If you gave an order 
                         that Santiago wasn't to be touched, 
                         and your orders are always followed, 
                         then why would he be in danger, why 
                         would it be necessary to transfer 
                         him off the base?

               And JESSEP has no answer.

               Nothing.

               He sits there, and for the first time, seems to be lost.

                                     JESSEP
                         Private Santiago was a sub-standard 
                         marine. He was being transferred off 
                         the base because --

                                     KAFFEE
                         But that's not what you said. You 
                         said he was being transferred because 
                         he was in grave danger.

                                     JESSEP
                              (pause)
                         Yes. That's correct, but --

                                     KAFFEE
                         You said, "He was in danger". I said, 
                         "Grave danger". You said --

                                     JESSEP
                         Yes, I recall what --

                         I can have the Court Reporter read 
                         back your --

                                     JESSEP
                         I know what I said. I don't need it 
                         read back to me like I'm a damn --

                                     KAFFEE
                         Then why the two orders?
                              (beat)
                         Colonel?
                              (beat)
                         Why did you --

                                     JESSEP
                         Sometimes men take matters into their 
                         own hands.

                                     KAFFEE
                         No sir. You made it clear just a 
                         moment ago that your men never take 
                         matters into their own hands. Your 
                         men follow orders or people die. So 
                         Santiago shouldn't have been in any 
                         danger at all, should he have, 
                         Colonel?

               Everyone's sweating now. Everyone but KAFFEE.

                                     JESSEP
                         You little bastard.

                                     ROSS
                         Your Honor, I have to ask for a recess 
                         to --

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'd like an answer to the question, 
                         Judge.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         The Court'll wait for answer.

                                     KAFFEE
                         If Kendrick told his men that Santiago 
                         wasn't to be touched, then why did 
                         he have to be transferred?

               Jessep is looking at O'MALLEY and PEREZ.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Colonel?

               JESSEP says nothing.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         Kendrick ordered the code red, didn't 
                         he? Because that's what you told 
                         Kendrick to do.

                                     ROSS
                         Object!

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Counsel.

               KAFFEE will plow through the objections of ROSS and the 
               admonishments of RANDOLPH.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And when it went bad, you cut these 
                         guys loose.

                                     ROSS
                         Your Honor --

                                     RANDOLPH
                         That'll be all, counsel.

                         You had Markinson sign a phony 
                         transfer order --

                         You doctored the log books.

                         Damnit Kaffee!!

                         I'll ask for the forth time. You 
                         ordered --

                                     JESSEP
                         You want answers?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I think I'm entitled to them.

                                     JESSEP
                         You want answers?!

                                     KAFFEE
                         I want the truth.

                                     JESSEP
                         You can't handle the truth!

               And nobody moves.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         Son, we live in a world that has 
                         walls. And those walls have to be 
                         guarded by men with guns. Who's gonna 
                         do it? You? You, Lt. Weinberg? I 
                         have a greater responsibility than 
                         you can possibly fathom. You weep 
                         for Santiago and you curse the 
                         marines. You have that luxury. You 
                         have the luxury of not knowing what 
                         I know: That Santiago's death, while 
                         tragic, probably saved lives. And my 
                         existence, while grotesque and 
                         incomprehensible to you, saves lives.
                              (beat)
                         You don't want the truth. Because 
                         deep down, in places you don't talk 
                         about at parties, you want me on 
                         that wall. You need me there.
                              (boasting)
                         We use words like honor, code, 
                         loyalty... we use these words as the 
                         backbone to a life spent defending 
                         something. You use 'em as a punchline.
                              (beat)
                         I have neither the time nor the 
                         inclination to explain myself to a 
                         man who rises and sleeps under the 
                         blanket of the very freedom I provide, 
                         then questions the manner in which I 
                         provide it. I'd prefer you just said 
                         thank you and went on your way. 
                         Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a 
                         weapon and stand a post. Either way, 
                         I don't give a damn what you think 
                         you're entitled to.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (quietly)
                         Did you order the code red?

                                     JESSEP
                              (beat)
                         I did the job you sent me to do.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Did you order the code red?

                                     JESSEP
                              (pause)
                         You're goddamn right I did.

               Silence. From everyone. RANDOLPH, ROSS, the M.P.'s, they're 
               all frozen. JO and SAM are likewise. JESSEP seems strangely, 
               quietly relieved. KAFFEE simply takes control of the room 
               now.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Please the court, I suggest the jury 
                         be dismissed so that we can move to 
                         an immediate Article 39a Session.  
                         The witness has rights.

               Silence.

               RANDOLPH looks to ROSS.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Lt. Ross?

               ROSS is frozen. He doesn't know what to do.

                                     KAFFEE
                              (as a friend)
                         Jack.

               ROSS looks at KAFFEE, then JESSEP, then nods his head "yes" 
               to RANDOLPH.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         The Sergeant at Arms will take the 
                         jury to an ante-room where you'll 
                         wait until further instruction.

               The SERGEANT AT ARMS begins leading the JURORS out of the 
               room.

                                     JESSEP
                         What the hell's going on?

               No one will say anything until the jurors are out of the 
               room.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing; to captain)
                         Captain, what the hell's going on? I 
                         did my job. I'd do it again. Now I'm 
                         getting on a plane and going back to 
                         my base.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         M.P.'s, guard the prisoner.

               The M.P.'s are tentative. They've never heard a marine colonel 
               referred to as "the prisoner" before. They sure as hell have 
               never been asked to guard one.

                                     ROSS
                         Guard the prisoner.

                                     JESSEP
                         What the hell --

                                     ROSS
                         Colonel Jessep, you have the right 
                         to remain silent. Any statement you 
                         do make can be used against you in a 
                         trial by court-martial or other 
                         judicial or administrative proceeding.  
                         You have the right...

               ROSS continues reading JESSEP his rights, over --

                                     JESSEP
                         I'm being charged with a crime? I'm -- 
                         that's what this is --
                              (to Ross)
                         Marine!
                              (Ross keeps going)
                         Marine!!
                              (Ross is doing his 
                              job.)
                         I'm being charged with a crime? I'm -- 
                         that's what's happening? This -- I'm --
                         this is funny, you know that, this 
                         is --

               And JESSEP lunges at KAFFEE, and KAFFEE would be dead but 
               for the three M.P.'s who've leapt in to restrain JESSEP.  
               SAM and JO have come to their feet and stand behind KAFFEE.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing; to Kaffee)
                         I'm gonna tear your eyes right outta 
                         your head and piss in your dead skull.  
                         You fucked with the wrong marine.

               ROSS is done reading JESSEP his rights.

                                     ROSS
                         Colonel Jessep, do you understand 
                         those rights as I have just read 
                         then to you?

                                     JESSEP
                         I saved lives. That boy was -- there 
                         was a weak link. I saved lives, you 
                         hear me?

               The courtroom is silent from Jessep's outburst. Jessep shakes 
               his head.

                                     JESSEP
                              (continuing)
                         You fuckin' people.
                              (beat)
                         You have no idea how to defend a 
                         nation.
                              (continuing; to KAFFEE)
                         All you did was weaken a country 
                         today, Kaffee. That's all you did. 
                         You put people in danger. Sweet 
                         dreams, son.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Don't call me son.
                              (beat)
                         I'm a lawyer, and an officer of the 
                         United States Navy. And you're under 
                         arrest you sonofabitch.

               KAFFEE stays on JESSEP a moment longer, then remembers --

                                     KAFFEE
                              (continuing)
                         The witness is excused.

               The M.P.'s start leading JESSEP out, and KAFFEE notices 
               DAWSON. And DOWNEY. And ROSS. who are watching a man in a 
               marine colonels uniform be led away in handcuffs... KAFFEE 
               takes a handkerchief from his pocket and wipes some sweat 
               from his hands. He takes a deep breath as we

                                                          SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. THE COURTROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

               There's low murmur in the room as the JURORS are being led 
               back into their box.

               Everyone's in place.

               RANDOLPH enters.

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                         Ten-hut.

               All rise. And sit when RANDOLPH sits.

                                     RANDOLPH
                         Have the jurors reached a verdict?

                                     JURY FOREMAN
                         We have, sir.

               The SERGEANT AT ARMS takes all the slips of paper from the 
               FOREMAN and brings them to RANDOLPH.

               KAFFEE stands, and nods to DAWSON and DOWNEY that they should 
               do the same. SAM and JO stand as well.

                                     RANDOLPH
                              (reading)
                         On the charge of Murder, the Members 
                         find the defendants Not Guilty.

               It's hard to resist the temptation to scream and shout, but 
               they do.

                                     RANDOLPH
                              (continuing; reading)
                         On the charge of Conspiracy to Commit 
                         Murder, the Members find the 
                         defendants Not Guilty.

               RANDOLPH looks up. Then reads from the last slip of paper.

                                     RANDOLPH
                              (continuing)
                         On the charge of Conduct Unbecoming 
                         a United States Marine, the members 
                         find the defendants Guilty as Charged.

               A little of the energy drains out of the room. RANDOLPH 
               continues reading.

                                     RANDOLPH
                              (continuing; reading)
                         The defendants are hereby sentenced 
                         by this court to time already served, 
                         and are ordered...

               RANDOLPH clears his throat.

                                     RANDOLPH
                              (continuing)
                         ...And are ordered to be dishonorably 
                         discharged from the marine corps.
                              (pause)
                         This Court-Martial is adjourned.

               RANDOLPH raps his gavel.

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                         Ten hut.

               All rise.

               RANDOLPH's gone.

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                              (continuing)
                         Dismissed.

               The M.P.'s move to DAWSON and DOWNEY to unlock their 
               handcuffs. KAFFEE is packing up his things, just another day 
               at the office.

                                     DAWSON
                         Why?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Harold, I'm sorry.

                                     DAWSON
                         Why?!

                                     DOWNEY
                         I don't understand. Colonel Jessep 
                         said he ordered the Code Red.

                                     JO
                         I know, but --

                                     DOWNEY
                         Colonel Jessep said he ordered the 
                         Code Red, what did we do wrong?

                                     JO
                         It's not as simple as --

                                     DOWNEY
                         What did we do wrong?

                                     DAWSON
                         We did nothing wrong.

               SAM slaps his hands down on the table --

                                     SAM
                         Yes you did! A jury just said your 
                         conduct was unbecoming a marine. 
                         What does that mean?!

                                     DAWSON
                         You're the lawyer.

                                     SAM
                         You're the marine.

                                     DAWSON
                         Not anymore.

               SAM lets it hang. DAWSON is staring at SAM. His stare moves 
               slowly to the floor.

                                     DAWSON
                              (continuing)
                         I never meant to hurt Willy.

               DAWSON looks up at HIS PARENTS. The moment hangs there... 
               before

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                         Kaffee, I've gotta take these guys 
                         over to personnel for some paper 
                         work.

               KAFFEE nods.

                                     SERGEANT AT ARMS
                              (continuing; to Dawson 
                              & Downey)
                         Gentleman?

               DAWSON looks to KAFFEE. There's gotta be more. This can't be 
               it.

               But KAFFEE has nothing to say.

               DAWSON and DOWNEY walk to the SERGEANT AT ARMS and begin to 
               follow him up the aisle and out of the courtroom. But before 
               they get to the door, KAFFEE turns around and calls

                                     KAFFEE
                         Harold!

               They stop and turn around.

                                     DAWSON
                         Sir!

                                     KAFFEE
                              (pause)
                         You don't need to wear a patch on 
                         your arm to have honor.

               DAWSON stares at KAFFEE for a long moment.

                                     DAWSON
                         Ten-hut.

               DAWSON and DOWNEY come to attention.

                                     DAWSON
                              (continuing)
                         There's an officer on deck.

               DAWSON snaps a salute and holds it.

               KAFFEE stares back. Then stands up straight and returns their 
               salute.

               With one last glance back at KAFFEE, DAWSON turns and walks 
               out the door, followed by DOWNEY.

               ROSS walks over to the defense table.

                                     ROSS
                         Airmen Cecil O'Malley and Anthony 
                         Perez? What exactly were these guys 
                         gonna testify to?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Unless I'm mistaken they were gonna 
                         testify, under oath, that they have 
                         absolutely no recollection of 
                         anything.

               ROSS smiles.

                                     ROSS
                         Strong witnesses.

                                     KAFFEE
                         And very handsome, too, don't you 
                         think?

                                     ROSS
                         I'll see you around the campus.  
                         I've gotta go arrest Kendrick.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Tell him I say "Hi".

                                     ROSS
                         Will do.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE - DUSK

               KAFFEE, JO and SAM are walking down the steps. The BAND is 
               practicing on the parade grounds.

                                     JO
                         What do you say we take the rest of 
                         the day off. Go out someplace. Sam? 
                         Champagne? Yoo-Hoo?

                                     SAM
                         Thanks, I can't. I'm gonna go home 
                         and talk to my daughter. I think 
                         she's gotta be bilingual by now.

               And SAM heads off toward his car.

                                     JO
                         So what's next for you?

                                     KAFFEE
                         Staff Sargeant Henry Williamson. He 
                         went to the movies on company time. 
                         What about you?

                                     JO
                         Me? Oh... you know... the usual.

                                     KAFFEE
                         Just pretty much generally annoying 
                         people?

                                     JO
                         Yeah.
                              (pause)
                         So what do you say? How 'bout a 
                         celebration?

                                     KAFFEE
                         No. How 'bout a date. A real date. 
                         Dinner. Attractive clothes. The works.

                                     JO
                         Sounds good.  Who do you think I 
                         should call?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'll pick you up at seven.

                                     JO
                         What are you gonna do now?

                                     KAFFEE
                         I'm gonna get started on Henry 
                         Williamson.
                              (beat)
                         Stand my post for a while.

               JO holds out her hand. KAFFEE shakes it. JO kisses him.

                                     JO
                         Wear matching socks.

               Jo splits off toward her building and KAFFEE keeps walking 
               toward the bleachers as we PULL BACK TO INCLUDE the almost 
               empty parade grounds and PULL BACK as to show the Washington 
               Navy Yard and PULL BACK and back and back and

                                                                  FADE OUT.

                                         THE END
