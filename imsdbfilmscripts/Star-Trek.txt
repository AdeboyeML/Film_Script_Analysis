15   OVER BLACKNESS, we HEAR a BACH HARPSICHORD CONCERTO. And then a 15
     WOMAN -- breathing hard -- straining, harder and harder -- until
     finally we HEAR a NEWBORN BABY CRYING -- and we...

     FADE IN:

     EXT. VULCAN FAMILY HOME - DUSK

     The image is spectacular, aglow in DUSK LIGHT: a beautiful BABY,
     just born, held in a WOMAN'S HANDS. It is being cleaned; warm
     water runs down its face and body.

     TIGHT ON the MIDWIFE (female, 60's) who holds and cleans the
     baby as it CRIES. Another, younger, Midwife can be seen behind
     her, assisting with the pitchers of water. As she cleans the
     baby, she says to someone OFF-CAMERA:

                                 MIDWIFE
                He is strong.

     The baby, now calm, gets SWADDLED.    He is then gently held out
     to the new MOTHER:

     AMANDA GRAYSON, late 20's. An original beauty. She lies on a
     divan, spent but eager to hold her first child. She tenderly
     takes the infant into her arms, tears in her eyes, mesmerized.
     She holds the wrapped baby tight and whispers sweetly:

                                 AMANDA
                ... hello.

     CLOSE ON the YOUNGER MIDWIFE, standing at the rear of the room.
     She raises an eyebrow as she quietly speaks:

                              YOUNGER MIDWIFE
                The baby is healthy. Why does she cry?

                              MIDWIFE
                        (a beat; then)
                She is human.

     A distant, quiet BUZZ -- and the elder Midwife stands, looking
     into the distance. And this is when we see, for the first time,
     that the Midwife has POINTED EARS.

                                 MIDWIFE (CONT'D)
                Sarek arrives.

     The Midwife moves away -- we PUSH IN on Amanda, who looks up for
     a moment, clearly disquieted.




15A   OMIT                                                              15A

15B   EXT. VULCAN LANDSCAPE - DUSK [FORMER SC. 14]                      15B

      A planet of massive, tortured ROCK FORMS, distant cities
      constructed atop and underneath them. A HOVER-SPEEDER in the
      mid-ground kicks up dust, backlit by the sun, as it traces the
      horizon. We PAN WITH IT, revealing a FAMILY HOME, built
      seamlessly into a rocky mountainside.

      A SUPER READS: STARDATE 2230.06.

      The speeder parks outside the home --

15C   EXT. VULCAN HOME - DUSK                                           15C

      SAREK (late 40's, a Vulcan) comes out to the balcony through the
      rear doors of the home. He moves to Amanda and kneels. He
      looks at the child -- his child -- and says:

                                  SAREK
                 Well done.

      She looks at him for a beat, then says, flatly -- with just
      enough rancor:

                                  AMANDA
                 Thanks.

      He regards her.   Knows he's in TROUBLE --

                               SAREK
                 Your tone suggests disappointment. The
                 Science Council required my presence for
                 a session regarding--

                                  AMANDA
                 Don't do that.     You knew I wanted you
                 here.

      The Vulcan Midwives share a look. Sarek glances at them. Nods.
      The two women excuse themselves. Sarek reaches over, touches a
      small touchpad -- the HARPSICHORD MUSIC STOPS. He says,
      clinically:

                               SAREK
                 As you are aware, the Vulcan male is
                 traditionally not present at the moment
                 of delivery.

                                AMANDA
                 Well traditionally, I'm not the one
                 giving birth.
                         (then)
                                (MORE)

                                               3
15C   CONTINUED:                                                        15C
                                 AMANDA (CONT'D)
                   I moved here -- to another planet -- to
                   be with you. I needed you to be with me
                   today. Holding my hand and telling me
                   I'm doing great, even when I'm just...
                   breathing the best I can.

      Sad that she has to tell him this at all, she just looks back at
      the baby -- finding comfort in his innocence. Sarek considers
      this. He moves closer to her. Whispers intimately:

                                 SAREK
                   You are correct. I should have been
                   here. I am sorry.

      And with her free hand, she pulls Sarek closer -- and kisses
      him. And the two look at the baby.

                                 SAREK (CONT'D)
                   I had a thought. That we might name the
                   child after one of our respected early
                   society-builders. His name was "Spock".

      She looks at the baby, not immediately taken by the name.

                                 SAREK (CONT'D)
                   Your silence does not suggest enormous
                   enthusiasm.

                                  AMANDA
                   No... Spock.
                           (smiles, touches his
                            face)
                   ... Spock.

      She looks at Sarek: Spock it is.

                                 SAREK
                   The child has your eyes.

      She pulls back the baby's swaddling, revealing his ears.    She
      gently rubs the top of his right ear -- AND IT UNFURLS,
      revealing a small, soft pointed VULCAN EAR.

                                 AMANDA
                   ... and your ears.

      And off the image of this TINY BABY, half-human, half-Vulcan,
      we... FADE OUT. And over BLACKNESS, we BEGIN TO HEAR an ALARM
      SOUNDING -- GROWING -- and the SUPER "THREE YEARS LATER" APPEARS
      -- and finally the BLACKNESS IS SPLIT BY TURBO-LIFT DOORS
      OPENING and we REVEAL THAT WE'RE ON:

                                                4


15D   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN [FORMER SC. 15A]                               15D

      With URGENCY, we MOVE DOWN a corridor with CAPTAIN ROBAU and
      OFFICER PITTS:


               CAPTAIN ROBAU                      OFFICER PITTS
      -- our sensors haven't made        -- no sir, it looked like a
      sense of the anomaly?              lightning storm in the middle
      -- how far are we from the         of space --
      Klingon Neutral Zone?              -- 150,000 kilometers, but the
                                         vessel is not Klingon, Sir,
                                         its registry doesn't match any
                                         recorded profile --

      SHWISH! The doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP -- a
      flurry of activity -- the MASSIVE SHIP they are approaching on
      the VIEWSCREEN. Robau moves to the center -- then he asks:

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 Report.

      -- turning to the ship's FIRST OFFICER: 32, all-American face,
      swiveling in a console chair to FACE US:

                               FIRST OFFICER
                 Sir, new contact bearing zero-three-four.

               CAPTAIN ROBAU                      FIRST OFFICER
      Are they transmitting on any       Negative, Captain -- all
      frequency?                         communications appear to be
                                         shut down.

               CAPTAIN ROBAU                      FIRST OFFICER
      Hail the ship. What's the          Nothing even close, Sir.
      closest match on registry?

      Robau moves to Pitts:

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 Any response?

                               OFFICER PITTS
                 No Sir -- hails met with silence.

                               CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 Maybe they're incapable -- any
                 identifiable damage?

                               OFFICER PITTS
                 Negative, Sir -- but our readings seem
                 confused--

                                              5
15D   CONTINUED:                                                        15D

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                   Confused?

                                 OFFICER PITTS
                   -- not only is the ship unregistered --
                   but even its construction materials seem
                   unrecognizable.

      Robau sits in the captain's chair his eyes on the ship as they
      approach -- and we SEE IT on the VIEWSCREEN -- THE NARADA --
      ENORMOUS AND THREATENING. He doesn't even realize that he says:

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                   ... oh my God...
                           (to himself, boggled)
                   A lightning storm... then this...
                           (to deck)
                   Signal all departments: first contact
                   protocols. Looks like we have someone
                   new on the block. All Stop.

      And in the endless vacuum of space, and in TOTAL SILENCE, the
      Kelvin appears as a dot, coming to a stop in front of the
      gigantic BLACK CLAW that is the Narada --

19D   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE                                       19D

      Crew members are glued to their telemetry, working consoles:

                                 FIRST OFFICER
                   Sir, should we initiate an invasive scan?

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                   That could be seen as an act of
                   provocation -- all readings passive--

      Suddenly, a WARNING BEEP --


               OFFICER PITTS                     CAPTAIN ROBAU
      Sir, I have a reading --
      they've locked weapons on us!     -- Red alert!   Arm weapons!

      SEPARATES, fracturing into a multi-hit projectile --

      Captain Robau helps a fallen CREW MEMBER up from the floor --
      then, on his chair com.:

                                  CAPTAIN ROBAU

      Moving with the Kelvin's CHIEF ENGINEER:

                 Our shields did nothing, Sir! Never seen
                 anything like it! Weapons off-line!
                 Main power at 38 percent!

      As the crew regains their footing, the First Officer pulls
      himself to his console, true fear in his eyes as he places an
      inter-ship call -- it's RINGING -- his fear grows with every
      passing RING -- then, we INTERCUT WITH:

24B   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - MEDICAL BAY - CONTINUOUS [FORMER SC. 26B]   24B

      A WOMAN, 25, answers her communicator -- she lies on an exam
      table, afraid -- and pregnant. This is WINONA.

                   -- what was that-- what's happening?!

      But the First Officer is just relieved that she's still alive:

                                 FIRST OFFICER
                   -- you're okay-- thank God-- where are

                   Medical bay-- I had a few close
                   contractions-- I'm fine-- what was that?

                                 FIRST OFFICER
                   Just sit tight-- stay there-- we'll be
                   fine--

      Or maybe not:

                                 OFFICER PITTS
                   They're firing another, Captain!

25    EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS                                           25

      ANOTHER NARADA TORPEDO -- it SEPARATES, pieces HIT the Kelvin.

                                           unknown aggressor!

               FIRST OFFICER                      TACTICAL OFFICER
      -- shields at eleven percent         -- were our shields even up?
      and dropping! Ten percent --         That was like nothing I've
      we're at nine! Eight percent!        ever seen -- this ship can not
      Seven! We're dropping here!          take another hit like that!
      Six!

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                   All remaining power to forward shields!
                   Prepare the shuttles f--

      And he STOPS. They all do. A fucking FACE is now on their
      VIEWSCREEN. A ROMULAN FACE -- the FIRST OFFICER of the Narada,
      whom we'll come to know as AYEL:

                                 AYEL
                   My commander requests the presence of
                   your captain in order to negotiate a
                   cease-fire. You will come aboard our
                   ship via shuttlecraft. Your refusal
                   would be unwise.

      Screen goes DEAD. All eyes on Robau... and he feels them.      A
      tense, horrible moment. Finally, to the First Officer:

                                   CAPTAIN ROBAU
                   Walk with me.

      The First Officer follows Robau OFF THE BRIDGE AND INTO:

26A   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - CORRIDORS - CONTINUOUS                        26A

      As they walk, briskly:

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                   If I don't report within fifteen minutes,
                   execute general order 13.

                                 FIRST OFFICER
                   Sir, we could issue a mayday call to--

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                           (frightened, but firm)
                   There is no help for us out here. If
                   we're going down, we're taking them with
                   us -- you save as many as you can.

                                             8A
26A   CONTINUED:                                                       26A

                                 FIRST OFFICER
                   ... aye, Captain.

      Robau heads into a waiting TURBOLIFT, turns -- they lock eyes,
      knowing what this means. Finally:

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                   You're Captain now. Mr. Kirk.

      He's gone.   And we realize this is GEORGE KIRK, Jim's father.

26B-C OMIT                                                         26B-C

26D   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                        26D

      All eyes on Kirk as he enters -- moves to the captain's chair.
      Sits. Not a small moment. Speaking his first words as Captain:

                               GEORGE KIRK
                 Lieutenant Pitts. Transfer Robau's vital
                 signs to the main view screen.

                                OFFICER PITTS
                 Yessir.

      In a moment, Robau's VITAL SIGNS appear on various monitors --
      his HEART RATE, OXYGEN LEVELS, BLOOD PRESSURE, all of it. A LOW-
      PITCHED BEEPBEEP of his HEARTBEAT is now HEARD --

                               SCIENCE OFFICER
                 Vitals on line.

                               GEORGE KIRK
                         (slightly awkward)
                 -- thank you.

26DA INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                    26DA

      TILT DOWN as the TURBO-LIFT DESCENDS -- we PUSH IN as the doors
      open and Captain Robau gets out -- moves quickly -- hurries down
      a SHUTTLE BAY catwalk --

26DB INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS [FORMER SC. 26C]                       26DB

      Robau enters a shuttle -- LIGHTS BLINK to life.   He moves to the
      cockpit -- starts the vehicle up --

                               CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 Computer, initiate departure sequence.

      A LOUD HISS and the craft SHUDDERS as it disembarks --

26DC INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                         26DC

      Sparks dripping from the ceiling, everyone is motionless -- eyes
      on the monitors -- and we're TIGHT ON GEORGE KIRK -- the BEEPS
      of Robau's heart might as well be representing his own. He
      realizes he's sweating -- wipes his forehead as:

                               OFFICER PITTS
                 The shuttle's pulling out of main bay,
                 Sir.

                               GEORGE KIRK
                 I want to see him -- floodlights please.

26E   EXT. U.S.S. KELVIN - SPACE                                     26E

      Two MASSIVE FLOODLIGHTS on the Kelvin's dish GO HOT -- and turn,
      FLARING out the lens -- landing on the SHUTTLE as it leaves the
      KELVIN, heading toward the imposing Narada.

26EA INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                                       26EA

      Backlit by the distant floodlights, Robau remains steely-eyed as
      he moves for the darkened ship -- nerves --

26F   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE                                    26F

      And Robau's HEARTBEAT QUICKENS -- the tension they all feel:

                               OFFICER PITTS
                 His heart rate's elevated--

                                   HELMSMAN
                 He's scared.

                                 GEORGE KIRK
                 He's brave.    That's what he is.

26FA INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                                       26FA

      Robau watches as he gets closer, the BEEPBEEPING HEARD over the
      SOUNDS of the shuttle -- but then --

26FB EXT. NARADA - SPACE - CONTINUOUS                                26FB

      ALL WE HEAR IS THE LOW-PITCHED BEEPBEEP as the small shuttle
      seems to get swallowed up by the massive forward-facing spires
      of the Narada -- the distant floodlights creating EERIE SHADOWS
      everywhere. A gigantic IRIS DOOR TURNS, SLOWLY OPENS -- and the
      shuttle enters the Narada's main HANGAR -- the door CLOSES --

26FC INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                        26FC

      And everyone is just motionless and silent. Only Robau's VITAL
      SIGNS can be HEARD, BEEPING away. George's eyes glued ahead --

26G   INT. SHUTTLE/NARADA HANGAR - CONTINUOUS                        26G

      TIGHT ON ROBAU as he faces the shuttle door, considering his
      fate. Finally the SHUTTLE DOOR OPENS -- standing there are
      eight ROMULAN GUARDS, brandishing WEAPONS. He steps down. They
      grab him, hard -- he's SCANNED -- FRISKED -- PULLED ALONG -- and
      we REVEAL the absolutely MASSIVE HANGAR, the insane architecture
      of the interior of this dark, wet, dripping ship --

                                               11


26H   INT. NARADA BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                                     26H

      Robau is led into the enormous, dark bridge. A dozen Romulans
      at controls. Robau does his level best to portray confidence as
      he is led up a walkway to AYEL. Behind him, sitting silhouetted
      and motionless, turned away and looking off, is his captain. A
      presence always felt in this scene. This is NERO.

      Ayel touches a panel, then THROWS AN IMAGE into the air before
      Robau. A ROTATING HOLOGRAM OF A UNIQUE-LOOKING SPACECRAFT (we
      will refer to it as the JELLYFISH).

                               AYEL
                 Are you familiar with this craft?

      Robau regards it.   Then:

                               CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 Who is your commander?
                         (silence, then re: Nero)
                 Is it him?

                               AYEL
                 You will speak only to me.

                               CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 Then ask your commander what right he has
                 to attack a Federation vessel.

                               AYEL
                 That was hardly an attack. My commander
                 will easily destroy your ship. If you do
                 not respond to the question.

      Robau considers the hologram again.     And what his answer might
      mean for the fate of his crew.

                               CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 I've never seen it. Or any ship like it.

                               AYEL
                 Are you familiar with -- or better, know
                 the location of -- Ambassador Spock?

      Ayel has thrown another HOLOGRAM -- A FLOATING, ROTATING IMAGE
      OF SPOCK, who appears to be 75 earth-years old. The baby, born
      just three years earlier. Robau is as confused as we are...

                               CAPTAIN ROBAU
                 I am unfamiliar with Ambassador Spock.

                               AYEL
                 A final question. What is the current
                 stardate?

                                                12
26H   CONTINUED:                                                         26H

                                 CAPTAIN ROBAU
                           (the fuck?)
                   ... Stardate? ... it's 2233.04.
                           (finally)
                   ... hey, where are you from--?

      Suddenly: TSCHING! Nero's activated his STAFF -- FOUR LARGE,
      HORRIFYING BLADES APPEAR AT THE TIP AND NERO SPRINGS TO LIFE,
      CHARGING ROBAU WITH A ROAR AND ROBAU'S EYES POP HOLY SHIT AND--

26HA INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE                                         26HA

      BLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE... Robau's vitals go dead.      PUSH IN ON
      KIRK as a SCREAMING ALARM IS HEARD --

      TIGHT ON GEORGE as this lands.      More honorable than terrified:

                   -- then I'll do it myself -- get to the

                           (no one moves until:)
                   THAT'S AN ORDER! GO!

      Agony in the faces as they reluctantly hurry off -- Kirk takes
      the Captain's chair, hits the COMLINK:

                   I have medical shuttle 37 standing by,

                   Yes -- where are you?

      HOLD ON GEORGE for a moment as he hesitates -- his eyes glued to

                                 WINONA
                   Good-- and George, it's coming-- our
                   baby, it's coming now.

      PUSH IN on him, his heart shattering -- having to out-maneuver
      incoming torpedoes, piloting the ship to its doom -- still, he
      forces optimism:

                   I'll see you in a minute, sweetheart.

      He disconnects -- another ALARM -- he TURNS the ship, FIRES --

                   -- Agh!   That was-- that was a big one!

      Another screen that shows stats of DEPARTING SHUTTLES -- more
      leaving as we glance at the screen -- but SHUTTLE 34 REMAINS
      DOCKED --

      The NARADA is GROWING in the viewscreen -- he hits the comlink:

      Winona PUSHING -- giving birth to their baby -- and we're BACK
      AND FORTH between a husband and wife that will never see each
      other again, MUSIC SWELLING as the Kelvin TURNS HARD, avoiding
      TORPEDOES -- the shuttle BANKING as the Doctor and Nurse help
      Winona -- and we're ON GEORGE as he HEARS A BABY CRYING -- and
      TEARS COME TO HIS EYES -- as he says--

                                GEORGE KIRK
                 Hey!   Hey, so what is it?

                                  WINONA'S VOICE
                 -- it's a boy.

                                GEORGE KIRK
                 It's a boy?   Yeah?

      And now we see Winona, handed this beautiful little boy.   And
      she cries, just looking at him --

                               GEORGE KIRK (CONT'D)
                 Tell me... tell me about him-- please--

                 He's-- he's beautiful, he looks like you.

      Heartsick, George laughs -- glances at the MONITORS -- SELF-
      DESTRUCT COUNTDOWN IS AT T-MINUS 20 SECONDS -- oh God...

                               WINONA (CONT'D)
                 George, you should be here --

                               GEORGE KIRK
                 I know-- so what should we call him, huh?

                               WINONA
                 We could name him after your father.

                               GEORGE KIRK
                 Tiberius? Are you kidding me? No,
                 that's the worst-- we'll name him after
                 your dad-- let's call him Jim.

                                WINONA
                 ... Jim.   Jim it is.

      Through the VIEWSCREEN -- he's ABOUT TO HIT -- the ship ANGLES
      within the enormous Narada blades -- George scared now --

      George's voice goes STATIC -- confusion washes over her face --
      suddenly LIT BY A BRIGHT GLOW -- she looks over, with wet
      devastated eyes --

      -- what she sees is the MASSIVE EXPLOSION -- quickly SUCKED AWAY
      in the vacuum of space -- and she's CRYING -- holding her new
      baby who just lost a father -- his life altered forever...

      ROMULAN DIALOG TO BE WRITTEN) -- we arrive at Nero, who, with
      small specks of HUMAN BLOOD on his face, just STARES at the
      fucking HOLOGRAM OF SPOCK -- he's OBSESSED.

      Ayel works a monitor, yelling out something (in Romulan) to one
      of their men -- and as a result:

      Gargantuan "BLADES" EXTEND from the ship like otherworldly SAILS
      -- and the ship begins to STEADY -- but then ANOTHER SHIP
      APPEARS -- DECLOAKING FROM NOTHINGNESS: a fucking KLINGON VESSEL
      -- then ANOTHER -- AND ANOTHER --

43    INT. NARADA - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                                   43

      And we're on Ayel as he witnesses, on his monitor, ships,
      popping up ALL AROUND THEM -- which is when they HEAR a VOICE --
      speaking KLINGON -- and we SUBTITLE:

                                              19

                                KLINGON VOICE (P.A.)
                  Trespassing vessel: you have entered the
                  jurisdiction of the Klingon Empire.
                  Power down and prepare to be boarded or
                  you will be destroyed.

     Eyes wide, Ayel turns to Nero, still staring at Spock's image:

     And we PUSH IN ON NERO as our MUSIC BUILDS, then we CUT TO:

     CLOSE ON a young VULCAN BOY. 11 years old. SPOCK. He's
     standing in an abstract space -- IMAGES PROJECTED and HOVERING --
     questions -- that he's answering as they appear, then disappear:

             COMPUTER VOICE                           SPOCK
     What is the square root of
     2,396,304?                          -- one-thousand-five-hundered-
                                         forty-eight --
     -- Correct. What is the
     central assumption of Quantum       -- everything that can happen
     Cosmology?                          does happen, in equal and
                                         parallel universes --
     -- Correct. Identify the 20th
     century earth composers of the
     following musical progression:      -- Paul McCartney and John
                                         Lennon.
     -- Correct

     And we find ANOTHER VULCAN CHILD -- then ANOTHER -- all in these
     odd spaces -- until we PULL BACK WIDE to reveal a large Vulcan
     LEARNING CENTER -- white "bowls", sunk into the dark ground,
     where PROFESSORS walk, hands behind their backs, surveying this
     mass "mental martial arts" test.

     We're on ANOTHER VULCAN CHILD as she gets an answer wrong -- AND
     THE LIGHT OVER HER BOWL GOES OUT. Then ANOTHER CHILD -- who
     gets an answer wrong -- and HIS LIGHT GOES OUT. An EXTREMELY
     WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT reveals BOWL AFTER BOWL as the LIGHTS GO OUT.

                                               20
45   CONTINUED:                                                         45

     Until only one bowl remains. Spock's. He finishes his last
     question. Gets it right. PUSH IN ON HIM as the COMPUTER SAYS:

                                COMPUTER VOICE
                  Your score is one-hundred percent.
                  Congratulations. Spock.

     Off his face, we CUT TO MOMENTS LATER, as Spock collects his
     things. As he does, three young VULCAN BULLIES walk up behind
     him. Spock glances at them, then back to his things.

                                YOUNG SPOCK
                  I presume you've prepared new insults for
                  today.

                                VULCAN BULLY #1
                  Your mother lies with many men.

     Spock just NODS.   Tries to ignore the fact that IT STINGS.

                                YOUNG SPOCK
                  I have no such information.

                                VULCAN BULLY #2
                  You are neither human, nor Vulcan -- and
                  therefore, have no place in the universe.

                                YOUNG SPOCK
                          (swallowing that too)
                  This is your thirty-fifth attempt to
                  elicit an emotional response from me.
                  Logic dictates you would cease by now.

                               VULCAN BULLY #1
                  Look. He has human eyes. They look sad,
                  don't they?

                                VULCAN BULLY #2
                  Perhaps an emotional response requires
                  physical stimuli.

     And Bully #2 PUSHES Spock -- who stumbles back, almost falling
     into one of the bowls. He looks up as:

                                VULCAN BULLY #2 (CONT'D)
                  He's a traitor, you know. Your father.
                  For marrying her.

     Spock stares -- we see him fighting the urge, but he's unable --
     AND HE CHARGES THE BULLY AND TACKLES HIM INTO THE BOWL! They
     land inside -- Spock cries, flailing as he punches Bully #2!
     The other two stand atop the bowl, stunned -- shocked -- unsure
     what the hell to do -- and we CUT TO:

                                              21


46   INT. LEARNING CENTER - CORRIDOR - LATER                             46

     TIGHT ON Spock, chastened, sitting glumly on a bench. A massive
     VULCAN CITY seen through the window behind him. His parents
     ARGUE at a distance down the hall:

                 AMANDA                                SAREK
     -- where I'm from, when
     someone hits you, you hit back-
     - how is that not logical?         -- Spock had no reasonable
     -- They pick on him -- they        expectation of being
     tease him -- every day.            physically injured --
                                        -- Which is precisely when
                                        reason must guide his actions
     -- I want him to embrace           above all.
     Vulcan, you know that... but
     he has to be himself-- which
     means, occasionally, being         -- His "humanity" is very the
     human.                             source of his ostracism.
     -- When Vulcans get disgusted
     with each other, they never
     just walk away, do they?           -- No.
     -- Well humans do.

     And Amanda walks away, leaving Sarek standing there. He turns --
     sees his son down the corridor. Approaches. And we're PUSHING
     IN on Spock, studying the fear in his eyes. His father stops in
     front of him, looming there, looking down stoically:

                              YOUNG SPOCK
                I did not mean to create conflict between
                you and mother.

     After a beat, Sarek seems to soften a little.     No anger in his
     face. Takes a seat beside his son...

                              SAREK
                In marriage... conflict is...

                                YOUNG SPOCK
                ... constant?

                              SAREK
                Natural.
                        (a beat)
                Emotions run deep within our race. In
                many ways, more deeply than in humans.
                Long ago, they nearly destroyed us...
                that is why we followed the teachings of
                Surak. Now you must choose.

                              YOUNG SPOCK
                ... between you and mother?

                                SAREK
                  Never, my son. But you may choose the
                  ethic of logic. Logic offers a serenity
                  humans seldom experience. The control of
                  feelings... so that they do not control
                  you.

                                 YOUNG SPOCK
                  They called you a traitor.
                          (then)
                  You suggest that I should be completely
                  Vulcan... and yet you married a human...
                  why?

     Sarek is clearly conflicted by this.      But he holds steady:

                                SAREK
                  As Ambassador to Earth, my duty is to
                  observe and understand human behavior.
                  Marrying your mother... was logical.
                          (Spock seems disquieted)
                  Spock. You are fully capable of choosing
                  your own destiny. The question you are
                  faced with... is which path you will
                  take. This is something only you can
                  decide.

47   EXT. IOWA FARMHOUSE - DAY                                             47

     BAM -- a door opens: 14 year-old GEORGE KIRK, JR. angrily exits
     the house, carrying a duffel. His angrier, redneckier UNCLE
     FRANK following. 11 year-old JIM KIRK nervously pursues them:

                                UNCLE FRANK
                  Go ahead: go-- run away! You know I
                  could give a damn!

                                  YOUNG KIRK
                  -- wait-- no!    Where are you going?

                                GEORGE JR.
                  Anywhere but here, far as I can get!

                                UNCLE FRANK
                  Which won't be far enough -- know what
                  your problem is?!
                          (big luggie spit)
                  No one ever taught you respect! How to
                  follow orders! Do as you're told!
                          (to Jim)
                  -- what the hell are you doing?

                                YOUNG KIRK
                  I-- I just don't want my brother to go.

                                            23
47    CONTINUED:                                                      47

                                 UNCLE FRANK
                   Well I do-- and I asked you to wash the
                   car! How many damn times do I need to
                   repeat myself?! How many damn times?
                   How many?

      A glare to George and Frank walks off. Jim nervously follows
      his brother, pulling out a small, FLOATING DISC --

                                 YOUNG KIRK
                   Please stay-- you can have my Flo-Yo!

      George hits it away:

                                  GEORGE JR.
                   This isn't about toys, it's Uncle Frank.
                   I can't take him anymore -- Mom has no
                   idea what he's like when she's not here--
                   d'you hear him talking like he's our
                   dad?! And that's not even his car you're
                   washing! That was Dad's car! You know
                   why you're washing it? Because he's
                   gonna sell it!

                                 JIM
                   Don't leave -- okay? We can tell Mom
                   when she gets back from Africa.

                                  GEORGE JR.
                   She's gone for five more months, by then
                   I'll be in a different system.
                           (sees fear in Kirk)
                   You're gonna be okay. You always are.
                   Always doing everything right -- good
                   grades and obeying every stupid order...
                           (then)
                   I can't be a Kirk in this house. Show me
                   how to do that and I'll stay.

      But Jim can offer nothing. George gives him a quick hug and
      walks off. Jim sadly watches his brother go.

47A   EXT. IOWA FARMHOUSE - DAY                                       47A

      Kirk washes a VINTAGE CORVETTE. Red, white top. Dumping the
      sponge in bucket, he's sadly cleaning, his mind spinning over
      his brother's departure. Devastated.

      And he's wiping the soapy passenger window (SQEEEEEEAK!) with
      the sponge, when he STOPS -- seeing the KEYS in the ignition.
      PUSH IN ON HIS FACE as a devilish idea comes to his mind. PRE-
      LAP A LOUD SCREECH and we CUT TO:

48-49 OMIT                                                          48-49

50    EXT. IOWA FARMHOUSE - DAY - LATER                                 50

      THE CORVETTE BLASTS ONTO SCREEN, FISHTAILING ONTO THE ROAD,
      young Jim Kirk behind the wheel (NOTE: The SOUND of the engine
      is a metallic WHIR -- not a gas engine). TIGHT ON JIM'S FACE as
      he drives -- having never done this before, he's as nervous as
      he is determined --

50A   EXT. IOWA ROAD - DAY - LATER                                     50A

      The CORVETTE SPEEDS -- while inside the car, Jim turns on the
      updated, modified RADIO -- scans stations, momentarily losing
      control of the car -- but he's back on track as he finds a HARD
      ROCK SONG -- and HE'S STARTING TO FUCKING LOVE IT -- PILOTING
      SOMETHING THIS FAST FEELS GOOD.

      He reaches for a CONVERTIBLE ROOF latch -- then the other -- but
      with the speed he's driving, THE ROOF RIPS RIGHT OFF THE FUCKING
      CAR -- Jim glances back, wide-eyed -- and the roof TUMBLES
      through the air, landing on the road -- and we PUSH AND ARC
      AROUND, as a POLICE OFFICER runs out from taking a roadside PISS
      -- he races back, jumps on his HOVERCRUISER and TAKES OFF --
      SPEEDING AFTER HIM, SIREN BLARING!

      BACK IN THE CORVETTE -- BLOOPBLOOP!!! -- Jim's eyes dart to the
      REARVIEW as the cruiser WEAVES behind him -- then PULLS UP
      BESIDE HIM -- the COP sees a CHILD driving and is AMAZED -- he
      calls through his PA:

                               COP
                 Son, you pull over that car!

      But Jim just BLASTS the RADIO LOUDER:

                               JIM
                 I CAN'T HEAR YOU!

51    EXT. IOWA ROAD - CONTINUOUS                                       51

      George, bag over shoulder, thumb out. He turns at the SOUND of
      the SIREN -- sees what's approaching... that car... looks...
      familiar... and the THE CORVETTE SHOOTS PAST HIM, JIM AT THE
      WHEEL -- then the POLICE HOVERCRUISER! George runs into the
      middle of the road, mouth agape --

                                 GEORGE JR.
                 -- no... way.

      Back at the Corvette, Jim YANKS the steering wheel TOWARD THE
      COP -- who RISES to avoid the Corvette, which SCREECHES onto a
      perpendicular DIRT ROAD, kicking up wild dust as the Cop ARCS
      QUICKLY to follow --

                                           25
51   CONTINUED:                                                       51

     Jim is now officially LOVING THIS -- and he DRIVES THROUGH a
     FENCE -- CRASH! The Cop RACES through it, in the Corvette's
     DUST -- and we PUSH IN on a SIGN that reads "DANGER - QUARRY
     AHEAD -- IOWA MINING CO." In fact --

52   EXT. QUARRY - CONTINUOUS                                          52

     We see the MASSIVE QUARRY -- hundreds of feet deep -- and TILT
     UP to the Corvette and Cop speeding toward it --

53   INT. CORVETTE - MOVING - CONTINUOUS                               53

     KIRK, EYES INTENSE, ALMOST SUICIDAL -- this is where he's been
     headed all along -- and for a moment we think holy shit -- this
     is how James Kirk dies. He speeds toward the edge -- CLOSER --
     CLOSER -- but at the last second, Kirk SLAMS the brake -- the
     car SKIDS -- PIVOTS -- and he LEAPS FROM THE CAR, WHICH SAILS
     SIDEWAYS OFF THE CLIFF EDGE -- FALLING... falling... the COP
     comes to QUICK a STOP in CLOUDS of DUST as the Corvette EXPLODES
     ON THE QUARRY FLOOR --

     The angry Cop hops off his hovercruiser, hand on weapon, as Jim
     Kirk, out of breath, exhilarated, gets to his knees.

                                COP
                  What's your name, son?

     And as he stands, we PUSH IN on him -- LOW and WIDE -- damn if
     that kid doesn't have a swagger. It's like the first time he's
     ever stood in his life.

                                JIM
                  My name's Kirk. James Tiberius Kirk.

     And as our MUSIC BUILDS we CUT TO:

54   EXT. RURA PENTHE- MINING QUARRY - NIGHT [FORMER OMIT]             54

     CONSTANT SHOCKS OF LIGHT as an ALIEN PRISONER -- intelligent, bi-
     pedal, but with FOUR TERRIFIED EYES -- is SLAMMED DOWN onto the
     wet pavement -- a CHOKE STICK SHOVED under his chin -- then:
     VOICES. Brutal, guttural KLINGON --

                                KLINGON GUARD (O.S.)
                          (SUBTITLED)
                  You say they are not yours...

     WHIP PAN TO SEE the scary KLINGON GUARDS -- four of them --
     standing above the Alien -- chilling MASKS hide their hideous
     faces -- and one holds a FLUORESCENT SET OF PAGES --

                                KLINGON GUARD (CONT'D)
                  ... these Federation maps we found in
                  your pockets.

      And the ALIEN SPEAKS -- an UNKNOWN LANGUAGE -- all eyes wild:

                                 ALIEN
                           (SUBTITLED)
                   I speak the truth. I do.

                                 KLINGON GUARD
                   Then who are they for?

      But the Alien just SHAKES HIS HEAD, afraid -- he will not talk.
      So they GRAB HIM AND YANK HIM UPWARD --

                                 KLINGON GUARD (CONT'D)
                   You would rather die then tell us?

      PUSH IN TIGHT as the Alien finally WHISPERS, terrified:

                                 ALIEN
                   ... NERO!!!

      And the Guards look at each other... seemingly with concern...

      MOMENTS LATER EIGHT GUARDS WALK TOGETHER -- and we PAN WITH THEM
      to reveal the HORRIFYING EXPANSE THAT IS THE KLINGON PRISON
      YARD. We realize that the constant shocks of light was
      LIGHTNING, that apparently never stops here. A SUPER READS:
      "RURA PENTHE - KLINGON PRISON ASTEROID". And we see they're
      heading for a MUSCULAR FIGURE, using a SLEDGE HAMMER, SPLITTING
      ROCKS, lit brilliantly by the lightning strikes. BOOM UP to
      find that it's NERO. And he stops, SENSING the coming Guards.
      And he manages a small smile. And he QUICKLY TURNS to them --
      THEY ALL STOP, SUDDENLY. Afraid of him. One of them tosses
      Nero a set of MANACLES. Nero picks them up. Puts them on. And
      offers his cuffed hands, willingly.

54A   INT. RURA PENTHE - HOLDING BLOCK - NIGHT [FORMER SC. 64B]        54A

      Guards drag Nero through the massive pyramidal structure...

54B   INT. RURA PENTHE - INTERROGATION CELL - NIGHT [FORMER SC. 64C]   54B

      Nero's ARMS AND LEGS get STRAPPED IN TIGHT. Go WIDE to reveal
      he's pinned to an interrogation table -- three GUARDS. A
      KLINGON INTERROGATOR approaches; looms over Nero, studying the
      Romulan's face with clinical detachment...

                                  KLINGON INTERROGATOR
                           (SUBTITLED KLINGON)
                   I have come far to meet you. "The One

                   time to maintain silence.
                           (beat)
                   Perhaps you simply do not speak Klingon,
                   just as I do not speak Romulan.

                   But I assume we both speak the language
                   of our common enemy.

      (NOTE: FROM NOW ON, OUR NON-ENGLISH SPEAKERS WILL SPEAK ENGLISH,
      UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.) He reveals a worn LEATHER JOURNAL.
      Opens it, flips through it almost casually... we see SKETCHES of
      the JELLYFISH SHIP, PAGES OF COMPLICATED MATH EQUATIONS...

                                 KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
                   We found this book in your cell.
                   Cartography, mathematics-- what do these
                   mean? This date here -- eleven years
                   from now-- what happens then?
                           (holds up the
                            FLUORESCENT MAPS)
                   And why attempt to smuggle in maps of
                   Federation space?

      Nero's face betrays nothing; no fear, no doubt. Cold as fucking
      ice.   The Interrogator happens to stare at a page in the book:
      A DRAWING OF SPOCK. He closes the book.

                                 KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
                   When you were captured we assumed you
                   were a spy, sent from Romulus to surveil
                   the Empire. But because the Romulans
                   deny your existence, I believe you are
                   much more than that.

      Interrogator looks over to the Guards, nods. A Guard approaches
      with some kind of GLASS CONTAINER; we HEAR something wet FLIP-
      FLOPPING around inside, but we can't SEE what it is.

                                 KLINGON INTERROGATOR (CONT'D)
                   Your ship remains in orbit above us now.
                   We've been asking for its secrets for too
                   long. That is why I am here. We want to
                   know how it works and I believe now,
                   finally... you will tell us.

      A Guard uses TONGS to pull out the most DISGUSTING creature
      you've seen from the container: a SLUG with SUCKERS and spikes,
      covered in a grimy muck -- it FLIP FLOPS.

      Another Guard SHOVES THE THING INTO NERO'S MOUTH -- Nero keeps
      his eyes open -- furiously determined not to be broken -- as
      they FORCE HIM TO SWALLOW IT -- he DOESN'T SCREAM as the
      wretched thing makes its way down his esophagus and into his
      stomach --

                 They try to claw and bite their way out
                 of any dark space they're in.

      Nero stares at the ceiling in HORRIFYING INTERNAL PAIN -- but
      straining to block it out. PUSH DOWN on Nero's wide, crazed
      eyes -- TIGHTER as we SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO SEE WHAT HE'S SEEING --
      WHAT'S KEEPING HIM FROM LOSING HIS MIND -- DREAMLIKE, ETHEREAL
      IMAGES OF A WOMAN -- HER BEAUTIFUL, SMILING FACE -- SHE'S
      ROMULAN -- LOOKING AT US, EYES FULL OF LOVE -- AND SHE TURNS AND
      WE SEE SHE'S PREGNANT -- AND AS OUR MUSIC BUILDS, WE CUT TO:

57    INT. VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY - COUNCIL ANTE-CHAMBER - DAY           57

      Quiet. A waiting area. AMANDA, Spock's mother, stands alone in
      a passageway. She looks off-camera to her son:

                               AMANDA
                 Spock, come here, let me see you.

                                   SPOCK (O.S.)
                          (beat)
                 No.

                                   AMANDA
                 Spock.

      Reluctantly, Spock walks into frame. She begins adjusting his
      collar. This is our ADULT SPOCK. Gripped by anxiety but trying
      like hell to look impassive.

                               AMANDA (CONT'D)
                 There is no need to be so anxious.
                 You'll do fine.

                               SPOCK
                 I am hardly "anxious", mother.
                         (beat, then, anxiously)
                 And "fine" has variable definitions.
                 "Fine" is unacceptable.

      She just smiles as she works his collar. He sees this and    it
      annoys him. He tries to move her hands away, to stop with    his
      collar -- his annoyance, her love for him, all sweet-- but   he
      doesn't let go of her hands. A meaningful silence between    them.

                                                 29

                                SPOCK (CONT'D)
                  May I ask a personal query?

                                  AMANDA
                  ... anything.

                                SPOCK
                  Should I choose to complete the Vulcan
                  discipline of Kolinahr... and purge all
                  emotion... I trust you will not feel it
                  reflects judgement upon you.

     She stares at him, moved.      Touches his face.

                                AMANDA
                  As always... whoever you choose to be...
                  you will have a proud mother.

     HOLD on mother and son, worlds apart but forever bonded:

58   INT. VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY - COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY                  58

     An imposing yet BEAUTIFUL INDOOR ATRIUM. Spock stands before
     the VULCAN HIGH COUNCIL. Among faces on the dais: his FATHER,
     seated beside the SCIENCE MINISTER and other VULCAN LEADERS.

                                SCIENCE MINISTER
                  You have surpassed the expectations of
                  your instructors. Your final record is
                  flawless. With one exception. I see you
                  have applied to Starfleet as well.

                                SPOCK
                  It was logical to cultivate multiple
                  options.

                                SCIENCE MINISTER
                  Logical but unnecessary. You are hereby
                  accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy.
                  A distinction all the more significant
                  given that you will be its first half-
                  human pupil. It is truly remarkable,
                  Spock. That you have achieved so much
                  despite your disadvantage. Welcome to
                  the Academy.

     They all start to rise.      But Spock is suddenly unsettled:

                                SPOCK
                  If you would clarify, Minister-- what
                  "disadvantage" are you referring to?

                                SCIENCE MINISTER
                  ... your human mother.

                                               30
58   CONTINUED:                                                         58

     As the council disperses, we PUSH IN on Spock's face -- the same
     look he had when he took punches as a kid. He glances at his
     father to say something, but Sarek's the consummate diplomat.
     His eyes command: remain calm. Spock STRUGGLES... then makes
     the first spontaneous -- human -- decision of his life --

                                SPOCK
                  Council -- ministers.    I must decline.

     Everyone STOPS.   A solid BEAT.   Confused looks turn cold:

                                SCIENCE MINISTER
                  No Vulcan has ever declined admission to
                  this academy.

                                SPOCK
                  Then as I am half-human, your record
                  remains untarnished.

                  SAREK                               SPOCK
     Spock. You have made a
     commitment to honor the Vulcan       At the moment, Father, I can
     way--                                think of no greater way to
                                          honor our race than to attend
                                          Starfleet as its first Vulcan.

                                 SCIENCE MINISTER
                  Why did you come before this council
                  today? Was it to satisfy your emotional
                  need to rebel?

                                SPOCK
                  I came with the intention of enrolling,
                  as my father wished. However, your
                  "insight" has convinced me otherwise.
                  Therefore, the only emotion I wish to
                  convey is gratitude. Thank you,
                  Ministers, for your consideration.
                          (a contained "fuck you")
                  Live long and prosper.

     He looks to his father, whose disappointment is evident --
     still, God bless him, Spock walks out --

59   EXT. "THE WARP TRAIL" BAR - IOWA - NIGHT                              59

     -- PUSH DOWN A HALLWAY -- MUSIC HEARD -- what seems like a PARTY
     is going on through windows in the double-doors ahead -- and a
     WOMAN SWOOPS INTO VIEW in front of us -- we PUSH BEHIND HER in
     the short skirt and high boots as she ENTERS the place -- a
     local, busy BAR -- the woman makes her way to the BAR, and we
     see her GORGEOUS, DIGNIFIED FACE. THIS IS UHURA. She leans
     into the bartender warmly, her smile glorious:

59   CONTINUED:                                                    59

                                UHURA
                  Hi. I'd like a Klabnian Fire Tea, two
                  Cardassian Sunrises and three Earth
                  beers, no slim-shots, anything on draft.

                                VOICE (O.S.)
                  That's a lot of drinks for one woman.
                  Wearing those boots.

     JAMES KIRK'S FACE leans in: at 22, he's charming, witty,
     dangerous, rebellious. He grins at her, flirty. Uhura gives
     him a look, then back to the bartender:

                                UHURA
                  And a shot of Jack, straight up.

                                KIRK
                          (to the bartender)
                  Make it two -- her shot's on me.

                                UHURA
                  Her shot's on her. Thanks but no thanks.

                                KIRK
                  Don't you want my name before you
                  completely reject me?

                                UHURA
                  I'm good without it.

     Damn, he likes her already.

                                KIRK
                  You are good without it. It's Jim. Jim
                  Kirk.
                          (long beat)
                  If you don't tell me your name, I'm gonna
                  have to make one up.

                                    UHURA
                           (beat)
                  Uhura.

                                KIRK
                  Uhura? No way -- that's the name I was
                  gonna make up for you. Uhura what?

                                    UHURA
                  Just Uhura.

                                KIRK
                  They don't have last names in your world?

                              UHURA
                Uhura is my last name.

                              KIRK
                They don't have first names in your
                world? Wait, let me guess. Is it "Jim"?

     That makes her smile.    So he moves closer to her:

                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                Okay, so you're a cadet. Studying.
                What's your focus?

                              UHURA
                Xenolinguistics. Lemme guess: you don't
                know what that means.

                              KIRK
                Let me guess: study of Alien languages:
                phonology, morphology, syntax-- it means
                you've got a talented tongue.

                              UHURA
                And for a moment I thought you were just
                a dumb hick who only has sex with farm
                animals.

                                KIRK
                Well.    Not only.

                              UHURA
                You think you're smart.

                              KIRK
                Oh, baby, I'm the smartest.

     Something sad in that.    A BURLY STARFLEET CADET appears.

                              BURLY CADET
                This guy bothering you?

                              UHURA
                Beyond belief, but nothing I can't
                handle.

                              KIRK
                You could handle me.    That's an
                invitation.

     The Burly Cadet spins Kirk around:

                                BURLY CADET
                Hey.    You mind your manners.

                At ease, Cup Cake, it was a joke.     Like
                your hairline.

     Uhura turns back.    The other cadets, seeing trouble, approach.

                              UHURA
                Hey -- Jim: enough.

                                   BURLY CADET
                What was that?

                              KIRK
                You heard me, Moon Beam.

                              BURLY CADET
                You know how to count farm boy?    There's
                five of us... and one of you.

                              KIRK
                Okay, so go get some more guys, come back
                and it'll be an even fight.

     The cadet swings his fist but Kirk HEADBUTTS HIS HAND, BREAKING
     IT -- another Cadet PUNCHES KIRK, then THROWS HIM into a table,
     which Kirk FLIES OVER, landing hard -- another Cadet GRABS HIM,
     pulls him up -- Kirk SLAMS FIVE FAST PUNCHES that send the Cadet
     back -- when ANOTHER CADET PUNCHES HIM -- yet another HOLDS KIRK
     -- and that last punch is repeated THREE-- then FOUR times --

                                   UHURA
                Enough!    STOP!

     Another punch and Kirk FLIES TO THE FLOOR - he's out of it, but
     won't give up. The Cadets UNLEASH on him and really PUMMEL HIM -
     - and Kirk's spirited, but LOSING -- about to LOSE BAD -- when
     an EAR-SPLITTING WHISTLE makes everything STOP -- they turn --
     standing in the doorway is a tall, rugged Starfleet officer --
     CAPTAIN CHRISTOPHER PIKE.

                              PIKE
                Outside, all of you!       NOW!

     The cadets file out, in for it. Pike moves to a dazed, semi-
     conscious Kirk, now upside down on a table.

                              PIKE (CONT'D)
                Y'alright, Son?

                              KIRK
                You can... whistle really loud, y'know
                that?

     -- and Kirk PASSES OUT.

     HIGH WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT of the almost-closed bar. Only Kirk and
     Pike sit here at a table. Kirk's bloodied, tissue in his nose.

                              PIKE
                I couldn't believe when the bartender
                told me who you are.

                              KIRK
                ... and who am I, Captain Pike?

                              PIKE
                Your father's son.
                        (then, smiles)
                For my dissertation, I was assigned the
                U.S.S. Kelvin. Something I admired about
                your dad... he didn't believe in no-win
                scenarios.

                              KIRK
                He sure learned his lesson.

                               PIKE
                Depends on how you define winning.
                You're here, aren't you?
                        (off Kirk's look)
                That instinct to leap without looking--
                that was his nature, too. And in my
                opinion it's something Starfleet has
                lost. We're admirable, respectable. But
                overly-disciplined.
                        (beat)
                Those cadets you took on, they'll make
                competent officers -- but you can bet
                your ass they'll run home to momma the
                minute they're looking down the barrel of
                a Klingon phaser cannon.

                              KIRK
                -- why are you talking to me?

                              PIKE
                I looked up your file while you were
                drooling on the floor. Your aptitude
                tests were off the charts-- what is it,
                d'you like being the only Genius Level
                repeat-offender in the midwest?

                              KIRK
                Maybe I love it.

                                 PIKE
                  So your daddy dies... you can settle for
                  a less-than-ordinary life.
                          (beat)
                  Or do you feel like you're meant for
                  something better? Something special?

     And that just hangs there for a beat. Because Pike just hit a
     nerve. Kirk does his best not to show it -- still absent-
     mindedly fiddling with STARFLEET SHIP SALT AND PEPPER SHAKERS.

                                KIRK
                  Come to think of it, I do want to feel
                  special. You know what? I'm gonna go
                  start a book club--

                                PIKE
                  Enlist in Starfleet.

                                KIRK
                  Enlist. You must be way down on your
                  recruiting quota for the month--

                                PIKE
                  If you're half the man your father was,
                  Jim, Starfleet could use you. You could
                  be an officer in four years, have your
                  own ship in eight.

     He's getting under Kirk's skin -- but Kirk keeps up the 'tude,
     grabs his jacket, stands --

                                KIRK
                  We're even, right?   I can go.

                  Riverside shipyard. Shuttle for new
                  recruits leaves tomorrow, 0800.
                          (Kirk turns, Pike grabs
                           him)
                  Your father was Captain of a Starship.
                  For twelve minutes. I dare you to do
                  better.

     Eyes lock... and it's now Pike who stands and walks off.   And
     that's where it hangs. Off Kirk, brooding...

62   EXT. IOWA PLAINS - SUNRISE                                        62

     CORN STALKS whipping by -- Kirk on his SPOKELESS MOTORCYCLE
     rocketing across the plains -- his soul's been stirred and he's
     fighting it -- he cranks it, ELECTRIC ENGINE SCREAMING --

63   EXT. STARFLEET CONSTRUCTION YARD - SUNRISE                       63

     Kirk pulls up to us, kills the bike. Camera starts to MOVE
     AROUND HIM -- he's dramatically BACKLIT and we COME AROUND for
     an INCREDIBLE REVEAL of a SHIPYARD -- at its center, the
     skeletal frame of a NEW SHIP under arclights. UNMISTAKABLY, THE
     U.S.S. ENTERPRISE. Unformed, raw, like its future captain. Our
     MUSIC SWELLS, we PUSH IN ON HIM, considering Pike's offer, his
     future, his fate.

64   EXT. STARFLEET SHIPYARD - MORNING                                64

     The shipyard is abuzz with activity -- cadets loading into a
     shuttle -- and Pike, staring off, waiting. The PILOT
     approaches:

                              SHUTTLE PILOT
                Waiting for something, Cap?

                               PIKE
                ... No.   Guess not.

     He climbs in. The pilot rapidly flips through switches, running
     a pre-flight sequence. Pike straps in. Glances through the
     viewshield... SEES SOMETHING... and he smiles. From his POV:
     KIRK on his MOTORCYCLE, driving into the shipyard --

                              PIKE (CONT'D)
                Hold her a second...

     Kirk rides past a WATERFALL of cooling tanks -- stops the bike
     near the shuttle -- steps off, has nothing -- no bags -- just
     the clothes on his back.

                              SHIPYARD WORKER
                Nice ride, man.

     Kirk kicks the stand, tosses the guy the startcard --

                               KIRK
                Live it up.

     Kirk walks past the startled worker and approaches Pike.

                               KIRK (CONT'D)
                Four years?   I'm gonna do it in three.

     Pike grins as Kirk passes him.

     Inside the shuttle, Kirk moves down rows of new recruits, some
     of them ALIEN. Passes UHURA and the BARFIGHT CADETS, who PERK
     UP when they see him -- one has a BANDAGED HAND.

                  At ease, Gentlemen.
                          (then, to Uhura)
                  Never did get that first name.

                                UHURA
                          (can't help it: a grin)
                  And you never will.

     He smiles as he takes a seat at the back of the shuttle.   Straps
     in as it RISES...

                                MAN'S VOICE
                  Are you people deaf? I told you I don't
                  need a doctor, damnit! I AM A DOCTOR!

     Kirk turns to see a MAN being forced OUT of the BATHROOM by a
     FEMALE FLIGHT OFFICER -- at 34, he has a Southern lilt and looks
     like a prisoner waiting for the guillotine to fall:

             FLIGHT OFFICER                          MAN
     -- you need to find a seat --     -- I had one, in the bathroom,
                                       Darlin', with no windows --
     -- Sir, for your own safety,      -- I suffer from Aviaphobia,
     siddown, or I will MAKE you       case you don't understand big
     sit down... do you hear me?       words, it means 'fear of dying
     RIGHT NOW.                        in something that flies.'

     They GLARE at each other, then the man drops into the seat
     beside Kirk. The ship TORQUES to one side and the man GRIPS his
     armrests, pale, sweating -- glances at Kirk:

                                MAN
                  I might throw up on you.

                                KIRK
                  I think these things're pretty safe--

                                MAN
                  Don't pander to me, kid: one tiny crack
                  in the hull and our blood boils in
                  thirteen seconds -- solar flare might
                  crop up, cook us in our seats -- Hell,
                  some of the damn passengers are blue.
                  And wait'll you're sitting pretty with a
                  case of Andorian shingles, see if you're
                  still so relaxed when your eyeballs are
                  bleeding-- space is disease and danger,
                  wrapped in darkness and silence.

                                KIRK
                  I hate to break this to you, but
                  Starfleet operates in space.

64F   INT. NERO'S CELL - NIGHT                                         64F

      Nero lies on the floor of his cell, semi-conscious, looking like
      death. Behind him the DOOR OPENS. Two KLINGON GUARDS enter,
      backlit.

                               KLINGON GUARD #1
                 The day you've been waiting for is upon
                 us, Silent One. And look. No sign of
                 salvation. No sign of change. Just more
                 pain.

      And they both lift his limp body up -- as something miraculous
      happens -- NERO SNAPS TO LIFE AND SINGLE-HANDEDLY BEATS THE SHIT
      OUT OF THE GUARDS -- TAKING THEM BOTH DOWN IN TEN SECONDS -- in
      what seems like an instant, he's the only one standing here --
      holding both of the Guards' rifles -- which he TWIRLS, badass.

64G   INT. AYEL'S CELL - NIGHT                                         64G

      PUSH IN ON THE DOOR as it opens -- Ayel, chained, looks up,
      intensely -- and sees that it's NERO who has arrived -- we PUSH
      IN TIGHT ON HIM as he SPEAKS FOR THE FIRST TIME:

                               NERO
                 The wait is over.

      TILT DOWN from a GLIMMERING BUILDING TO REVEAL a sea of RED
      CADET UNIFORMS: HUNDREDS OF CADETS head across campus, McCoy and
      Kirk among them. A miraculous view of San Francisco beneath a
      blue sky, Golden Gate Bridge piercing the air. Kirk struts:

                               KIRK
                 So you'll do it for me, right?

                               MCCOY
                 I have no interest.

                               KIRK
                 I didn't ask if you have interest, I
                 asked if you'd do it.

                               MCCOY
                 I'm about to ask you an obvious question:
                 why bother?

                               KIRK
                 Because I've failed the test twice.

                               MCCOY
                 And you're determined to make it three.
                 We've all failed it-- everyone has, and
                 that's the point! No one goes back for
                 seconds, let alone thirds -- it's not
                 like you need to pass it to graduate.

                               KIRK
                 So Bones: why do they make us take it?

                               MCCOY
                 I told you to stop calling me that.
                 You're very annoying.

                               KIRK
                 And you're the greatest -- thank you.

                               MCCOY
                 You'd better study for it this time.

                   be-- no idea.

      And with a smile, Kirk heads off -- McCoy watches him go,
      calling after him:

      In MOONLIGHT, a beautiful WOMAN lies on her back, in some kind

      Gaila reaches over, turns on the light and we realize: SHE'S

                   I say "I love you", and you say "I sent

     Kirk falls, lands hard on the floor, SCRAMBLES under the bed as
     Gaila's roommate enters -- UHURA. Dropping her backpack:

                  just catching up on some rest. Tired.
                          (fake yawn)
                  That's all.

     Uhura watches her.   Her eyes narrow.

                                UHURA
                  Were you running simulations with the
                  mouth-breather hiding under the bed?

     Gaila freezes, caught.   Uhura looks down, Kirk PEERS OUT.

                                KIRK
                  Your hearing is scary-- you sure both
                  your parents are human?

                                UHURA
                  The hell are you doing with him in here?

                  GAILA                              JIM
     I can't help it! I love him!      Gaila loves me--

                                UHURA (CONT'D)
                  Get outta here -- it's my ass too if
                  administration catches you in this dorm.

                                KIRK

                        (pushing him out)
                You're gonna fail.

                              KIRK
                If I pass, will you tell me your first
                name?

                               UHURA
                No.   Good night.

                              KIRK
                        (quiet, tries to charm)
                I think the fact that you picked up a
                transmission of a Klingon prison escape
                is very interesting.

     SHE CLOSES THE DOOR ON HIM and we CUT TO:

     Dead silence on the bridge... all eyes on the VIEWSCREENS: empty

     Ayel studies his console, hope in his eyes.     Quietly:

                Captain... long range scans of Beta

      Ayel hides his disappointment behind his eyes as suddenly -- A
      LIGHTNING STORM -- impossibly, from nowhere -- LOTS OF IT -- and
      through the lightning erupts THE JELLYFISH -- THE SHIP NERO HAS
      BEEN LOOKING FOR DECADES.

                                   NERO (CONT'D)
                   Welcome back.    Spock.

      And we won't know where we are as MUSIC BUILDS and we CUT TO:

81A   INT. U.S.S. TRAINER - BRIDGE - SPACE     [FORMER SC. 65]            81A

      Uhura TURNS TO US, at her comm station -- PUSH IN on her.     She
      seems wildly BORED and almost RESENTFUL:

                                 UHURA
                   -- we are receiving a distress signal
                   from the U.S.S. Kobayashi Maru. The ship
                   has lost power and is stranded.
                   Starfleet Command has ordered us to
                   rescue them.

      WHIP TO THE COMMAND CHAIR, where KIRK captains the battered
      bridge. Confident -- cocky:

                                 KIRK
                   "Starfleet Command has ordered us to
                   rescue them... Captain."

      She glares, turns away.      Then McCoy, at a console, reports:

                                 MCCOY
                   Klingon vessels have entered the Neutral
                   Zone. And they are firing upon us.

                                   KIRK
                   That's okay.

      McCoy and Uhura -- and the others -- look at him, confused.

                                   MCCOY
                   It's okay?

                                 KIRK
                   Yeah, don't worry about it.

      McCoy and Uhura share a look -- that's when we CUT TO:

81B   INT. TESTING CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS [FORMER SC. 66]             81B

      Looking at the bridge from above, we PULL BACK to reveal an
      observation room above the faux-ship. This is the test Kirk was
      referring to. CONSOLE TECHNICIANS monitor the proceedings. A
      TEST ADMINISTRATOR turns to another and asks:

                   Did he say "don't worry about it"?

                                 TEST ADMINISTRATOR #2
                   -- what's he doing?

      And we CONTINUE TO PULL BACK TO REVEAL that, sitting among the
      technicians, is Gaila. Our resident GREEN GIRL. She checks her
      watch -- PUSH IN ON IT: 2:59 PM. On her MONITOR awaits a 23rd
      century e-mail -- a MESSAGE FROM KIRK --

      Annoyed, she does as:

                   Our ship is being hit -- shields at sixty
                   percent.

                                    KIRK
                   I understand.

                                 MCCOY
                   Should we at least, I dunno, fire back?

                                    KIRK
                   Mmmm... no.

                   Of course not.

                 stopped firing.

                 Arm photons. Prepare to fire on the

                   James T. Kirk.     Step forward.

      It's a huge Starfleet chamber. Golden Gate Bridge visible
      through huge windows. 500 cadets, a nervous KIRK among them.
      He stands, moves to one of two PODIUMS.

                                 ACADEMY PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
                   An incident has occurred today that
                   concerns the entire student body.
                   Academic immorality by one is an assault
                   on us all. It will. Not. Stand. Cadet
                   Kirk, evidence has been submitted to this
                   council suggesting you violated the
                   ethical code of conduct pursuant to
                   regulation 17.43 of the Starfleet code.
                   Is there anything you care to say before
                   we begin?

                                 KIRK
                           (uncomfortable beat)
                   Yessir. I believe I have the right to
                   face my accuser directly.

     President nods toward the assembly. SPOCK RISES. He and Kirk
     MEET EYES for the first time. It's clock-stopping.

                                ACADEMY PRESIDENT
                  Step forward please. This is Commander
                  Spock, one of our most distinguished
                  graduates. He's programmed the Kobayashi
                  Maru test for the last four years.

     Spock steps up to the OTHER PODIUM.      President nods.

                                SPOCK
                  Cadet Kirk. It is obvious you somehow
                  managed to install and activate a sub-
                  routine in the programming code, thereby
                  changing the conditions of the test.

     We happen to find GAILA, in the crowd, fucking pissed.

                                KIRK
                  Your point being?

                                ACADEMY PRESIDENT
                  In academic vernacular, you cheated.

                                  KIRK
                  Respectfully.    Define "cheating".

                                SPOCK
                  To deceive by trickery.

                                 KIRK
                  Now let me ask you something I think we
                  all know the answer to: the test is
                  rigged, isn't it? You programmed it to
                  be unwinnable.

                                ACADEMY PRESIDENT
                  Mr. Kirk, I don't see how the intent of
                  the exam is relevant to these
                  proceedings.

                                KIRK
                  Because if I'm right, Sir, then the test
                  itself is a cheat.

                                SPOCK
                  Your argument precludes the possibility
                  of a no-win scenario --

                                KIRK
                  I don't believe in no-win scenarios --

     on Kirk. This is his boy. His recruit. And he's INVESTED.

                               SPOCK
                 Then not only have you violated the
                 rules, you've failed to understand the
                 principle lesson.

                               KIRK
                 Please, enlighten me.

                               SPOCK
                 You, of all people should know, Cadet
                 Kirk -- A captain cannot cheat death.

     ON KIRK. The first punch by Spock that landed.      The cockiness
     slips away as he senses where this is going --

                               KIRK
                 "I of all people?"

                               SPOCK
                 Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk, had
                 assumed command of his vessel before
                 killed in action, did he not?

     Shit.   The DADDY card.   Kirk, a mix of ANGER and EMBARRASSMENT --

                               KIRK
                 How long did it take you to look that up?

                               SPOCK
                 How long did it take you to program the
                 virus that allowed you to cheat?

     The President smirks; considers ending this now but doesn't,
     it's just too damn entertaining...

                               KIRK
                 Maybe you just don't like that I beat
                 your test.

                               SPOCK
                 I am Vulcan. "Like" is not a verb in our
                 vernacular. I've simply made the logical
                 deduction that you're a liar.

                               KIRK
                 What an idiot I am for taking that
                 personally --

                               SPOCK
                 Agreed. Furthermore, you have failed to
                 divine the purpose of the test.

                              KIRK
                Enlighten me again.

                              SPOCK
                The purpose is to experience fear. Fear
                in the face of certain death. To accept
                that fear and maintain command of one's
                self and one's crew. This is a quality
                expected in every Starfleet captain.

     Kirk absorbs that.   Then --

                              KIRK
                So you're telling me the point.      Of the
                whole thing. Is to be afraid?

                              SPOCK
                Fear is necessary, yes.

                              KIRK
                Have you taken the test, Commander Spork?

                              SPOCK
                Spock. As a Vulcan, I require no
                additional training to control my
                narcissism when making command decisions.

     No he DIN'T!   Kirk's hit guys for a lot less -- The crowd all
     but "OOOOOOHs." But Kirk ain't fucking done yet.

                              KIRK
                You keep reminding me that you're Vulcan.
                And I'm sure you're really proud of that,
                who wouldn't be-- but isn't it true you
                people don't experience fear at all?

     ON SPOCK. He raises that eyebrow. And Kirk sees... no matter
     how subtly... that he has fucking made CONTACT. Smelling blood -
     -

                              KIRK (CONT'D)
                And if that's the case -- What's that say
                about your ability to make command
                decisions?

     Well. Looks like Kirk just hit him in HIS fucking weak spot.
     And before this lovefest can continue --

                                             49

     A REDSHIRT bursts into the HALL -- Kirk turns to look -- they
     all do -- now we're SPEEDING IN behind the REDSHIRT, who runs to
     the President, hands him a DATAPAD. President reads it.
     Everyone watches, on edge -- finally, quietly:

                              ACADEMY PRESIDENT
                        (to all)
                We've received a distress call from
                Vulcan.
                        (Spock reacts concerned)
                Cadet Kirk -- you are on academic
                probation pending the result of your
                hearing. Cadets, report to Shuttle
                Hangar One immediately -- this hearing is
                at recess until further notice --
                dismissed.

     Everyone's on their feet, MOVING QUICKLY, Kirk suddenly
     irrelevant. PIKE passes by him, all fucking business, but
     before he goes --

                              PIKE
                Cheating isn't winning.

     And as that settles on Kirk, McCoy now joins him. The two
     exiting with the rest of the cadets as Kirk eyes SPOCK --

                              KIRK
                Who was that pointy-eared bastard?

                              MCCOY
                I don't know, but I like him.

84   INT. STARFLEET ACADEMY - HANGAR - CONTINUOUS                      84

     DOLLY THROUGH HUNDREDS OF CADETS, racing to their shuttles --
     BARRACKS LEADERS stand on platforms, calling out SHIP
     ASSIGNMENTS -- cadets HURRYING OFF as they're called --

          MALE BARRACKS LEADER             FEMALE BARRACKS OFFICER

     As the last of the cadets head off, Kirk stands there without a
     home -- he moves to his exiting Barracks Leader --

                              KIRK
                Excuse me, you didn't call my name.
                Kirk, James T..

                          (checks his tablet)
                  You're on academic probation. That means
                  you're grounded until the Academy Board
                  rules.

     Kirk is POLEAXED as Leader heads off -- McCoy, needing to run:

                                MCCOY
                  ... Jim, the Board'll rule in your favor.
                  Most likely.
                          (Kirk is just rocked)
                  Look, Jim -- I gotta go --

                                KIRK
                  ... yeah-- yeah, you go... I'm good.

     Kirk forces a half-smile. Torn, McCoy hurries off. PULL AWAY
     from Kirk, alone as the mass of newly-minted cadets criss-
     crosses around him. At the hangar entrance, McCoy suddenly
     STOPS: a lightbulb. He quickly returns to Kirk, pulls him off:

                  MCCOY                              KIRK
     Come with me --                    -- what're you doing --?

     TRACK with them as they hurry through the throng of cadets --
     and suddenly we're moving in the OTHER DIRECTION as a pissed-off
     Uhura serpentines through the group to SPOCK --

                                UHURA
                  Commander, a word?

     Spock moves away from the officers, a private moment with her:

                                SPOCK
                  Yes, Lieutenant?

                                UHURA
                  Was I not one of your top students?

                                SPOCK
                  Indeed you were --

                  Did I not receive a Gold rating for
                  Exolinguistic skills, giving Starfleet
                  first place over Kyoto and MIT at the
                  Oxford Invitational?

     A LOUD nearby SHUTTLE LEAVES BEHIND THEM -- it gets WINDY --

                and, I quote, "unparalleled ability to

                And while you were well aware that my
                unqualified desire was to serve on the
                U.S.S. Enterprise, I was assigned to the
                Farragut.

     Spock reacts unusually; he seems almost embarrassed.   Quiet.

                               SPOCK
                It was an attempt to avoid the appearance
                of favoritism.

     She gets closer, voice low, all pride and defiance:

                            UHURA
                No. No. I am assigned to the
                Enterprise.

     Their eyes hold.    He checks his tablet, makes an change:

                                 SPOCK
                Oh.     Yes, I believe you are.

     a med in a hypospray SYRINGE.

                What are you doing?

                against viral infection from Melvaran mud

                   "Kirk, James T." -- he's not cleared for

                           (re: scanner)
                   You can see he's suffering, he needs me
                   as his doctor, so since I'm assigned to
                   this ship, so's he, or would you like to
                   explain to Captain Pike why the
                   Enterprise warped into a crisis without

     Kirk looks up -- SPOCK moves towards them, not seeing them --
     Kirk yanks McCoy out of the way -- Spock passes and enters a
     TURBOLIFT -- Kirk looks back as the doors close.

     Then we go INTO THE TURBOLIFT -- for just a moment -- as the
     doors open and we enter with Spock:

                                 SULU
                   Moorings retracted, Captain. Dock
                   Control reports ready -- thrusters fired,
                   separating from space dock --

90A   EXT. SPACE DOCK - SPACE [FORMER SC. 92]                             90A

      The Enterprise moves away from the dock -- smaller SATELLITE
      crafts floating around it. The other FIVE STARFLEET SHIPS
      already ahead -- moving into position.

91    INT. MEDICAL BAY - CONTINUOUS                                       91

      MEDICAL STAFF preps. McCoy enters with Kirk, in amusing agony --
      McCoy helps him onto a bed, prepares another hypospray.

                   KIRK                                   MCCOY
      -- oh, this wasn't worth it --
      I wish I didn't know you-- I'm
      itching in my mouth, this is         Here's a short-lasting
      horrible--                           sedative -- those symptoms
                                           won't last long, don't be an
                                           infant.

      And he SHOOTS KIRK with another hypospray --

                   The fleet's cleared space dock, Captain.

      The six ships -- ONE, then TWO, then THREE, then FOUR, then FIVE
      SNAP INTO WARP. The Enterprise, however... just sits there.

      Pike -- and the others -- look at Sulu, who is confused --
      concerned -- searching the controls. Finally:

                               PIKE
                 Lieutenant, where's Helmsman McKenna?

                                SULU
                 Uh, he has lungworms, Sir? He'll be fine
                 but couldn't report to his post-- I'm
                 Hikaru Sulu --

                               PIKE
                         (fucking with him)
                 -- and you are a pilot, right?

                               SULU
                 Very much so, Sir-- I'm not sure
                 what's... wrong here...

                               PIKE
                 Is the parking brake on?

                               SULU
                         (half-laughs)
                 -- no, I'll figure it out, just--

                               SPOCK
                 Have you disengaged the External Inertial
                 Dampener?

      Sulu does -- and realizes Spock is right.     He makes it work.

                               SULU
                 Ready for warp, Sir.

                               PIKE
                 The external inertial dampener.
                 That's... the parking brake.

                               SULU
                         (essentially)
                 ... yessir.

                               PIKE

                 Let's punch it!

      And now alone, the Enterprise SNAPS INTO WARP -- and is gone.

      home, out to the balcony -- and in the distance, a mile away, is
      a massive COLUMN OF LIGHT -- like a ray from God, which creates
      NUKE-LIKE CONCENTRIC CLOUDS and massive DIRT AND DUST, slamming
      into the ground. Amanda's eyes go wide with terror --

      source. Ayel observes TWO ROMULANS EXTRACTING some of this Red

                  their planet was experiencing seismic

                  two minutes. Thank you for your time.

     And as Chekov's message ends, Kirk suddenly SITS UP IN FRAME --
     his mind SPINNING, through the pain and sedative -- he tries to
     get off the bed, to his feet, as McCoy hurries over --

                   Vulcan isn't experiencing a natural
                   disaster, it's being attacked -- by
                   Romulans.

      ON THE CREW as that lands.     But most specifically, SPOCK.

                                 PIKE
                   Cadet Kirk, I think you've had enough
                   attention for one day -- Dr. McCoy,
                   return to medical, we'll have words
                   later.

                                   MCCOY
                   Yessir.

      Rebuked, McCoy exits as:

                   SPOCK                                 KIRK
      As you know, Mr. Kirk is not
      cleared to be aboard this
      vessel. By Starfleet                  Yeah, I get it, you're a
      regulations, that makes him a        great arguer, I'd love to do
      stowaway...                          it again with you, too.

      I can remove the cadet from          -- Try it! This cadet is
      the bridge, Sir --                   trying to save the bridge!
      -- By recommending a full stop
      in trans-warp in the midst of
      a rescue mission?                    -- It's not a rescue mission--
                                           listen to me! It's an attack!
      -- Based on what facts?

      ON KIRK.   Enough.     And cadet or not, the bridge is HIS.

                                 KIRK
                   Fact: the same anomaly -- a lighting
                   storm in space -- that we saw today also
                   occurred on the day of my birth, before a
                   Romulan ship attacked the U.S.S. Kelvin.

                 Fact: This ship -- which had formidable
                 and advanced weaponry -- was never seen
                 or heard from again -- fact: the Kelvin
                 attack took place on the edge of Klingon
                 space and at 11-hundred hours last night
                 there was an escape from a Klingon prison
                 planet -- Rura Penthe -- fact: the
                 escaped prisoners were Romulans, Sir, and
                 it was reported that they stole a ship
                 from the prison dock.

                               PIKE
                 And you know of this prison escape how?

      Kirk just points to Uhura.

                               UHURA
                 Sir, I-- I intercepted and translated the
                 message myself. Kirk's report is
                 accurate.

                               KIRK
                 We're warping into a trap-- there are
                 Romulans waiting for us, I promise you
                 that.

      All eyes on Pike.   He looks to Spock, who could screw Kirk
      here... But--

                                SPOCK
                 The cadet's logic is sound.
                         (then)
                 And Lieutenant Uhura is unmatched in
                 xenolinguistics, we would be wise to
                 accept her conclusion.

                 Sir, I'm-- not sure I could distinguish
                 the Romulan language from Vulcan.

                   transmissions -- or transmissions of any
                   kind in the area. There seems to be
                   something jamming all communication
                   around Vulcan.

                                 KIRK
                   It's because they're being attacked.

                 Let's go.

      Bridge doors WHOOSH open -- they EXIT.

117   INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDORS - CONTINUOUS                       117

      WE TRACK FAST with Pike, Kirk, Spock and Sulu as they HURRY
      through the Enterprise toward the shuttle bay:

                               PIKE
                 Without transporters, we can't beam off
                 the ship, can't assist Vulcan, can't do
                 our job. I'm creating an opportunity:
                 Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sulu and Mr. Olson will
                 space-jump from the shuttle. You'll have
                 chutes -- you'll land on that machine
                 they've lowered into the atmosphere
                 that's scrambling our gear-- you'll get
                 inside, disable that thing then beam back
                 to the ship.

      Kirk and Sulu share a HOLY FUCKING SHIT look --

                                KIRK
                 ... okay.

                               PIKE
                 Mr. Spock, I'm leaving you in command of
                 the ship. Once we have transport
                 capability and communications back up,
                 you'll contact Starfleet and report what
                 the hell's happening here.

                   Something you've got only precious few
                   minutes to figure out. If all else
                   fails, fall back and rendezvous with the
                   fleet in the Laurentian System.
                           (Spock is freaked, then)
                   Kirk. I'm promoting you to First
                   Officer.


                    KIRK                               SPOCK
      What!?!                           -- Captain?

                                 PIKE (CONT'D)
                   While I'm gone we need to keep the chain
                   of command. And you two make a swell
                   team.

                                 SPOCK
                   Captain. Please. I apologize, but the
                   complexities of human pranks escape me.

                                 PIKE
                   It's not a prank, Spock.   And I'm not the
                   Captain. You are.

      And with that, he's DONE. Strides off.     Kirk finally shakes off
      the shock of his PROMOTION --

                                 KIRK
                   Once we knock out that machine... Sir,
                   what happens to you?

                                 PIKE
                   I guess you'll have to come get me.
                           (turns; to Spock)
                   Careful with the ship. She's brand new.

      They appreciate the pure BALLS of that. BRAVERY washes over
      them -- they'd fucking DIE for their Captain, who now turns to
      Kirk and Sulu --

                                 PIKE (CONT'D)
                   Suit up, Gentlemen.

      Sarek's hovercraft speeds along the desert floor, arriving at a

     Bridge doors WHOOSH open -- all eyes on Spock as he enters --
     their new captain. With cold certainty, he takes the command
     chair, hits the intercom:

                 Dr. Puri, report --

118B INT. MEDICAL BAY - CONTINUOUS                                      118B

     CHAOS, UTTER AND COMPLETE. WOUNDED MEN AND WOMEN, it's bad,
     bloody -- a HAND hits an intercom: McCoy, badly shaken --

                               MCCOY
                 It's McCoy-- Dr. Puri was on Deck 6, he's
                 dead.

                                SPOCK
                         (beat)
                 Then you have just inherited his
                 responsibility as Chief Medical Officer.

                               MCCOY

119   INT. ENTERPRISE - SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS                        119

      QUICK CUTS: Kirk, Sulu, and the ship's LEAD ENGINEER OLSON are
      suiting up for the drop, strapping on sleek AIRDROP ARMOR. WEB
      BELTS. CHUTE PACKS. HARNESSES. HELMETS. COM-SETS.

119A INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                                          119A

      They race into the shuttle and take seats facing each other
      across a narrow aisle -- Red Shirt Engineer GRINS like he's
      going on a ski trip:

                               RED SHIRT ENGINEER
                 I am pumped to kick some Romulan ass!   No
                 joke. BRING IT ON!

      Kirk nods at him -- subtext: "What a fucking sack."     He looks to
      Sulu.

                               KIRK
                 So what kinda combat training d'you have?

                               SULU

                 ... fencing.

      In the COCKPIT, Pike works the controls -- MOTORS WHINE and the
      craft LURCHES --

119B INT. ENTERPRISE SHUTTLE HANGAR - NIGHT                             119B

      We see the shuttle LEAVE THE DOCK --

120   EXT. IN ORBIT ABOVE VULCAN - CONTINUOUS                           120

      The shuttle soars from the Enterprise bay, the planet Vulcan a
      red orb below... THRUSTERS FLARE as it descends and now we
      REVEAL AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT:

      THE NARADA: FROM ITS BELLY, TENTACLE CABLES DESCEND TOWARD THE
      PLANET'S OUTER ATMOSPHERE, WHERE THE PLASMA DRILL SUB-STATION IS
      TETHERED: THE SOURCE OF THE DRILL BEAM SHOOTING INTO THE PLANET.
      The shuttle GLIDES to a hover, 60,000 FEET ABOVE THE DRILL --

                                            70


121   INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                                        121

      A KLAXON SOUNDS, signalling depressurization of the cargo lock --
      the guys ready their equipment, snatching for handstraps,
      standing on the lip of THE AIRLOCK -- Kirk and Sulu meet eyes
      through their helmet faceplates, the point of no return --
      PIKE'S VOICE over their headsets:

                               PIKE (V.O.)
                 Pre-jump on one: Three, two, one.

      KIRK, SULU, AND RED SHIRT ARE SLAMMED HARD INTO THE ROOF OF THE
      CARGO HOLD AS GRAVITY DIES.

                                  PIKE (CONT'D)
                 Good luck.

      Pike hits another control -- as the shuttle BOMB BAY DOORS OPEN -
      - and KIRK, SULU, AND RED SHIRT ARE INSTANTLY PULLED OUT, INTO:

122   EXT. ABOVE VULCAN - CONTINUOUS                                   122

      THE THREE MEN IN VIOLENT FREEFALL TOWARD THE PLANET -- IN WILD
      SPIN -- THE SENSE OF SPEED'S BEYOND EXHILARATING --

      ROCKETING THROUGH THE VOID AT 150 MPH AS THEY BREAK THROUGH THE
      PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE -- SHAKING VIOLENTLY AT TERMINAL VELOCITY --

123   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                            123

      The falling trio TRACKED ON SCREEN, everyone watches, agape:

                               CHEKOV
                 Away team's entering the atmosphere --

      SPOCK and UHURA meet eyes -- this is fucking insane -- and a
      MAN'S ENTHUSIASTIC YELLING takes us to:

124   EXT. VULCAN'S ATMOSPHERE -- CONTINUOUS                           124

                 WHOOOAAAHYYYEAAAAH!

      ONE BY ONE THEY STABILIZE -- FALLING FACE DOWN -- STRAIGHT PAST
      THE CABLE TENTACLES TETHERING THE DRILL TO THE NARADA WHICH GIVE
      US A SENSE OF INCREDIBLE RELATIVE SPEED AND SCALE -- THESE
      MASSIVE CABLES AT DIZZYING SPEED --

      THEY ANGLE THEIR HANDS AND FEET FOR CONTROL, GUIDING THEMSELVES
      TOWARD THE PLASMA DRILL -- SULU PULLS HIS CHUTE FIRST, THEN KIRK
      -- their chutes SNAP OPEN -- JERKING THEM HARD UPWARD AS THE RED
      SHIRT BLOWS PAST KIRK AND SULU --

                                 KIRK
                   OLSON, PULL NOW, NOW!!!

      HE DEPLOYS HIS CHUTE LAST -- 50 FT -- 40 -- 30 AND HIS CHUTE
      BILLOWS OUT, OPENED TOO LATE -- OLSEN'S FUCKING BODY SLAMS INTO
      THE EDGE OF THE CIRCULAR DRILL, BOUNCING OFF HARD STEEL AND
      RIGHT INTO ITS CENTER WHERE THE SWIRLING VORTEX SPINS -- HE'S
      INSTANTLY EVISCERATED IN THE PLASMA LIGHT!

      Kirk approaches -- more terrified than ever -- he comes in hard,
      too -- SLAMS against the drill edge, bounces but quickly gets
      his footing -- hits a button on his chute and SLITS appear in
      the fabric, suddenly there's no more drag and THE CHUTE AUTO-
      RETRACTS into Kirk's pack -- A REUSABLE PARACHUTE.

      BUT SULU ISN'T SO LUCKY: 20 yards from the drill surface his
      chute gets SNARED IN THE CABLES, JERKING him upside down -- the
      WIND is so intense Sulu is BLOWN SIDEWAYS -- his CHUTE LINES
      begin RUBBING on the sharp metal of the suspension rig! Kirk
      holds on to one of the chute's cables -- yells up:

                                 KIRK (CONT'D)
                   I'M COMING FOR YOU!

      As Kirk tries to climb up, Sulu's cables begin to SNAP! ONE BY
      ONE -- and Sulu tries to CLIMB BACK using his chute cables,
      toward the rig -- otherwise he's gonna fly off.

      As Kirk makes his way up the rig, suddenly:

                                  SULU
                   BEHIND YOU!!

      Kirk SPINS just as a Romulan appears -- tackling Kirk to the
      drill platform! The two FIGHT PRECARIOUSLY ON THE EDGE OF THE
      SWIRLING PLASMA DRILL, WIND ROARING -- and suddenly there's
      ANOTHER ROMULAN from an OPEN HATCH! SULU SLIDES DOWN THE CABLE -
      - JUMPING and tackling the second guard and the shit is ON: our
      Starfleet heroes battling these Romulans to the death -- and
      Sulu KICKS OFF AN ANTENNA PIECE and uses it as a SABER --
      fucking swashbuckling at 10,000 feet! It's a frenzied assault
      even the bigger Romulan isn't ready for, and Sulu manages to
      KICK him into the vortex, where he's VAPORIZED as --

      KIRK draws his PHASER and point-blank SHOOTS the Romulan,
      knocking him clear OFF the cylinder and into the sky, falling to
      his death, DISINTEGRATING as he falls --

      Against pummeling wind, Kirk and Sulu move toward the HATCH --
      OPEN IT -- as:

125   OMIT                                                             125

      Pike's SHUTTLE DOOR OPENS. Pike steps out. Surrounded by a
      dozen of Nero's men. Ayel steps forward. Pike stands firm,
      knowing this is the end for him:

                 I'm Captain Christopher Pi--

      WHACK! He's cut off by a PUNCH to the face. Drops to his
      knees. Looks up at Ayel with blazing eyes, wipes a trickle of
      blood from his lip:

                 So much for diplomacy.

                 None of this is familiar-- the interface,

      And for an instant... nothing. What looks like a puff of smoke
      billowing up from the planet's core... THEN A SHOCKWAVE BLASTS
      UPWARD, ALL THE WAY UP TO THE DRILL AT 10,000 FEET -- KIRK AND

                   scale -- if my calculations are correct,
                   that pod they launched is creating a
                   singularity... that will consume the
                   planet.

      SPOCK'S STOIC FACE. WE GET ONLY A HINT OF THE WILD EMOTIONS
      STIRRING INSIDE HIM -- Uhura watches Spock, heartsick for him:

                                 SPOCK
                   They're creating a black hole... at the
                   center of Vulcan?

                                  CHEKOV
                   ... yessir.

                                 SPOCK
                   How long does the planet have?

                                 CHEKOV
                   ... minutes, Sir. I'd say minutes.

                                 SPOCK
                           (beat, to Uhura)
                   Alert Vulcan Command Center to signal a
                   planetwide evacuation-- all channels, all
                   frequencies -- maintain standard orbit --

                                  UHURA
                   What?   Spock, wait --

      She goes after him as he moves to the TURBOLIFT --

                                 UHURA (CONT'D)
                   -- where are you going?

                                 SPOCK
                   To evacuate the Vulcan High Council--
                   they're tasked with protecting our
                   cultural history. My parents will be
                   among them--

                                 UHURA
                   -- you can't beam them out?

                                 SPOCK
                   It's not possible -- they'll be in the
                   Katrik Arc, I must get them myself--

      TURBOLIFT DOORS CLOSE AS --

136   EXT. PLASMA DRILL CYLINDER - CONTINUOUS                          136

      The platform BANKS -- Sulu FALLS BACK, OFF THE PLATFORM --
      WITHOUT A CHUTE! Kirk, holding on, watching this wide-eyed --
      and knowing what he must do, he RUNS AND JUMPS --

      KIRK FALLS FAST, he's only gonna have one shot at this, presses
      his arms to his sides and ROCKETS downward, building speed, four
      hundred feet below is Sulu, FREEFALLING --

      KIRK moves his feet and hands, angling toward him -- slashing
      downward at 160 mph, closing like a missile -- the gap between
      them narrows -- Sulu's 30 feet below him... 5000 feet to the
      planet surface. 40 ft -- 20 -- 10 -- WHAM! Kirk slams into
      Sulu in a mid-air tackle -- they TUMBLE TOGETHER -- Kirk's made
      the grab and locked his arms around Sulu in an iron grip,
      screams in his face:

                                  KIRK
                   I GOTCHA!   NOW PULL MY CHUTE!

      Sulu DOES -- it opens -- but HOLY FUCK, the double weight RIPS
      IT -- IT SNAPS AWAY FROM THEM -- NOW THEY'RE BOTH FREE-FALLING
      WITH NO CHUTE, THE GROUND COMING AT THEM FAST!

                                 KIRK (CONT'D)
                   ENTERPRISE, WE'RE FALLING WITHOUT A

      The TRANSPORTER CHIEF works his controls, sweating -- trying to
      LOCK ON TO THEIR MOVING TARGET --

                                  TRANSPORTER CHIEF
                   I'm trying!   I can't lock on your signal!

                   -- you're moving too fast!

                                 CHEVOK
                   -- no-- I can do that-- I CAN DO THAT!!!

      Chekov suddenly BOLTS -- Uhura watches him race off -- a CREW
      MEMBER steps into frame:

                                 CREW MEMBER
                   The black hole's expanding, we won't

      Chekov SPRINTS through CORRIDORS -- ENGINE ROOM -- YELLING:

                   MOVE!   I CAN DO THAT!   I CAN DO THAT!!!

                                    CHEKOV
                   I CAN LOCK ON!     GIMME MANUAL CONTROL!

141   INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER BAY - CONTINUOUS                    141

      AND REMATERIALIZE, SLAMMING DOWN ON THE TRANSPORTER PADS, HARD
      AND PAINFUL, BUT SAFE! Transporter engineers GAPE in utter
      amazement and relief -- Chekov, sweating, laughs. Kirk and Sulu
      get their bearings, peeling themselves up, at stunned whispers:

                                 SULU
                   ... thanks.

                                 KIRK
                   ... yeah, not a problem.

      And Kirk looks up as SPOCK hurries in --

                                 SPOCK
                   Step aside -- I'm going to the surface.

      As the console ENGINEER works the display --

                                 KIRK
                   The surface of what? YOU'RE GOING DOWN
                   THERE? Are you nuts?!

                                 SPOCK
                   Energize --

      And Spock DEMATERIALIZES --

      PUSH IN as Spock MATERIALIZES -- the distant landscape around
      him COLLAPSING, IMPLODING, EXPLODING -- he sprints for the
      MOUNTAIN -- the entrance to the ARK -- a scared, small CREATURE
      runs past Spock as he heads up the mountain -- rocks falling --

143   INT. KATRIC ARK CHAMBER - DAY                                   143

      Spock RACES through the tunnels as the world SHAKES around him --
      he enters the massive ARK CHAMBER -- sees, atop the enormous
      stairs, FIVE VULCAN ELDERS, Sarek among them, hands placed on
      the sarcophagus-like ark. Mind melding with it. Amanda is here
      too, kneeling beside Sarek -- and she sees her son, who is now
      RUNNING toward them -- she stands:

                                   AMANDA
                 Spock--!

      Spock rushes up the stairs --

                               SPOCK
                 The planet's not safe, it has only
                 seconds left -- we must evacuate now --

      And as they run out, ENORMOUS ROCKS COLLAPSE AROUND THEM -- and
      they run through the tunnels, the STONE COLLAPSING AROUND THEM --

144   EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - DAY                                      144

      Spock and the group finally emerge from the tunnels to see --
      THE PLANET IS COLLAPSING, COMING TOWARD THEM -- Spock whips
      open a tri-corder, TREMBLING LIKE CRAZY --

                               SPOCK
                 Spock to Enterprise: take us back now!

146   EXT. KATRIC ARK CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS                            146

      HORROR AS THE WORLD LITERALLY STARTS TO FALL APART AROUND SPOCK,
      HIS PARENTS AND THE FIVE ELDERS -- MASSIVE SINKHOLES APPEARING,
      LIKE THE GRAND CANYON RACING FOR THEM -- AND WE SEE IN ALL THEIR
      FACES -- THE BELIEF THAT THEIR PLANET -- THAT THEY -- ARE GOING
      TO DIE -- and Spock, trying to hold it together -- even though
      their transport hasn't yet begun -- looks at Amanda -- their
      eyes lock -- THE COLLAPSING GROUND RACING TOWARD THEM -- and in
      a surreal, intimate moment, Amanda says to Spock, quietly:

                                AMANDA
                 It's okay.   To be scared.

      PUSH IN ON SPOCK, looking at her -- as the LIGHT DARTS start
      TRACING THEM -- and they begin to EVAPORATE AS THE GROUND DROPS
      FROM UNDER AMANDA -- AND SHE'S SUCKED DOWN -- AWAY -- as Spock
      REACHES FOR HER, CALLING OUT --

                                   SPOCK

      Chekov in a panic at the controls --

                   NO!!!   I'M LOSING HER!!!

      -- as the Vulcans MATERIALIZE on the pad, Spock still REACHING
      for his mother -- but all he gets it the GHOSTLY IMAGE OF HER --
      BEAUTIFUL, HOLDING, FROZEN IN SPACE -- AN IMAGE HE'LL BE HAUNTED
      BY FOREVER -- AS IT FADES AWAY, EVANESCING LIKE MIST -- ON SPOCK
      as it lands -- Sarek too... a mother... a wife... has been lost.
      And Kirk stands nearby, having observed all of this, without
      anything to do or say... there's no cheating death.

148   EXT. SPACE - ETERNAL NIGHT                                       148

      And the Enterprise BLASTS AWAY -- in the distance, THE ENTIRE
      PLANET OF VULCAN SWALLOWS INTO ITSELF -- A TERRIFYING,
      UNIMAGINABLE IMPLOSION -- UNTIL NOTHING IS THERE BUT DARKNESS.
      And over this we HEAR:

                                 SPOCK (V.O.)
                   Acting Captain's log. Stardate 2256.42:

151   INT. ENTERPRISE - SICK BAY - CONTINUOUS                          151

      SHOCK. The kind that crashes after the world's changed. In
      triage, the bay's filled with wounded Enterprise Officers. The
      Vulcan Elders and Sarek being examined as well. Kirk sits here,
      getting his hand bandaged from the fight. During this, he looks
      up, seeing one of the Elders being treated for a slight wound --
      her GREEN BLOOD seen through the bandage...

                                 SPOCK (V.O.)
                   We've heard no word from Captain Pike. I
                   have therefore classified him a hostage
                   of the war criminal known as Nero.

151A INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE                                          151A

      Spock sits in the captain's chair, reporting. He's glassy-eyed,
      staring at nothing as he speaks. Behind him, Uhura sits,
      watching, concerned.

                                SPOCK
                 Nero, who has destroyed my home planet.
                 And most of its six billion inhabitants.
                 I estimate no more than ten thousand
                 survived.
                         (beat)
                 While the essence of our culture has been
                 saved, in the elders who now reside upon
                 this ship... I am now a member of an
                 endangered species.

      Spock considers this. Clicks off the log recorder.     Spock moves
      off, into the turbolift -- Uhura follows him --

152   INT. TURBOLIFT - CONTINUOUS                                      152

      Spock and Uhura. Silence hangs. She glances over, wanting to
      say so much, but not to invade what must be the worst moment of
      his life. He looks at her, with kind eyes. And Uhura does
      something odd -- she STOPS the lift. Spock looks over as she
      wordlessly reaches out and puts her arms around him. Just
      holding him. Kissing his face with utter tenderness and
      comfort, which he lets her do... and we realize, this is why the
      intimacy before -- this is their secret...

                                  UHURA
                 I'm so sorry.

      Spock looks off, taking comfort, bewildered and lost...

                                  UHURA (CONT'D)
                 What can I do?     Tell me what you need.

                                  SPOCK
                 ... I need...

      He's on the verge of some emotional release... but self-
      consciousness returns and he clamps up, starting the lift again:

                               SPOCK (CONT'D)
                 I need for us all to continue performing
                 admirably.

      He looks at her again -- gives her another kiss. The door opens
      and he exits. She watches him go -- and the door closes on her.

                                             81


152A INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR                                        152A

      Kirk comes down the hall, stretching his hand bandage -- when he
      stops. Standing at the other end of the corridor, operating a
      DATAPAD is a familiar-looking GREEN GIRL. Guilt overcomes him.
      After a beat he moves to her. Awkward.

                                   KIRK
                 Hey.
                         (she turns to him)
                 Listen, about what happened at Starfleet.
                 The test and everything-- I know it looks
                 like I was... using you, or whatever.

                   tunnel through space time.

                 You're assuming Nero knows how events are
                 predicted to unfold. The contrary:
                 Nero's very presence has altered the flow
                 of history, beginning with the attack on
                 the U.S.S. Kelvin, culminating in the

      Our POV is BLURRY. We come into FOCUS on a blinking instrument
      panel. KIRK is stirring awake, his shoulder kills. He sits up:
      inside a ONE-MAN POD CRAFT. He WIPES THE GLASS -- looks up --
      like a TUNNEL OF SNOW, 30 feet long, to the sky. THE PODCRAFT'S
      EMBEDDED ON THE SURFACE OF A VAST, ICE PLANET. Kirk's been
      MAROONED. He closes his eyes, his face falls...

      The CANOPY RISES -- a blast of cold air hits Kirk -- with some
      agony, out he goes -- he CLIMBS UP THE TUBE OF SNOW -- and gets
      to the surface -- looks out. HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF FUCKING
      NOWHERE. Finally:

      HUGE, SLITHERING UNDERWATER beneath the ice --

      Kirk FREEZES at a nearby GROWL. He looks -- sees nothing --
      then ANOTHER GROWL -- he turns -- some thirty feet away, an
      eleven foot-tall cross between a polar bear and a gorilla (it's
      a POLARILLA) steps out from behind a mass of ice. Sees Kirk.
      It's horrifying. Kirk takes a SLOW, SMALL STEP BACKWARD -- and
      the fucking thing CHARGES HIM -- KIRK RUNS, TERRIFIED -- and the
      POLARILLA PURSUES -- gaining -- it's gonna EAT HIM ALIVE WHEN
      SUDDENLY --

      WHATEVER WAS BENEATH THE ICE EARLIER EXPLODES UP THROUGH IT --
      IT'S NEARLY 30 FEET TALL, RED, HUNDREDS OF EYES -- IT SMACKS THE
      POLARILLA AWAY LIKE NOTHING AS KIRK FALLS TO THE ICE AND TURNS
      BACK -- HOLY SHIT! THIS THING IS SO MUCH WORSE! IT ROARS AS
      KIRK GETS TO HIS FEET AND RUNS, SCREAMING --

      KIRK HAULS ASS AS THE THING COMES AFTER HIM -- THEN SUDDENLY HE
      FALLS -- DROPS -- and we see that Kirk is FALLING DOWN A MASSIVE
      SNOW MOUNTAIN! The huge red creature stops at the edge and
      ROARS LOUDLY -- until the ice shelf BREAKS AWAY! The creature
      starts to FALL AS WELL! Now Kirk is TUMBLING, the immense
      creature TUMBLING not far behind!

      And Kirk LANDS ON THE ICE, HARD -- sees a distant CAVE. Looks
      up at the FLAILING CREATURE that is about to CRUSH HIM -- Kirk
      tries to run, but the ice is TOO SLIPPERY -- FINALLY he gets
      footing and runs off toward the cave -- as the red creature
      LANDS HARD -- its sharp SPEAR LIMBS STAB into the ice as it
      pursues Kirk --

      Kirk races through the darkened cave -- the creature comes
      after him -- Kirk goes as fast as he can -- the creature reaches
      out and fucking GRABS HIM -- pulls him toward the disgusting,
      wet, TEETHY MOUTH -- Kirk tries to hold on to anything he can --
      but he's fucking LUNCH -- and just as you're SCREAMING, there's
      LIGHT -- FIRE LIGHT -- and a FIGURE APPEARS, WAVING A TORCH --

      And the red creature's eyes ALL GO WILD -- and it DROPS KIRK and
      BACKS OFF, AFRAID -- the figure CHASES IT until it's gone.
      Kirk, on the ground, is freaked out, out of breath, and can't
      take his eyes off this man... who says:

      And the Figure turns... we may have recognized the voice.
      IT'S SPOCK. As in NIMOY. HERE. Lit in the darkness by the
      fire. We'll refer to him as SPOCK PRIME. He looks at Kirk --
      moves closer to him -- finally seeing him. And is amazed...

                                 KIRK
                   Hey... thank you...

                   How did you find me--? Does Starfleet
                   know of my presence?

                                 KIRK
                   HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME?

      Spock looks deep into the eyes of the freaked out young man,
      feeling the full effect of fate playing its hand, but realizing
      he doesn't recognize him...

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   I have been... and always shall be...
                   your friend.

                                 KIRK
                   -- no, I don't know you -- the only
                   Vulcan I know isn't exactly a buddy.

      Of all the things Spock predicted Kirk might say, it wasn't
      that. He's analyzing a thousand steps ahead, calculating:

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   You are James T. Kirk. Your father is

                   Stop.   Please.     I don't understand.

      As Spock nods, we PRE-LAP:

      Spock's eyes SNAP SHUT, Kirk JOLTS as if by an electric charge --
      and the SCREEN OVEREXPOSES TO WHITE as we CUT TO our MIND MELD

                                SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                  A star in Beta Quadrant will go supernova
                  -- and like a cancer left untreated... it
                  will grow... and destroy everything.

162A INT. VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY                                     162A

      Now we're seeing VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY -- where SIX VULCAN
      SCIENTISTS study a HOLOGRAM of this event -- the star's ORIGIN,
      its PATH OF DESTRUCTION -- and SPOCK PRIME is among them --

                                SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                  I saw the beginning of it myself. Vulcan
                  Science Academy devised a plan to stop
                  it.

                                SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                  We built a ship containing a material
                  capable of generating the only thing
                  powerful enough to consume a supernova.
                  A black hole.

163   INT. JELLYFISH - CONTAINMENT HOLD - NIGHT                        163

      Now we're INSIDE the ship -- the CONTAINMENT HOLD -- being
      ASSEMBLED by Vulcan Scientists --

                                SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                  I agreed to pilot the ship. Knowing I
                  would not return.

164   Now we see Spock Prime, in a ritual ceremony of a Vulcan         164
      Kamikaze pilot. Tea, sipped inside the Ark --

                                SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                  My sacrifice, in service of all races,
                  seemed only logical.

      Now Spock Prime sits in the Jellyfish COCKPIT --

                  Unfortunately... before I could begin the
                  mission... the supernova destroyed

166   -- and suddenly we're OUT OF THE MIND MELD as KIRK GRABS SPOCK   166
      PRIME'S HAND AGAIN:

                                KIRK
                  Nero's planet was destroyed--

                                SPOCK PRIME
                  Yes. He of course blamed us. Believed
                  Vulcan allowed his planet to die. Which
                  was hardly the case. Let me continue.

                   KIRK                           SPOCK PRIME
      This annoys me, I don't like      -- I know, I know, I'm not
      it-- do we have to do it like     surprised to hear you complain
      this--?                           -- allow me to finish.

      Spock Prime touches Kirk again and we go:

      -- the JELLYFISH SWOOPS PAST US -- and we PAN -- and see the
      MASSIVE SUPERNOVA in the infinite distance -- no sense of scale
      here -- but then -- THE NARADA APPEARS -- FIRES TORPEDOES at the
      Jellyfish.

                                 SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                   Nero came after me. Determined to thwart
                   my mission. If Romulus was allowed to
                   die, he said... all planets should share
                   its fate.

167A SPOCK PRIME IN THE COCKPIT, ROCKED AS TORPEDOES EXPLODE         167A
     CLOSELY. TIGHT ON SPOCK PRIME AS HIS MIND RACES --

                                 SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                   I needed an exit. I knew if this mission
                   failed... everyone, everywhere... would
                   lose everything.

      Spock Prime LEAVES the cockpit --

167B INT. JELLYFISH - CONTAINMENT HOLD                               167B

      Prime ENTERS AN AIRLOCK -- TUMBLES IN WEIGHTLESSNESS and enters
      THE CONTAINMENT ROOM. QUICK CUTS as he REMOVES RED MATTER FROM
      THE HOLD --

                                 SPOCK PRIME (V.O.)
                   I realized: a large black hole could
                   destroy the supernova. A smaller one...
                   could be my escape. Could send me back
                   in time, allowing me to complete my
                   mission. So I created a black hole...

      Spock loads the CANNISTER with a small amount of RED MATTER into
      a JETTISON TUBE --

                  Nero must have understood what I was
                  trying to do. Because he began racing
                  for it.

                  Nero simply got to it first. How long I
                  was travelling... I couldn't tell you.
                  It was timeless. But when I arrived...

      LIGHT on Spock Prime's face goes away -- he and the Jellyfish

      KIRK INHALES, SHARPLY, having been there with Spock Prime.    Back
      to the two men, in a cave:

      Kirk stares at him... his mind spinning because now he
      believes him. The result is overwhelmingly emotional.

                                SPOCK PRIME
                  Forgive me... emotional transference is
                  an effect of the mind meld.

                           (sympathy, surprise)
                   ... so you do feel...

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   "Cthia" is the stricture that binds our
                   emotions... but few of us are that
                   perfectly Vulcan.

      Kirk gathers himself, wipes his eyes on his sleeve...

                                 KIRK
                   Going back in time... you changed all our
                   lives.

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   Yet remarkably, events within our
                   timelines, characteristics, people...
                   seem to overlap significantly. Tell me
                   about the rest of the crew? Chekov--
                   Uhura --?

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   Dr. McCoy would assert our meeting here
                   is not a matter of coincidence... but
                   rather, indication of a higher purpose.

                                 KIRK
                   ... he'd call it a damn miracle.

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   Yes he would. Perhaps the time stream's
                   way of attempting to mend itself. In
                   both our histories, the same crew found
                   its way onto the same ship in a time of
                   ultimate crisis -- therein lies our
                   advantage.
                           (rises)
                   We must go-- there's a Starfleet outpost
                   not far from here.

      But Kirk stands -- stops him:

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 ... yes. You often spoke of him as your
                 inspiration for joining starfleet.

      This is amazing for Kirk -- he looks off, trying to imagine that
      life. Spock intuits what this means.

                               SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
                 You should know. He proudly lived to see
                 you become captain of the Enterprise.

                 Yes, Doctor. I'm aware that James Kirk
                 is a friend of yours. Supporting me, as
                 you did, must have been difficult.

                               MCCOY

                               SPOCK
                 I'm simply acknowledging your
                 difficulties.

      We're not sure how McCoy is taking this...

                  Permission to speak freely, Sir.

                                  SPOCK
                  I welcome it.

                                MCCOY
                  Do you. Okay then: are you out of your
                  Vulcan mind? Were you doing the logical
                  thing? Maybe. The right one?
                  Debatable. But one thing's for damn sure
                  -- that kid doesn't know how to lose.
                  Just isn't in his DNA. Back home we have
                  a saying: "If you're gonna ride in the
                  Kentucky Derby, don't leave your prize
                  stallion in the stable."

                                SPOCK
                  ... a curious metaphor, Doctor. As a
                  stallion must first be broken before it
                  can reach its potential.

                                MCCOY
                  My God, Man... you could at least act
                  like it was a hard decision.

                                SPOCK
                  I intended to assist in the effort to re-
                  establish communication with Starfleet.
                  However, if crew morale would be better
                  served by my roaming the halls weeping,
                  I'll gladly defer to your medical
                  expertise.

      A strong look and Spock turns away as Sarek enters the bridge.
      Spock moves to meet him. Off McCoy, fuming --

      A fucking BLIZZARD.   Kirk and Spock Prime move through the
      maddening whiteout.   Kirk yells through it:

                  I AM SO PISSED OFF AT THE OTHER YOU RIGHT

      Echo. Nothing. They head down. After a beat, a SMALL, DARK,
      ODDLY ALIEN CREATURE STEPS OUT. Eyes them curiously. This is
      KEENSER.

                                 KEENSER
                   ... can I help you?

                                 SPOCK PRIME

      Keenser looks them over.    Then:

                   ... no.   This way.

      And they follow Keenser into a MASSIVE WAREHOUSE, filled mostly
      with junked space parts. A large, tarped SHUTTLE in the
      background. In the middle of the huge, depressing space is a
      table. And a STARFLEET OFFICER who is ASLEEP, legs kicked up,
      leaning back in a chair, a hat covering his face. Keenser taps
      the Officer's boot.

                                  STARFLEET OFFICER

      A beat -- and the Officer peers from under his hat.     A cool,
      slow burn.

                                 STARFLEET OFFICER
                   You realize how unacceptable this is.

                 You eat nothing. A bean and you're done
                 for a week, I need food. And now you're
                 here -- so. Thank you. Where is it.

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 You are in fact the Mr. Scott who
                 postulated the theory of trans-warp
                 beaming.

                               SCOTTY
                 Yes! That's exactly what I'm talking
                 about! How d'ya think I ended up here?
                 I got into a debate with my instructor on
                 the issue of Relativistic Physics as they
                 pertain to subspace travel... He seemed
                 to think that the range of transporting
                 say, a roast turkey, was limited to a few
                 hundred miles -- so I told my instructor
                 I could not only beam a bird from one
                 planet to an adjacent planet in the same
                 system -- which is no big deal anyway --
                 but if I were so inclined I could
                 actually do it with a lifeform! So I
                 tested it on Admiral Archer's prize
                 beagle. Which... was a mistake.

                 Feel guilty.

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 What if I told you your trans-warp theory
                 was correct? That it is indeed possible
                 to beam onto a ship that is travelling at
                 warp speed. And that you only required
                 the correct field equation to
                 recrystallize dilithium?

                 The reason you haven't heard of it, Mr.
                 Scott... is because you haven't
                 discovered it yet.

      Kirk reacts. Scotty reacts -- is almost spooked -- sobers up a
      bit... really regards Spock Prime. Skeptical. Amused.

                               SCOTTY
                 Y'from the future, are ya? Brilliant.
                 D'they still have sandwiches where you're
                 from? Piece and jam? Mince 'n tatties?
                 Cockaleekie soup?

                               KIRK
                 What is he talking about?

                                KEENSER
                 Food.

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 Allow us access to your shuttle... and I
                 will show you what a genius you actually
                 are.

      Off Scotty, who can't help but be intrigued --

      Scotty PULLS A TARP over much of the out-of-service shuttle.

                               SCOTTY
                 She's a wee bit dodgy: shield emitters
                 are totally banjaxed, along wi' a few
                 other things.

      Spock finishes speed-typing the FIELD EQUATIONS on the
      TRANSPORTER CONTROL PANEL -- amazingly fast.

                                  SCOTTY (CONT'D)
                   ... rapid.   That's impressive.

      Spock Prime steps aside:

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   Your equation for achieving trans-warp
                   beaming.

      Scotty looks at the equations -- we watch his expression run the
      gamut: from confused, to dumbfounded, to quiet awe and delight:

                                 SCOTTY
                   Imagine that! Never occurred to me to
                   think of space as the part that's moving.

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   Point of fact: it did occur to you.
                           (he works the console)
                   Extrapolating Enterprise's course --

                                 SCOTTY
                   -- Enterprise? Had its maiden voyage
                   already, has it? Well, you must've done
                   something right to be assigned to that
                   ship, Kiddo. She's a well endowed lady --
                   love to get my hands on her ample
                   nacelles, if you'll pardon the
                   engineering parlance.

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   Now's your chance, Mr. Scott.

                                 SCOTTY
                   Look, even if I believed you -- where
                   you're from, what I've done-- which I
                   don't -- we're still talkin' bout
                   slingshotting aboard while she's going
                   faster than light. Without a proper
                   receiving pad, that's like tryin'a hit a
                   bullet with a smaller bullet, wearing a
                   blindfold. On a horse.

                                 SPOCK
                   I calculate no more than a four meter
                   margin of error.

                                 SCOTTY
                   That's all well and good unless you
                   rematerialize four meters outside the
                   ship.

      As Spock works the keyboard, an ENTERPRISE SCHEMATIC rotates:

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 Agreed: the aft engineering bay is your
                 best option: a large space and no
                 unpredictable airlocks --

                               KIRK
                 -- you're coming with us, right?

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 No, Jim. My destiny lies along a
                 different path.

                   KIRK                          SPOCK PRIME
      Your destiny can wait -- he         (simply, strong)
      won't believe me, only you can   Under no circumstances can he
      explain w--                      be made aware of my existence.
                                       You must promise me this.

                               KIRK
                 You're telling me I can't tell you I'm
                 following your own orders? Why not?
                 What happens?

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 Trust me. Above all. Jim, this is the
                 one rule you cannot break. To stop Nero,
                 you alone must take command of your ship.

                               KIRK
                 How, over your dead body?

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 Preferably not. There is, however,
                 Starfleet Regulation 619.
                         (off Kirk's confusion)
                 Yes. I forget what little regard you had
                 for such things. 619 states that any
                 commanding officer who is emotionally
                 compromised by the mission at hand...
                 must resign said command.

                               KIRK
                 So I need to emotionally compromise you?

                                SPOCK PRIME
                 Jim.  I just lost my planet. I can tell
                 you.  I am emotionally compromised.
                         (then)
                 What you must do... is get me to show it.

      PUSHING IN ON KIRK as this lands for him --

                 Hm.

                               SCOTTY
                 Aye, then. Live or die, Laddie, let's
                 get this over with. he Enterprise has a
                 decent cafeteria I'm guessing.

      Scotty's on the pad.   Kirk follows, looks at Spock:

                               KIRK
                 You know... coming back in time...
                 changing history... that's cheating.

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 A trick I learned from an old friend.

      Something strikes Kirk -- his eyes GLINT with revelation. Spock
      responds enigmatically: a silent acknowledgment of what Kirk
      must do to get the ship. He raises his hand in the legendary
      Vulcan salute:

                               SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
                 Live long, and prosper.

      And Spock activates the transporter and they DEMATERIALIZE --
      the light plays off his face as he watches them vanish --

      down at his legs, his chest, his arms to make sure he's still in
      one piece, glances over to share his relief with Scotty... BUT
      SCOTTY ISN'T THERE. A strange BANGING -- Kirk turns: the
      BANGING is coming from a large metal TANK -- then Scotty appears
      in a TRANSLUCENT PIPE -- FREAKING OUT -- BANGING ON THE CLEAR
      METAL -- Kirk's mind races -- he looks around for a way to save
      his new friend -- just then a STRONG CURRENT IS FELT inside the
      tube -- AND SCOTTY IS YANKED AWAY, DOWN THE TUBE!

      TWISTING and TURNING tubes -- SCOTTY SEEN every time he enters a
      CLEAR TUBE AREA -- then DISAPPEARING again into the ORANGE tubes
      -- and Scotty gets sucked UPWARDS -- and Kirk turns and looks --
      FOLLOWS THE LENGTH OF TUBE -- SEEING WHERE IT'S HEADING -- TO A
      GIANT WATER TURBINE -- essentially? A MASSIVE FUCKING BLENDER.

                   manage to get aboard this ship?

      Kirk stares at the young Spock -- a different experience now --

                   As Captain of this vessel I order you to
                   answer the question.

                                  KIRK
                   Well I'm not telling.

                   Does that frustrate you? My lack of

                   You will answer me.

                   I'd rather not take sides.

      Spock nods back to the SECURITY GUARDS, over this --

                                 SPOCK
                   Escort them to the Brig.

      But before the guards can do so --

                 interfere with my abilities to command
                 this ship is inaccurate--

                               KIRK
                 HA! And yet you said fear was necessary
                 for command. I mean -- did you see that
                 bastard's ship? Did you see what he did?

                               SPOCK
                         (tense)
                 Yes, of course I--

                               KIRK
                 So are you afraid or aren't you?!?

                               SPOCK
                         (tenser)
                 I will not... allow you to lecture me
                 about the merits of emotion.

      Kirk gets close to Spock --

                               KIRK
                 Then why don't you stop me.

      Sarek watches, tense.   McCoy, too.   Spock blinks --

                               SPOCK
                 Step away from me, Mr. Kirk.

                               KIRK
                 What is it like? Not to feel? Anger.
                 Or heartbreak. Or the need to stop at
                 nothing to avenge the death of the woman
                 who gave birth to you?!

                               SPOCK
                         (volcanic)
                 -- back away --

                               KIRK
                         (closer still)
                 You must not feel anything! It must not
                 even compute for you! You must not have
                 loved her at all--!

      -- WHAM! SPOCK HAS JUST HIT KIRK -- and Kirk goes to hit back,
      but Spock fucking DELIVERS A SERIES OF POWERFUL BLOWS --
      Security stand back as the Captain attacks...

      And Spock is now fucking CHOKING Kirk -- HE SLAMS KIRK AGAINST
      THE WALL -- SPOCK'S CHOKING THE LIFE OUT OF HIM --

                  Spock!

      And everything -- everything -- STOPS. Spock, red-faced,
      releases his grip. Kirk GULPS air and tumbles to the ground.
      Spock staggers back. Kirk's hardly able to speak, close to
      collapsing. But despite his brutalized face, his expression
      isn't about spite, or hatred... but compassion.

      Spock sees the faces of the STUNNED CREW staring at him. But
      worst of all? Sarek. His father. Spock levels his chin.
      Quickly wipes his eyes. Trying to regain some semblance of
      dignity... looks to McCoy. Softly --

                                SPOCK
                  Doctor. I am no longer fit for duty. I
                  hereby relinquish my command on the
                  grounds that I have been... emotionally
                  compromised. Please note the time and
                  date in the ship's log.

      JESUS. Spock just... QUIT. And after a beat, he leaves the
      room. Sarek follows a moment later.

      The crew just stands there in stunned SILENCE.   Finally --

                                SCOTTY
                  I like this ship. It's exciting.

      McCoy turns to Kirk, exasperated --

                                MCCOY
                  Congratulations, Jim. Now we've got no
                  Captain and no first officer to goddamn
                  replace him.

      ON KIRK.   The moment is upon him.

                                 KIRK
                  Yeah we do.

      ON MCCOY. The CREW -- confused. Sulu just fucking POINTS at
      Kirk and they all realize HOLY SHIT -- Pike made KIRK the First
      Officer before he left!

                    Mr. Spock has resigned commission and
                    advanced me to acting Captain. I know
                    you were all expecting to regroup with
                    the fleet, but I've ordered a pursuit

                    I want all departments at battle stations
                    and ready in ten minutes. Either we're

      Clicks off.    PUSH IN ON KIRK, staring off --

                                  UHURA
                    I want some answers.

      He looks up.    Uhura is there.   Pissed off:

                   I'm a PhD in astrophysics, I think I can
                   handle it -- how'd you get back?

                   You vant us to trust you but you von't

                   No. No, I won't-- hey, I'm the Captain
                   now! I don't have to tell you anything!
                   Now listen: we need to figure out a way
                   to catch up and get to Nero's ship.

                                 SULU
                   There's not a chance. They're gonna be
                   in geosynchronous orbit around Earth in
                   ten minutes. We'll never make it.

                                 MCCOY
                   Even if we could, you can't go in guns
                   blazing, not with their technology,
                   that's suicide.

                                 KIRK
                   Then we find a way to get on that ship
                   and steal the black hole device away from

                   Speak your mind, Spock.

                                 SPOCK
                   That would be unwise.

                                 SAREK
                   What is necessary is always wise.

      Watch Spock's face.   Struggling with what's pent-up inside...

                                 SPOCK
                   I feel as conflicted as I once was. As a
                   child. Have I made so little progress?

                                 SAREK

                   You will always be a child of two worlds.
                   I am grateful for that. And for you.
                           (painfully)
                   And not only because you are all I have
                   left of her.

      Spock looks at Sarek.   This is as close to emotion as he'll get.

                                 SPOCK
                   I feel anger. For the one who took her
                   life. An anger I cannot stop.

                                  SAREK
                   I believe she would say... do not try to.
                           (then)
                   You asked me once. Why I married your
                   mother.
                           (beat, simply)
                   I married her because I loved her.

      Their look HOLDS -- and for Spock, a revelation...

                   Yes, Chekov-- you don't need to ask
                   permission to--

                                 CHEKOV
                   Based on the Narada's course from Vulcan,
                   I've projected that Nero will travel past
                   Saturn. If we could drop out of warp
                   behind one of Saturn's moons, say, Titan,
                   the magnetic distortion from the planet's
                   rings will make us invisible to Nero's
                   sensors. We could follow him to Earth by
                   staying in his blind spot.

                                 KIRK
                   What blind spot?

                                 CHEKOV
                   Its exhaust wake. If we adjust our
                   shield frequencies, they shouldn't detect
                   us.

                                 MCCOY
                   Wait a minute-- anyone understand this
                   kid? How old are you?

                                 CHEKOV
                   I am seventeen, Sir, how old are you?

                                 MCCOY
                   We're all old enough to shave here.

                                 SPOCK (O.S.)
                   Doctor... Mr. Chekov is correct.

      Everyone turns, surprised: SPOCK has entered the bay --
      galvanized, full of purpose --

                   I have reviewed his telemetry. If Mr.
                   Sulu can maneuver us into position, I can
                   beam aboard Nero's ship.

                                 KIRK
                   I won't order you to do that, Mr. Spock.

                   Romulans and Vulcans share a common

      BEAUTIFUL HOLOGRAM before him. He doesn't notice behind him, as
      those BLADES from his STAFF APPEAR BEHIND HIS NECK. Nero
      tenses, only now sensing this unforeseen danger: AYEL HOLDS THE
      WEAPON. Strong. Tough. But under it all... terrified.

                                AYEL
                 The men and I have discussed this. What
                 we are about to do.
                         (beat)
                 We have to turn the ship around. We can
                 save our home.

      Nero turns slowly and deliberately -- Ayel tenses:

                               AYEL (CONT'D)
                 Stop.

      Nero now faces Ayel, blades at his throat -- Ayel growing more
      nervous as he faces his master. The surrounding crew stare on,
      frozen in the moment, only slightly confirming their makeshift
      mutiny with scared looks.

                                                  113
191   CONTINUED:                                                            191

                                 AYEL (CONT'D)
                   We can go back. That's what we want. We
                   have taken our vengeance on Vulcan. No
                   more. We want to go home now.

      Nero considers this... nods gently.

                                  NERO
                   There is no need, Ayel.   To threaten me.
                           (beat)
                   I understand.

      Ayel is massively relieved.     Nero gently reaches out, holds the
      staff (still aimed at him).     He deactivates it -- the blades
      instantly RETRACT.

                                   NERO (CONT'D)
                   I understand.    But you are wrong.

      And just as Ayel realizes he's fucked, Nero somehow activates
      the staff in a way we have not seen -- AND THE BLADES APPEAR ON
      THE OTHER END -- THE END NOW FACING AYEL -- AND JUST AS AYEL'S
      EYES GO WIDE -- NERO THRUSTS THE BLADES INTO AYEL -- WHO FALLS
      TO THE FLOOR, DEAD! Nero's hard face turns to the rest of his
      crew.

                                 NERO (CONT'D)
                   We will return to Romulus when the
                   Federation lies in ruins and not a moment
                   before. When those who watched our
                   people burn at last understand our pain,
                   our loss. I refuse to return as a slave!
                   We will return as conquerors!

      ON THE FACES OF THE MEN, SUBMITTING TO HIS WILL, our MUSIC
      BUILDING -- and then, his eyes on Earth like a fucking LION eyes
      a gazelle--

                                 NERO (CONT'D)
                   Deploy the drill.

      Sulu makes rapid-fire thruster combinations to stay on track --
      a stealthy ballet of incredible dexterity. THE NARADA appears
      over the horizon in geosynchronous orbit, passing underneath the
      Enterprise as they arc in behind it.

                   Whatever happens Mr. Sulu, if you feel
                   you have a tactical advantage fire on
                   that ship. Even if we're still aboard.
                   It's an order.

                                  SULU
                   Yessir.   Good luck.

      Spock turns to Uhura, who hands him a small TRANSLATOR DEVICE:

                                 UHURA
                   We'll be monitoring your frequency...

      Uhura gives the translator to Spock -- AND HE KISSES UHURA.

                                 SPOCK
                   Thank you, Nyota.

      They part, revealing KIRK'S SHOCKED FACE. Uhura walks off,
      leaving the two men -- Kirk looking stunned at Spock.

                                 KIRK
                   Her first name is...

                                 SPOCK
                   I have no comment on the matter.

      Kirk still stunned as Scotty moves to transporter control.

                                 SCOTTY
                   If there's any common sense to their ship
                   design, I'll be puttin' ya in a cargo
                   bay, shouldn't be a soul in sight.

      KIRK AND SPOCK STAND ON THE TRANSPORTER PAD, SIDE-BY-SIDE AND
      FACING THE SAME DIRECTION FOR THE FIRST TIME -- AN ICONIC IMAGE -
      - The moment of truth.

                                  KIRK
                   Energize.

      Scotty hits the transport and Kirk and Spock DISAPPEAR --

199   INT. NARADA - CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS                               199

      Kirk and Spock MATERIALIZE in the cargo bay... to find
      themselves suddenly smack-dab in the middle of SIX ROMULAN
      GUARDS working at cargo consoles!!

      For a split second they're as shocked as Kirk and Spock, until
      they ATTACK -- Kirk immediately engages the closest Romulan,
      struggles -- but Spock's a machine: his palm snaps up CRACKING a
      nose -- SLAMS a head against the wall -- as battle-ready as the
      Romulans are, it's like trying to catch a GHOST, Kirk finally
      knocks his one opponent unconscious, and turns to see it's ALL
      OVER --

                                 KIRK
                           (a touch insecure)

                   I am trained in the Vulcan martial art of
                   Suus Mahna.

      Kirk and Spock move to a still conscious Romulan as he struggles
      to get up. Spock reaches for the fallen Romulan's temples.

                                 SPOCK (CONT'D)
                   I am unable to meld with these Romulans --
                   there are subtle differences in their
                   physiology I did not anticipate --

                   KIRK                                SPOCK
      -- punch him in the face --
      make him talk! Suus Mahna his       -- Suss Mahna is only intended
      ass!                                for self-defense, he's no
                                          longer a threat --
      -- then pretend it's a threat -
      - I'm your captain, that's an
      order!

      Spock PUNCHES the Romulan HARD -- and via Uhura's comlink
      translator, speaks in SUBTITLED ROMULAN:

      Kirk hits a console, a familiar voice comes to life:

                 Voice print and face recognition analysis

                 Spock, you'll be piloting the ship alone.

                               SPOCK
                 Which may be problematic, as I am
                 unfamiliar with this ship's design.

      THE LASER GRID RESPONDS TO SPOCK'S VOICE, scans his features for
      ID -- THE HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY MATERIALIZES:

                 Wow.   That's weird.

      He looks to Kirk in surprise -- Spock's eyes fix with sudden
      understanding. Ambassador Spock... of course... suddenly all
      the pieces start coming together...

      Spock looks at Kirk, a touch upset:

                               SPOCK
                 It appears you've been keeping rather
                 important information from me.

                 Just trust me.      Can ya do that?

      Spock weigh his options.     Trust.   Finally:

                   Father...?

      Sarek turns -- but IT ISN'T SAREK.   IT'S SPOCK PRIME.     Who says:

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   I am not... our father.

      An incredible beat, our two Spocks in eye lock... both minds
      processing conversational possibilities at an incredible rate...
      surreal extensions of each other, separate but connected...

                                 SPOCK
                   ... Fascinating.

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   There are so few Vulcans left.    We cannot
                   afford to ignore each other.

      Young Spock's eyes flicker in puzzlement...

                                 SPOCK
                   Then why did you send Kirk aboard when
                   you alone could've explained the truth?

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                           (beat, simply)
                   Because you needed each other. Opposing
                   yet complimentary opposites. It was that
                   balance between us -- I should say
                   you and Kirk -- that often made the
                   impossible, possible.

                                 SPOCK
                   ... it was a test?

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                           (no: his heart heavy)
                   I'm in no position to pass judgment...
                   my actions have robbed you of much. I
                   could not also deprive you the revelation
                   of all you can accomplish together... of
                   a friendship that will define you both in
                   ways you cannot yet realize.

      There is, to young Spock's surprise, vulnerability in that.

                                 SPOCK
                   How did you persuade him to keep your
                   secret?

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   I inferred universe-ending paradoxes
                   would ensue should he break his promise.

                                  SPOCK
                   You lied.

                                  SPOCK PRIME
                   I implied.

                                  SPOCK
                   A gamble...

                                 SPOCK PRIME
                   An act of faith. One I hope you'll
                   repeat in the future.

      Young Spock considers an enduring friendship between him and
      Kirk... for the first time, understanding it. But --

                                 SPOCK
                   The future's not what it used to be... in
                   the face of extinction, it's only logical
                   I resign my Starfleet commission and help
                   rebuild our race.

                 you can be in two places at once.

                         (beat)
                 I urge you to remain in Starfleet: I've
                 already located a suitable planet on
                 which to establish a Vulcan colony, and
                 assist in the foundation of a new science
                 academy.

      Young Spock takes that in, resolute...

                               SPOCK
                 My future cannot be determined by your
                 past. We are one, but not the same.

                               SPOCK PRIME
                 Then I ask that you do yourself a favor.
                 Put away logic. Do what feels right.
                 The world you've inherited lives in the
                 shadow of incalculable devastation... but
                 there's no reason you must face it alone.

      Spock Prime moves to the door, stops.    Offers the VULCAN SALUTE:

                               SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
                 As my customary farewell would appear
                 oddly self serving, I will simply say...
                 good luck.

      Their eyes hold. Spock turns, disappearing into the corridor.
      Young Spock stares at the empty doorway a beat, his mind a
      jumble of thoughts... and our MUSIC BUILDS...

242   INT. STARFLEET CORRIDOR - HANGAR - CONTINUOUS                     242

      As Spock Prime walks off down the corridor, he passes right by a
      man conferring with a nurse -- the man pauses, turns... it's
      SAREK. Suddenly overcome by a feeling that the stranger who's
      just passed him is... oddly familiar.

243   INT. STARFLEET ACADEMY - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - DAY                   243

      MUSIC STILL BUILDING -- glass walls reveal THE ENTERPRISE at
      dock, UTILITY CRAFTS floating around it, repairing. Standing at
      attention in rows, THE ENTERPRISE CREW -- over four hundred of
      them wearing DRESS UNIFORMS -- TRACK DOWN the faces, all proud --
      and we STOP ON YOUNG KIRK. Composed, focused, a man. The
      ACADEMY PRESIDENT stands at a podium:

      Kirk breaks from formation, pivots, marches down the hangar --
      past UHURA... SULU... CHEKOV... SCOTTY. All Beaming. Notably
      absent, is Spock. Kirk ascends the stairs, snaps to attention:

                                 ACADEMY PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
                   Your inspirational valor and supreme

                   service and reflect utmost credit to
                   yourself, your crew, and the Federation.
                   For your... unique solution to the
                   Kobayashi Maru, it's my honor to award
                   you with a commendation for original
                   thinking.

      He opens a BOX -- glorious in repose, a MEDAL:

                                 ACADEMY PRESIDENT (CONT'D)
                   By Starfleet Order 28455, you are hereby
                   directed to report to Commanding Officer,
                   USS Enterprise, for duty as his relief.

      Kirk turns. Walks to... PIKE. In a wheelchair now, wearing an
      ADMIRAL'S UNIFORM. Overnight, his hair's turned totally grey --
      but despite his trauma, his pride's overwhelming. They SALUTE:

                                 KIRK
                   I relieve you, Sir.

                                 PIKE
                   I am relieved. Congratulations, Captain.

      Pike containing a smirk, pins the medal to Kirk's chest.

                                 KIRK
                   Thank you, Sir.

      Kirk turns to the crowd. Eyes shining. WILD APPLAUSE. As Kirk
      rejoins his crew for hugs and congratulations, we go to the BACK
      of the hangar... SPOCK PRIME. Watching. Moved beyond words.
      He turns and leaves them to it... and our MUSIC SWELLS as --

      The turbolift WHOOSHES open and in walks Kirk -- to every fan's
      delight, wearing his iconic GOLD SHIRT. All around him, our
      crew -- young and fresh-faced but no longer children -- in
      charge of the greatest starship ever built:

                   Same ship, different day.

      And Kirk pauses. His eyes go over to the empty science console
      with a sense of incompleteness. In fact, everyone on the bridge
      feels it. A bitter truth they'll have to accept.

                                 KIRK
                   Mr. Sulu, prepare to engage thrus--

                   ... Permission granted.

                                 SPOCK
                   As you have yet to select a first
                   officer, respectfully, I would like to
                   submit my candidacy. Should you desire,
                   I can provide character references.

      Kirk nearly laughs. Spock's eyebrow goes up. Something passes
      between them... it carries acceptance, and trust...

                                 KIRK
                   It would be my honor, Commander.

           Then I ask that you do yourself a
           favor... put away logic, and do what
           feels right. The world you've inherited
           lives in the shadow of incalculable
           devastation... but there's no reason you
           must face it alone.

And from around his neck, he removes the PENDANT that until now,
we've only caught glimpses of. Places it on the table beside
his younger self. The feeling in his eyes is profound...

                         SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
           This was a gift to me.   Representing...
           a dream. One we were unable to fulfill.
                   (softly)
           The way you can now.

And moves to the door.    Stops.   Offers the VULCAN SALUTE:

                         SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D)
           As my customary farewell would appear
           oddly self serving, I will simply say...
           good luck.

Their eyes hold. Spock turns, disappearing into the corridor.
Young Spock stares at the empty doorway a beat, his mind a
jumble of thoughts. Looks to the pendant... and realizes it's a
HOLO-EMITTER. After considering a beat, he hits an activation
button and a MOVING HOLOGRAPHIC MESSAGE materializes before him:

CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK. WILLIAM SHATNER.      As always, brash, wry,
confident -- and SINGING:

                         KIRK/ SHATNER
           Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to
           you...
                   (stops, grins)
           I know I know, it's illogical to
           celebrate something you had nothing to do
           with, but I haven't had the chance to
           congratulate you on your appointment to
           the ambassadorship so I thought I'd seize
           the occasion... Bravo, Spock -- they tell
           me your first mission may take you away
           for awhile, so I'll be the first to wish
           you luck... and to say...
                   (beat, emotional)
           I miss you, old friend.

                                      136

... and we're PUSHING IN on Young Spock, taking in the image of
Kirk's future self, the message, but above all -- the clear,
unquestionable friendship these two men had...

INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

As Spock Prime walks off down the corridor, he passes right by a
man conferring with a nurse -- the man pauses, turns... it's
SAREK. Suddenly overcome by a feeling that the stranger who's
just passed him is... oddly familiar.

                         KIRK/SHATNER (V.O.)
           I suppose I'd always imagined us...
           outgrowing Starfleet together. Watching
           life swing us into our Emeritus years...

INT. STARBASE ONE - HANGAR - ETERNAL NIGHT

MUSIC BUILDING -- glass walls reveal THE ENTERPRISE at dock,
UTILITY CRAFTS floating around it, repairing. Standing at
attention in rows, THE ENTERPRISE CREW -- over four hundred of
them wearing DRESS UNIFORMS -- TRACK DOWN the faces, all proud:

                         KIRK/SHATNER (V.O.)
           I look around at the new cadets now and
           can't help thinking... has it really been
           so long? Wasn't it only yesterday we
           stepped onto the Enterprise as boys?
           That I had to prove to the crew I
           deserved command... and their respect?

And we STOP ON YOUNG KIRK. Composed, focused, proud. A man.
And to every fan's delight, finally wearing his YELLOW SHIRT.
The FEDERATION COMMANDANT stands at a podium:

                         COMMANDANT
           This assembly calls Captain James
           Tiberius Kirk...

Kirk breaks from formation, pivots, marches down the hangar --
past UHURA... SULU... CHEKOV... SCOTTY. All Beaming. Notably
absent, is Spock. Kirk ascends the stairs, snaps to attention:

                         COMMANDANT (CONT'D)
           Your inspirational valor and supreme
           dedication to your comrades are in
           keeping with the highest traditions of
           service and reflect utmost credit to
           yourself, your crew, and the Federation.
           By Starfleet Order 28455, you are hereby
           directed to report to Commanding Officer,
           USS Enterprise, for duty as his relief.

                                         137
CONTINUED:

Kirk turns. Walks to... PIKE. In a wheelchair now, wearing an
ADMIRAL'S UNIFORM. Overnight, his hair's turned totally grey --
but despite his trauma, his pride's overwhelming. They SALUTE
each other:

                           KIRK
             I relieve you, Sir.

                           PIKE
             ... I am relieved.

He opens a BOX in his lap -- glorious in repose, a MEDAL:

                           PIKE (CONT'D)
             And as Fleet Admiral, for your... unique
             solution to the Kobayashi Maru, it's my
             honor to award you with a commendation
             for original thinking.

Pike containing a smirk, pins the medal to Kirk's chest...

                           PIKE (CONT'D)
                     (a touch choked)
             Congratulations, Captain.

                           KIRK
             Thank you, Sir.

Kirk turns to the crowd. Eyes shining. WILD APPLAUSE.    OUR
MUSIC SOARS. Bones leans in to Sulu, rolling his eyes:

                           BONES
             ... Same ship, different day.

As Kirk rejoins his crew for hugs and congratulations, we go to
the BACK of the hangar... SPOCK PRIME. Watching. Moved beyond
words. He turns and leaves them to it... as he goes...

                           KIRK/SHATNER (V.O.)
             I know what you'd say -- `It's their turn
             now, Jim...' And of course you're
             right... but it got me thinking:

INT. STARFLEET HOSPITAL - EARTH - DAY

Our montage comes full circle as we END on Kirk's transmission:

                            KIRK/SHATNER
             Who's to say we can't go one more round?
             By the last tally, only twenty five
             percent of the galaxy's been chartered...
             I'd call that negligent. Criminal even --
             an invitation.
                            (MORE)

                                       138
CONTINUED:
                           KIRK/SHATNER (CONT'D)
             You once said being a starship captain
             was my first, best destiny... if that's
             true, then yours is to be by my side. If
             there's any true logic to the universe...
             we'll end up on that bridge again
             someday.

Stops, grins.   Because this is the part he needs to say most...

                           KIRK
             Admit it, Spock. For people like us, the
             journey itself... is home.

Young Spock's face.   Lost in feelings that flood through him.
