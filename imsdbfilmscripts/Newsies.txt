    FADE IN:

1   INT. THE NEW YORK WORLD - PRESS ROOM - MORNING                1
    The huge printing PRESSES POUND out the morning edition,
    setting a rhythm that carries us through the scene as the
    newspapers are printed, collated, folded, and spit out
    onto a rapidly-growing stack.
    Pressmen bundle the papers and toss them into carts.        See
    the masthead: "THE NEW YORK WORLD, JULY 10, 1899."

    Two men push hard a cart loaded with papers to get it
    rolling down an iron ramp -- then have to run to keep up
    with it as it careens toward --


2   INT. THE WORLD - CIRCULATION ROOM - MORNING (SAME TIME)       2
    Broad-necked workmen grab the carts and begin unloading
    them -- stacks of paper grow as the POUNDING RHYTHM BUILDS
    and we GO TO --


3   INT. NEWSIE LODGING HOUSE - SAME TIME                         3
    A man's feet move up some stairs (in rhythm) -- they
    belong to KLOPPMAN, 70s, who enters --


4   INT. NEWSIE LODGING HOUSE - DORMITORY - SAME TIME             4
    A large room filled with boys sleeping in hammocks,
    including JACK KELLY, snapping his fingers in his sleep.
    On the wall by his head, the commanding visage of Teddy
    Roosevelt grins down from a rotogravure photo. Kloppman
    wakes the boys, intoning his morning ritual:

                             KLOPPMAN
               Ink's wet, the presses are rolling,
               the papers are stacking -- rise
               and shine, make a dime, no news
               without the Newsies -- etc.
    Jack jumps out of his bunk and shakes the BOY below.

                             JACK
               Wake up, Crutchy -- The World is
               waitin'.

                 Tell Mr. Pulitzer my yacht was
                 lost at sea.
    Jack laughs and tosses him his crutch. The dorm is now
    alive with waking boys -- yawning, stretching, pulling
    on pants, hitching up suspenders as they sing --
    SONG: "CARRYIN' THE BANNER" (Approx. 7 minutes, 15
    seconds)

    The boys begin to wake,                          KID BLINK
    yawning, stretching,                HEY BUMMERS, WE GOT WORK TO DO
    complaining as they hit
    the floor: pants pulled                         SPECS
    on, suspenders hitched             SINCE WHEN DID YOU BECOME

    MUSH, cross-eyed and skinny with big ears and lisp, play-
    fully pushes the NEWSIE so he falls on his hammock.

                               NEWSIE
                 Hey, whattaya?


5   INT. WASHROOM - MINUTES LATER                                     5
    Younger boys pump water for       older boys, then trade off.
    Teeth brushing, sponge baths       with cold water -- the older
    boys shave. Jack smears his        face with shaving cream as
    Mush pulls up a box next to       him.

                               MUSH
                 How'd you sleep, Jack?

                 Jack, this look like I'm fakin'
                 it?
    He hobbles towards Jack on one crutch.

                               JACK
                 Who says you're fakin' it?

                               CRUTCHY
                 The streets are fulla fakes these
                 days -- it's hurtin' the rep of
                 genuine articles like myself. I

                 where they ain't used to seein'

    Jack smiles; Mush taps
    Crutchy on the arm... sings.

                   Too rotten to be the sewer.   It
                   must be --
                                 CRUTCHY
                   -- the Delancey brothers!

      For revenge, Oscar jerks Snipeshooter out of line and
      propels him to the rear.
                                 OSCAR
                   Inna back, ya ugly little shrimp!
      Oscar and Morris glare at the crowd, daring anyone to do
      anything about it. Jack calmly walks Snipe back to his
      place in line, then faces the Delanceys who try to stare
      him down. The air is electric. Nearby --

                   bettin' --
      The Newsies shake their heads.    Nearby the staring
      contest continues until --

                   you're referrin; to the family
                   resemblance in your brother here.
      The brothers glower, look at each other, then back at
      Jack, who grins at them.
                                 JACK
                   That's right. It's an insult.
                   And so's this --
      Jack deftly reaches out both hands and flips the derbys
      off both their heads. The brothers scramble for them
      and the chase is on.

19A   EXT. NEWSIE SQUARE - DAY (SAME TIME)                           19A

      DANCE BREAK... The Delanceys chase Jack throughout the
      square, entertaining the Newsies... a morning tradition.
      The Newsies sing in counterpoint, underscoring the chase.

      are just arriving, hurrying towards the gates on a
      collision course with -- Jack who comes barrelling around
      the statue and runs smack into David. For a moment,
      everything stops -- Jack catches his breath, David looks
      at him in outrage.

                                 DAVID
                   Watch it, willya? What do you

      He speeds on -- just as the Delanceys come thundering
      around the statue, bowling David to the pavement. Les
      looks at Jack as if he's watching Robin Hood and Br'er
      Rabbit rolled into one.

      ANGLE - NEAR GATES - JACK

      keeps running, keeping just out of the Delanceys' grasp
      -- but then he trips and they've got him. Morris lifts
      him high into the air to smash him onto the cobblestones.
      The crowd stops breathing -- but then --

19B   EXT. WORLD BUILDING GATE - DAY                                   19B

      Jack grabs the bars and like a monkey jerks free of the
      bully's grasp. The kids howl, loving the show as Jack
      avoids the brothers moving from bar to bar like Tarzan.

      and back towards the entrance to the World gates.

      Newsies yell out Jack's name as he rides the gates 'til
      the last possible moment, then leaps into the back of a
      wagon. Jack takes a bow as the boys cheer, moving into
      line.

      Les watches Jack, his new hero, as David pulls him along.

20   EXT. CIRCULATION OFFICE - LOADING DOCK - SAME TIME          20
     Newsies jostle for position at the window -- David
     shoving and jostling like the rest. He manages to elbow
     in near the front. Les, hanging back, has his eyes on --
     -- Jack sauntering coolly to his natural place at the
     head of the line, flanked by Boots and Mush. He leans
     on the counter and grins at the rodent-faced man inside
     the window: WEASEL, 40.
                             JACK
               Ya miss me, Weasel?

     The Newsies love it as Jack deliberately takes a paper,
     turns and scans.  Seeing Les staring at him, Jack winks.
     Les smiles back, fascinated. Jack turns back to Weasel
     with a fifty-cent piece.
                            JACK
               The usual.
     Weasel grabs for the coin -- Jack flips it out of his            *
     grasp and onto the counter. The Newsies whoop.

     scans the newspaper for a catchy headline; Race, Crutchy,
     the others wander up, doing the same. A commotion O.S.
     and they look up to see --

     David is incredulous, but Les is pleading.      David sighs.

     A hand smashes the paper onto an ornate desk beyond which
     cower three harried employees of The World, including
     SEITZ, 45, the hard-bitten business manager. BUNSEN, the
     editor, and JONATHAN, an accountant.
                                SEITZ
                  The news is slow, Chief, the

                  Hearst has, too -- see how he
                  covers the strike!
     The magnifying glass swings to a copy of the New York
     Journal with a large black headline: "NUDE CORPSE ON
     RAILS -- NOT CONNECTED TO TROLLEY STRIKE." The CAMERA
     COMES AROUND to reveal JOSEPH PULITZER, himself, a
     thundering presence in smoked-glasses and a beard,
     wielding the magnifying glass like a gavel of judgment.
                                PULITZER
                  Hearst is killing us in the
                  circulation war -- and you give
                  me headlines that would put a

               double what Hearst pays.
                             SEITZ
               That's how he stole him from us.
                      (sighs)
               Chief, you spend as much as you
               make fighting Hearst. That's why
               the paper's losing money --

     air market crowded with carts and people -- all the

                  Paper, mister?
     Without breaking the kiss, the man kicks out at David
     who jumps away. Shaking his head, Jack whispers
     something to Les, who rushes over to the Lovers, still
     kissing.

     running back waving a coin --

                  He gimme a dime! He said I should
                  go far away and keep the change!

     Jack takes the dime; Les's face falls.     He flips it back.

                    Sleeper!

       He leaps over a Sleeping Man on the stairwell; so do
       David and Les as they run out onto --


B26A   EXT. TENEMENT ROOFS - CONTINUOUS ACTION                      B26A
       More sleepers; people living in makeshift shelters.
       Jack runs to a plank stretched between two buildings.

                                  DAVID
                    I'm not crossing that! Anyway,
                    I don't think they're chasing us --

       Jack scoops up Les -- who's loving it -- and carries
       him across the plank.
                                   JACK
                    No?   What're they doin' then?
                                  DAVID
                    I think they're chasing you!
       Snyder and MacSwain huff out onto the roof. David,
       still uncertain, looks back at them -- the runs across
       the plank. Jack calmly topples the plank to the street
       as the pursuers reach it, gasping for breath -- he gives
       Snyder a little salute, then moves on to a rooftop exit --

26A    EXT. ANOTHER STREET (NEAR THEATER) - SECONDS LATER           26A

       The boys run out of a doorway onto the street; Jack
       stops, looks around carefully, as if expecting Snyder to
       come bounding out of the sky. David is bursting with
       suspicion -- starts to say something, but Jack shushes
       him, leads them quickly, furtively into --

26B    EXT. ALLEY BEHIND THEATER (IRVING HALL) - DAY                26B
       Jack runs to a side door and opens it, waving David and
       Les inside. He follows, giving a quick look around
       before he closes the door.

26C    INT. THEATER - BACKSTAGE                                     26C

       MUSIC lilting somewhere -- for a moment we don't know
       we're in a theater, as the boys huddle against a wall,
       catching their breath.

                   I want some answers -- Why was he
                   chasing you? What's the Refuge?
                                 JACK
                   The Refuge is this jail for kids.
                   That guy, Snyder, he's the warden.

                                 LES
                   You were in jail...?   Why?

                                 JACK
                   I was starvin'. I stole some food.

                          (suspicious)
                   Right, food. He called you

                   truth.' Why was he chasing you?

                                 JACK
                   Because I escaped.

                   of him?
      David starts to reply when he sees something behind Jack             *
      that makes his mouth drop open. At the top of a short                *

      She descends the stairs grandly, shooing them away like
      pigeons. Jack turns to her and grins.
                                 JACK
                   You wouldn't kick me out without
                   a kiss goodbye, wouldya, Medda?
      Surprised, she gasps in delight -- throwing her arms
      around Jack. David can't believe it. Medda's accent
      quickly disappears.
                                 MEDDA
                   Kelly, where've you been, kid?

       Les is looking green from all the candy as he follows
       Jack and David, balancing on trolley tracks. In the
       distance, the FAINT sound of SHOUTING/SINGING.

       word of what he's saying; seeing how much he wants it to
       be true... The SINGING grows LOUDER, the haunting
       refrain of "Seize The Day," as the boys continue --

     Down the street, a trolley is in flames, surrounded by a
     mob of shouting men. David looks at it nervously.

               Why don't we divvy up at my

               Scabs!   Soak the scabs!   Etc.

     A conductor with a bloody head and terrified face runs

     Jack nods awkwardly, starts to say something when SARAH,

     piecework. She's beautiful -- Jack becomes instantly
     tongue-tied.

                  That's Sarah.    My sister.

                  Catchy words -- like, uh, 'corpse'
                  or 'maniac,' or, let's see, 'love
                  nest' or 'nude' --
     Sarah and David giggle; Esther looks shocked.

                  that cake your mother's been

                  That's for your birthday tomorrow!
                                MAYER
                  I've had enough birthdays!    This
                  is a celebration!
     David leaps up to fetch silver; Sarah gets a luscious
     chocolate cake from a cabinet --
                                DAVID
                  It's only the beginning -- the
                  longer I work, the more I'll make --
                                MAYER
                  You work only until I go back to
                  the factory! Then you go back to
                  school, like you promised.

     All activity stops, an awkward silence.       Mayer looks at
     his bandaged hand.
                                MAYER
                  It will heal... they'll give me
                  back my job... I'll make them...
     Jack sees how worried the family is.       No one seems able
     to speak, then --

                                LES
                         (in his sleep)
                  'Gimme all ya got, baby...'

     The family is shocked -- except for Jack and David, who
     sputter into laughter. The celebration is restored --
     Jack digs into an enormous slab of cake, looking around
     at the smiling faces, for the moment feeling he
     belongs...

      Jack and David talk; the family visible inside.

                               JACK
                 How'd your pop get hurt?
                               DAVID
                 The factory. An accident.
                        (bitterly)
                 He's no good to them anymore so
                 they just fired him. He's got no
                 union to protect him.

      Inside, Esther is singing a lullaby to Les; Mayer calls
      out to David.

                                MAYER
                 David?   Time to come in now.
      Jack looks in at the warm family tableau: the lullaby,
      Sarah reading to Mayer. David, going in, sees his
      friend's expression.
                               DAVID
                 Why don't you stay here tonight...?

      Jack watches as David rejoins the family inside, the
      warmth, the casual intimacy. He moves off, singing:

      smiling man and woman beam down at a small boy in a
      cowboy hat -- it's Jack, about Les's age, with his

                  price to the distribution
                  apparatus.
     Exasperated, Pulitzer looks to Seitz for a translation.

                  You mean the Newsies...? Charge
                  the Newsies more for their papers?
                  Bad idea, Chief.
                                JONATHAN
                  Very well. My next proposal --
                  salary cuts, particularly those
                  at the very top --
                                PULITZER
                  Wait. What  do the Newsies pay
                  now -- fifty cents per hundred
                  papers? If  you raised it to
                  sixty cents --

                                JONATHAN
                  A mere tenth of a cent per paper --

                                PULITZER
                  -- then that, multiplied by forty
                  thousand papers a day, seven days
                  a week -- well, it would pay some
                  of the bills around here.

                                SEITZ
                  Chief, if you do this, every
                  Newsie we got will head straight
                  for Hearst.

                   Not necessarily. As newspapermen,
                   Hearst and I would cut each other's
                   throats to get the best of the
                   other. But as businessmen -- and
                   gentlemen -- we often agree on
                   ways to keep down certain operating
                   costs. If I know Willie Hearst,
                   he's going to wish he thought of
                   this himself.

                                 SEITZ
                   What about the other papers -- ?
                                 PULITZER
                   If we do it, they'll all do it.
                   It's only a tenth of a cent --
                   nobody gets hurt! It's good for
                   the Newsies -- an incentive, make
                   'em work harder, sell more papers!
                   Now get me Hearst on that
                   contraption.
      Seitz sighs and reaches for the phone.

      Jack bounces into the square, still   basking in the glow
      of last night. He looks up to the    chalkboard and sees
      the headline: "BLOODY BEATINGS IN    TROLLEY STRIKE!"
      He grins, gives the high-sign -- a   very salable headline.

        It don't make no sense!
        All the money Pulitzer
        makes, why would he gouge us?
      Jack sees Weasel behind his window, grinning.

      He plops fifty cents on the counter.      Weasel's grin
      gets weaselier as he slides it back.

                   We ain't scared of Brooklyn. But
                   Spot Conlon makes us a little
                   nervous.

      David looks up; Jack grins, challenging him.       David comes
      right back at him.

      Jack looks at the huge doors of the World Building,
      steeling himself. He starts for them, then has a thought
      -- beckons to Les, who runs to join him, thrilled.
                                 JACK
                   Maybe the kid'll soften him up a
                   little.

      Shouting encouragement, the Newsies clear a path as Jack
      and Les march up to the big doors. Jack pounds on them
      and there's a hush as everyone waits, watching -- including
      a handsome, well-dressed man in his thirties, BRYAN DENTON.

      The huge doors swing open like the mouth of a whale and
      Jack and Les disappear inside. The Newsies cheer.
      Denton moves next to David.

                   The Newsies' demands.   We're on
                   strike.
      Denton looks around, a little amazed.     He takes out a
      notebook.

                                 DENTON
                   I'm Denton, New York Sun.   What's
                   your name?

                   David.  As in David and Goliath?
                          (off at doors)
                   You really think old man Pulitzer's
                   going to listen to your demands?
                                DAVID
                   He has to.

      At that instant, the big doors swing open and Jack and
      Les are spat out like two seeds.
                                 JACK
                          (yelling back)
                   So's your ol' lady! Tell Pulitzer
                   he needs an appointment with me!
      The doors slam shut; Denton scribbles, intrigued.


49    INT. NEWSPAPERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY                           49

      Jack, David and Les devour a tray of sandwiches as Denton
      takes notes. Newsmen at other tables glance over
      curiously as Jack holds forth.

      Denton smiles, closes his notebook.    Gets up, handing
      David a card.
                                 DENTON
                   Keep me informed -- I want to
                   know everything that happens.
                                 DAVID
                   Are we really an important story...?
                                 DENTON
                   What's important? A year ago I
                   covered the war in Cuba -- charging
                   up San Juan Hill with Colonel Teddy
                   Roosevelt. A very important story.
                   Now it doesn't seem so important --
                   except Teddy's our governor and
                   probably on his way to the White
                   House. Is the Newsies' strike
                   important? It all depends on you.
                                  JACK
                           (stopping him)
                   My name really gonna be in the
                   papers?
                                 DENTON
                   Any objections?

                                 JACK
                   Not as long as you get it right --
                   Kelly, Jack Kelly. And, Denton?
                   No pictures.

      Denton smiles and shrugs.    David suspects Jack's thinking
      of Snyder.

50    EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE (MATTE SHOT - BROOKLYN SIDE) - DAWN 50
      Jack, David, Boots are walking as we WIDEN OUT to reveal
      the magnificent bridge against a dawn sky. They all seem
      a little nervous.
                              DAVID
                I've never been to Brooklyn --
                have you guys?

                Spent a month there one night.

                This Spot Conlon... is he really
                as bad as they say...?

      Jack and Boots look at each other and laugh; they keep
      laughing as they walk along --
                              DAVID
                I say something funny? Come on,
                tell me -- he bad or not? What's
                the joke? Tell me, willya? (Etc.)
      We KEEP WIDENING as the figures get smaller and Jack and
      Boots keep laughing and David keeps asking about Spot...

55     EXT. BROOKLYN WATERFRONT - DAY                               55
       On a rotted and collapsing pier is a battered sign:
       "BROOKLYN EXCURSIONS - CLOSED." Hunched under the pier
       is a tough kid playing a harmonica, his eyes fixed on --
       -- Jack, Boots, David as they cautiously approach through
       the no-man's land of mud and junk. Boys appear like
       hostile Indians -- behind them, to the side of them, in
       front of them -- silently escorting them under the pier.
       David looks very nervous as they are halted, and the
       harmonica plays a signal, then stops abruptly.

       From behind some rotting timbers steps a freckled gnome.
       He looks them up and down, then grins. He is SPOT
       CONLON.
                               SPOT
                 If it ain't Jack be nimble, Jack
                 be quick.

       Jack meets his challenging grin with one of his own.
                               JACK
                 You're movin' up in the world,
                 Spot -- got a ocean view and
                 everything.
       Spot and Jack exchange "heh-hehs."   David's getting more
       nervous.

                               SPOT
                 So I'm hearin' things from little
                 birdies in Harlem and Queens and
                 all over. They're chirpin' in my
                 ear: 'Jackie-boy's Newsies are
                 playin' like they're goin' on

                 strike -- it's --

       Spot's eyes click like switchblades in David's direction
       -- so do his henchmen's.

                  listen. Tell 'im, Davey.

     David looks at Jack wide-eyed: "Me?" Scared to death,
     he starts -- as Spot's henchmen begin circling him like
     jackals.
                                DAVID
                  Uh... we started the strike but...
                  we can't do it alone, so... we've
                  been talkin' to Newsies all over

                                SPOT
                  So they told me. And what did
                  they tell you?
     David looks nervously at the circling henchmen.
                                DAVID
                  That... they're all waiting to see
                  what Spot Conlon does. That you're
                  the key...

                          himself up; David
                          sees an opening)
                  That Spot Conlon is the most
                  respected and... famous... newsie
                  in New York... and probably
                  everywhere else...

     Spot signals the henchmen to stop circling; waits for
     more, lapping it up.

                                DAVID
                  And... if Spot Conlon joins the
                  strike, they'll join and we'll be
                  unstoppable so you gotta join and
                  ... well... you gotta...
     He trails off.    Spot nods, turns to Jack.

                                SPOT
                  You're right. Brains.
                         (hardens)
                  But I got brains, too -- and more

                    gotta show me.

       He turns and walks away. David and Boots exhale in
       relief -- but Jack suddenly grabs a rope hanging from
       the wharf and swings in front of Spot.

                                  JACK

                    afraid to join the strike.
       Murder's in the air: David and Boots are paralyzed;
       the henchmen are ready to explode. Spot's eyes are
       locked on Jack's for an excruciating moment -- then
       Spot grins.

       With a bucket of red paint, Crutchy paints a portrait of
       Pulitzer on an old bedsheet. Around him, Newsies roll
       hoops, play marbles, tag, leap-frog, etc. Looks like
       more of a holiday than a strike. Jack, David, Boots
       return from Brooklyn.

      He's waving the bedsheet with the scowling devil-mask of
      "Joe P" painted on it. Jack smiles as Crutchy parades
      with the banner, the other Newsies begin to notice.

      Across the square, Denton lounges with his notebook,               *
      studying the Newsies as if he, too, were concerned about           *
      how serious they are.                                              *
      David watches Crutchy parading with the bedsheet; other            *
      Newsies put aside their marbles, hoops, etc., and watch.           *
      Sensing a moment, David moves among them, beginning to             *
      sing:

59A   EXT. NEWSIE SQUARE/GATES - DAY                             59A
      MUSIC CONTINUES as the gates swing open and wagons loaded
      with papers, followed by the nervous non-striking
      Newsies, are revealed. Weasel and the Delanceys carry            *
      clubs...
                                                                       *
      -- Jack signals and Boots, Race and the boys loose a
      volley of rotten fruit -- With a shrill cry, the Newsies         *
      rush into the courtyard and leap onto the wagons --              *
      Denton watches nearby, writing it all down.
      David moves among the ranks of terrified non-striking
      Newsies, exhorting them --
                               DAVID
                 Throw down your papers!   Join the
                 strike! (Etc.)

      Many of them do -- ripping up their papers, shouting --
      -- The Delanceys slog through a storm of rotten fruit;
      cornering some Newsies by the wagons. They're raising
      their clubs when --
      -- Paint begins to dribble onto their heads -- they look
      up and the whole bucket is dumped in their faces by
      Crutchy. They lunge for him, dripping -- he ducks away,
      poking at them with his crutch --
      -- Jack and the others toss bundle after bundle of papers
      from the wagons -- they're torn to shreds, tossed in the
      air -- a blizzard of newsprint and then: SHRILL POLICE
      WHISTLES --

       The Newsies scatter through the snowstorm of paper as
       three mounted policemen gallop into the square --

       Crutchy, hobbling as fast as he can, falls -- a large
       hand snatches him up -- Morris, grinning through the
       paint. But no one notices as --
       The Newsies leap, cheering in triumph, through the drift-
       ing shreds of paper, as they vanish in all directions --

59B    INT. PULITZER'S OFFICE - MORNING                               59B

       He stands at the window with Seitz. Weasel hovers
       nearby, awestruck in the presence of Pulitzer.
                                  SEITZ
                    I don't think they're just going
                    to go away, Chief.
                                  WEASEL
                    Just give me the means, Mr.
                    Pulitzer. I'll take care of them
                    for you.
       Pulitzer turns his godlike gaze on Weasel, who seems to
       shrink slightly. Pulitzer studies him a moment.
                                  PULITZER
                           (to Seitz)
                    Give him whatever 'means' he
                    requires, I want this nuisance
                    over and done with.

       He looks back down at the square, where Crutchy's crude
       portrait of him, lying crumpled on the pavement, stares
       back at him.

                   stink -- 'cause that's how things
                   work. An orphan gets arrested,
                   Snyder gets him sent here to be
                   'rehabilitated' --

                   Snyder can steal.
                          (starts climbing)
                   He's here alright.

      David, looking around nervously, starts climbing after
      him.


64A   EXT. HOUSE OF REFUGE - ROOF - NIGHT                            64A
      Jack and David creep along above some large barred
      windows. Jack loops the rope around his waist, swings
      over the edge --


65    EXT./INT. HOUSE OF REFUGE/BUNKROOM - NIGHT                     65
      David watches from the roof as Jack taps on a window.
      An inmate, TENPIN, 9, looks up and grins.
                                  TENPIN
                   Cowboy!   Ya miss the joint?

                   The gimp?   I'll get him for ya.

      Jack takes a railroad spike from his belt and begins
      prying at the bars, talking conversationally up to
      David who's terrified someone's going to hear them.

                                 JACK
                   That's Tenpin -- s'posed to get

     rope.

     David pleads for silence.    Jack pries at the bars.
                                JACK
                  Go get your hat, Crutch -- kiss
                  Snyder good-bye.

                  Monahan hisself! Took him two
                  minutes to move me along to

                             JACK
               Later, Crutchy -- get your stuff.
     Crutchy stops Jack's hand prying at the bars.
                             CRUTCHY
               Listen, Jack... truth is, I ain't
               walkin' so good. Oscar and Morris

     he smiles, softens.
                             CRUTCHY
               It ain't so bad here. Get three

      Crutchy hears something and quickly shushes them: Jack
      disappears from the window; Crutchy slumps into a bunk
      and pretends to sleep -- just as Snyder comes into
      the room. Utter silence --

      -- except for Snyder's FOOTSTEPS as he walks slowly down
      the aisle between the bunks. He stops at the window, his
      back to it. Crutchy sneaks open his eyes to see --
      -- Jack, behind Snyder, swinging past the window, arms
      stretched in a balletic arabesque --
      -- Crutchy struggles not to laugh; Tenpin and some others
      see what's going on. They all fight laughter as --
      -- Jack swings back and forth behind Snyder, striking
      difference poses as he passes the window: the breast
      stroke, running on air, a bird with flapping wings...

      -- From the roof, David looks down in disbelief: then
      smiles -- nothing Jack does would surprise him any more.
      -- Snyder glares suspiciously at the boys, sensing
      something is going on. Behind him, Jack floats past
      as an angel -- Snyder wheels around, looks --
      -- but the window is empty. Puzzled, he walks out
      of the room. The instant he's gone, the boys explode
      in stifled laughter. We MOVE IN ON Crutchy as he
      laughs until the tears come...

                   What was he doing at the Refuge?
                                 JACK
                   Runnin' for governor. Showin'
                   his concern, like all pols during
                   elections.

                                 DAVID
                   Teddy's not like other politicians.
                   He's the biggest hero in the
                   country.
                                 JACK
                   Anyway, he's there. I see his fancy
                   coach waitin' for 'im, so I sneaks on
                   top of it. Teddy gets in and he's
                   wavin' goodbye, and all the guys are
                   wavin' goodbye, and Snyder's wavin'
                   -- 'Good-byeeee, Colonel Roosevelt!'
                   So just as we're goin' out the gate,
                   I stands up and --
                          (waves)
                   'Good-byeee, Warden Snyder!' It was
                   in the papes and everything.

                          (laughs; then)
                   He's governor now. I don't understand
                   how he could see that place and not
                   do anything --
                                 JACK
                   He only seen what Snyder wanted him
                   to -- good food, everything the
                   city pays for that Snyder usually
                   steals.

                                 DAVID
                   I'll bet if he just knew -- I mean,
                   he's a hero --
                                 JACK
                   Last year he was a hero.   This year
                   he's a politician.

       Weasel moves down a line of frightened young scab
       newsies clutching their papers. He stops in front of --

       -- a burly THUG, 20s, and behind him two dozen more, all
       clutching newspapers.

                 Okay, 'newsies' -- you check the

     SONG: SEIZE THE DAY explodes into full energy as Jack
     and David lead the Newsies across the square towards
     the gates.

     swing, fists flail -- the Thugs move the Newsies back,
     trying to box them in --
     -- Weasel and the Delanceys, backed up by other Thugs,
     are forcing Jack, David, Race, Mush, Boots and Blink into
     a tight circle. The boys fight back as best they can,
     dodging the brutal clubs and saps. As the circle
     tightens, Weasel's eyes are gleaming with gloat --

     Something seems to sting him in the neck -- he slaps at

     slapping -- all over the square, Thugs are slapping and
     looking around in puzzlement -- then --
     -- the BELL CLANGS as it's hit by a good-sized stone.

     Jack looks up as David points excitedly to the roofs
     where --
     -- It's Brooklyn to the rescue: Spot Conlon's gang is
     pelting the Thugs with volleys from their slingshots --
     and Spot himself is swinging through the air on a chain

               So, ya showed me! Now I'll show

     He looks pointedly at a group of reporters leaving the
     restaurant, shame-facedly averting their eyes.
                                DENTON
                  -- They can just ignore you until
                  you go away.
                                JACK
                  We ain't goin' away.   We'll never
                  go away.
                                DAVID
                  That's what we gotta show 'em --
                  we gotta do somethin' they can't
                  ignore, somethin' big --
                                JACK
                  We'll do it up big, all right --
                  We'll show 'em we ain't tired, or                      *
                  bored, and the hungrier we get,
                  the more we fight --
                         (as Denton starts
                          writing)
                  We'll have a rally -- every Newsie                     *
                  in New York -- and we're gonna send                    *
                  a message: there's a lot of us and
                  we ain't goin' away -- we'll keep
                  fightin' until doomsday if it means
                  gettin' what's ours!

     His eloquence is spellbinding; the Newsies are silent,
     looking at him with new respect. Then, from somewhere,
     there is a smattering of APPLAUSE. They look to see --

     -- At the door,      the group of reporters applauding --
     guilty applause      maybe, but still applause. One of them
     takes a dollar      and puts it in the box marked NEWSIES
     STRIKE FUND --      another follows suit, then another, and
     another...

     Jack and the Newsies watch -- then Jack begins to applaud
     the reporters. The Newsies join in, clapping, whistling,
     as the reporters hurry out, feeling a little better about
     themselves.

       SNYDER pops a messy eclair in his mouth -- from a large
       platter of them -- as he glances at the New York Sun.
       Crutchy, with a featherduster, is eyeing the eclairs
       when he sees the picture in the Sun.
                               CRUTCHY
                 That's Jack -- ! Hey, he looks
                 just like hisself!
       Snyder looks at the picture:    instant recognition.

                               SNYDER
                 You know this boy...?

                 'Jack.'... Do you know where he
                 lives...?
                               CRUTCHY

                 This brain of mine, always makin'
                 mistakes. Got a mind of its own.
       He hobbles out quickly.    Snyder looks at him, eyes
       narrowing.

                   It's not the money. I depend on

                   our necks on the line -- all we

      Mush painstakingly charcoals "NEWSIES RALLY -- IRVING
      HALL" on a piece of cardboard. Newsies are scattered in
      the lobby making handbills, signs, posters. Kloppman
      comes in and stops short, seeing a dark figure at his
      counter, going through his register.

                              KLOPPMAN
                Can I help you?
      The figure turns -- Snyder smiles his smarmy smile.

                Do you have a 'Jack Kelly'
                registered here? I wish to see
                him.

      The boys look up, alert.   Kloppman dislikes Snyder on
      sight.
                              KLOPPMAN
                'Jack Kelly...?' Any of you boys
                know a 'Jack Kelly'?

                  Prob'ly not the same guy.

      Behind Snyder, they see Jack bouncing in the front door.
      Racetrack tries to signal him --

                -- He was here but he put an egg
                in his shoe and beat it.
      Jack sees Snyder -- but instead of running back out the
      door, he can't resist mocking him behind his back. The
      Newsies snicker; Kloppman is dying.
                              SNYDER
                I have reason to believe he's an
                escaped prisoner. Possibly
                dangerous.

      He tries to move Snyder away, silently imploring Jack to
      go -- but Jack takes his time, picks up a leaflet, elabo-
      rately approves it, pockets it and strolls out, blowing
      good night kisses. The Newsies crack up -- Snyder wheels
      around suspiciously. Racetrack thrusts a leaflet in his
      face.

                   mista?

      Snyder tries to look around the leaflet -- then it
      catches his eye: "RALLY AGAINST PULITZER." He takes it
      thoughtfully, making a connection. Smiling dangerously,
      he digs out a penny and drops it in the surprised
      Racetrack's hand.

      the window and breathes in the morning air. Then she

      They're smiling, their faces close; for an instant, a
      kiss seems inevitable. But suddenly a gust of wind
      catches the leaflet and sails it off the rooftop. Jack
      lunges for it -- knocking over the milk, squashing the
      bread with his elbow. He looks up at her sheepishly.

      Another leaflet reading "RALLY AGAINST PULITZER" (the one
      Snyder took at Kloppman's) is in Pulitzer's hands as he
      listens to MAYOR VAN WYCK, very nervous. Nearby is
      POLICE CHIEF DEVERY.

                   Of course the city is very
                   concerned that this, uh, event
                   doesn't get out of hand, but...
                   Chief?

                   We can't just charge in and break
                   it up, Mr. Pulitzer -- we got no
                   legal cause.
      Pulitzer looks as if he knows something they don't.

                  Would the fact that this rally is
                  organized by an escaped criminal
                  be cause enough, Mayor?

                  prisons, Mayor -- a convicted
                  thief who's been at large for some
                  time under the alias of 'Jack
                  Kelly.' His real name is...?

     Snyder slinks out of a corner, humble in such august
     company.

                  You know Warden Snyder, don't you,
                  Mayor? I believe you appointed
                  him.
     The Mayor nods ruefully; not one of his best appoint-
     ments.
                                MAYOR
                  If this boy is a fugitive, then
                  the chief can quietly arrest him
                  and --

                  Not quietly -- I want an example
                  made. I want this rabble he's
                  roused to see what happens to
                  those who dare to -- well, they
                  should see justice in action.
                                MAYOR
                  Arrest him at the rally?   But...

                                PULITZER
                  By the way, Mayor, I'm having a
                  few friends for cards that night
                  -- newspaper friends, Willie
                  Hearst, Gordon Bennett. Perhaps

      the seal on a deck of cards. The Mayor is next to him.
      The room is cavernous, austere.

       The happy song roars inside the theater as the mounted
       police begin to form a half-circle around the entrance.
       A paddy wagon clops up and some foot police dismount,
       among them Officer MacSwain whom we met before.

      The SONG fills the hall as Jack, happy and proud, sees
      Sarah smiling at him, reaches out his hand and pulls her
      on stage. David is watching this when someone signals
      him -- Denton, who points his finger at --
      Snyder    edging closer to Jack, checking the time on his
      pocket    watch. He has something in his  hand -- a tin
      police    whistle. He puts it to his lips  and is about to
      blow it    when Denton moves up behind him and --
                                DENTON
                  Aren't you Warden Snyder?
      Snyder nearly swallows the whistle --

                                DENTON
                  I'm Denton of The Sun. I've heard
                  about your work with young people.
                  I wonder if you'd agree to an
                  interview?
      Snyder blinks at him, glances at his watch, then lowers
      his police whistle, smiling modestly.


      ON STAGE
      David tries to move to Jack to warn him but Race and the
      others have formed a chorus line and drag him into it.
      David shouts over the song --
                                 DAVID
                  Jack -- you've gotta get out of

                           his ear)
                  Snyder!

      Jack can't hear over the song but Snyder does --

                         (interviewing)
                  Is it Snyder as in 'snide'?
      Furious, Snyder blows the police whistle for all he's
      worth. Instantly police burst in from every door -- all
      converging on Jack. Immediately he leaps off the stage
      into the arms of several boys below -- then fights his
      way out the front door --

       -- the mounted police form a half-circle cutting him
       off -- and from behind them, Weasel, the Delanceys,
       and the Thugs move through the horses towards him.
       Jack has no choice -- he turns and races back into --

       stumbles around as David hangs on in a wild piggyback
       ride. A cop pulls him off and hurls him to the floor --
       -- Sarah screams, seeing what's happened to David --
       Les, sobbing, kicks furiously at the cop's leg. Sarah
       pulls her little brother away as --

       swinging. The Newsies scatter, try to escape -- but at
       each exit door more cops are moving in --

       thug cracks him on the head and he staggers, bloodied...

       He turns to see Weasel and   the Delanceys grinning at him,
       clubs in their hands. They    start toward him and suddenly
       disappear -- straight down   the trap door that's suddenly
       opened beneath their feet.    Jack sees Spot at a lever in
       the wings --

       Cops leap for Jack's legs as he rises above them heading
       up into the flies. He hangs on, thrusts one fist into
       the air and shouts --

       the dressing room stairs. MacSwain nabs him, they're

                    children, maybe you'd like to try
                    a lady next.
       Confused and intimidated, the Irish cop looks at her --
       then ducks his head shamefacedly and moves away.

                                  MEDDA
                    Run, David, hurry --

                    They got Jack --
                                  MEDDA
                    You can't help him if you're in
                    jail, too! You were right, David
                    -- you've got to keep fighting
                    them -- always.
                           (kisses him)
                    Now go. Please.
       David looks at her, very moved, then goes. She turns
       back to her theater -- the sounds of the melee sweep over
       her. She watches, tears welling in her eyes...

116   INT. COURTROOM - MORNING                                   116
      A dingy room filled with dusty light.   A BAILIFF
      announces --

                              BAILIFF
                Awrise, awrise, court is now in
                session, Judge E.A. Monahan
                presiding.

      Weasel is in the gallery as JUDGE MOVEALONG MONAHAN,
      hungover, winding a pocket watch, takes the bench and
      glances down at a group of battered Newsies, including
      Spot, Race, and Boots.
                              MONAHAN
                Any of you represented by counsel?
                No? Good. That'll move things
                along considerably.
      David sees Denton come in, a neat bandage on his head.
                              SPOT
                Judge Movealong, ya honor, I object.
                              MONAHAN
                On what grounds?
                              SPOT
                       (proudly)
                On the grounds of Brooklyn, ya honor!
      The Newsies congratulate Spot.    Monahan gavels.
                              MONAHAN
                I fine you each five dollars or
                two weeks confinement in --

                   you. We have to talk.
                                 RACETRACK
                   Talk and eat, right? On you, huh,
                   pal?
      They laugh and clap his shoulders as he looks uncomfort-
      able. Suddenly David gasps, seeing Jack led out in
      shackles, his face bruised and swollen. Everybody
      stares, horrified.
                                 JACK
                   Hiya, fellas! Hey, Denton --
                   guess we made all the papes this
                   time, huh? How'd my picture look?
                                 DENTON
                   None of the papers covered the
                   rally. Not even The Sun.
      Jack is stunned, David bewildered, as Denton turns
      abruptly and leaves the courtroom. The Bailiff shoves
      Jack in front of the bench. Snyder slips in from a side
      door.

                                 SNYDER
                   This boy's real name is Francis

                   convict in the state penitentiary --

      David, the Newsies, are stunned as Snyder continues.
                                 SNYDER
                   He is currently an escapee from the
                   House of Refuge, where his original
                   sentence of three months for theft
                   was extended six months for
                   disruptive behavior --

                          (fighting tears)
                   -- Last time wasn't no attempt,
                   remember, Snyder? Me and Teddy
                   Roosevelt wavin' bye-bye --
                                 SNYDER
                   -- Therefore, I ask that he be

                                 JACK
                   -- For my own good, right,
                   Movealong? -- and for what Snyder
                   kicks back to ya --
                                 SNYDER
                   -- And that the court order his
                   incarceration until the age of
                   twenty-one --

           (on their feet)                  -- In the hope that we
        No! You can't do that!              may yet guide him to a
        No! Etc.                            useful and productive

      The Newsies shout angrily as Jack is led away,
      struggling. Weasel slips out the door, smiling.

      David, Spot, Race, Mush, Boots, Blink pick dispiritedly
      at a plate of knockwurst. Les, hungry as always,
      finishes a large sausage and takes another as he listens.

                He won't be there long -- the jail
                ain't built that Jack can't bust

                gotta keep the strike going, just
                like Jack was here.

                       (the sad truth)
                Yeah, but Jack ain't here.
                              RACETRACK
                We know that, genius -- if he was
                here, he'd be tellin' us what to
                do when he ain't here.

      expression.

                   Denton, what's happened -- you get
                   fired or somethin'?

      Denton forces a breezy tone.

                   Reassigned -- back to my old job

                   The owner thinks I should be

                   stories. So wish me luck, boys.

                   They bought you off... didn't they?

                   paper to write for.
      He looks at David; hurt, betrayed, angry; wishes there
      was more he could say. He hands him something from his
      coat.
                                 DENTON
                   This is the story I wrote about
                   the rally. I want you to read
                   it at least.
      He hands it to David and   goes. David returns to the
      others, angrily crumpling   the story and hurling it onto
      the table. The boys look    puzzled; Les, still eating
      the sausage, picks up the   story and looks at it
      curiously.

       David leads Spot, Blink, Boots, Mush, Race as they crouch
       and creep along the wall. Spot carries a rope. David
       looks up, searching for a window. Indicates one.

                                  DAVID
                    That's where we saw Crutchy...
       He starts to throw up the rope when Boots hisses from the
       corner, beckoning furiously. They hurry over and peek
       around the corner to see --


120    EXT. HOUSE OF REFUGE - COURTYARD - NIGHT                      120
       A carriage is waiting. The boys watch as a door opens
       and two figures emerge. One is Snyder, the other is
       Jack. They get into the carriage and it starts toward
       the boys -- who quickly duck out of sight as it CLIP-
       CLOPS past and enters the street.
                                  MUSH
                    Where they takin' him...?

                    One way to find out.   Meet me back
                    at the square!
       David runs after the carriage, leaping onto its back. He
       flashes the high-sign to the boys as the carriage moves
       off into the night.

       David hangs on to the back of the carriage, peering
       around to see some huge stone gates as it moves into a
       circular drive and stops. He sees a figure waiting:

      A butler leads Seitz, Snyder and Jack across a marbled
      floor, their FOOTSTEPS ECHOING in the luxurious hall.
                                 JACK
                   Very impressive. So where do they
                   keep the trains in this station?
      Seitz shows   him into an elegant library. Snyder tries to
      follow but   Seitz stops him, closing the doors. Inside,
      Jack looks   around to see the imposing figure of Pulitzer
      staring at   him, framed by luxurious furnishings. For a
      moment, the   two just stare at each other. Then --

      The Driver strolls around the rear of the carriage --
      just as David slips beneath it and begins to crawl care-
      fully toward the front. Finding the lynch-pin that
      hitches the horses to the carriage, he reaches for it --
      just as the horse snorts and pulls the carriage forward a
      few steps. The Driver hurries back to the reins. With
      the Driver's boots a few inches from his face, David
      waits for another chance...

                                 JACK
                   I heard of it. You win?

                                 PULITZER
                   People think wars are about right
                   and wrong. They're not. They're
                   about power. You know what power

                                 JACK
                   Heard of that, too.   I don't just
                   sell ya papes, Joe.   Sometimes
                   I read 'em.
      Pulitzer ignores the impudence, continues quietly.
                                 PULITZER
                   Power means that I could see to it
                   that you serve your full sentence
                   at the Refuge. Or I could pull
                   strings and have you free tomorrow.
                   It means I could give you my
                   pocket change -- and you'd have
                   more money than you'd likely ever
                   earn.

                   the compliment, but I ain't got
                   the power to stop the strike --
                                 PULITZER
                   I disagree. You're the spirit of
                   the strike, without you, they'd
                   fall apart in a few days.

                   is that you return to your old

      David is hiding by the gates with the lynch-pin in his
      hand. Snyder is waiting by the carriage. The front door
      opens -- Seitz and Jack walk out and appear at the top of
      the entrance stairs. David calls out --

       Jack is surprised. He looks at Snyder and Seitz, pulls
       away from Seitz, slides down a bannister, and leaps to
       the ground. Snyder lunges for Jack, who manages to evade
       Snyder's reach.

       The driver whips the horse forward but is jerked off his
       seat as the carriage separates. The horse runs off.
       Amidst the confusion, David and Jack tear through the
       gates way ahead of Snyder.

       As Jack steps back into the light, the CAMERA WIDENS and
       we realize he's back in the House of Refuge. Jack begins
       to sing softly: REPRISE: "SANTA FE."

       Jack sits in a small dark room -- an isolation room;
       moonlight shines through barred windows; there's a door
       with a small serving panel in it.

       Jack looks up as the serving panel opens and Crutchy
       peers through, offering him something furtively: a
       boiled potato.
                                  CRUTCHY

                   The World -- don't scab, etc.
      David moves among them, looking like a leader now.

                                 DAVID
                   Nobody sells a pape today -- we're
                   hurtin' them and they know it!
                   Remember -- no soakin', no hittin'
                   -- etc.

      The gates open, the wagons start out, followed by nervous
      scabs flanked by cops and goons. The chant builds as the
      scabs parade by, then suddenly --

                                 SPOT
                   Look... I'm seein' t'ings... tell
                   me I'm seeing t'ings -- !
      David and the others look in disbelief -- walking with
      the scabs is Jack, wearing a tight new suit, flanked by
      Weasel and other goons. As Jack moves past, staring
      straight ahead, the chant dies...


                RACETRACK

        scabs...?

                   hisself. A special gift to a
                   special new employee. Only not

      Spot tries to bust through the goons but they hurl him
      back. David, confused, angry, runs alongside Jack,
      shouting across the smirking Weasel as they march
      along --

                   This is why you wouldn't escape
                   last night -- why'd you do it?
                   Talk to me, you liar! What else
                   did he give you to sell us out --
                   money? What else? Look at me!
                          (as Jack keeps
                           walking)
                   You lie about everything --
                   headlines, your family --

                   -- because nobody counts but you
                   -- nobody or nothing! Look at me.

      David lunges for him and Weasel grabs him, hissing.

                                 WEASEL
                   I'm gonna be lookin' for you,

                   -- or maybe you'd like a nice new
                   suit of your own.

      David twists away, tries to rally the Newsies.
                                 DAVID
                   Keep after them -- we don't need
                   him!
                          (starts the chant)
                   Stop The World -- don't scab! Etc.
      Some chant halfheartedly, confused, demoralized. A few
      toss down their picket signs in disgust. David moves
      among them, desperately trying to keep the chant going.
      The scabs move on, passing Les, who gives Jack a stricken
      look as he moves away.

                                 LES
                          (to himself)

                   spy on them or something...

                   That's it. He's spyin' on 'em.

      Mayer is removing the bandage from his injured hand,
      helped by Les. Sarah and Esther work on lace piecework.

                   That hand is not ready to work.

      He gets his coat; Sarah, looking for something, finds a
      stained paper package under a sewing basket.

      eaten knockwurst -- throwing the wrapping on the floor.
      Irritably Sarah starts to throw it away when she sees it
      has writing on it.

      stained papers.

                   It's Denton's story. 'The Dark

      David refuses to listen; he angrily steps out on the fire
      escape and stares off into the city. Sarah keeps reading
      to herself. What she reads disturbs her.

                 He will only be a minute.   Please,

       A policeman stands aside and Jack enters, in the new
       suit. Utter silence. The police escort him the length
       of the dorm and into --

       Jack goes straight to his hiding place and removes the
       box. He looks inside and is startled --

       -- a dead rat is inside the box, covered with tiny pieces
       of the photograph with his family. His money is gone.
       He tosses the box aside; his eyes hardening. The police
       escort him back into --

       stands holding a bundle of Jack's belongings: he shoves
       it into Jack's chest and does his Delancey routine.

       on him.

      an old printing press, junk, all covered with dust.

      He goes. The great PRESSES THUNDER heavily somewhere in
      the building above, like a judgment. Jack looks at the
      bleak room, buried in dust and noise.

      Jack ignores him, moves off with his papers. The
      Delanceys pass by; Morris grinning at him, bouncing a
      club in his hand.

      He stops to kibbitz a game of marbles in an alley.
      Sarah walks on -- suddenly a man steps in front of her.
                                 OSCAR

      She tries to step around him but Morris is there. He
      "accidentally" knocks her lacework into the gutter. Les
      sees it -- and races towards the Delanceys --
                                 LES
                   Get away from my sister!

      He flails at Morris -- who effortlessly shoves him flat
      on his bottom and turns, grinning, to Sarah.

                                 MORRIS
                   Where's ya brudder, tootsie?

                   You... stupid... ape!
      On "ape," she socks him square in the grin -- he recoils,
      licking a bloody lip. Behind him, she sees David
      rounding the corner --

      Oscar grabs Sarah from behind and lifts her up, taunting.
                                 OSCAR
                   Yeah, run, Davey! We got the best
                   parta ya family right here!
      David, furious, runs down the sidewalk towards them.
      Morris slips on some brass knuckles in anticipation.
      Sarah struggles, screaming --
                                 SARAH
                   David, no -- don't -- !

      Oscar hangs on to Sarah, enjoying himself -- suddenly,
      from behind, two hands grab the rim of his derby and jerk
      it down to the bridge of his nose. Blinded, he releases
      Sarah and staggers around, trying to pry the hat off his
      eyes. Les looks up to see --

                   Jack!
      Jack flashes him a grin        as he works on Morris's bread
      basket. Just as Oscar         frees himself from the derby,
      David leaps on him like        a fury. Punches fly and the
      Delanceys beat a quick        retreat down the sidewalk, yelling
      back --

                MORRIS
        Ya better run, cowboy --

                                             coward -- run!
      But they're the ones running. David, catching his
      breath, looks at Jack, beginning to understand.
                                 DAVID

                 Without you, the strike's falling

                               SARAH

       The others shush him hastily; MUSIC BEGINS as they
       go into --

166    INT. BASEMENT PRESS ROOM - NIGHT                             166

       Denton heads straight for the old press, checking it over
       expertly. Jack directs the others to ink, paper, etc.,
       as --

      Denton finds the type-

      ink the rollers. A NOISE

      his lips; hoists Les up to     WHO'S THAT?
      the window to be a lookout.

      sets a headline in very large type: HOW WE CAN SHOW

            press as they examine it proudly.

       C)   They fold and bundle the papers, happy but exhausted.

            Les as they pass him bundles of papers and he passes
            them out the window to --

       large caps and too-small coats, holding lunchpails...
       holding picks and shovels far too large for them...
       girls in shapeless dresses sewing, or scrubbing...
       shining eyes, dirty faces... sad expressions beginning
       to bloom into hope as they snatch and read the news that
       the headline proclaims as it whirls TOWARD us ON the
       SCREEN: HOW WE CAN STOP THIS CITY!

       We see that same headline across --

185B   INT. MANSION - BACK OF MAN'S HEAD - MORNING                185B

       as he reads the Newsie News at breakfast attended by a
       butler (the Rough Rider) in a khaki uniform. He's
       reading a headline: "HOUSE OF REFUGE, HOUSE OF SHAME"
       with a subhead beneath it: "SCANDAL HIDDEN FROM TEDDY
       ON VISIT." We glimpse a famous walrus mustache as the
       Man slams his fist on the table in anger. A figure steps
       INTO FRAME across the table: Denton.

                               DENTON
                 I thought you'd feel that way,
                 Governor Roosevelt.
                               TEDDY ROOSEVELT (MAN)
                 Dis-graceful, Denty! Those poor
                 boys -- and I did nothing!
                        (pure steel)
                 Until now!

       The Rough Rider snaps out a silk hat and a silverheaded
       walking stick. Teddy snatches them as if they were
       armor.

187    EXT. NEWSIE SQUARE - DAY                                   187
       Our Newsies look anxiously around the square, empty
       except for them. They take pains to conceal Jack among
       them.
                               MUSH
                 So when's the others comin',
                 Cowboy?

       Jack looks glumly at the empty square; at the gates of
       the World where Weasel and his goons are beginning to
       line up, clubs in hand.

      defeated.

      Then Les steps forward, a defiant look on his face,
      glaring at the goons beyond the gates. He sings out
      loud and clear --

      The SONG RESONATES in the golden dome; Pulitzer stares
      down at the crowd as the mayor, sweating as usual, waves
      the Newsies' paper at him. Seitz sits reading a copy,
      impressed, as Jonathan fields phone calls.

       Pulitzer glowers in suspicion at the telephone.

       The huge doors of the World Building open and Seitz
       marches out, flanked by guards. The crowd opens a path
       as he marches up to Jack and David.

       open as Seitz ushers them inside, closes the doors,
       leaving them alone. Pulitzer waits by the windows, a
       looming shadowy figure; sounds of CHANTING, SHOUTING
       floating up from below. David is awed by the palatial
       office, but Jack saunters coolly to the windows past --

                    You're going back to jail.
                                  JACK
                    Maybe. But you can't put every
                    kid in that square in jail. They
                    ain't goin' away, Joe.
                                 PULITZER
                    Neither am I. I can wait them
                    out. It won't be me that's hurt.

                                  PULITZER
                    I knew it. Whoever helped you

                    Not enough, Joe -- you gotta deal

                    All right, all right -- just say
                    the traitor's name. It's Hearst,

                    of the scoundrel whose press you

                    disgrace of the newspaper world!
                    Say his name, damn you!

       He thunders over them, eyes blazing in triumph. The
       boys say nothing, just smile up at him knowingly until
       at last the horrible truth begins to dawn and --

                    And Hearst and them other owners?
                    Maybe they don't have to know.
                    Depends.

       Pulitzer walks with stiff dignity to the window; from
       below, the FAINT CHANTING floats seems deafening to his
       ears.

      ready for action. They see several police moving into
      the square -- including a paddy wagon.

      The others nod agreement -- but where is he?   Then they
      see --

193   EXT. COURTYARD - GATES OF THE WORLD - DAY                   193
      Behind Weasel and the line of goons Jack and David are
      approaching, beaming in triumph. Seitz is with them.
      Les quickly slips through the bars, running to tell Jack
      -- but Weasel grabs him, shoves him back roughly --
                               LES
                Jack -- !   Jack -- !

      Weasel, surprised, sees Jack behind him.
                              WEASEL
                I don't know how he got in here,
                Mr. Seitz -- but I'll take care of
                him, with pleasure. Just say the
                word!

      A tomato hits him in the face; he turns to see Les wiping
      tomato juice off his hands.

                              LES
                He said, you're fired.
      Triumphant, Jack hoists Les over his shoulders:

      A huge roar goes up outside the gates -- they swing open
      and the Newsies swarm in, engulfing Weasel and the
      Delanceys -- trying to look like part of the gang -- as
      they rush to mob Jack and David. Jack spots Sarah --
      she's waving and pointing in alarm at something.

                                 LES
                          (remembers)
                   The bulls! Jack -- the bulls!
      Jack sees several police shoving through the crowd toward
      him. He quickly deposits Les -- turns to run and sees --
      -- Snyder right in front of him, hands behind his back.
      Jack spins away and right into the arms of --

                                 MacSWAIN
                   Easy, lad! You don't have to run
                   anymore -- not from the likes of
                   him anyway!
      Jack looks again and sees Snyder's hands are handcuffed
      behind him; two cops have him in custody. Denton is
      there, smiling.
                                 DENTON
                   We brought the Warden over to say
                   goodbye. Goodbye, Warden.

      Jack watches, amazed, uncomprehending,    as the cops move
      Snyder to the paddy wagon. As the rear     doors are opened,
      several boys pile out -- former inmates    of the Refuge,
      including Tenpin. As Snyder is loaded     in, the last boy
      is coming out, crutch first --

                   Who?   Your pal! Him!

      He points O.S. -- Jack turns to see --


      ELEGANT COACH
      parked across the square. A Rough Rider opens the door
      and a man leans forward -- a glimpse of silk hat and
      walrus mustache as Teddy Roosevelt raises his walking
      stick in salute to Jack across the square.


      BACK TO SCENE
      Jack is awestruck; so are the other Newsies gathering
      around. Denton moves up to Jack.
                                 DENTON
                   Governor Roosevelt's very grateful
                   that this problem was brought to
                   his attention. He'd like to offer
                   you a lift, anywhere you like.
                   This time, you ride inside.

      Jack looks at the coach, torn. Boots holds the bundle of
      belongings he gave him earlier. Suddenly Jack decides,
      snaps his fingers, Boots tosses him the bundle.

                                 JACK
                   Think he could drop me at the
                   train yards?

      Denton moves off toward the coach. David, Sarah, Les
      look stunned, dismayed -- Jack avoids their eyes. Behind
      them, the BELL RINGS, the circulation window opens for
      business -- a crowd of Newsies races to line up. The
      gang looks at them hungrily, eager to return the work.
      They look at Jack.

      He shakes; the others crowd around. David looks on, left
      out for the moment; Sarah and Les beside him.

      waiting coach, then holds out his hand to Les, who runs
      up and clings to him.

                    Maybe that's what scares me...
       Suddenly, the emotions are too much for him -- he turns,
       runs across the square, not looking back, racing towards

       holds him, as he and Sarah watch --

       -- Jack climbing into the coach, greeted by Teddy.          The
       door closes, the coach trots away. "SANTA FE" is
       underscored.
       As the coach moves off, the Newsies move up, waving their
