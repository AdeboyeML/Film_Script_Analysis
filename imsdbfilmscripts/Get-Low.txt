          1 EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT 1

          From a distance and through the trees we see a raging hell
          fire engulfing a small two story house. It burns and burns.
          Out of nowhere a man bursts through a second story window,
          lands hard and rolls to smother his burning clothes.
          He crawls away and staggers up and for a moment looks as if
          he might run back into the flames. But the heat is
          unbearable. He runs toward us then past us through black
          shadows. We cannot see his face,

          1A EXT. WINDOW - EARLY MORNING (WINTER 1930S) 1A

           Glass in a weathered window glitters with early morning sun.
           A rock shatters one of the remaining glass panes!

          2 EXT. YARD - EARLY MORNING/CONTINUOUS 2

           The rock thrower, TOM ( 10) is hightailing it away from an
          isolated Appalachian SHACK as the door bangs open, a shotgun
          barrel appears, and a chicken comes SQUAWKING out from under
          the porch!
          Thinking he's sure to be shot, Tom runs into the old barn!

          3 INT. BUSH'S BARN - EARLY MORNING/CONTINUOUS 3

          Panting in terror, Tom is hunkered down in strips of light,
          trying to see through the cracks. There is a loud SNORT and
          the huge face of some kind of beast suddenly appears at his
          shoulder.
          Tom jumps, panicked, just as a SHADOWY FIGURE creeps into the
          barn and levels a glinting shotgun at him!
          Tom freezes, bends over, and throws up!
          When Tom looks up, a ray of light reveals the half face of a
          fierce gray bearded man, FELIX BUSH. He is holding out a
          handkerchief to the boy. Shaking hard, Tom hesitates then
          takes it and wipes his mouth.
          Bush pushes open the door and gives Tom a sad look that the
          boy will never forget before waving him away.

          4 EXT. BUSH'S BARN - MORNING 4

          Looking back over his shoulder, Tom runs for the road. Two of
          his BUDDIES are already kicking up dust.
          BUSH (72) steps into the sun and watches the boy run off with
          a look of muted anger, sadness, and something much deeper.

          5 INT. BUSH'S BARN - DAY 5

          Bush enters the barn to check on his companion. MULE is older
          than Bush in mule years and just as gray. He wears an old
          mule blanket everywhere to keep out the cold. He fidgets
          nervously from all the excitement. Bush comforts him.

                         BUS H
          Just a boy, that's all.

                         6 SERIES: 6
          7 Bush rips down an old faded sign at the road and posts a 7
          fresh one:'No Damn Trespassing/Beware of Mule'. Bush checks
          the road in both directions. All clear for now.
          8 Bush splits firewood with powerful cleaving strokes. Mule 8
          dozes in the shade. Bush sees a Model-T approach and turn
          into his road, right past his new sign. He glances at his
          shotgun leaning against the shack.
          The Model-T comes to a shaky stop. A MAN climbs out, sees
          Bush swinging the axe and approaches with trepidation.

                         HORTON
          Mornin', sir.

                         BUSH
          Hard life if you can't read..

                         HORTON
          Pardon? I'm uh, Reverend Gus
          Horton, sir, how you doing?
          Bush stops his swing and turns and stares coldly at Horton.

                         BUSH
          Don't need saving, preacher.

          Uh, well, Mr. Wiley Starke has
          passed on, sir. His funeral is
          tomorrow and I thought you might
          want to know since..

                         BUSH

                         (SOFTLY)
          What got him?

                         HORTON
          Just got old, sir.

                         BUSH
          Yeah, well..
          Bush returns to chopping wood.
          Feeling awkward, Horton hesitates, starts for his car, stops.

                         HORTON
          Mr. Starke told me that you and him
          ran away from home when you were 6
          years old. Is that true?

                         BUSH
          I talked him into it.
          Bush doesn't turn, just keeps chopping.

                         HORTON
          Well.. anyway.. I.. alright..
          Horton shrugs, get in his car, and leaves.
           Bush strikes the log hard and a cleaved piece goes flying.

          9 EXT. CEMETERY - EVENING 9

          The loneliness of the empty cemetery is broken by Wiley
          Starke's fresh grave. The mounded earth is covered with
          beautiful flowers and wreathes, a loving send off from his
          family and friends. As we pan past the flowers and cards..
          we realize that the cemetery is not quite empty.
          Hunkered down nearby, Bush is as still as a gravestone,
          staring at the last resting place of his old friend.
          As Bush gets up to leave he stops abruptly and stands frozen,
          staring at a pot of YELLOW FLOWERS on a distant grave. Now he
          turns and walks quickly away in the opposite direction.

          Rain drums hard on the tin roof as Bush, soaked to the bone
          and shaking with chills, rummages through an old hat box by
          lamp light: Letters, news clippings and keepsakes. He finds
          what he's looking for: A PICTURE of a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN.
          She smiles at us from happier days. Realizing that he is
          raging with a serious fever, he tries to stand up only to
          collapse back on the bed.

          14 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - NIGHT 14

          Wrapped in his quilt and carrying the oil lamp, Bush moves
          slowly toward the barn. But he is so wracked with fever he
          has to stop. It stuns him that he can't go on. He never
          thought anything could stop him. Stuck in the rain with the
          shaking lamp sizzling, he stares into the forever darkness,
          the muscles in his jaw rippling in the pale light.

                         BUSH
          Well hell..

          15 INT. BUSH'S BARN - NIGHT 15

          Somehow he has made it. Sopping wet and shivering, Bush is in
          bad shape and knows it.
          Mule sees Bush and grunts anxiously as he rises.
          Bush blindly pours Mule some feed and the poor old thing
          snatches his first meal in days.
          Bush tries to think through the fever. He stumbles back to
          the door and swings it wide open so Mule can get out if Bush
          doesn't make it. Satisfied, he comes back and drops hard onto
          a pile of hay near Mule.

                         BUSH
          Always thought you'd go first..
          White as cotton, Bush stares into the lamp that is running
          out of oil, the light fading fast to darkness. Thoughts
          tumble through his mind, troubling him, stirring the dark
          waters of memory.

          PAN across the stillness of the foothills to the barn. The
          door is still swung wide open.
          Back from the brink of death, Bush emerges into the blinding
          sunlight. Mule is dozing in his favorite spot. He swings his
          big gray head over at Bush.

                         BUSH
          Ahh, don't look so disappointed.

          18 EXT. BUSH'S BARN - MORNING 18 

          Mule watches Bush heave a creaky old wagon out from behind
          the barn. Mule climbs up on all fours. Bush gets a set of
          reins and walks toward him. Mule starts to take a stroll,
          knowing what the reins mean.

                         BUSH
          You better not.
          Mule looks back, sees an apple in Bush's hand, and stops.

                         BUSH
          And coffee when we get there.

          19 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 19

          Old wheels creak and moan. Bush and Mule ease up Main street
          with the cart. PEOPLE try to catch a glimpse of the infamous
          recluse.
          Mule comes to a wearied stop, breathing hard. Bush climbs off
          the cart and walks Mule, ignoring the eyes upon him.

          20 INT. CHAPEL - DAY 20

          Reverend Horton, stoking the wood stove, hears FOOTSTEPS.

                         HORTON
          Oh! Hello..
          Horton comes to Bush but Bush ignores him and keeps
          critically looking around.

                         HORTON
          What can I do for you, sir?
          Suddenly BUDDY and KATHRYN ROBINSON (20's) enter from the
          vestibule with their new BABY. In their own world, and not
          realizing that there is anyone in the chapel, Kathryn picks
          some lint from Buddy's jacket. He catches her fingers and
          kisses them.
          Bush is transfixed by the loving moment.

                         BUSH
          I can wait.
          Buddy and Kathryn see Horton and double-take Bush. Buddy nods
          to Horton and he and Kathryn step back into the vestibule to
          give Bush and Horton privacy.

                         HORTON
          It's alright, have a seat.
          Bush sits down uneasily in a pew. Horton sits down in the pew
          in front of him and twists around to face him. The wintry
          light from the near window washes over them.

                         HORTON
          What's on your mind, sir?

                         BUSH

                         BUSH
          Down to business
          Bush reaches into his overalls and puts a balled-up wad of
          MONEY on the pew. Horton's eyes bulge.

                         BUSH
          Need a funeral.
          Horton looks up from the money.

          Buddy peers around from the vestibule, listening, curious as
          hell, until Kathryn pulls him back.

                          HORTON
           For you?
          (off Bush's impatient nod)
          You want to buy a funeral for you?

                         BUSH

          can help you get your affairs in
          order, arrange a service..
          Horton glances at the strange wad of money again.

                         BUSH
          What stories?
          Bush leans in and stares into Horton. It feels like
          everything in the world stops dead.
          Buddy peeks in again, this time Kathryn peeks too.

                         HORTON
          Just stories..

          into the pew and the money FALLS.
          Buddy stares wild-eyed at the big wad of money then drops
          back into the vestibule.
          Bush storms past Buddy, Kathryn and the baby like a hot wind.

          Bush heads off down the road on his wagon. Horton, Buddy, and

          them.
          Kathryn goes back into the church with Horton who is cooing
          at the baby. Buddy lingers, staring at Bush, thinking..

          21 EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 21

          Bush's wagon loaded with bags of feed and supplies, sits in
          front of the Diner.
          Bush is holding a big tin cup of coffee for Mule who is
          drinking it and loving it.
          Tom (the kid who threw the rock) comes from behind the diner
          with a full garbage can to empty into the big trash barrels
          on the back of an old pick-up truck. He sees Bush and
          freezes.
          Bush looks up and stares at him.
          The diner door snaps open and BONNIE (30's), Tom's mother,
          steps out. She sees Tom and Bush staring at each other.

                         BONNIE
          What are you doing, son?
          Now Tom is scared to death that Bush is going to tell on him.
          Bonnie doesn't like this staring match at all.

          Empty those cans in your daddy's
          truck and get back in here. Now.
          Finally Bush drops his gaze and lets Tom off the hook.
          Relieved, Tom heaves the can up into the truck. Bonnie
          hesitates then goes back into the diner just as...
          .CARL (30s), his sidekick, GARY, and two other MEN come
          across the street toward the diner. Gary sees Mule slurping
          coffee from the big tin cup.

                         GARY
          Look at that. A mule drinking
          coffee!

                         CARL
          Finally found somebody that likes
          Bonnie's coffee.
          As they move past, they see Bush standing there..

                         WORKER
          Ya'll better hush, that's old Bush.
          Carl eyes him. Gary and the others throw curious glances as
          they head into the diner. Carl stops.

                         CARL
          Hey..

                         (NO RESPONSE)
          I'm talking to you..
          Carl picks up a handful of gravel, tosses some over
          nonchalantly in Bush's direction. Bush ignores it.

                         CARL
          We know about you. You stay out of
          this diner. There's women and
          children here and we don't want you
          around them.
          Bush stands to mount up, never turning around.

                         CARL
          You better hear me. I see you here
          again, I'll.. Hey! Hey!
          Hearing the hollering, Tom looks up from the pick-up.
          Carl throws a stone, harder this time to get Bush's
          attention.

          But the rock misses Bush and hits Mule, startling him. Old
          instincts kick in and he has a VIOLENT FIT.

                         CARL
          Shit..
          Carl moves up to try and calm him..
          .as Bush tries to ease Mule down the cart hitch grinds a
          GASH in Mule's hind-quarter. Mule whinnies painfully, slowly
          surrendering.
          As Carl steps up, Bush yanks the BRAKE HANDLE off the cart
          and hits Carl in the chest. Air explodes from Carl as he
          gasps with pain. Before he can move, Bush hits him again in
          the same place. Carl wants to hit back but he has no air.
          Lightning quick, Bush steps back and hits Carl again in the
          exact same place.
          Carl falls like a bag of bones. He looks up and sees Bush
          towering over him with a terrible bottled up darkness in him.
          It has all happened so fast it feels like an awful dream to
          Carl.

                         TOM
          Daddy!
          Wild with fear, Bonnie and Tom run toward Bush.

                         BONNIE
          Stop it!! Get away!
          Gary, the Worker burst from the diner but see the brake
          handle in Bush's hand and slow down.
          Bush comes to himself, sees everyone staring, sees Carl in
          tears, and now Tom and Bonnie, trying to get him away..
          Gary and the others slowly move toward Bush. More patrons
          step out from the diner.
          Buddy races up, sees Mule bleeding, and eyes Bush as he grabs
          the reins and leads Mule down Main street, still holding the
          brake handle.

                         CARL

                         (GASPING)
          I'll kill him!
          Bonnie shushes him softly as Carl moans in pain.
          Tom stares after Bush, mirroring his father's hatred.

          23 INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY 23 

          An EMPTY CASKET, awaits its passenger in a small but
          serviceable funeral hall. Through the office door, FRANK
          QUINN sits at his desk, his head completely buried behind a
          paper that he shakes hard every few seconds. His feet are up
          on the desk revealing a pair of lovely burgundy silk socks.

          24 INT. FUNERAL HOME/OFFICE - SAME 24

           Frank's hand slips the flask next to his coffee cup into a
           drawer when he HEARS the front door open. But his face
           remains hidden as Buddy enters. Buddy is troubled by the
          fight.

          He puts the paper down and studies his socks.

          squints up at the old shack and doesn't like what he sees at
          all. Buddy opens his door but Frank doesn't.

          32 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 32

          As Buddy uneasily approaches the shack, he feels the
          beautiful stillness and mystery of the place. He KNOCKS
          timidly on the door, pressing an ear to listen.

                         BUDDY
          Hello?
          Nothing. He shoots a look back to the hearse - miles away,
          and knocks a little louder. Nothing. He inches to the window
          and peeks in one of the remaining glass panes then starts to
          slide away..

          CLICK.
          Buddy spins and discovers Bush standing on the ground behind
          him, his shotgun barrel pointed between Buddy's eyes.

                         BUSH
          Want to see in my house, do you?
          BOOM! Bush blows away several windowpanes and re-aims at
          Buddy's head.

          How's it look?

          .Quinn Funeral Home. I thought I

          Bush glances at his blown out window: 'Damn'. He lowers his
          gun, walks up onto the porch.

          Buddy looks desperately back at the hearse but can't see
          Frank. He doesn't know whether to run for it or not.

          Sit down.
          There is only chair at the table so Buddy dumps the glass off
          a small stool under the window and sits down low. The wonder
          of not being dead makes him look at everything with new eyes.
          On a window sill he sees a beautiful little CARVED MULE
          emerging from a block of wood.

          pieces covered with bacon and white gravy.

                         BUSH
          It's how you put things together,
          see? Some things go, some things
          never will. Indians said that
          everything spoke to them. That's
          how they made medicine and knew
          what to eat. Things talked to them
          clear as we talk. You believe that?

                         BUDDY

          If you don't listen you won't hear
          nothing.
          Bush puts the big skillet on the table and sits down.
          Buddy is so low he can look under the table and sees how the
          table legs run right into the top without screws or nails.

                         BUDDY
          Did you make this furniture, sir?
          Never seen any like it. Can't even
          tell what's holding it up.

          Magic.
          Buddy looks up. Bush is dead serious. The word lingers.
          Finally..

          Alright. Well. Sir, if you do want

          Buddy is caught off guard by Bush's lucid candor and finds
          himself automatically responding differently to him.

                         BUDDY
          There's two sides to every story.
          As Bush puts some rabbit on Buddy's old yellowed plate..

                         BUSH
          People say that. But they don't
          mean it. They think what they think
          and they don't want to know
          anything else.

                         BUDDY
          Yes, sir, but I think people are so
          scared of what they don't know that
          they make things up to feel better
          about it.

                         BUSH
          Like life after dying. Heaven.

          But I don't think we know the
          actual truth about much of
          anything. I know I don't. I'm just
          guessing most of the time.
          Bush gives Buddy a closer look and motions for him to try the
          rabbit. Fearing the worst, Buddy bends into the steam, takes
          a cautious bites and mutters with shocked surprise..

          I'd rather not.
          Bush eases forward, his eyes slit. The old Bush is back.

                         BUSH
          I rather you did.

                         BUDDY

          Well. When I was kid I heard you
          killed some men in a fist fight.

                         BUSH
          Is that all?
          Bush leans back stone-faced.
          In the silence, Buddy looks over again at the wondrous
          carving of the mule on the window sill, at the big ears and
          long face that are being born from the rough block. It makes
          him smile. But when he glances back, Bush is staring a hole
          through him.

                         BUS H
          What's your name again?

          Well, if I need you -- I know where
          you are.
          It sounds almost like a threat. It shorts Buddy out. He stops
          eating and realizes that Bush has taken another turn and that
          he's been dismissed.

          34 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 34

          Buddy heads to the hearse, glancing back over his shoulder.
          As he recalls his encounter, he stops, looking back at the
          shack. The old legend has gotten deep under his skin.

          Bush is on the porch, straining boiled herbs, grass, and bark
          into a jar. There is something not right with him and he
          knows it. While the medicine cools he looks out across the
          mountain and draws a deep breath.

          37 EXT. FUNERAL HOME - MORNING 37

           A well crafted live-in home doubling as a funeral parlor. A
          sign, 'QUINN FUNERAL HOME', hangs from the porch.

          Frank is looking a little hung over. Buddy walks in. Frank
          points at the phone and rolls his blood shot eyes.

          .state law requires.. No ma'am, we

          There is a loud KNOCK at the door. Buddy goes to get it.

          39 EXT. FUNERAL HOME/FRONT DOOR - DAY 39

          Buddy swings the door open. Bush is standing there. Buddy
          leans back unconsciously, not knowing what to expect.

          FRANK (O.S.)
          Well just for argument's sake,

          some kind, Ma'am for decency and

          Bush enters the Funeral Home. As Buddy starts to close the
          door, Bush catches it.

                         BUSH
          Leave it.

          40 INT. FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS 40

          Frank is still on the phone and pouring himself a drink from
          the flask into his coffee cup in the drawer.

                         FRANK
          Yes, Ma'am, but there's lots of
          natural things that aren't decent.

          He did what?! Good God. No, Ma'am,
          I didn't know that about your

          The phone goes dead. FRANK sighs as Bush walks in.

          Frank Quinn, Mr. Bush.
          Frank takes a quick swallow from his cup to fortify himself,
          then jumps up, smiling, and goes to Bush with his hand out.

                         FRANK
          Come in, come in, pleasure. Coffee?
          As Bush shakes Frank's hand, he stares into him, taking
          everything in, his bloodshot eyes, the wrinkled shirt beneath
          his suit, his breath. Frank feels downright naked.

                         BUSH

          desk. Buddy pulls up a chair.
          Bush reaches into his coat and pulls out the wad of hermit
          money and lays it on the desk. Frank does something
          phenomenal. He ignores the money.

                         FRANK
          How can we help you, sir?
          Bush gives Buddy a look, then looks back at Frank who
          steadfastly refuses to look at the ball of money.

          Frank and Buddy stand with Bush in a room dedicated to sales.
          Three caskets are lined up for display. All tanks.
          Bush steps up to a cheap cloth covered box, bangs it with his
          knuckles, and scowls. Frank points to a wooden casket.

          Solid pecan, steel handles..
          Bush eyes it, repulsed.

           That probably covers 4 counties..
           Bush shoots him a look. Frank shoots him a look. Buddy thinks
           about how great an outdoor life would be.

                          BUSH
          Then I want 4 counties worth of
           people at the party.

          Well, sir, the thing is, how would
          you get people to come and tell
          stories about you that I'm guessing
          might get them, you know.. shot?
          Bush scoops up the ball of money and heads out. Now all Frank
          can see is the money, leaving.

          As Bush starts out the open door, he nearly bumps into
          Buddy's wife, Kathryn, and MATTIE DARROW. Mattie is carrying
          Kathryn and Buddy's baby boy.
          Frank sees Mattie and flicks his hair back nervously and
          quickly brushes his teeth with his finger as..
          .Bush gives Mattie a glance and tries to be invisible.

                         MATTIE
          Felix?!
          Feigning deafness, Bush walks on. Sensing something, Kathryn
          takes the baby so Mattie can go after him.

                         MATTIE
          Felix! Say hello to me!
          Frank, eyes wide with surprise, mouths, "Felix?".
          Bush's shoulder hunch then fall as he turns. He looks into
          her, taking everything in. When he speaks his eyes and voice
          are soft.

                         BUSH
          Hey Mattie.
          Buddy comes out, surprised to see Mattie and Bush together.
          Frank walks up behind him and scowls. Kathryn steers them
          back inside to give Mattie privacy.

          So? We got to know.
          Kathryn shakes her head and goes back outside. FRANK has
          another look at Mattie then lets the curtain fall back.

          We have a plan. All we need is a
          little bit of your time.

          Frank, Buddy, and Bush ride in the front seat of the hearse.
          They are together but in very different worlds. They don't
          even look at each other when they talk.
          Buddy is lost in serious thought.
          Frank is preoccupied about the deal and driving too fast.
          Bush is scrunched up to the door. He is going much faster
          than he is used to going. He kinda likes it and kinda
          doesn't.

                         HIMSELF)
          I was thinking about your funeral
          party before I went to sleep last
          night and I think I understand it a
          little now. When I was a kid, my
          folks where killed in a bad car
          wreck and the people at the funeral
          home... they did the impossible as
          far as I was concerned. I don't
          know what I would've done without
          them. And I remember wishing that
          my mother and daddy were there to
          see how beautiful they made
          everything.
          Frank is hearing this for the first time and is shocked. Bush
          glances softly at Buddy then looks out the side window at the
          world rushing by too fast. All at once he gives in to it.

          48 EXT. TOWN STREET - DAY 48

          The hearse pulls up on main street. Frank, Buddy, and Bush

          Frank and Buddy rush in. The barber, an anxious Mr.
          Tollerude, pumps Bush's chair upward.

          Tollerude, a clear threat.

          Don't leave me naked.

          cut you want after we take your
          picture, I'll pay for it.
          Mr. Tollerude doesn't know whether to cut or not.

          Bush rips the bib off as Tollerude whooshes him to the floor.

          Bush is seated in front of a backdrop painted with a bridge,
          a swan, and a pond. The Photographer is trying to tidy up
          Bush without offending him. As he walks back to camera, Bush
          roughs himself up and looks truly wild.
          Buddy snickers. When the Photographer gets back to the
          camera, he cocks his head, what?!

          Mr. Tollerude, nervous as hell, brings Bush up from his
          reclining position and turns the chair to the mirror.
          Bush studies his well trimmed hair and beard for a moment.
          It's impossible to tell what his thoughts are as he looks
          into his own eyes.
          Buddy and Frank are in the mirror too, staring at him.

          decent black suit, pinned to be hemmed, and a plain white
          shirt, open at the collar. It is a startling change. But we
          still can't tell what he is thinking.
          Buddy is staring at him with honest disbelief.
          Frank is quietly trying to get Mr. Feldman to lower the price
          for the suit. He looks over and double-takes Bush.

          new shirts, puts them on the counter, gives Frank a hard
          look, and walks away. Frank looks down at the clothes, over
          at Buddy.

          Late night Poker. Cigarette smoke drifts into the air.
          Frank, Carl, Rev. Horton, Mattie, and RAY, a banker, are at
          the table. Ray has the untouchable presence of someone
          privileged which appears to be driving Frank up a tree
          tonight. Horton gathers up his winnings.

           for her. The loss of the hand is especially hard on Carl who
          has only a couple of dollars left.

                         RAY
          Oh yes. Buying him clothes, getting
          him a haircut..on credit.
          Frank shoots him a look.

                         HORTON
          Took out ads in a bunch of papers
          too, something about a party?

                         FRANK
          God, I love small towns.

                         FRANK

          "Felix" Bush.

                         CARL
          What the hell is a funeral party?

                         FRANK
          Hey, the man wants to be at his own
          funeral. What can I say? I'd like
          to be at my funeral so I could tell
          my ex-wife to kiss my..

                         MATTIE
          What makes you think she'd show up
          for you?

                         FRANK
          Because, Dear, vultures are
          constitutionally unable to ignore
          the dead.
          Mattie grins which delights Frank, no end.
          Horton stops counting his money and stares at Frank.

                         HORTON
          It's that big wad of money of his
          you're after.
          There is a crack in Ray's disinterest that he tries to hide.

          What money is that?

                         MATTIE
          Felix has money?
          Everyone is looking at Frank but he shuffles the cards.

                         HORTON
          He came to see me, wanting a
          funeral, had a big old greasy ball
          of money. Talked like he thought he
          could buy his way to heaven with
          it.

          Hearing that Bush wants or needs a real funeral Mattie is
          suddenly truly concerned.

          Horton shrugs. Frank notes the concern and doesn't like it.
          Carl coughs and his ribs make him break out into a sweat.

                         CARL
          I'll tell you one damn thing, ain't
          nobody gonna go to a funeral for
          that son of a bitch.
          Mattie gives Carl a look

          They might. He's inviting everyone
          who has a story about him to come.
          You could tell about him kicking
          your ass, Carl.
          Carl looks at Frank as if he wants to cold cock him.

                         RAY
          Old man is going to ride the Weird

          your back, Ray?
          (off his look)
          Yeah, probably not.

          I already know way more about

          you're broke.
          This is not about cards. It's a declaration meant to
          embarrass Frank in front of everyone. Frank feels their eyes
          on him as he starts to pull off his watch. Ray waves it off.

                         RAY
          Please. I've won that 4 times
          already.

                         FRANK
          It's who has it last that counts.

                         CARL
          Say what you want but if there
          hadn't been anybody there the other
          day he would've killed me. And I
          guarantee you it wouldn't have been
          his first time.
          It sounds true and everyone is quiet except Mattie.

                         MATTIE
          Everybody knows you started it.
          (off his glare)
          Don't look at me like that. I
          remember when you were born. You
          were the sweetest little boy. What
          is wrong with you?
          Momentarily shamed, Carl's face softens and we can see a
          better man there. He struggles to hold on to it but..

                         CARL
          I made a mistake. But there's a
          line.. and he crossed it.. and
          everybody knows that too. Ya'll go
          on and have a party with the devil
          for his money but I'll dance on his
          grave someday.
          Carl snatches his few dollars up and heads out.

                         HORTON
          You kind of hate to admit it when
          it comes to Carl but he's got a
          point. You don't know what Bush is
          doing. What if he just wants to get
          everybody in one place so he can
          turn his shotgun on them?

          I looked in his eyes. The truth is
          nobody knows what he's capable of.
          Maybe even he doesn't know.
          She looks into him. Frank starts to deal the cards.

                         RAY
          Go ahead and lay your watch down,
          Frank. But I am going to keep it
          this time, alright, on principle.

          different.

          The cards in your sock? Leave'em
          there.
          Everyone freezes. Ray shakes his head.

          What are you trying to pull now?

                         FRANK

          You cheat at everything you do.
          Even at the bank, you loan people
          just enough to get'em deeper in so
          you can foreclose on them.

          Stand up or I'll stand you up.
           Ray looks around the table and suddenly realizes that he is
           irreversibly exposed and alone. The sound of Frank's chair
          scraping the floor makes him jerk up.

          A tiny PLACE, cramped with radio gear.
          Buddy and Frank peer through a glass window into a small
          control booth.(We will cut back and forth between the glass)
          Buddy is having misgivings about being here. But Frank gives
          the thumbs up to the young WCGM ANNOUNCER in the booth, a
          hopeful kid with a smooth voice and dreams of the big-time.
          The Announcer hands Bush a set of headphones. Bush is wearing
          his new clothes and truly looks like a different man.
          Bush is puzzled by the headset. The kid takes it and clamps
          it onto Bush's head. He starts to yank them off then hears a
          song playing inside his head and loves it. But now the
          announcer cuts the record off and Bush scowls.

                         ANNOUNCER
          Friends, we have a treat for you
          today on WCGM. Our special guest is
          going to tell us about an event

          Well, you're a bit of a local

          about our interview. I've heard

          has a story about you to come and
          tell it. Is that right?

          The first stop on the tour is a small fenced grave site near
          the shack. Three grave markers with names carved into them:

          KEEPER, CHARLIE, MAUDE.
          Bush is squatting down staring at the markers. Mattie stands
          close beside him. Since his attention is elsewhere she looks
          at him in an unguarded way. Her mind is full of questions,
          old and new.

          Mattie and Bush walks side by side through the last of the
          glimmering light and shadows beneath the trees. It is a
          chilly and Mattie's cheeks are flushed. She is enchanted by
          the place. Bush tries to hide how winded he is..

          But suddenly she is lifted from the chair as if by strong
           ropes. She stares at the wall as she walks toward Bush's bed.
          Bush is stricken and white. He would stop her if he could but
          it is too late.
          She walks right up to the picture at the edge of the lamp
          light and stares into it as if it is a mirage that will
          disappear if she blinks.
          Finally she whirls and looks at him, her face a tortured
          mask. A strangled sob escapes her.
          He gets up and stands there staring at the floor.
          Suddenly she is moving toward him and then past him and out
          the door. Her shadow merges with the darkness. Bush stands
          with his head down, staring into oblivion.

          the hell? He looks up and sees more sacks dumped on the desk.
          Frank is grinning and ripping open envelopes from the sacks
          and each one has 5 dollars in it! Buddy looks down and sees
          even more mail sacks on the floor!

                         FRANK
          Jesus, kid!

                         BUDDY
          Yeah! But, but it's not our money.

                         FRANK
          Well yeah, no, but some of it's
          gonna be! We're putting this thing
          on!
          Frank rips open two more envelopes and dollar bills rain down
          to the floor. He's beside himself. Buddy eyes him warily.

                         BUDDY
          He should be here. I'm gonna go get
          him.
          They lock eyes. Frank finally tosses him the hearse keys.

          Buddy, Frank, and Bush are staring reverently at the money
          stacked across the desk and the full paper sacks all around
          the desk. Bush eyes Buddy who is still quiet.

                         FRANK
          I don't know exactly how much your
          land's worth but looks to me like
          you could get maybe 10 times that
          or more. I don't know what to do
          with it. I mean it's yours to do
          with what you want but I'm getting
          a little nervous about it. Never
          thought I'd see enough money to
          make me nervous. We should probably
          talk about the price for
          everything, the clothes, the ads,
          the food and drink for the party,
          the music.. our fee for everything,
          we'll be fair about that, I'm not
          worried about it.
          Bush is looking at Buddy who is looking across the room.

                         BUSH
          What do you think, boy?
          Buddy jerks, looks at Frank, at Bush.

                         BUDDY
          Money makes people do funny things.
          Frank scowls.

                         BUDDY
          I think you should probably put it
          in the bank, sir.

                         FRANK
          No! Ray is not..
          (off Bush's look)
          I mean, if it was my money I'd put
          it in a bank out of town so
          everyone didn't know my business.
          This bank here, you can't trust,
          that's all I'm saying.

                         BUSH
          Can I trust you?

          I don't see why..

          Hush.

                         FRANK
          I've sold horses, cars, houses,
          hell, pocket watches pinned to the
          inside of my coat. I'm not ashamed
          of it. I don't rob banks, don't
          cheat at cards, and I sleep all
          right the nights I sleep. What was
          the question..?

          They goddamn..
          He nods at the money and suddenly becomes the "other" Bush.

                         BUSH
          Take out for the expenses you've
          already had and give me the
          receipts. As the bills come in for
          things, give them to me and I'll
          pay them. Put this money in a box
          and the boy and I'll take it
          someplace in the morning. Whatever
          new comes in, keep it in the bottom
          of one of them ugly caskets in
          there 'till I come get it. After
          the party, name a fair price for
          what you've done and we'll settle
          up.

                         (WALKING OUT)
          I'll be at the car.
          After he's gone, Frank and Buddy stare at each other.

                         FRANK
          Is it just me or is he extremely
          fucking articulate when he wants to
          be?

                         BUDDY
          Not only that but something feels
          really wrong.

                         FRANK
          Hold on. I told you that you were
          working on commission..

                         BUDDY
          Yeah, but..

                         FRANK
          So whatever our end of this is, you
          get a piece.

                         BUDDY
          A piece?

                         FRANK
          Half. It could help set you up,
          Buddy. So whatever feels wrong is
          gonna feel right pretty damn
          quick,okay? We just have to close
          it out. From here on, watch me, do
          what I do, and we'll be fine.

                         BUDDY
          But..

                         FRANK
          He wants you to go with him to take
          this money somewhere which means
          that it's you he trusts. And that's
          fine because I trust you too. Just
          don't trust him, okay?

                         BUDDY
          I'm lost again.

                         FRANK
          Look, that funny feeling you have..
          I have it too. And it's not funny.
          So go along, be friendly, but
          that's it.

          There's a euphoria that comes with
          closing a deal, Buddy, and the
          bigger the deal, the higher you
          get. It's better than anything.

          But the critical time is just
          before it closes. It's like a
          witching hour and everything tries
          to come apart. We're not going to
          let that happen.

          All right.

          Now go.
          (as Buddy starts out)
          You know.. I always wondered why
          you wanted to work here. I thought
          you could do a lot better.
          (off Buddy's look back)
          I didn't know about your folks, I'm
          really sorry.

                         BUDDY
          Thank you.
          He goes on.
          Frank turns and flips through a large stack of bills,
          hungrily entranced.

          81 INT. BUDDY'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT 8 1

          Buddy's son is crying his heart out. Kathryn comes in
          unbuttoning her blouse, picks him up, sits down, slips her
          blouse off her shoulder, brings the boy to her breast and
          voila, his sorrow miraculously vanishes.
          Buddy appears in the doorway, his eyes soft with love.

          carnival out of a person's death, I
          don't know if it's right.

          other people do, Buddy, just you.

           A very determined little GIRL is working her way through a
           song on the piano that is unrecognizable in this form, even
           to her.
          Mattie sits just behind the girl with tears in her eyes, not
          really listening. On the table beside the piano is a stack of
          picture albums and old yellowed newspaper articles.

          Sitting in the hearse outside of Bush's shack, Buddy watches
          Bush get in the car with his shotgun. There is a big wooden
          box of money on the seat between them. Bush props his shotgun
          against it.

          How much further now?
          Bush waves him on. Buddy scowls then decides to get serious
          about this. He presses on the accelerator and the hearse
          takes off down the highway.

          Frank is hopelessly lost in a sea of envelopes. The phone is

          some Reporter is trying to take a picture through the front
          window. Frank scowls and lowers the blinds.

          when he knocks. In seconds, Mattie appears.

                         FRANK
          Hey Mattie.
          He looks almost boyish and bashful as he drinks her in.

          To who?

                         BUSH
          You can say "hi".
          Bush gets out. Buddy sighs, mimes "Hi" and gets out.

          92 INT. ILLINOIS CHURCH ENTRY - AFTERNOON 92

          Buddy quietly creeps in through the front door, looks back
          over his shoulder, scowls, and enters the church.
          93 He stops and looks around, awed by the beautifully serene 93
          sanctuary.
          Now he sees a tall BLACK MAN (70) come out of an office door
          behind the pulpit, walk up the aisle, glancing out the window
          at the driveway, and then at Buddy.

                         BUDDY

                         CHARLIE
          Hello.
          Buddy is out of words that he is allowed to say. He glances
          at the door but Bush is not coming in.

          Hi.
          Charlie holds out his hand, Buddy shakes it.

                         CHARLIE
          Are you sure you're in the right
          place? Not expecting a funeral.
          Suddenly Bush steps into the church. Charlie squints over
          then stares at Bush with utter disbelief.

                         CHARLIE
          Felix?!

                         BUSH
          Hey, Charlie.
          They shake hands, then hug. Buddy is blown away that Bush
          would hug anyone. Bush looks up at the church rafters.

                         BUSH
          Still standing.

                         CHARLIE
          Yes.
          Charlie give Bush a look then holds out his hand to Buddy
          again.

                         CHARLIE

          talk much.

                         CHARLIE
          Someone better talk. A ghost pulls
          up in the driveway in a hearse, you
          expect a little bit of a story.

          My hearing is not what it was. It
          sounded like you said you want me
          to preach at your funeral party
          with you sitting there?

                         BUSH
          Yes, sir.

                         CHARLIE
          (shaking his head)
          You know I've talked to God a lot
          about you over the years and he
          said he broke the mould when he
          made you. Said you were sure
          entertaining to watch but way too
          much trouble.
          Buddy grins.

          Well.

          Sit still.
          Buddy plops back down.

                         CHARLIE
          What's the matter? You scared to be
          alone with me?

                         BUSH
          He can hear what's said.
          Buddy is surprised again. So is Charlie.

                         CHARLIE
          All right. After you left here..

                         CHARLIE
          You confessed? Asked forgiveness?
          Bush looks off and the muscles jump in his jaw.

                         CHARLIE
          Did you tell her, Felix?
          Charlie sighs, leans on his knees, and drops his head.

                         CHARLIE
          You came a long way for nothing
          then.
          Bush's eyes jerk back to Charlie and they are hot.
          Buddy tenses.

          I built my own jail and put myself
          in it! And I stayed in it for 40
          goddamn years! No wife, no kids, no
          friends! That's not enough?

          Well. Why don't you come and say
          that then, Charlie? Hell, say it
          all! I don't care.

                         CHARLIE
          Not on your life.
          The air is so heavy you can't breathe it. Bush suddenly gets
          up and leaves. Buddy starts to follow. Charlie puts his hand
          on him to stay. They sit in silence a moment.

          108 INT. DARROW HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - LATER 108

          Mattie sits beside a fire, knitting a baby blanket by an oil
          lamp. All at once the lights sputter on, the radio lights up,
          warms, and begins to PLAY, as a KNOCK at the door..

          Mattie pulls the door open. Bush is standing there soaking
          wet, breathing hard, holding his shotgun. She draws back
          reflexively. He looks into her.

                         BUSH
          Please, Ma'am.

          110 INT. DARROW HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT 110

          Bush stands with a towel around him, shivering.
          Mattie opens a dresser drawer. Inside the drawer, is the
          carefully arranged tableau of a watch, a ring, a stethoscope,
          and some clothes. She hates to disturb the drawer but pulls
          out a pair of black pants and a white shirt, lays them on the
          bed, and walks out.

          111 INT. DARROW HOME/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 111

          Mattie steps from the kitchen with a steaming mug as Bush
          comes down the stairs in clothes that are too loose.
          Still shivering, Bush steps uneasily in front of the fire.
          Mattie hands him the hot mug. He looks uneasily at the yellow
          flowers on the table nearby.

                         BUSH
          Thank you.

                         MATTIE
          What are you doing here?
          Burned through, a log falls in the fire. Bush jerks oddly and
          moves away.

                         BUSH
          Can I sit a minute?
          She stares at him then nods at a chair. She keeps standing
          behind the other chair.
          He bends over the mug and seems to lock up inside.

                         BUSH
          You want to know why I have your
          sister's picture on my wall?

          I'm not stupid, Felix. No, I take
          that back. How long was it going
          on? She was already married when I
          met you. Were you just making up to
          me to get to her?
          Bush is so still he looks like a gargoyle.

                         MATTIE
          If you're not going to talk, leave.

                         BUSH
          Can you help who you love?
          Mattie's face tells us that she has asked herself that
          question many times.

                         BUSH
          I've had 40 years to think about it
           and I still don't know.

                         MATTIE
          I don't know either, so..
          Slowly the gargoyle unfolds. His eyes drill into her.

                         BUSH
          I want to tell you how it was. If
          you don't want me to, I'll go.
          Mattie sighs from down deep in her shoes then comes around
          and sits down.

                         MATTIE
          Don't lie to me. When did you take
          up with her?

                         BUSH
          I came to see you and she was
          there, hanging clothes on the line
          with your mama.
          Bush stares out the window so hard, Mattie turns to see what
          he is looking at..

                         BUSH
          She turned around..
          (as Mattie turns back)
          .and.. I promise you that I did

                         BUSH
          You were a fine fine girl. I didn't
          know why you wanted anything to do
          with me but I was gonna keep coming
          to see you 'till my luck ran out.

                         (BEAT)
          And then I saw her.

                         MATTIE
          She was married! And she wasn't
          just my sister, she was my best
          friend. We told each other
          everything. I can't.. how long did
          it go on?!
          Bush's face is so white it looks like a death mask.

                         MATTIE
          How long?

                         BUSH
          It's still going on, Little Bit.
          Mattie tries to absorb that. The truth and tragedy of it
          touches her in way that she is not prepared for. They sit
          there in silence. She suddenly wipes her face and scowls.

                         MATTIE
          Did you have anything to do with
          her death?
          The mug trembles. She sees it.

                         MATTIE
          Tell me.
          Like a fish jerked from the water, he mouth opens and closes,
          but nothing comes out.

                         MATTIE (CONT'D)
          Felix!
          (off his haunted silence)

          Bush stands up quickly and starts for the door.

                         MATTIE

          He staggers, tries to catch himself but slides down against
          the wall.
          Despite her anger, Mattie starts toward him.

          112 INT. DARROW HOME/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT/MOMENTS LATER 112

          Bush sits on the floor, pale as moonlight. Mattie is beside
          him with a stethoscope in her lap.

                         MATTIE
          You need to see a doctor..
          He raises his eyes to her but says nothing. They look into
          each other for a long moment.

                         MATTIE
          Just tell me, Felix. Did you hurt
          Mary or not?
          Bush stares into her then suddenly gets up, picks up his
          shotgun and goes out the door without a word.

          113 INT. FUNERAL HOME/FRONT DOOR - NIGHT 113

          Frank is putting the files back in the drawers when he hears
          a NOISE. He reaches into the drawer and turns with a pistol
          in his hand.
          Bush is standing in the doorway with his shotgun.

                         FRANK
          What the hell?!
          Bush glances at the pistol, at the open drawers of the
          cabinet and desk.

           Frank sits with his feet on the desk. Bush sits across from
           him. They each have a cup of whiskey.

           Buddy is surrounded by bags. He is copying down names onto
           raffle tickets and putting them in bin for the drawing. There
           is a MAN standing guard by the front door with a rifle.

           Mule stands with his ears back, upset. Bush, back in his old

          A blurred image becomes clear as a magnifying glass lowers
          to a page of a stamp collection book. Fingers fill an empty
          space with a prized addition. A LOUD KNOCKING startles him
          and the stamp is placed slightly crooked..

          up, does a double-take out the window. MORE LOUD KNOCKING.

          Bush is sanding the beautiful lid of his casket. It is
          leaning against the wall and sawdust is drifting down all
          over him. He suddenly stops, rubs the wood tenderly, muscles
          up the heavy top to put it on the box and staggers back. It's
          not the weight, something is wrong. Sweat pops out on his
          forehead. He forces himself to the casket and drops the top
          down hard, staggers back against the loft ladder, slides down
          to the ground, and stares at the casket. Is this it?

          eyes are closed and the fading light steals across his face
          that is as still as it can be. The sawdust makes him look
          almost wooden. A shadow crosses then comes closer.
          Buddy is sure he is dead but Bush's eyes open.

          scratching. He looks around, sees something at the window. He
          slides to the floor, crawls on his knees, and looks out.

          figure. The old hermit is gone. He looks into the mirror.

          Horton hold the car door open for Kathryn who is holding the
          baby and looking back puzzled at Mattie's house. Finally she
          sighs and gets into the car.

          At the top of a wide clearing, a truck with a Circus Ad on
          the door is being set up to become a stage.
          The tractor and truck pull into the clearing and drive to the
          circus truck.
          The hearse pulls in and parks. Frank, Buddy, and Charlie
          climb out of the hearse, look around, and stand frozen.

          The big old honking generator is unloaded. Holes are dug. 10
          foot poles are slid from the truck and huge speaker horns are
          attached. Speaker poles are pulled up and set into holes.
          Frank directs a gang of 6 KIDS who are selling raffle tickets
           making sure they know that he has his eyes on them.
           A BAND arrives on the back of pick-up truck.
           The Generator kicks on belching smoke everywhere. Frank is
           yelling Whoa Whoa! Disaster in the making.

          Bush stands staring out the checkerboard window. He sees
          Charlie approaching and opens the door for him. Charlie
          climbs the steps, appraises the shack, and stares at Bush.

                         CHARLIE
          Pretty nice jail.
          Charlie enters and looks around the little room.

                         BUSH
          Why did you change your mind?
          Charlie just looks at him, the unspoken words louder than any
          reason he could give.

          I'm gonna try and tell it, Charlie,
          I really am. But if I can't get it
          done, would you do it? I want it

          The generator is working! And standing on the flat bed truck,
          which is now a stage, an ANNOUNCER introduces a hot blue
          grass group The crowd is huge now and listens as the group
          kicks off a song.
          Behind the stage Frank is collecting money from the boys who
          are selling the raffle tickets, making them turn their
          pockets inside out. The generator makes a strange noise,
          Frank eyeballs it, and it labors on.
          Buddy walks up, nudges Frank, and nods out at the huge crowd.
          Can you believe this?! Charlie walks up and says something
          that we cannot hear.

          Frank, Buddy, and Charlie enter the barn and see Mule hitched
          to the wagon. On the back of the wagon is a simple and
          rustically elegant casket with the initials FB carved into
          the center board. It sobers them all.

          The bluegrass fiddle player nods to the others to quickly end
          the song. Now we see why. Frank, Buddy, and Charlie have
          brought the wagon with the coffin into the field. Everyone
          quiets, remembering why they are here. They park the wagon
          behind the hearse.
          Frank and Charlie walk toward the stage. Buddy peels away.
          Frank calls after him to come with them to the stage but
          Buddy waves them away. He wants no part of that. He sees
          Kathryn and Horton threading their way through the crowd and
          moves toward them instead.
          Frank and Charlie climb the makeshift stairs up to the stage.
          Charlie sits down on a folding chair while Frank goes to the
          big microphone and stares with satisfaction at the huge
          Depression-era Woodstock crowd.

          Horton steps up to the microphone. The shocked crowd turns to
          him. He closes his eyes and bows his head.

                         REVEREND HORTON
          Lord, you say you move in
          mysterious ways and we believe you
          because we don't understand much of
          anything. And so we come to you
          today not seeking answers to what's
          happened here but asking you to
          help us open our hearts a little
          more to each other and find some

          Frank has cleaned the wound. Buddy has made a poultice that
          Bush is pressing onto the wound as he hears the last of
          Horton's prayer over the loudspeakers.

                         BUS H
          Pretty good prayer. Mighta been

          Bush thinks about it, sees a way out. For a second he looks
          like he might take it. Then he shakes his head, puts a rag
          over the poultice and pulls his shirt up.

                         BUSH
          Let's go 'fore I lose my nerve.

          Bush scowls at the huge blood stain on his shirt. He looks at
          Frank's white shirt. Frank just stares at him. Bush keeps
          looking. Finally Frank sighs and starts loosening his tie.

          The bluegrass band sings a good hymn. The crowd is still

          Buddy gently helps Bush into his jacket, which has a bullet
          tear in it along the shoulder but Bush seems okay with it, to
          Frank's relief.
          Frank is putting on an old faded shirt of Bush's. As Bush
          starts for the door, he comes up beside Charlie.

                         BUSH
          You ain't nervous? All them white

          You're the one they're shooting at.
          As Charlie opens the door, Bush stops, all his misgivings
          flooding in with the light. He looks at Buddy.

                         BUSH
          Pretty interesting day so far, huh
          boy?
          Bush straightens himself up and goes out the door.

           Charlie, Bush walk through the murmuring parting crowd toward
           the stage. Frank and Buddy are close behind. Buddy is looking
           for Kathryn. She spots him and moves toward the stage.

          162 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - DAY 162

          Bush and Charlie go up the steps to the stage.
          At the last second, Bush stares at the big microphone and
          stops, unable to go on.
          Charlie gives him a look then goes on up to the microphone
          and looks out a the sea of white folks.

                         CHARLIE
          I'm Reverend Charlie Jackson. Felix
          wants to continue with his funeral.
          And he's asked me to say a few
          words.
          Just below the stage, Buddy and Frank are joined by Kathryn.
          Charlie glances back at Bush, turns inward, searching for the
          words. Finally he holds his hands out, wide apart.

                         CHARLIE
          We like to imagine that good and
          bad, right and wrong, are miles

          Some 40 years ago Felix Bush
          dropped into my life and then
          dropped out. In between he built
          the most beautiful sanctuary that
          I've ever seen. A lot of wonderful
          things happened in that church.
          Suddenly Bush breaks away, moves up beside Charlie, and puts
          his hand on his shoulder.

          Charlie gives him a long look then steps away from the
          microphone and moves back to where Bush was standing.
          Bush stares at the microphone, takes a breath, and walks up
          to it, and looks out over the huge crowd.

                         BUSH
          Had to go clear to Illinois to find
          somebody that had anything good to
          say about me. Hell of a thing.
          His voice booms out over the crowd, startling him. He looks
          down, sees Buddy, Kathryn, Frank and Horton.
          He looks closer for someone most important but she is not
          there. The crowd murmurs. Finally..

                         BUSH
          I'm not a smart man or a wise one.
          I don't know what kind of man I am.
          I was always restless, thought I'd
          see the world. But I didn't hardly
          go nowhere.. on purpose..

          I wish you good luck with that. I
          really do.

                         (BEAT)
          When I told Charlie what I'd done,
          he told me to confess to God and
          the law and to.. to someone else..
          so I could get forgiveness. But I
          didn't want forgiveness.

          He stops, not knowing how to go on. The crowd has quieted
          completely.
          As as his eyes sweep over the sea of expectant faces, he
          suddenly SEES HER coming through the crowd.

          Mattie's here. Seeing that Felix appears to alright, her face
          changes from conflicted concern to open unbridled hatred.
          The look takes Bush's breath away. But he suddenly seems to
          accept it as his due and when he talks, it is only to her.

          I fell in love with a married lady.
          And somehow she fell in love with
          me. It was the only time that I
          have been in love.

          We made a plan to run off and start

          at the time that we said we'd meet.
          I got a funny feeling and I went to
          her house.
          Buddy, Kathryn and Frank all see Mattie now, see Bush talking
          just to her.

                         BUSH
          Her husband answered the door.

                         (BEAT)
          He had blood on him.
          For Mattie all of this is like window into the past being
          suddenly thrown open and she is haunted and mesmerized.

                         BUSH
          I hit him pretty hard, knocked him
          down. Can't remember going upstairs
          but I remember I saw a hammer on
          the steps and it had blood and hair
          on it.
          The crowd gasps. Mattie is trembling.

                         BUSH
          I found her in the bedroom. She was
          crawling across the floor.

          But before I could get to her and
          help her up.. a kerosene lamp hit
          the wall. And then her husband
          jumped on my back. Funny what
          happens sometimes when things go
          wrong. It's like the clock stops
          and you have all the time in the
          world to think. I could see that
          her husband had set the downstairs
          on fire before he came up.

          broke in.

          Bush pulls Buddy aside. Frank stares over at them but can't
          hear what they are saying. He moves over beside Mattie.

                         FRANK
          Are you alright, Mattie?
          She looks up at Frank for a long moment, her face softening.

                         MATTIE
          Oh, I don't know. I'm still moving,
          I guess..
          He doesn't know what that means but she has finally really
          looked at him and that's something he'll hold onto.
          Kathryn comes and hugs Mattie as.. Bush and Buddy come back.
          Bush goes to Charlie.
          Frank is staring at Buddy, looking for a clue as to what Bush
          said. Buddy gives him nothing,

                         BUSH
          Thanks again for coming, Charlie.

                         CHARLIE
          I'm proud of you.

                         (MEANING IT)
          Thank you for my church.

                         BUSH
          Did you ever get my bill?

                         HORTON
          Can we get a ride our car's about 2
          miles down the road.
          Everyone piles into the hearse. There is no back seat so they
          all have to crawl in the back door and sit along the sides.
          It makes everyone smile. Mattie gives Bush one last fleeting
          embrace then climbs in. Bush looks in on them all for a long
          moment all then closes the door.
          As the hearse moves out, he waves to Buddy who is looking out
          the back window. Buddy waves back.

                         BUSH

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Look at that. My funeral and
          everybody's in there but me.
          The hearse pulls onto the road and drives away.

          The place is suddenly quiet and beautiful. He looks down the
          road through the fading dust and sees a WOMAN walking slowly
          toward him. He squints, recognizes her, and his face fills
          with a timeless love.

          168 EXT. BUSH'S LAND - DAY - TWO MONTHS LATER 168

          It's a cold day beneath the spreading pecan tree. Mule stands
          hitched to the wagon. The three dog grave markers are
          frosted.
          A fourth grave marker just like the others leans against the
          tree. It is freshly carved with: Felix Elijah Bush. A pot of
          fresh yellow flowers sit beside the marker.
          Bush's beautiful handmade casket is inside his grave.
          Frank, Mattie, Charlie, Buddy, Kathryn, and Horton stand
          beside the grave. Several MEN with shovels wait near the
          tree. Charlie's eulogy is more of a one-sided conversation
          which Bush would probably love.

                         CHARLIE
          Well, Felix, this one's for real, I
          guess. I didn't actually see them
          put you in the box so..
          Charlie glances over and notices "Charlie" on one of the
          dog's grave markers. He snorts and shakes his head.

                         CHARLIE
          Wherever you are, you're probably
          giving someone a hard time or
          something wonderful and priceless
          just to confuse them. Not
          everything can be figured out, nor
          everybody. I wish you peace from
          the burdens of your mind and heart.
          I wish it for us all.
          Mattie moves toward the edge of the grave. Frank puts a hand
          out to catch her should she should stumble. She stares down
          at the FB on the coffin, opens her hand, and lets the picture
          of her sister drift down onto the coffin.

          169 EXT. HILLSIDE - LATER 169

          Everyone moves away as the men fill in the grave. Buddy and
          Kathryn move up beside Frank and Mattie and Charlie. Buddy
          tosses the ball of hermit money to Frank.

                         BUDDY
          A 50 on the outside, all ones
          inside. Less than $100.

                         FRANK
          What?!

                         CHARLIE
          I told you. Nobody listens to the
          preacher.
          Buddy pulls some papers from his coat.

                         BUDDY
          The day of the party he told me
          about the will he had in the secret
          drawer of his table. He left the
          raffle money to all of us.
          Everyone is shocked, touched.

                         BUDDY

                         (TO FRANK)
          But you have to pay for Mule's
          upkeep for the rest of his life.
          Charlie grins and Buddy flaps the papers at him.

                         BUDDY
          And he set up a fund for the
          upkeep of your church.

                         CHARLIE
          What's the catch?

                         BUDDY
          No catch, sir.

                         CHARLIE
          Still don't get it, do you? With
          Felix, there's always a catch.

                         BUDDY
          Maybe he just knew you'd go crazy
          wondering what it was.
          They all laugh and move down the hillside. As the laughter
          fades we see in their faces the impact that Felix Bush has
          had upon them. Buddy feels the comfort of this odd but
          growing family and stops and looks back at the grave and the
          pot of yellow flowers. His curiosity about the fearsome old
          man has not abated. Nor will it ever.


          THE END
