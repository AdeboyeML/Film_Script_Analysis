    READER NOTE

    One thing that will be obvious to viewers, but not
    to readers, is that the nine principal parts in this
    film are played by only three actors:

     1) Gary, Gavin, Gabriel

     2) Sarah, Susan, Sierra

     3) Margaret, Melissa, Mary

    It'll make more sense in context. Promise.

      A MAN'S HAND

      unwinds a short length of green string. We're extremely
      close, with a shallow, blurry focus. It's like the first
      moments after a dream -- just fragments.

      Scissors cut the string. The man wraps it around his left
      wrist. A loop. A bracelet.

      We see the man's teeth, the edge of his chin as he pulls the
      knot tight.

      His fingers pull against the string.   Solid.   It won't break
      easily.

                                                FADE OUT.

      PITCH BLACK

      There's no music. No sound at all, really, except for some
      distant birds CHIRPING.

      Then a SQUEAK.   A SQUEAL as rusty springs engage.

      A GARAGE DOOR LIFTS,

      revealing GARY BANKS in silhouette. He's 30, effortlessly
      fit, with movie-star good looks. (Although for now, he's
      merely a TV star.)

      Like most Laurel Canyon garages, this one has never held a
      car. Instead, it's the resting place for all the detritus of
      bachelordom: shitty Ikea furniture, a drum set, a styrofoam
      snowman, and the Harley he always meant to get running.

      Gary spots what he was looking for.

      EXT. BACK PATIO / LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR (DAWN)

      Gary drags a beaten Weber kettle. One of its wheels is
      broken, SCRAPING against the deck.

      WIDER, we see Gary's house has an incredible view of the
      city. He couldn't fucking care less.

      He yanks the circular grill out of the Weber and throws it
      down the canyon.

                                                                  2.

      He empties a garbage bag into the barbecue: mostly women's
      clothes, but also some stuffed animals and photos still in
      their frames. There's too much to fit, so he tries stomping
      it down with a flip-flopped foot.

      He cracks open a container of lighter fluid and begins
      drenching everything inside. He sprays until the container
      is WHEEZING air. He shakes it, making sure it's really
      empty.

      Then he cracks open a new container and keeps spraying.   And
      spraying.

      We follow the dripping fluid as it runs across a photo of
      Gary and a BLONDE WOMAN. Her eyes are scratched out, making
      her unrecognizable.

      Under the grill, lighter fluid is dripping in a stream,
      soaking into the wooden deck.

      Finally satisfied, Gary throws the lighter fluid aside. He
      takes five steps back and pulls a box of matches from his
      pocket.

      EXTREMELY CLOSE as the match SCRAPES, erupting in flames.

      On Gary's left wrist, we see a green string bracelet.

      MUSIC STARTS: a pounding, hypnotic track that will carry us
      through these MAIN TITLES.

      In EPIC SLOW-MOTION, we follow the burning match as it sails
      through the air, tumbling end-over-end.

      Just as it's about to reach its target, we...

      INT. THE PRIUS - DAY

      Gary's at the wheel, driving, as he finishes a fifth of
      bourbon. JUMP CUTS take us out of Hollywood, heading
      downtown. Our TRAVELLING MUSIC is serving us well.

      Gary stops at a light. He looks left and sees himself on the
      side of a bus. It's an ad for CRIME LAB ("This fall, Mondays
      are killer.") Gary watches himself drive away.

106   Further along, Gary spots two THUGGY TEENAGERS sitting on a 106
      low wall. He calls out to them:

                              GARY
                   Hey!   Do you sell crack?

      The boys look wary.

                                GARY (CONT'D)
                   It's cool.     I'm only a cop on TV.



      QUICK CUTS:

      Money changes hands.

      Gary holds a small ziplock bag -- and has no idea what to do
      with its lumpy beige contents.

      HOLLYWOOD.

      Gary pulls up to a curb. He's now on Sunset Blvd. A
      matronly black streetwalker (OCTAVIA, 35) approaches the
      passenger window.

      Gary holds up the little bag.

                             GARY
                   Is this crack?

      She takes a closer look.

                             GARY (CONT'D)
                   Do you know how to do it?

      INT. SHITTY MOTEL ROOM - DAY

      Gary and Octavia jump up and down on the bed, each trying to
      bounce higher than the other, LAUGHING all the while.

      Gary bounces so high that he THUNKS his head against the
      ceiling. He crumples, falling off the bed. But he's still
      laughing.

      INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - DAY

      Gary takes a shower with his jeans on.

      INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

      Toweling off, Gary looks at his body in the mirror. He
      notices something odd. He tries to wake Octavia up, but
      she's down for the count.

      Looking around, he finds his cell phone. Dials 911. Pacing,
      he tries to sober up while it rings. The far side answers.

                          GARY
                Yes, hello. I'm having a medical
                situation. Yes. Okay. I don't
                have a belly button.
                    (explaining carefully)
                I do not have a belly button where
                I should, on my belly. And I'm
                concerned, because I don't know if
                that's...

      He sits down on the edge of the bed.

                          GARY (CONT'D)
                Can a person live without a belly
                button? Because if you think about
                it, you're born with one. So if
                you don't have one, you're unborn
                and it's really hazy whether you're
                alive or not. I guess I'm
                wondering: am I alive?
                    (a sudden thought)
                Or what if I'm God?

      A beat.

                           GARY (CONT'D)
                No, no.   I'm totally sober.

      A beat.

                          GARY (CONT'D)
                No, I don't think I need an
                ambulance. I don't seem to be
                dying any faster than usual. But I
                should probably go to the hospital,
                don't you think? Yeah, I should.

      He hangs up.

       INT. THE PRIUS - DAY

       He's driving again, but most of his attention is focused on
       trying to locate his missing navel.

       He looks up in the rear-view mirror, where he sees two

       VERSIONS OF HIMSELF

       sitting in the back seat.    All three Garys give each other
       thumbs-up.

       Driver-Gary looks out the driver-side window, where he sees
       shoes and asphalt. Only now do we ROTATE to reveal we're

       Gary has rolled the car.

       The music suddenly STOPS.    We hear SIRENS approaching.

       INT. COURTHOUSE PROCESSING AREA - DAY

       MARGARET O'REILLY, 34, is speaking to herself.

                  La la la la la. Like you've never
                  done worse.

       From a NEW ANGLE, we see she's using a cell phone earpiece.

                            MARGARET (CONT'D)
                  Okay, yes. He totalled a car. But
                  it was an environmentally friendly
                  car. Why doesn't that get
                  reported?

                  Please! He was heartbroken,
                  betrayed. You say you understand
                  but you don't. You can't. You're
                  like a big giant Vulcan.

                A few. Not Hugh Grant level. More

                I didn't mean to burn down my
                house.

                          MARGARET
                Yeah, I didn't mean to eat my way
                into a ten-year shame spiral, but I
                did, and it's healthier to
                acknowledge it.
                    (moving on)
                This flammable house belongs to one
                of Lola's other fabulous clients,
                who is currently shooting a pilot
                in Toronto.

                             GARY
                Actor?

                          MARGARET
                Writer. So for the next six weeks,
                su casa es su casa. I say, feel
                free to wear his clothes. He'll
                probably get a sick thrill of out
                it. The gays.

      Noticing two crates...

                          GARY
                He has dogs?

                          MARGARET
                They're away at summer camp.    Now,
                try the bed.

      He lies back on it, feeling it out.

                             GARY
                It's fine.

                          MARGARET
                Comfortable?

                             GARY
                Sure.

      She massages his besocked feet.

                                                                 9.

                          MARGARET
                Look, Gary, I know this has been
                crazy and stressful. I want you to
                feel safe. And comfortable.

                           GARY
                I do.

                          MARGARET
                I'm a fan of yours, you know.   Your
                number-one fan.

      Gary looks over his toes at Margaret. From this angle, she
      looks a bit like Kathy Bates from Misery.

                          MARGARET (CONT'D)
                But if you fuck this up, I will
                smash your ankles with a sledge
                hammer.

      A long beat.

                          MARGARET (CONT'D)
                That wouldn't be comfortable for
                either of us.

                                                CUT TO:

      INT. KITCHEN - DAY

      Margaret boxes up the alcohol while Gary bounces a lime on
      the island.

                           MARGARET
                I'll be coming by twice a day to
                check up on you. I'm the only
                person who should be coming by. No
                buddies, no pals, no heroin
                dealers...

                          GARY
                I don't do heroin.

                          MARGARET
                Yeah, crack is classy. And I'm not
                buying you porn. There's spray-per-
                view on cable.

                          GARY
                Good. I really wasn't concerned
                about my career, my family or my
                future. I just wanted to jack off.

      Margaret is a little impressed by this show of backbone.

                                                                 10.

                          MARGARET
                Let me see your phone.

      He hands over his cell phone.   She drops it in the contraband
      box.

                           GARY
                C'mon!   All my numbers are in that.

                          MARGARET
                Dial ten digits at random. Whoever
                answers will be better than the
                people on this phone.

      She picks up the liquor box, ready to go.

                          MARGARET (CONT'D)
                You have my cell number. You have
                delivery menus. You're fine.
                Right?

                           GARY
                I guess.

      As she leaves, Margaret notices a long butane lighter by the
      stove. She adds it to the box, just to be sure.

                                                  TIME CUT TO:

      INT. HOUSE / VARIOUS - DAY

      Gary paces around his new home, trying to get a feel for it.

      He plays a few NOTES on the piano.

      He looks up at the painting over the staircase:    a cliff near
      the ocean.

      He opens random drawers in a Chinese herb cabinet, wondering
      if there's anything hidden in one of the 46 slots. There
      isn't.

      He takes a long beat to consider three paintings in the
      dining room, which show the same thing in three different
      ways.

      EXT. BACKYARD - SUMMER NIGHT

      Gary swims laps, trying to exhaust himself.

      He stands in the shallow end, listening to the quiet.

                                                                 11.

      INT. KITCHEN - SUMMER NIGHT

      Wearing a fluffy white robe, he looks through the delivery
      menus.


122                                                                     122
      INT. FOYER / FRONT DOOR - SUMMER NIGHT

      He takes a bag of food from a college-age DELIVERY GUY, who
      seems to recognize him. Gary pays him, shuts the door.

      As he's walking to the kitchen with the food, Gary looks back
      and sees the Delivery Guy watching him from the front walk.
      The guy is a little embarrassed, but Gary is pretty used to
      being stared at.


123                                                                     123
      INT. KITCHEN - SUMMER NIGHT

      Gary unwraps the Thai food.   Makes himself a plate.

      He watches CRIME LAB on the plasma screen while eating
      dinner.

                          GARY (O.S. TV DIALOGUE)
                Once we get these samples back to
                the Crime Lab, we'll know who the
                real killer is.


124                                                                     124
      INT. LIBRARY / TV ROOM - NIGHT

      Gary scans the shelves, looking for something to read. There
      are five times more books here than Gary has opened in his
      lifetime.

      He settles on a paperback of Voltaire's Candide.

      He lies back on the couch, reading it.

      He flips a few pages ahead to see if it gets more
      interesting. A beat.

                                                CUT TO:

      GARY JACKING OFF

      to soft-core pay-per-view. We're CLOSE ON Gary's straining
      face, but we can hear the pleasured MOANS of the actresses as
      they go down on each other.

      Nearing climax, he looks for something to come on.     He can't
      find anything.

                                                                  12.

      INT. FOYER - NIGHT

      His left hand cupped to hold the semen, he pads barefoot from
      the TV room to the downstairs bathroom. We hear WATER
      RUNNING as he washes his hands. Then it shuts off.

      We hear a THUNK.   Something hard was dropped on the wood
      floor.

      Gary hears it too.

      He steps out of the bathroom, looks around. He takes a few
      silent paces back in our direction, stopping just before he
      reaches the two-story section of the foyer.

      That's when he hears it: CLICK-CLICK-CLICK-CLICK on the
      wooden floor. A JINGLE of metal.

      We follow Gary's eyes up to the second-floor walkway.   We can
      hear the little FOOTSTEPS, toe nails CLICKING. Faint
      PANTING. But there's no dog.

      BACK ON Gary, increasingly unsettled. He's directly below
      the walkway, and can't see up into it.

                           GARY
                 Is somebody there?   Hello?

      He CLAPS his hands twice.   Listens.

      Nothing.

      He's about to venture a step forward when suddenly

      THE PHONE RINGS.

      He nearly jumps out of his skin. It RINGS two more times
      before he ducks into the TV room to answer it.

                           GARY (CONT'D)
                 Hello?!
                     (relieved)
                 Yes. Yes.

      He turns his back to the foyer, listening to the instructions
      on the phone.

                           GARY (CONT'D)
                 Nine leopards run through the
                 jungle.
                     (listening)
                 I bought two cakes at the store.

      His identity evidently confirmed, he hangs up.   He looks back
      into the foyer.

                                                            13.

                           GARY (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)
                 The house is haunted. There's a
                 zeitgeist, or something.

      EXT. UPSTAIRS DECK - DAY

      Margaret's brought coffee and pastries from Susina.

                           MARGARET
                 Poltergeist, and no. Maybe they
                 were rats. L.A. is teaming with
                 rats. They live in the palm trees.

                            GARY
                 Sure.   Maybe.

      He's obviously not convinced.

                           MARGARET
                 Okay. You know I'm a licensed
                 psychotherapist.

                            GARY
                 Really?

                           MARGARET
                 No. I'm a publicist. My job is
                 what other people think of you, not
                 what you think of yourself. So
                 pull your shit together. I am
                 thisclose to getting Christine
                 Walsh to do your piece in Parade.

                            GARY
                 Parade?   I fucking hate Parade.

                           MARGARET
                 Everyone hates Parade. But the
                 people who watch "Crime Lab," they
                 love their Marilyn Vos Savant.
                 Give them a woman of indeterminate
                 age who solves riddles and they are
                 in hee-haw heaven.

                            GARY
                 Okay.

                           MARGARET
                 One heartfelt act of contrition and
                 maybe the showrunner won't kill off
                 your character between seasons.

      He nods.   He gets it.

                                                               14.

                          GARY
                I'm not crazy.

                            MARGARET
                Exactly.    Exactly.

      EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

      Gary is lying in the sun, eyes shut.   Suddenly, a golf ball
      hits him on the head.

      He sits up, perplexed. For a long moment, he has no idea
      where the ball came from, until he hears a voice from beyond
      the wall that separates the properties.

                           WOMAN'S VOICE
                Sorry!   Really sorry.

      (A practiced ear notices a Canadian accent.)

                          WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                Over here. To your left.
                    (correcting)
                Right. Sorry. Right.

      He follows the voice to a gap in the hedges at the far corner
      of the yard, finding SARAH GLEASON. Late 30's, fresh-
      scrubbed and girlish, she looks more fragile than she really
      is.

                          SARAH
                I'm working on my putting, if you
                can believe it.

      Indeed, she's holding a putter.

                          GARY
                Not really.

                          SARAH
                Okay. Maybe I was just looking for
                a way to meet my infamous neighbor.
                You see, I'm under house arrest,
                too.

                          GARY
                What did you do?

                                                15.

                     SARAH
           I had sex with my husband.

                     GARY
           That's awful.

                     SARAH
           Nine months later, I had Jaden.
           That's her over there.

She points to a small portable baby monitor.

                     GARY
           She's cute.

                     SARAH
           She's sleeping for another...
               (checks watch)
           ...seventeen minutes. She keeps to
           a schedule.

                     GARY
           She sounds really boring.

                     SARAH
               (whispers)
           She is.

A beat.   A smile between them.

                     GARY
           You're rich. Shouldn't you have a
           nanny from Ecuador?

                     SARAH
           I'm Canadian.

                     GARY
               (as if that explains it)
           Ohhh...

                     SARAH
           I can't work in the U.S. Plus, I
           want to maintain this air of moral
           superiority by doing everything
           myself.

                     GARY
           Very Canadian.

                     SARAH
           Thanks.

Another pregnant pause.

                           SARAH (CONT'D)
                 Listen, Jaden goes down again at

                 I'm pretty sure I'll be here.

                           SARAH
                 It's a date.

                             GARY
                 Is it?

      She picks up the baby monitor, heading back into her house.
      Suddenly, she realizes...

                            SARAH
                 Oh.   I'm Sarah, by the way.

                             GARY
                 Gary.

                             SARAH
                 Yeah.    I know.

      Gary neatens up, tossing out newspapers and delivery boxes.
      He plumps pillows.

      He looks up at the clock:      2:30.

      He sits, trying to read Candide again.     He fidgets.

      He looks at the clock again:     2:49.

      Under the pretense of sweeping up leaves, he peers over the

      Gary carefully sets rat traps, staggering them every few
      feet.

      He pokes one with a pencil.   The metal arm SNAPS back,
      breaking the pencil in two.

      INT. FOYER - DAY

      Gary notices that the piano has an electronic device attached
      to it. He turns it on.

      He opens the piano bench, finding computer disks. A red disk
      is labelled "Knowing." He puts it in. Hits play.

      The piano begins playing by itself, a sensuous but melancholy
      CLASSICAL PIECE.

      Gary lies on the floor, listening to it.   He stares up at the
      elaborate chandelier.

      EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY

      Gary is sitting on a bench by the front walk, trying to read
      more of his book. He looks over to see Sarah coming up the
      steps, carrying the baby monitor and a bottle of chardonnay.

      She stops beside him.

                           SARAH
                 The best of all possible worlds.

                           GARY
                     (confused)
                 Okay.

                     (pointing to his book)
                 Voltaire. Candide.

                           GARY
                 I thought I was.

      He gets up.

                 Sorry I bailed. Jaden had a fever.

      INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

      Sarah tops off Gary's wine glass. They're both on the couch.
      The baby monitor is sitting on the table behind them.

                           GARY
                 ... so it's kind of hard to prove
                 that I only meant to burn my ex-
                 girlfriend's stuff, and not the
                 entire house.

                            SARAH
                 Yeah.   Fire's tricky that way.

                           GARY
                 How about you? Any history of
                 arson?

                           SARAH
                 Strangely enough...

                              GARY
                 I knew it!     I could see that little
                 spark.

                           SARAH
                 It wasn't arson.    Probably.

      A long beat while she decides whether she wants to tell him
      the story.

                           SARAH (CONT'D)
                 Okay. When I was a little girl,
                 our house caught on fire.

                                                                    19.

                              GARY
                 Oh shit.

     MUSIC begins, providing backing to her monologue.

                           SARAH
                 I'll never forget the look on my
                 father's face as he gathered me up
                 in his arms and raced through the
                 burning building, out onto the
                 pavement.

     ON GARY, feeling bad he brought this up, but fascinated at
     the same time.

                           SARAH (CONT'D)
                 I stood there shivering in my
                 pajamas and watched the whole world
                 go up in flames. And when it was
                 all over, I said to myself, "Is
                 that all there is to a fire?" Is
                 that all there is?

     As she starts to SING, Gary realizes the story isn't hers at
     all. It's Peggy Lee's "Is That All There Is."

                              SARAH (CONT'D)
                 Is that all there is, is that all there is?
                 If that's all there is my friends, then let's
                 keep dancing.

     She leans closer.

                 Let's break out the booze and have a ball.
                 If that's all there is.

     Standing up, Sarah takes Gary's hands, pulling him off the
     couch. She leads him to an open area -- more space for
     dancing.

                   Then I fell in love with the most
                   wonderful boy in the world. We
                   would take long walks by the river
                   or just sit for hours gazing into
                   each other's eyes. We were so very
                   much in love. Then one day he went
                   away and I thought I'd die. But I
                   didn't. And when I didn't, I said
                   to myself, "Is that all there is to
                   love?"

      Deep in the bowels of the store, Sarah is surrounded by

                   I know what you're thinking.
                   If that's the way she feels about
                   it why doesn't she just end it all?

      Sarah and Gary become more intimately acquainted on the
      couch. They still haven't kissed, but hands are running up
      and down over clothing. Sarah isn't singing anymore, though
      her voice continues.

                                                                  21.

      Just as they're about to kiss,

      A BABY HOWLS.

      It's the monitor, HISSING and POPPING as Jaden wakes up from
      her nap, cranky and hungry. Sarah pushes back. Gary tries
      to close the gap, but she's already standing up.

                          SARAH

      Gary washes the wine glasses, being sure to wash off any
      trace of lipstick. He dries them and puts them back in the
      cabinet.

      Faced with the remainder of the wine, he considers dumping it
      down the sink. Instead, he chugs it from the bottle.

      He wraps the empty bottle in newspaper and tucks it in the
      recycling.

      Gary enters from the driveway door, gulping from a water
      bottle. He starts to look through the delivery menus when he
      notices an orange Post-It note by the telephone. It reads:

                         Look for the Nines.

      He picks it up, looks at the back.   Nothing.    Sticks it back
      down on the counter.

      Gary sits on the couch with his water bottle, listening to

                Goodnight.

      For a long beat, it's quiet.   Then we hear RUSTLING.

      A crib toy plays a short MELODY.   Then a slightly-digital
      voice speaks:

                          VOICE
                The cat says meow!
                The pig says oink!

       Gary looks back.     Did he just hear that?

       The phone RINGS.


159                                                                     159
       INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]

       Gary answers it on the third ring.

                               GARY
                   Hello.

       It's the parole system.

                             GARY (CONT'D)
                   Yes. Yes. Two trains run through
                   the forest.

       Music STRIKES. We see a sudden change in Gary's expression.
       He nearly drops the phone.

       Forcing himself not to panic, he pushes the button for
       speakerphone. He wants to make sure he's hearing it right.

                               MALE COMPUTER VOICE
                   Nine.    Nine. Nine. Nine.

       Gary backs away from the phone like it might sprout legs and
       jump on him. Suddenly, he backs into

       SOMEONE ELSE.

       He spins around, startled. He only catches a glimpse of THE
       MAN -- same height, same build, same everything. The Man is
       gone in half an instant, vanished into thin air.

       Gary bolts for the door.

       Reaching the foyer, Gary steps on a

       RAT TRAP,

       which SNAPS down on his toes. He SCREAMS, pulling it off.
       He looks around to find all eight traps are now on the main
       floor, rather than the second-floor walkway.

       Limping, he hops out the door.     We stay behind, looking out
       through the open door.


A160                                                                A160
       EXT. WILSHIRE BLVD. - NIGHT

       HEADLIGHTS FLARE as cars travel down Miracle Mile, bringing
       us to a Metro Bus stop -- a semi-enclosed bench with backlit
       signage.

                                                           24.

The far side of the shelter has a one-sheet for Crime Lab.
("This fall, Mondays are murder.") The bench side is a promo
poster for a show called Knowing. ("Some fates are chosen
for you.")

It's here we find Gary taking a seat, gingerly checking his
toes where the rat trap snapped. He's hobbled his way here
from the house, which is probably a block away.

There's only a little blood, but his toes really hurt.

Over Gary's shoulder, we see a blonde 8-year old girl
(Noelle) watching him with concern. She BANGS on the shelter
to get his attention. Gary nearly jumps out of his skin.

                     GARY
          Jesus!   You scared the shit out
          of...

She signs "What's wrong?"

                    GARY (CONT'D)
              (confused)
          What?

                    NOELLE
              (signed, subtitled)
          You're hurt.
                    GARY
          I don't speak that.   Sorry.   I
          don't...

She points to his toes.   Getting what she must mean...

                      GARY (CONT'D)
          I'm fine.    I'll be fine.

Looking around, he realizes that the little girl is out here
by herself.

                    GARY (CONT'D)
          Where are your parents?

She looks at him oddly, not really getting the question.

                    GARY (CONT'D)
          Your mom, your dad. Where are
          they?

                     NOELLE
               (signed, subtitled)
          Mom is at the car. Where you left
          her.
Again, Gary has no idea what she's saying.

                                                                  25.

                             NOELLE (CONT'D)
                       (signed, subtitled)
                   You're lost.
                             GARY
                   Look, you need to go back, okay?
                   You shouldn't be out here. It's
                   not safe.

       Noelle glances to her left.

       We hear BWOOP BWOOP as a police cruiser pulls over to the
       curb.

                             GARY (CONT'D)
                   Shit.

       We go to a WIDER ANGLE as TWO OFFICERS get out of the car.
       Gary looks back.

       Noelle is gone, though there's really nowhere she could have
       disappeared.

       Putting on his best face for the police...

                             GARY (CONT'D)
                   Evening, officers.

       INT./EXT.   POLICE CRUISER - NIGHT

       Handcuffed, Gary is placed in back.     He's reserving the right
       to remain silent.

                             MARGARET (PRE-LAP)
                   Once again, the idea of house
                   arrest is you stay inside your
                   house.

       INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

       The same parole officer from earlier attaches a black anklet
       to Gary's left leg. We see that Gary's left foot also
       features bandaged toes.

                              MARGARET
                   Think of it like an electronic
                   leash. Basically, if you ever go
                   more than 100 feet from the base
                   station...

       She points to an electronic device by the wall.

                                                                 26.

                          MARGARET (CONT'D)
                ...the cops come, they throw your
                ass in jail. If you ever try to
                take it off, the cops come and
                throw your ass in jail. And if
                they ever detect drugs or alcohol
                in your system...

                          GARY
                ...the cops come and throw my ass
                in jail.

                          MARGARET
                No. I kick your ass. Then the
                cops come and throw your ass in
                jail.

      The parole officer smiles.

                          GARY
                Do I still have to answer the
                phone?

                          MARGARET
                No, I'll be doing that from now on.
                I'm moving into the guest room.

                          GARY
                I don't need a babysitter.

                          MARGARET
                Despite all evidence to the
                contrary. Don't worry, I'm a cool
                roomie. Who do you think taught
                Affleck how to gamble?

      The parole officer hits a test button on the anklet, which
      lets out a PIERCING ALARM.

                          MARGARET (CONT'D)
                Let's never hear that again.

      Margaret walks heel-to-toe, counting her steps.

                            MARGARET
                97.   98.   99.

      With a piece of chalk, she draws a line on the concrete.    She
      looks back to Gary, who's waiting by the front door.

                                                               27.

                Out of the world. Look at me, I'm
                dancin'!

      She starts doing the running man over the line.   Even Gary's
      dark mood is broken.

      Margaret and Gary roast marshmallows over the propane grill
      to make s'mores. They're giggling.

                          GARY
                So the guy was like, "Do you know
                fencing?" And I say, of course.
                That's what it says on my headshot.

                           MARGARET
                Lies!

                           GARY
                Always.   So he says, "Foil or epi?"

                          GARY
                I say, I'm about equal in both.

                          MARGARET
                Which is true.

                          GARY
                So he tosses me this fucking Conan
                sword and goes after me. I'm just
                swinging, trying to stay alive.
                But I end up cutting his ear.

                          MARGARET
                You cut his ear off?

                          GARY
                Just a little. But I got the job.

      Margaret is confused.

                What?

      He looks over.    Margaret holds up the orange sticky note by
      the phone.

                                                                31.

                           MARGARET
                 "Look for the Nines."

                           GARY
                 It's not mine.

                           MARGARET
                 It's your handwriting.

                           GARY
                 I didn't write it.

                             MARGARET
                 Okay.

      She puts it back down.    But she doesn't believe him.

                           MARGARET (CONT'D)
                 All-ee-all-ee-all-come-free.

                           GARY
                     (perplexed)
                 What?

                             MARGARET
                 Nothing.

                           GARY
                 Seriously, what?

                           MARGARET
                 Nothing. I thought you
                 were...forget it. Done.    Sorry.


171                                                                   171
      EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

      At the far edge of the property, Margaret and Gary play
      backgammon. Their mood is significantly more subdued.

      Margaret answers her RINGING cell phone.

                           MARGARET
                 Yhello? Hi. What?!
                     (to Gary)
                 I have to take this.

      He nods.   Margaret starts walking back to the house.

                           MARGARET (CONT'D)
                     (on phone)
                 Well, who thought it was a good
                 idea letting Courtney into a
                 pottery shop?

                                                                32.

      Left alone, Gary rolls the dice idly. He gets a 4 and a 5.
      Rolls again. 4,5. 3,6. 4,5. 3,6. 3,6. 3,6. 4,5.

      He keeps rolling, the wheels in his head starting to turn.


172                                                                   172
      EXT.   FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY

      Sarah is looking in through the living room windows, trying
      to spot Gary. Giving up, she turns back to the main steps,
      only to find...

      MARGARET,

      who doesn't look pleased.

                            MARGARET
                  I know who you are.

                              SARAH
                  Really.

                            MARGARET
                  I know what you are. And if you
                  come near him again...

                            SARAH
                  You'll what?

      Margaret lets that go unanswered.   There's obviously
      something big we're not privy to.

                            SARAH (CONT'D)
                  What are you going to do, M...

      She's forgotten Margaret's name -- if she ever knew it.

                            SARAH (CONT'D)
                  Sorry, what's he calling you?

                              MARGARET
                  Margaret.

                            SARAH
                  I like that. "Margaret."   Classic.

                            MARGARET
                  Why can't you just leave him alone?

                            SARAH
                  Alone? He's an actor. If nobody's
                  watching him, he doesn't really
                  exist.
                      (approaching)
                  And for the record, I'm not the one
                  deceiving him.
                            (MORE)

                                                                   33.
                            SARAH (CONT'D)
                  He's going to figure it out
                  eventually. And when he does, who
                  do you think he's gonna blame?

       Sarah lets her warning land, then walks past Margaret,
       heading back down the stairs.

       REVEAL Gary watching through the hole in the door.


A173                                                                 A173
       INT. FOYER - DAY

       Gary heard the whole conversation.   Or at least enough of it
       to be deeply freaked out.


173                                                                      173

       INT.   UPSTAIRS WALKWAY - NIGHT

       Margaret leans out her doorway:

                            MARGARET
                  Goodnight, ratface.

                               GARY
                  Goodnight.


175                                                                      175
       INT.   BEDROOM - NIGHT

       Gary sits in one of the upholstered chairs, staring at his
       still-made bed. It's impossible to know what he's thinking,
       but the wheels are turning.


176                                                                      176
       EXT. SIDE PATIO - MORNING

       Gary opens the newspaper to a page at random.   He starts
       circling things with a red Sharpie.

       MACRO CLOSE UP.    His pen circles the number nine every time
       it appears.

       As he flips the page, he spots Sarah looking in through the
       rounded trellis, just a few feet away. She's holding her own
       newspaper, still in the wrapper.

                            SARAH
                  Hey neighbor.

                               GARY
                  Hi.

                                                        34.

                    SARAH
          Sorry for the psychotic episode.
          I'll blame it on hormones.

                    GARY
          Okay.

                    SARAH
          Are you alright? You look a little
          Beautiful Mind-ish.

He almost deflects it, but decides to trust her:

                    GARY
          How many times should the number
          nine come up? Probablistically?

                    SARAH
          Probablistically?

                    GARY
              (annoyed)
          You know what I mean.

                    SARAH
          One time out of ten.

                    GARY
          How about every time?

He hands her the paper through the bars.

                    GARY (CONT'D)
          But they only show up when you look
          for them. Looking for them changes
          things.

Trying to find an explanation...

                    SARAH
          Some of these are prices. There's
          going to be a lot of nines when...

                    GARY
          There is something wrong with the
          world.

Sarah looks up slowly. She smiles for an uncomfortably long
beat. She's stalling, thinking.

                    SARAH
          You have an eyelash on your...
          here...

She steps forward, and motions for him to lean closer to the
bars. Brushing off the non-existent eyelash, she WHISPERS:

                                                                 35.

                           SARAH (CONT'D)
                 I can get you out of here.    But you
                 have to trust me.

                            MARGARET [O.S.]
                 Morning.



      MARGARET

      enters, carrying her tea. She sees Gary by himself, leaning
      near the bars of the trellis.

                           MARGARET
                 Everything okay?

                            GARY
                 Peachy.

                           MARGARET
                 Peachy's good. I like peaches.

      WIDER,

      we see that Sarah is flush back against the wall, out of
      Margaret's line of sight.

                           MARGARET (CONT'D)
                 You want coffee?

                            GARY
                 Sure.

      She turns and heads back into the house.    Once she's out of
      earshot...

                           GARY (CONT'D)
                 What do I do?

                           SARAH
                 You have to trust me.


177                                                                    177
      INT.   LIVING ROOM - DAY [A FEW MINUTES LATER]

      CLOSE ON a white plastic device mounted in the corner of the
      room, about ten feet up. It might be a smoke detector.

      Gary stares up at it, intently.    He steps forward.

      A little red light flicks on inside the unit. After a few
      seconds it turns off. It's some sort of motion detector.

      Gary tests it again, trying to move his arm slowly enough
      that the light never engages.

                                                         36.

Margaret enters, carrying two mugs.   She watches him warily.

                       MARGARET
          You okay?

                       GARY
          No.

                       MARGARET
          Oh.

                    GARY
          Tell me about the Nines.

                       MARGARET
          The Nines?

                       GARY
          The Nines.

                    MARGARET
          Sort of hard to start there...

                    GARY
          Try. And don't tell me I'm
          imagining it. They're showing up
          everywhere, and I want to know why.

Trying to formulate the simplest truthful explanation:

                    MARGARET
          Best guess? They're your
          subconscious trying to remind you
          who you are.

                    GARY
          I'm a Nine?

                    MARGARET
          Yes. It doesn't make a lot of
          sense of out context.
              (offering)
          Coffee?

He takes the mug, then reconsiders.   Maybe it's laced with
something.

                    GARY
          Why don't you drink coffee?   You're
          always drinking tea.

Frustrated, she takes his coffee back and drinks it. She'd
really like to drink the whole thing to prove her point, but
it's just too hot.

                                                              37.

                      MARGARET
          Happy?

She gestures for him to sit down.     Reluctantly, he does.    She
sits across from him.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          You're not going to understand this
          yet, but we've known each other for
          like 25 years. One day when I was
          12, you called me out of the blue.
          And we've been talking ever since.

                      GARY
          Talking.

                    MARGARET
          On the phone. Usually.

                    GARY
          I never met you before I came here.

                    MARGARET
          You, Gary, never met me. But
          you're not always...
              (lacking the words)
          I can understand why you're a
          little confused.

                     GARY
          No.   I'm a lot confused.

                      MARGARET
          Theories?

                    GARY
          This is all a dream.

                      MARGARET
          No.

                    GARY
          I'm in a coma.

                      MARGARET
                (amused)
          No.

                    GARY
          Then I'm dead. This is Hell, or
          Purgatorium or something.

                    MARGARET
          Okay, a purgatorium is where Romans
          vomited. But no. This is as real
          as anything can be.

                                                                38.

                           GARY
                     (suspicious)
                 What does that mean?

      She sits forward in her chair.    By instinct, he sits back.

                           MARGARET
                 Everything is what it is. But
                 you're not who you think you are.

178                                                                   178
      NEW ANGLE (TIME JUMP)

      Gary gets up, headed for the front door.

                            MARGARET (CONT'D)
                 God, no!   Please, Gary, don't.

      But he's already outside.


180                                                                   180
      EXT.   FRONT WALKWAY - DAY

      He's walking towards the blue chalk perimeter line, headed
      for Sarah's house.

      Leaves fall lazily from the trees, counter-point to the
      tension.

      Margaret calls out from the arched windows.

                           MARGARET
                 You don't know what you're doing.

      She's almost at tears.   He stops at the edge of the chalk
      line.

                           GARY
                 What happens if I cross this line?

      The tear in her eye falls.

                           MARGARET
                 I don't know. But it's not good.

      He very deliberately steps over the line. We hear a thin
      BEEPING from the house-arrest anklet. He shoots her a look
      to say, is that all there is?

      But the BEEPING grows louder, deeper. It starts to come from
      all sides, booming, a nuclear-meltdown/self-destruct-sequence-
      activated DRONE.

      Gary suddenly realizes something very, very terrible is about
      to happen.

                                                         39.

                     GARY
          Oh shit.

The world ignites in white-hot atomic flames.

We see the blinding glare erupt behind Margaret, illuminating
through her skin, right to the bone.

The same flash catches a leaf in mid-air, sizzling through it
like an etched x-ray.

As the light hits Gary, we...

                                         CUT TO BLACK.

                                             40.

pilot from conception through delivery. In
keeping with the genre, it's very fast and
cutty.

INTERVIEW sequences are done to an off-
camera interviewer.

Some scenes are unscripted. The gist of
these scenes is summarized in italics.

      EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY

      GAVIN TAYLOR (30) walks to a meeting, with his laptop bag
      over his shoulder. He has a tidy, Banana Republic
      sensibility and an easy smile that belies his manic schedule.

                             SUSAN (V.O.)
                   Gavin Taylor's one of the best TV
                   writers out there.

      Cluttered and corporate, with stacks of scripts and a few
      touches of arbitrary quirk. SUSAN HOWARD (35) and Gavin kiss
      hello.

                             SUSAN (V.O.)
                   Every network would kill to work
                   with him.

                   a woman whose husband disappears.
                   She starts to believe that her
                   daughter is the key to a dark
                   conspiracy.

      INT. SUSINA COFFEESHOP - DAY

      Gavin has coffee with actress MELISSA McCARTHY (34), his best
      friend. He's pitching her the idea.

                          GAVIN (V.O.)
                Melissa McCarthy is my first and
                only choice for the lead.

                             MELISSA
                I love it.     I'll do it.

                Gavin and I have been friends for
                forever.

      Melissa hangs out with her "Gilmore Girls" CAST and CREW.

                           MELISSA (V.O.)
                 It's really hard to leave a show
                 like "Gilmore Girls," but I really
                 believe in Gavin.

      Gavin, Susan and a LINE PRODUCER go over the figures.

                           GAVIN (V.O.)
                 The only way we can afford to shoot
                 the pilot is in Canada.

                 leaving for six weeks.

      A DRIVER holds up a sign for "TAYLOR." Gavin approaches,

       INT.   LAUNDRY ROOM / KITCHEN - DAY

       Gavin unlocks the door, entering from the driveway. He's
       hauling a massive wheeled duffle bag. (Note: This is the
       same house from Part One.)

       We hear the CLATTER of toenails on hardwood floors.   Gavin
       kneels down to greet...

                              GAVIN
                  Puggies!

       Gavin's PUGS pounce all over him.

       INT.   KITCHEN - DAY [MINUTES LATER]

       Gavin is on the cordless phone, talking with a friend as he
       sorts through massive piles of mail.

       On his left wrist, we notice the same green string bracelet
       Gary wore in Part One.

                            GAVIN (ON PHONE)
                  It's weird being back. It doesn't
                  feel like my house anymore.

       INT.   FOYER - DAY

       Gavin sits at the piano, pecking out a haunting melody he's
       been fiddling with. He grabs a red diskette and a Sharpie.

                            GAVIN (V.O.)
                  At this stage, you have the script
                  you wrote, and the film you shot,
                  but you don't know how it's all
                  going to come together. You just
                  know how you want it to feel.

       He writes "Knowing" on the diskette, and pops it into the
       Disclavier unit.

                 Could we be more clear why Mary is
                 so freaked out at that moment?

                          GAVIN
                 Wow. I thought it was pretty
                 obvious. And dramatic.

                           GAVIN [INTERVIEW]
                 More importantly, I trust her as a
                 barometer of Roger's taste.

                           SUSAN
                 I know. But that's Roger's big
                 thing this season. Never let the
                 audience be confused.

      INT. EDITING SUITE - [LATER THAT] DAY

      The Editor hands Melissa a microphone.    TITLES list her
      simply as:

      Melissa McCarthy
      "Mary"

                           GAVIN
                 So we're trying to squeeze in a
                 wild line over this shot of Noelle.

      The monitor shows a three-second clip. It's Melissa and a
      eight year-old actress ("Noelle") in a car.

                                                        46.

Melissa's character looks alarmed by something the girl has
just done or said.

                    MELISSA
          What's the line?

                    GAVIN

          Yeah.

                    MELISSA
          Howkajew. It sounds like kosher
          drug paraphernalia. Like, come on
          Shmuley! Have a toke on the
          Howkajew.

                     GAVIN
          I know. It's just for the test
          screening.

                    MELISSA
          They really think people won't get
          it?

                    GAVIN
          The dumb people might not.

                    MELISSA
          I didn't think we were making the
          show for dumb people.

A beat.

                                         JUMP CUT TO:

Melissa holds a microphone.

As video footage plays back, we hear three evenly-spaced
LOOPING BEEPS. Where the fourth one would be, Melissa says
the line.

      A MODERATOR explains how it all works to the RECRUITED AUDIENCE.

      The test begins.

      ANGLE ON a monitor.         We see a scene of Melissa (as "Mary") on
      a forest road.

      INT.    TESTING SERVICE / FOCUS GROUP ROOM - DAY

      Through a one-way mirror, Gavin and Susan watch as the
      Moderator asks a group of twelve MALE VIEWERS about the pilot
      they just watched.

      Their comments are mostly positive. Gavin and Susan share relieved looks. She has a
      notepad, as always.

      One AGITATED MAN keeps staring at the mirror, right at Gavin.
      (We recognize him as the Parole Officer from Part One.)

                             GAVIN
                   That guy's looking at me.

                             SUSAN
                   He can't see you.

      As a test, Gavin waves his arm. The Agitated Man's
      expression changes slightly, but it's not clear whether it's
      in reaction or not.

      The Moderator directs her next question to the Agitated Man.

                             MODERATOR
                   How about you? Did you feel it
                   was...

                             AGITATED MAN
                   It's not real.

                             MODERATOR
                   And what do you mean by that?

                   The show's not real. Why can't you
                   see that? Jesus! Are you fucking

                   You think you're above it all,
                   don't you? You are trapped here
                   with the rest of them, brother.

      He stands up, pushing past the other people to come right up
      to the one-way glass. He stares directly at Gavin, even
      though he shouldn't be able to see him.

      He SHOUTS:

                              AGITATED MAN (CONT'D)
                   Get out.   Get out! Oblivio
                   accebit!

      Gavin backs away from the glass, freaked out.

      EXT. STREET - [LATER THAT] DAY

      Impromptu INTERVIEW with Gavin, standing beside his Prius.
      He's clearly still shaken by the experience.

                             GAVIN
                   The guy was crazy. Obviously. The
                   show is kinda twisted, and it just
                   flipped something in him.

      Gavin sounds like he's trying to convince himself.

                             GAVIN
                   Oblivio accebit. It's Latin.
                   "Oblivion approaches."

                             PRODUCER'S VOICE (O.C.)
                   What do you think it means?

                   Other than the world is coming to
                   an end? "Oblivio" also means
                   forgetting, forgetfulness.
                       (jump cut)
                   I think that's what I'm going to
                   do. Forget it.

      Gavin hosts a game night: good friends and lots of

      SAM, TOM, BRUCE, DANA, JON, KEVIN, JEFF, DAN, and CARL. (We
      don't show anyone's names.)

      They're playing Celebrity. We go several rounds, keeping the best of what's said.

      INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

      Between rounds of Celebrity, party-goers mingle. Gavin is
      making a new batch of cocktails -- he obviously has a knack
      for it.

      Susan pours herself another glass of chardonnay.

                              SUSAN
                    Did you have a chance to look at
                    the cards yet?

                              GAVIN
                    From the screening?

      Melissa reaches in, grabbing the vodka.

                                  MELISSA
                    Pardon me.      Daddy needs his drink.

      She makes a quick Cape Cod.            From the other room, Sam YELLS:

                              SAM (O.S.)
                    Woman, where's my cocktail!

                              MELISSA
                        (yelling back)
                    I'm a-comin!
                        (to Gavin)
                    I still love you most.

      She gives him a quick peck, then dashes off with Sam's drink.

                              SUSAN
                        (continuing her thought)
                    People write stuff on the cards
                    they won't say in a focus group.
                    They get more specific.

      He SHAKES the mixer.

                              SUSAN (CONT'D)
                    Roger has this advice I always

                             SUSAN (CONT'D)
                   Forget about anyone who scores you
                   in the Twos and Threes. They'll
                   never like your show.

      Gavin pours.

                             SUSAN (CONT'D)
                   Instead, look for the Nines.

                                GAVIN
                   The Nines.

                             SUSAN
                   They're the one who think your show
                   is almost the best thing they've
                   ever seen. They get your vision.
                   They just want it to be even
                   better.

      Melissa YELLS from the living room:

                             MELISSA
                   Round two is starting without you!

                             SUSAN
                   So you'll look at the cards?

                             GAVIN
                   Absolutely.

      Making his way back to the living room, he stops by the
      phone. Pulls out an orange Post-It and makes a note.

                Her overall scores were okay. But
                if you look at the people who
                scored the show highest, the one
                consistent dip was Melissa.

      INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

      Susan and Gavin are having lunch.

                          GAVIN
                She doesn't have a ton to do in the
                pilot. There's so much to set up,
                you don't get a lot of Melissa-
                time.

                          SUSAN
                True. That's one of the challenges
                with a premise pilot.

                          GAVIN
                But the network still likes the
                show?

                          SUSAN
                Of course. Roger is your biggest
                cheerleader.

                          GAVIN
                How about above Roger?

                          SUSAN
                Roger calls the shots.

                          GAVIN
                After he consults with the Higher
                Powers.

                          SUSAN
                True.

                          GAVIN
                Do they like the show?

                          SUSAN
                They haven't seen it. They're
                watching all the pilots on Friday.

      A beat.

                          GAVIN
                Why are you focusing on Melissa?

                                                            52.

                    SUSAN
          Because she's the biggest concern.

                    GAVIN
          She's also the biggest star in the
          show.

                    SUSAN
          No, you're the biggest star. Roger
          made a huge deal with you, and he
          went along with casting Melissa
          when that wasn't his instinct.

                    GAVIN
          Well, hooray for Roger. I don't
          understand what you want me to do.

                    SUSAN
          Meet with someone.

                     GAVIN
          Who?

                    SUSAN
          Dahlia Salem.

Gavin drops his fork so that it will CLATTER on his plate.

                    SUSAN (CONT'D)
          The network has a holding deal with
          her.

                   GAVIN
          Yes. And you put her in Gatin's
          pilot.

                    SUSAN
          It's dead. It's dying. But the
          network loves Dahlia. So if she
          could jump over to your show...

                    GAVIN
          Replace Melissa and reshoot the
          pilot.

                    SUSAN
          Roger would pay for it.

Gavin is nauseous.   He has to take a drink to be able to
speak.

                    GAVIN
          So is this even about Melissa?

                                                                                             53.

                               SUSAN
                     It's about getting your show on the

                     I see why the network loves her.
                     It's just, I wrote the part for
                     Melissa. She's one of my best
                     friends. And in my head, I only
                     see Melissa for the role.
                         (jump cut)
                     Could Dahlia do it? Absolutely.
                     It could work. I just don't know
                     if I want it to work.

      In the background, we see the door to the driveway swing open
      by itself.

                                                              55.

      A beat later, it SLAMS shut.

      Gavin is understandably startled.

                           MELISSA (CONT'D)
                In-between the pilot and the
                series, I'm trying to squeeze in a
                one-woman show.
                    (edit)
                I've always been obsessed with
                nuns. They're sort of like God's
                fag-hags.

      Melissa spots Gavin entering and sings the rest of the song
      to him.

      EXT. WEST HOLLYWOOD BAR - NIGHT

      Gavin and Melissa have martinis.

                          GAVIN
                I think my house is haunted.

                          MELISSA
                Your house is really old.

                          GAVIN
                1926. Ever since I got back, I
                feel like there's someone else
                there. And then last night, I
                thought I heard something. A woman
                singing.

                           MELISSA
                Shit.   Like a ghost?

                                                          56.

                    GAVIN
          I guess. And then I saw something.
          I ran into someone.

                       MELISSA
          The woman?

                    GAVIN
          It was a man. I think it was me.

A beat while Melissa processes.

                    MELISSA
          Your house is haunted by yourself?

                       GAVIN
          Yeah.

                    MELISSA
          Gavin, are you alright?

                       GAVIN
          No.    No.

He takes a long beat, psyching himself up.    What spills out
is heartfelt but clearly rehearsed.

                    GAVIN (CONT'D)
          The network wants to replace you.

                       MELISSA
          Oh my God.

                    GAVIN
          And I'm letting them, because I
          really want the show on the air. I
          have all these characters inside my
          head, and they want to live. I'm
          the only way they can. This is the
          only way they can. I have five
          seasons mapped out, and though it
          sucks, either you go away, or the
          show goes. I had to make a
          decision, and that's the decision I
          made. I'm sorry.

By the end of it, we can hear the emotion in his voice.
Melissa takes a beat to process.

                    MELISSA
          So it's done. Finished.   Decided.

                       GAVIN
          Yes.

                                                        57.

                    MELISSA
          I understand. It's not your fault.
          You're morally incapable of doing
          the right thing.

Gavin doesn't rise to the challenge.

                    MELISSA (CONT'D)
          Don't get me wrong. I think you do
          feel bad for me. But that's all
          you feel for me. You still see me
          as the fat girl you call on Friday
          night when a date falls through.
          Let's go to a movie! Let's go to
          Fubar! And if you meet a hot piece
          of ass, don't worry about Melissa,
          you can apologize tomorrow. Or
          don't! Same difference. It's not
          like we're actually friends.

                    GAVIN
          I don't want to do this on camera.

                    MELISSA
          No, because you can't control it.
          Your little puppets are off their
          strings, running around. Saying
          things you didn't write. Reality
          terrifies you.

                     GAVIN
          Reality.

                     MELISSA
          Yes.

                    GAVIN
          The reality is, you would not be
          here without me. I gave you your
          first few roles. And your career
          is a result of that.

With exaggerated relief...

                    MELISSA
          God, thank you. Thank you for
          finally playing that card. I
          always knew you were holding onto
          it, the "I invented Melissa
          McCarthy card." Congratulations,
          you win. The game is over.

She gets up to go, then decides she has one more thing to
say:

                                                             58.

      She leaves him sitting at the table.

      elevator.

                          DAHLIA

                   And I   think it was shitty for you

                   I "heard" you fired Melissa
                   McCarthy without having a backup.
                   Why would they pick up your show
                   when you don't have a star?

                             GAVIN
                   The network wanted Dahlia.

                   Yeah, in my show. We tested right

                            SUSAN
                      (on phone)
                I'm   at the UTA party. Yeah. Did
                you   hear about Ricky's assistant?
                She   literally shat herself. No, I
                saw   it.

      In the background, we see Gavin approaching. Susan spots him
      and seizes up a bit. She holds up a one-sec finger to him as
      she continues her conversation.

                          GAVIN
                I will break your fucking finger.

                          SUSAN
                    (to phone)
                I'll call you back.

      She hangs up. They look each other in the eye, daring each
      other to go first.

                          SUSAN (CONT'D)
                Roger wanted to talk to you
                personally.

                            GAVIN
                Bullshit.

                          SUSAN
                They're only picking up two dramas.

                          GAVIN
                The rest is, what, reality?

                          SUSAN
                You can go mid-season.

                                                        63.

                    GAVIN
          You can go to Hell.

                      SUSAN
          Wow.

She takes a beat, trying to size him up.

                     SUSAN (CONT'D)
          You think I deliberately sabotaged
          your show.

                    GAVIN
          Didn't you?

                    SUSAN
          G., I'm on your side. Trust me,
          I'm the only one who is trying to
          protect you.

            GAVIN                           SUSAN
Protect me from what?   You?    There is so much more going
You are psychotic.              on than you...

                    GAVIN
          All I want to know is why.

                    SUSAN
          You want a motive?

                      GAVIN
          Yes.

                    SUSAN
          This isn't "Crime Lab."   No one got
          murdered.

                    GAVIN
          My show did. So tell me why.

                    SUSAN
          I had to get you away from her.
          She was holding you back.

                      GAVIN
          Melissa.

                     SUSAN
          You had to give her up.
              (beat)
          C'mon, G. If she really mattered,
          you couldn't have betrayed her so
          easily.

                      GAVIN
          I didn't.

                                                                  64.

                          SUSAN
                What, you're the victim? The big
                Creator can't stand up to one
                little d-girl? It was your choice.
                I didn't make you do anything. I
                mean, do you have any principles?
                Do you believe in anything but your
                own ego?

                            GAVIN
                Fuck you.

                          SUSAN
                Your dialogue used to be sharper.
                Maybe Gatins could do a polish.

      He suddenly punches her, one hit to the face.   She drops
      hard.

      Gavin takes a step back.

      Tasting blood, Susan gets to her knees.   A wry smile.

                          SUSAN (CONT'D)
                Is that all there is?

      In the background, we see partygoers responding to the blow.
      Susan gets to her feet. She approaches Gavin, hands open.
      She's not going to hit him.

                          SUSAN (CONT'D)
                Do you feel like a man? Because
                I'll tell you a secret.

      She leans in very close to his ear.   There's a strange
      intimacy between them.

                          SUSAN (CONT'D)
                    (whisper)
                You're not.

      She walks away.   CLOSE ON Gavin.

      EXT. MANHATTAN SIDEWALK - DAY

      We move with Gavin as he walks. He's trying to get away from
      the camera, but it keeps following him.

      He reaches a crosswalk. He has to wait for the light.
      Finally, he looks INTO CAMERA:

                          GAVIN
                Look, I don't want to do this
                anymore. My show's not going to
                happen, so this show is over.
                          (MORE)

                                                          65.
                       GAVIN (CONT'D)
             Done. Gone. I`m not going to be
             your fucking puppet.

                       OFF-SCREEN VOICE
             Are you alright?

Gavin looks left, where an African-American woman is waiting
for the same crosswalk. (We recognize her as Octavia, the
streetwalker from Part One.)

                         GAVIN
             I'm fine.

                       OCTAVIA
             Who were you talking to?

Gavin looks back towards camera, a strange expression.

MUCH WIDER

We see Gavin and the woman on the corner. There's no camera
Gavin could have been talking to. He's understandably
perplexed: Where did the documentary crew go?

Was there ever anyone there?

Our CAMERA style has changed:    instead of handheld and jerky,
we're smooth and slow.

The MUSIC has completely changed, underscoring a sense of
creeping dread.

We HOLD for a long beat. The light changes. Still a little
unnerved, Octavia begins to cross the street.

Only then do we notice something unusual floating above her
head:

A SPHERE OF BLUE LIGHT.

WIDER, we see that everyone on the street has the same kind
of sphere floating a foot above their heads. No one seems to
see the lights other than Gavin.

Gavin looks around in uneasy fascination, as if he's just
landed on an alien world.

A beat, then he has an unsettling thought.

He slowly looks up. Above his own head, he sees the same
sphere of light -- only his is bright white. Pulsing.
Blinding.

                         GAVIN
             Oh God.

                                                                  66.

       We PULL BACK, RISING UP to a perspective above and behind
       Gavin. As we do, the edges of the frame creep in, revealing
       ICONS and unintelligible STATISTICS, changing moment by
       moment.

       A dialog box appears in the center of the screen, reading...

                                   Exit Now?
                         Unsaved changes will be lost.

                          [ Cancel ]          [ Exit ]

       An arrow slides back and forth between to the two options.
       Finally it lands on `Exit.'

       A CLICK.

                                                  CUT TO BLACK.

                            MARGARET
                  I can understand why you're a
                  little confused.

                             GARY
                  No.   I'm a lot confused.

                              MARGARET
                  Theories?

                            GARY
                  This is all a dream.

                              MARGARET
                  No.

                            GARY
                  I'm in a coma.

                              MARGARET
                        (amused)
                  No.

                            GARY
                  Then I'm dead. This is Hell, or
                  Purgatorium or something.

                                                         67.

                    MARGARET
          Okay, a purgatorium is where Romans
          vomited. But no. This is as real
          as anything can be.

                    GARY
              (suspicious)
          What does that mean?

She sits forward in her chair.   By instinct, he sits back.

                    MARGARET
          Everything is what it is. But
          you're not who you think you are.

                    GARY
          Okay, then. Who am I?

With practiced calm...

                    MARGARET
          You're a multi-dimensional being of
          vast, almost infinite power. You
          created this world on a whim, and
          decided to stick around to see how
          it turned out. You, this body
          you're in, is just one of your
          incarnations. Avatars. Call you
          what you will.

Not sure he follows...

                    GARY
          Are you saying I'm God?

                    MARGARET
          Technically, no. If God is a ten --
          a theoretical ultimate, that-which-
          no-greater-can-be-imagined --
          you're more of a nine.

                    GARY
          So what are you?

                    MARGARET
          Humans are sevens. Monkeys are
          sixes.

                    GARY
          What are the eights?

                    MARGARET
          Koalas. They're telepathic.    Plus,
          they control the weather.

She didn't mean to get on that tangent...

                                                          68.

                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
          What's important is that you,
          you're the big cheese. El Supremo.
          You could destroy the world with a
          single thought.
              (suddenly)
          Don't, incidentally. Just file
          that away. But the truth is, you
          hold all the cards: every church,
          every candle, every sacrifice --
          that's for you. When people pray,
          they're not praying because they
          want this thing or that thing.
          They just don't want to be
          forgotten.

                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
          So you understand, I would have
          told you earlier, but I didn't...

                    GARY
          Yeah.

                    MARGARET
          Okay.

                    GARY
          I understand. But I don't believe
          you.

He gets up to exit. (This is where we jump-cut time earlier.)

      EXT. MEADOW - DAY

      In a WIDE SHOT, we see a vast field, bordered by green
      mountains. Unseen BIRDS call out from the trees, while
      insects CLICK and WHIRR.

      In the distance, we spot swatches of bright colors moving our
      way. It's a family: father GABRIEL (34), wife MARY (33) and
      daughter NOELLE (8). They're returning from a short day
      hike. Mary carries a small videocamera.

      Seeing that Noelle is already a ways down the path...

                            GABRIEL
                 Noelle!   Don't get too far ahead.

      Noelle turns around. Instead of speaking, she moves her
      hands in sign language. (She's mute, not deaf.)

                            MARY
                 No.   You had ice cream at lunch.

      Noelle begs to differ.   More signing.

                           GABRIEL
                     (to Mary)
                 Apparently frozen yogurt doesn't
                 count.

                           MARY
                 I'll make note.

      EXT. SMALL GRAVEL ROAD - DAY

      The family walks up to their car, a blue Toyota Prius.
      Gabriel sheds his daypack, trying to open the hatchback.    It
      won't lift.

      Mary goes to open the passenger door.      Locked.

                           MARY
                 Did you hit it?

                           GABRIEL
                 Shouldn't have to.

                                                             70.

He fishes the keys out of his pocket.     Presses the remote
entry button repeatedly.

Gabriel tries to open the driver's side door.      Locked.   Even
Noelle knows something's wrong.

Gabriel pulls the small mechanical key out of the fob.
Unlocks the door and climbs in. Opens the door for Mary and
Noelle.

                    GABRIEL (CONT'D)
          I think we left the overhead light
          on.

He taps it.   Moves the switch.

                     MARY
          Shit.

Noelle signs her made-up representation of "shit."

                     MARY (CONT'D)
          Noelle.

Gabriel slides the key into the slot.     Hits "START."
Nothing.

                    GABRIEL
          Battery is dead. Least the starter
          is.

Noelle leans forward, aware that this is something serious.

                    MARY
          How do we...?

                    GABRIEL
          We call the service.     That's all we
          can do.

                    MARY
          It's just the little battery that's
          dead, right? The big one is
          probably fine.

                     GABRIEL
          I guess.

                    MARY
          We can't jump it from one battery
          to the other? Cross-over somehow?

                    GABRIEL
          Who did you marry?      MacGyver?

                                                          71.

He gets out of the car, retrieving his cell phone. Mary
follows him out. Noticing that he's not dialing...

                    MARY
          Are you getting a signal?

                      GABRIEL
          No.    Do you?

She checks her phone.    A long beat.

                       MARY
          Yes!     One bar.

They're both relieved. Finding the AAA card in his wallet,
Gabriel takes the phone and dials.

It's at this moment we notice the familiar green string
bracelet around Gabriel's wrist.

In the back seat, Noelle KNOCKS on the window.   She signs,
asking if everything is okay.

                    MARY (CONT'D)
          We're okay. Daddy's calling people
          to help us.

Gabriel pulls the phone from his ear.   Looks at the screen.
Hits redial. Fuck.

                    GABRIEL
          The minute you try to place a call,
          the bar goes away.

                    MARY
          Keep trying.

                    GABRIEL
          Okay, I'll keep trying, Mary.   But
          it will keep happening.

                    MARY
          Well, what do you want to do?

                    GABRIEL
          I don't know.

He tries redial.

                    MARY
          Maybe if you hold it up higher.

Humoring her, he holds it at arm's length.   No good.

                                                                72.

                          GABRIEL
                The problem is we're boxed in.
                It's a canyon.

      A beat.

                          GABRIEL (CONT'D)
                Where we turned off the main road,
                it was more open. And higher, too.

                          MARY
                That's at least a mile.

                          GABRIEL
                I can run that.

                          MARY
                So...we stay here?

                          GABRIEL
                You okay with that?

                          MARY
                I don't think we have a choice, so,
                yeah. Go.

      Half a beat, while each waits for the other to think of a
      better plan. Neither does.

      Gabriel leans down next to Noelle's window.

                           GABRIEL
                Daddy's going to get a truck to
                help us out. You take care of your
                mom, okay?

      Noelle nods.

                          GABRIEL (CONT'D)
                I'll be right back.

      Gabriel gives Mary a quick peck and starts running down the
      road.

      We MOVE IN on Noelle, who smiles a little.

                                                 CUT TO:


303                                                                   303
      EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - DAY

      Gravel CRUNCHES under Gabriel's shoes as he runs.    He keeps
      an easy pace.

      In VARIOUS SHOTS, we get a sense of the distance he's
      travelling. He passes gulches, meadows and boulder fields.

                                                                 73.

      He finally arrives at the junction of the dirt road and a
      larger...


304                                                                     304
      EXT. PAVED ROAD - DAY [CONTINUOUS]

      Pulling out Mary's cell phone, Gabriel tries to get a signal.
      By his reaction, it's still iffy.

      He dials, but the call drops.    Tries again.   Just the same.

      He looks left.   Looks right.    Looks back down the dirt road.

      He decides to head off to the right, downhill.


305                                                                     305
      EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD - DAY

      We catch up to Gabriel as he's walking in the middle of the
      road, still trying unsuccessfully to get a signal.

      In the distance, he spots a patch of moving color: a female
      hiker. A moment's hesitation, then he YELLS out to her:

                             GABRIEL
                Excuse me!     Hi! Hello?

      She stops, turns.

      Gabriel jogs to close the distance. As we approach, we
      reveal SIERRA, 38. In the past 10 years, she's "made a fresh
      start" 12 times. In this incarnation, she's a wilderness-
      loving, Bush-hating, wildly-overeducated clerk at Trader
      Joe's in Venice.

                             GABRIEL (CONT'D)
                Excuse me.     Do you have a cell
                phone?

                          SIERRA
                No, I don't. There's no service up
                here.

                          GABRIEL
                    (re: his phone)
                Yeah, I'm finding that out.

                          SIERRA
                You can usually get a signal up at
                the ranger station.

                             GABRIEL
                Okay...

      She points in the opposite direction -- back the way he came.

                                                                74.

                     SIERRA
           You follow the road. It's
           probably... I don't know. You have
           a car?

                        GABRIEL
           It's dead.     That's why I need...

                        SIERRA
           Oh...

She pulls a stray hair back from her mouth.       Notices him
noticing her.

                        GABRIEL
           Yeah.

A beat.   She takes a subtle step closer to the center of the
road.

                     GABRIEL (CONT'D)
           Are you headed back to your car
           now? If you could give me a ride
           to a gas station, wherever...

She doesn't leap to extend an invitation.        It takes a beat
for Gabriel to figure out why.

                     GABRIEL (CONT'D)
           Oh. Hey. Look, I'm not some crazy
           Ted Bundy guy. I'm not going to
           rape you or kill you or anything.

She doesn't seem reassured.

                     GABRIEL (CONT'D)
           Of course, that's what Ted Bundy
           would say. Look, I'm a videogame
           designer.
               (fishing through wallet)
           My wife is an editor. My daughter
           is four.

He offers her a family photo.     She looks at it, but doesn't
take it.

                     GABRIEL (CONT'D)
           They're waiting back at the car,
           and I want to get some help before
           it gets dark.

                     SIERRA
           I can call somebody when I get to
           town.

Trying to temper his frustration...

                                                                75.

                          GABRIEL
                I believe you. I do. But you
                don't know where the car is. And
                the guy might not come. We can't
                be up here all night.

      Sierra backs away.

                             SIERRA
                I'm sorry.

                          GABRIEL
                Don't be sorry. Just help me out
                here.

                           SIERRA
                No.   I can't. I'm sorry.

      Once she feels she's reached a good distance, she turns and
      keeps walking.

                          GABRIEL
                Why won't you trust me?

      She doesn't turn back, heading down the road.

      EXT. ROAD / INT. PRIUS - DAY

      Mary is sitting in the back seat of the Prius with Noelle,
      who's getting tired of her coloring book.

      Noelle signs something to Mary, who considers the request.

                          MARY
                Okay, but you have to be careful,
                understand? You have to use Big
                Girl hands.

      Noelle nods. Mary hands her the small video camera. Noelle
      has some trouble folding out the little screen, but
      eventually gets it open without any help from her mom.

                          MARY (CONT'D)
                Do you want to see where we were
                today?

      Noelle nods.

      Mary takes the camera back for a second, flipping it to
      playback mode and rewinding. The blocky video footage zips
      past.

                                                               76.

                          MARY (CONT'D)
                Okay, now hit play. This button.

      Noelle does. On the tiny screen, we see Noelle and her
      father eating lunch by a waterfall. (Mary is filming.)

                          MARY (CONT'D)
                There's you. And there's Daddy.
                You're a little movie star, huh?

      Noelle smiles.   Signs something.

                          MARY (CONT'D)
                He'll be back soon. Don't you
                worry.

      EXT. PAVED ROAD - DAY

      Gabriel continues walking, headed back in the direction he
      came. From behind him...

                           SIERRA (O.S.)
                Hey!

      He turns, finding her a ways back.   She approaches.

                          GABRIEL
                Were you following me?

                          SIERRA
                Once I was sure you weren't
                following me. I'm sorry, it's
                just...

                          GABRIEL
                You thought I was Ted Bundy.

                           SIERRA
                Kinda.

                          GABRIEL
                My name's Gabriel.   Bundy.

      She smiles.

                           SIERRA
                Sierra.

      They shake.

                          SIERRA (CONT'D)
                Weird that there's no cars.    At
                all.

                                                                   77.

                            GABRIEL
                 Yeah.

                           SIERRA
                 So, listen. I'm parked that way.

      She points off the road, through the forest.

                           SIERRA (CONT'D)
                 It's not that far. If you want,
                 I'll give you a ride to town.

                            GABRIEL
                 Really?

                            SIERRA
                 Yeah.   Make up some karma.

                           GABRIEL
                 Lead the way.

      She does. They cross off the pavement, descending into a
      dark forest.

      EXT.   FOREST - DAY

      Gabriel walks with Sierra. The trees here are taller,
      creating a cathedral-like ceiling above them.

                           SIERRA
                 Okay, confession.    I kind of
                 recognized you.

                            GABRIEL
                 Really?

                           SIERRA
                 I wasn't sure, but I think I saw a
                 picture of you in some videogame
                 magazine my boyfriend had. You're,
                 like, the shit.

                            GABRIEL
                 No.

                           SIERRA
                 You're like the Quentin Tarantino
                 of that world. A videogame God.

                           GABRIEL
                 Not really.

                                       78.

           SIERRA
Fine.

           GABRIEL
You seriously recognized me off of
one photo?

          SIERRA
I thought you were kinda hot.
Considering.

          GABRIEL
Considering..?

          SIERRA
Within the subset of videogame
people.

           GABRIEL
Okay.

          SIERRA
I wasn't masturbating to your
picture or anything.

          GABRIEL
Well, I guess I'm flattered.

          SIERRA
You should be. I'm stingy with
compliments.

          GABRIEL
So your boyfriend plays videogames?

          SIERRA
Ex-boyfriend. And yes. Way too
many. He used to play Evercrack
back in the day, but yours, well,
that was like...what's worse than
crack?

          GABRIEL
Super-crack?

           SIERRA
Sure.   He was this orc witch doctor
guy.

           GABRIEL
Shaman?

          SIERRA
Yeah. At one point he was spending
like, 40 hours a week gathering
"thunderleaf" or whatever.

                Then I was his mule, hauling it

      EXT. ROAD NEAR PRIUS - DAY

      Mary is pacing -- but trying not to look like she's pacing.
      She holds the other cell phone (Gabriel's), which she turns
      on and off, hoping that somehow she'll get a signal.

      Each time she turns it on, we hear the CHIMES.

      IN THE PRIUS

      Noelle is still playing with the video camera, watching
      footage of the hike. She decides to wind back further.

      CLOSE ON the blocky pixels rushing past.

      Noelle hits "play."   For now, we just hear the audio.

                          MAN'S VOICE
                ...I have five seasons mapped out,
                and though it sucks, either you go
                away, or the show goes. I had to
                make a decision, and that's the
                decision I made. I'm sorry.

      We reveal the screen. We're watching the argument between
      Gavin and Melissa from Part 2.

                          MELISSA (ON TAPE)
                So it's done. Finished. Decided.

                            GAVIN (ON TAPE)
                Yeah.

      Confused, Noelle looks out at her mother, Mary, who is still
      pacing with the cell phone.

                          MELISSA (ON TAPE)
                I understand.

                                                                 80.

                             GAVIN (ON TAPE)
                 You do?

                           MELISSA (ON TAPE)
                 I understand. It's not your fault.
                 You're morally incapable of doing
                 the right thing.

      Sierra continues to lead the way. She seems confident where
      she's headed, even though there's no real path.

      During the conversation, we notice a small tattoo on her
      right shoulder blade: IX.

                           SIERRA
                 So you play a lot of characters at
                 once?

                             GABRIEL
                 A couple.    Most people do.

                           SIERRA
                 You're not most people. You
                 created the world. You know all
                 the secret codes.

                           GABRIEL
                 What, like `God mode'?

                           SIERRA
                 That's what you call it?

                           GABRIEL
                 That's when you have all the
                 powers, and you can't be killed.
                 It's fine when you're designing,
                 but it's really boring to play. A
                 game isn't fun unless there are
                 rules.

                           SIERRA
                 And you make the rules.

                           GABRIEL
                 Yes I do. I mean, you want to give
                 everyone freedom, but they can't
                 handle it. Half your players are
                 teenage boys, and it's like they're
                 programmed to be destructive.

       Sarah offers Gary her water bottle, which he gladly takes.

       Out of nowhere...

                    Do you think I'm pretty?

       She stops, turning to face him.

                              GABRIEL
                    What?

                              SIERRA
                    Do you think I'm hot?   On a purely
                    physical level.

                              GABRIEL
                    Sure.

       He drinks.

                              SIERRA
                    That's a rave.

                              GABRIEL
                    Well, I don't know why you're
                    asking.

                              SIERRA
                    My ex-boyfriend, the orc, he says,
                    "What I like about you is that
                    you're not so hot that I'm afraid
                    of losing you."

                              GABRIEL
                    So where's the orc now?

                              SIERRA
                    He's dead. I spiked his water
                    bottle with a massive quantity of
                    GHB. He hallucinated, went into
                    convulsions and died.

       He screws the cap back on the water bottle and hands it back.

                              GABRIEL
                    Remind me not to piss you off,
                    Sarah.

                                                                   82.

                            SIERRA
                Sierra.

      He's surprised.    He could have sworn her name was Sarah.

                            GABRIEL
                Sorry.

                          SIERRA
                And what makes you think you
                haven't pissed me off already?

      She smiles, keeps walking.

      Mary sits down in the front passenger seat of the car.
      Noelle is still in back, watching footage on the video
      camera.

                          MARY
                How are you doing, kiddo?

      Noelle doesn't look up.

                          MARY (CONT'D)
                I was thinking we could all go to
                El Cholo for dinner. How would you
                feel about some blue corn
                enchiladas? Should we ask Daddy
                when he gets back?

      Without looking up...

                          NOELLE
                He's not coming back.

      Mary is stunned. For her part, Noelle seems to have no idea
      she just spoke her first words.

      We hear three evenly-spaced BEEPS.    After the third one, Mary
      says:

                          MARY
                How could you...

      Mary flinches.    It's like someone walked over her grave.

      Noelle hands her the camera. The footage is cued to earlier
      in Part 2, where Gavin is having Melissa loop in a wild line:

                           MELISSA (ON TAPE)
                Howkajew. How could you. How

                 That's how I like ya.

      Mary backs out of the car, as if trying to get away from the
      video camera. But she's still holding it.

      She hits STOP.   Tries to collect herself.

      Noelle gets out of the car, but doesn't approach.      She signs,
      "Mommy?"

      Mary backs away.

      Gabriel and Sierra stop for a moment, so he can pull off his
      outer shirt. For the first time, we see that Gabriel has a
      large tattoo on his back which looks like this:

                                     IX
      He's sweating a lot.

                           GABRIEL
                 Am I crazy, or is it getting
                 hotter?

                           SIERRA
                 Oh, you're crazy.

      She hands him back the water bottle.   He gladly drinks.

      When she takes the bottle back, she steps forward. The
      motion leaves them face-to-face. She pauses for a moment,
      just long enough for him to turn away.

      He doesn't.

      She kisses him. He doesn't really kiss back -- but he
      doesn't fight it, either.

      She puts a hand on his thigh, sliding up the inside.     Only
      when she reaches his crotch does he pull back.

                           GABRIEL
                 I have a wife. And a daughter.
                 They're waiting for me.

                           SIERRA
                 Where are they?

                                                                 84.

                           GABRIEL
                 Back at the car.

                           SIERRA
                 I mean, which direction?

                           GABRIEL
                 They're back...

      Gabriel turns, trying to get his bearing.      The trees BLUR.
      He nearly falls over.

      He manages to steady himself.

                           SIERRA
                 Face it, G.: You don't know where
                 they are. You don't know where you
                 are. We've been walking in circles
                 for an hour.

                           GABRIEL
                 Where's your car?

                           SIERRA
                 There is no car. That was all a...
                     (what's the word)
                 "pretense," I guess. An excuse to
                 get you alone.

      Wobbling, Gabriel sits down on a stump.   Sierra kneels down
      in front of him.

                           SIERRA (CONT'D)
                 Dizzy, huh? It's probably just the
                 GHB. In the water.

      She holds up the water bottle.

      Gabriel experienced the flashbacks.   He felt time move.

                 That's right. Just let it go.       Let
                 it go.

      She's genuinely empathetic -- she doesn't enjoy his
      suffering.

                 checked in every once in a while.

                           G.
                 It was warm. And white.    Like...

       EXT.   GRAVEL ROAD / NEAR THE PRIUS - DAY

       Mary is sitting on the road. Noelle has her chin on her
       mother's shoulder, watching the videotape with her.

       ON SCREEN, with tinny audio: (from scene 177)

                             MARGARET
                  You could destroy the world with a
                  single thought.
                      (suddenly)
                  Don't, incidentally. Just file
                  that away. But the truth is, you
                  hold all the cards: every church,
                  every candle, every sacrifice --
                  that's for you. When people pray,
                  they're not praying because they
                  want this thing or that thing.
                  They just don't want to be
                  forgotten.

       Mary is still watching the tape. She realizes Noelle isn't
       watching over her shoulder anymore.

       Mary looks around.    Her daughter is nowhere to be seen.

                              MARY
                  Noelle?    Noelle!

       EXT.   FOREST CROSSROADS - DAY

       Gabriel and Sierra are back at the junction where the paved
       road meets the gravel road.

                            GABRIEL
                  Maybe if I just cut back, didn't
                  get so involved...

                            SIERRA
                  We both know that'll never work.
                  Next week, you'll be back here
                  redesigning the pinecones. You
                  have to quit cold-turkey.

                              GABRIEL
                  I can't.

                                                                  89.

                           SIERRA
                  You can. But I can't force you to
                  leave. You have to want it.

       She takes his hand, running a finger through the green string
       bracelet around his wrist.

       She kisses him.   And then she's gone.

       Gabriel stands there for a long beat, considering his
       decision.

                  Noelle!   Noelle!

       She's nowhere to be found.     Then, from behind her...

                            GABRIEL
                  She's here.

       Gabriel is walking up the gravel road, with Noelle holding
       his hand.

                            GABRIEL (CONT'D)
                  I didn't forget you guys.

       Mary regards him as a familiar stranger, a beloved imposter.

                            MARY
                  Everything okay?

                            GABRIEL
                  Absolutely. Let's go home.

       MUSIC BEGINS, a song that will carry us through the next
       sequence.

       Gabriel climbs into the driver's seat. Both Mary and Noelle
       watch with interest as he pushes the "START" button. The car
       BEEPS and engages without any problem.

       Everyone fastens their seatbelts.

      The Prius drives down the gravel road. Mary tries to keep

      Gabriel, trying to read what he's thinking.

      INT.   KITCHEN / EXT.   BACK YARD - DAWN

      Gabriel stands in the doorway, looking out at the inky-blue
      sky. His eyes are red, tired. He hasn't slept at all.

      It's very quiet, except for the occasional precocious BIRD
      CALL.

      Mary enters from the living room, still in her pajamas.   He
      knows she's there. Neither wants to speak.

                           MARY
                 You need to go, don't you?

                            GABRIEL
                 No.   I can stay.

                           MARY
                 How long? Forever? Every day,
                 you'd know what you were missing.

      He smiles, a little.

                           MARY (CONT'D)
                 What happens? If you go.

                           GABRIEL
                 Worst-case scenario? Spontaneous
                 disintegration into a fiery void.
                 Oblivio accebit. The end of
                 everything.

                           MARY
                 That's all?

      Both smile.

                           GABRIEL
                 That probably wouldn't happen. The
                 basic structure of the universe
                 should hold. I guess I'm just
                 worried about the human factor.
                 You guys kill each other a lot.

                                                 92.

                    MARY
          In fairness, that's usually in your
          name. Plus we've gotten much more
          efficient at it.

A beat.

                    GABRIEL
          I like this world. I like my life,
          here, with you and Noelle...

                    MARY
          But it's not real. I'm not really
          your wife, you're not really my
          husband. On some level, it's all
          pretend.

                    GABRIEL
          It's not pretend. There's a reason
          you were there, in every version.
          You were my sister, my wife, my
          best friend...

                    MARY
          That's a little creepy.

                    GABRIEL
          I wanted you close. In one
          version, I even told you. I warned
          you that some day they might come
          for me, and...

                    MARY
          ...You'd have to leave.   How many
          versions were there?

                     GABRIEL
          Ninety.   This is the last one.

                     MARY
          Wow.

                    GABRIEL
          I've destroyed billions of people
          with a thought. Obliterated them.
          And you'd like to think it's
          painless...

                    MARY
          Stop. You don't have to explain, or
          apologize. Everything that is, is
          because of you. If that's all,
          that's enough.

With that, there's really nothing more to say.

                                                           93.

                      MARY (CONT'D)
          So.

                      GABRIEL
          So.

                    MARY
          Guess you don't really need to pack
          anything.

                      GABRIEL
          I'm good.

                    MARY
          You're great. It's been a
          pleasure.

                      GABRIEL
          Likewise.    I love you.

                    MARY
          Love you, too. Ya big lug.

He kisses her. It's not a big, passionate, movie-ending
kiss, but rather a fond kiss farewell. At the end of it, he
WHISPERS into her ear:

                    GABRIEL
          You're my favorite.

She smiles.

With two fingers, Gabriel BREAKS the green string bracelet
around his left wrist.

And in that moment, a film passes over him, like the boundary
between water and air.

He's stepped out of this dimension.

Mary is frozen with the same smile on her face, but we notice
that she and the kitchen around her have flattened out to two-
dimensional images.

She and everything around her has become like wallpaper,
slowly curling away, revealing emptiness beneath.

Gabriel collapses into a single, spiky sphere of light.

The light moves through the kitchen, creating waves that
ripple through the tissue-thin walls.

Picking up speed, the sphere rushes through the window,
heading west.

                                                                  94.

      EXT.   LOS ANGELES - DAY

      As the light flies out over Hancock Park, the mansions and
      skyscrapers seem unreal, like models.

      Reaching Santa Monica, we pass over the ferris wheel at the
      end of the pier.

      We dive into the blue ocean beneath us, which becomes only a
      swirling gray fog with a viscous thickness.

      We see three lights in the distance.    We join them, moving
      with them.

      Further ahead, more lights, circling. It's a loose spiral
      made of stars, resembling nothing so much as the number 9.

      As we get closer and closer, we...

                                                  MATCH CUT TO:


      A PALE EYE,

      INT.     KITCHEN - MORNING

      Hands reach up, expecting to find glasses, but there are
      none.

      As we PULL OUT, we reveal it's not Mary, Melissa or Margaret,
      but a fourth person -- just slightly different from any of
      them. We'll call her M.

      She looks first to the spot where Gabriel was standing.

      Empty.

                             MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                   Honey, do we have nutmeg?

      M looks over at husband Ben, who is busy making pancakes,
      reading from a recipe.

                                M 
                   We should.

      Coming around from behind Ben, Noelle checks through the
      spice drawer. M watches her with cautious fascination.

                             BEN
                   Cinnamon, too.

                                                         95.

M catches her reflection in the toaster.   Notices she looks
different than she expected.

                    NOELLE
              (to Ben)
          If I had a horse...

Noelle turns back with the spices, handing them to Ben one at
a time.

                    NOELLE (CONT'D)
          I would name her Cinnamon.

                       BEN
          Really.

          And if I had another horse...

                       BEN
          Nutmeg?

                       NOELLE
          No, Flash.

                       M 
          Sweetie?

She beckons Noelle over. Tucks back the little girl's hair.
Keeping her voice low enough so Ben can't hear:

                    M  (CONT'D)
          This is going to sound really
          strange, but...what's my name?

Noelle only gives her a half-crazy look.

                    NOELLE
          Mmmmmmmmmm-Mommy.

Noelle smiles.   M smiles too, a little embarrassed.

                      M 
          Right.    Exactly.

Noelle looks her right in the eye.

                    NOELLE
          He's not coming back. But it's
          gonna be okay. He put the pieces
          together, it's like...

                    M 
          The best of all possible worlds.

Noelle taps her nose.

                                                          96.

                       BEN
            Honey? Is it supposed to stick
            like this?

Sharing a look...

                      M 
            We should help him.

Noelle agrees.   They head over to assist.

We MOVE ACROSS the family as they work on the pancakes,
Noelle directing how big the ears on hers should be.

We leave them in the middle of a messy kitchen, gooey
pancakes, and a good life.


FADE OUT.




                             THE END

                                                                97.


     ADDITIONAL MATERIAL

     The following scene (Scene 99) is the conversation between S
     and G that plays near the end of Part Three. The plan is to
     shoot this scene in almost every setup of the film that
     involves both characters -- be it in Part One, Two or Three.

     So we'll be shooting this scene a lot. We'll then be
     intercutting the best of all these moments to create one
     sequence.


99                                                                    99
     INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS

                         S.
               It's not that hard to make a
               universe. At first, you just
               checked in every once in a while.
               See how the Neanderthals were
               doing. Move some continents
               around. But then you got more into
               it. Starting playing a couple of
               characters of your own. Kings.
               Slaves. Messiahs. Pretty soon,
               you were playing 24/7.

                         G.
               How long have I..?

                         S.
               You've been gone for four thousand
               years. Not that time means the
               same for us, but...

                         G.
               You came looking for me.

                         S.
               That's what a girl does.

                           G.
               Why now?

                         S.
               We couldn't just storm in on a
               fiery chariot. It's your universe.
               We had to play by your rules. We
               had to make you see how limited and
               corrupt your little world was.
               Don't get me wrong, this world is
               nice. It's cozy. But do you
               remember where you came from?

     A few beats while it comes back to him. Tears start to build
     in his eyes. What he's picturing is unspeakably beautiful.

                                    98.

          G.
It was warm. And white.   Like...

           S.
You can't describe it with human
words. You can't think it with
human thoughts.
    (beat)
That's why you have to come back.
Come back with us. With me.
