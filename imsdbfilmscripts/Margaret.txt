          From across Broadway we see a little girl waiting at the
          curb. She steps off the curb toward us --
          A TRUCK BARRELS into frame -- The long lens' flattened
          perspective makes it look like she's just been crushed. But
          the truck flashes by and she's fine. More traffic passes to
          and fro through the frame.

          The LIGHT CHANGES and a crowded corner full of New Yorkers
          step off the curb and into the crosswalk -- Before the first
          foot lands on the street we go to SUPER SLOW MOTION as the
          mid-day work crowd crosses the street.

          An 11th-grade math class at the Ralph Waldo Emerson School,
          one of the few remaining Manhattan '60s-inspired progressive
          schools. About twenty kids, mostly white secular Jewish. A
          sprinkling of black and Hispanic kids.
          The teacher, MR AARON, late 20s, is returning test papers.

          their chairs.

          Well, Lisa, that's just not necessarily
          true. Haven't you ever developed an 
          interest in something you didn't initially
          think you were going to develop an interest
          in?

          Anyway, it was open book. So what's the big
          difference-between using a book and like, I
          don't know, using somebody else's mind
          who's like, really good at math? It's not
          like this person did the whole test for me.

          big fan of all the Presidents of the United
          States, especially the current one, but I
          still don't think its necessarily all that
          useful to categorize every President as
          universally corrupt, because that just
          seems very general to me. Especially if
          you're going to judge them by the standard
          of -- whatever they're supposed to
          traditionally be like in some mythical

          right in front of her, and that her blood is spreading
          everywhere. Monica is reaching out vaguely, unable to speak.
          She is making choking sounds.

          to put her hands. Other people start converging.

          I grew up five years in Panama, four years
          in Holland, then nine years in Paris. After
          I finish university, I moved back to
          Colombia. So: when I'm speaking French,
          they think I'm Spanish. When I'm speaking

          I have a company: We design computer
          software to help companies in South
          American countries.that use an incompatible
          software, so the computers can't talk to
          each other. It's a big problem in Central
          and South America, where there is not
          usually so much coordination in computer
          communications. So right now there's a big
          opportunity for us, because for the big
          software companies it's still in the
          backwoods. That's changing already, but in
          the last ten years we have done extremely
          well. It's the next ten years we're going
          to see what happens.

          Are you aware that things have gotten to
          the point where I now have to hear things
          about you from other people and I can't
          even correct them because I no longer have
          any first-hand information about you
          myself?

          Nothing. I just feel like we used to be
          really close -- like, up until a few days
          ago. And I'm not really getting that from
          you anymore.

          I can't believe you just said that to me.
          That was really hard for me to say, and
          that's you response?

                         PAUL
          You don't have to be cool. All youhaveto

          He gives her the spoon. She snorts it.

          And then you wanna do the other nostril
          because you always want to be symmetrical.
          Very important.
          She snorts some up the other nostril. Paul does some too and
          closes the vial. _

          I'm sorry. It just sounded like you just
          asked me about my girlfriend.

          Oh, never mind...
          They make out. He immediately starts feeling her up. She
          pushes his hand away.

          You're not serious.

          I guess I'm not very consistent.

          it is. And I'm just gonna be this little

          like, voice-Over to Voice Over. I mean rich

          But how about those people yelling "Bravi!"
          and "Brava!"

                         RAMON
          How do you mean?

                         JOAN
          It's just so pretentious. "Bravi!" "Bravi!"
          Why can't they just say "Bravo?"

                         RAMON
          Well, it's the plural.

                         JOAN
          I know --

                         RAMON
          It's the plural of "bravo." It's what they
          say to acknowledge the ensemble.

                         JOAN
          No, I know, I know it's correct, it just --
          don't you think there was something a 
          little pretentious about those people? 

                         RAMON
          Pretentious?

                         JOAN
          I don't mean they didn't really enjoy
          it...But you know how you can really be
          enjoying something -- but you're also kind
          of looking around out of the corner of your
          eye -- because you know people are watching
          you enjoy it...? Does that make sense at
          all?

                         RAMON
          Yes, but I wouldn't say that it was
          pretentious. In Italian you say "Bravo" for 
          a man and "Brava" for a woman, and "Bravi"
          for the whole company.

          You use the masculine for the male singer
          and the feminine for the female singer.

          Yeah...Anyway, I really enjoyed it. Thank
          you.

          people in this room. I'm not saying I'm not
          gonna do my job, but for some reason, a lot
          of the actors in this show seem to think
          that this whole show is about them. And I
          think I speak for a lot of the techies when
          I say that I feel really unappreciated and
          basically fucked over. And I don't know if

          Yes, thank you, Emily.

                         EMILY
          As you all know, Monica was not a religious
          woman. Anybody who ever had to sit through
          a wedding or a funeral with her knows how
          she felt about formal occasions. So Harry
          and Elise and I, when we were talking about
          this, decided we would just have everyone
          over and let.anyone who wanted to.talk.
          about Monica just talk about her. Maybe
          share some remembrances of her. Some of us
          know each other, some of us don't. But
          we're all here because we loved Monica.
          (She stops. Gets a hold of herself) And 
          because we want to pay tribute to her in a
          way that might conceivably not enrage her.
          Everyone laughs slightly.

                         EMILY (CONT'D)
          I don't want to tell anyone what to think,
          or how to feel. And I don't want to kid
          myself about the stupid, meaningless way
          she died, because it would really make her
          throw up. But I don't want it to become the
          summation of her life. Because it's not.
          When her Lisa died I said to her, "How can
          you stand it?" And she said. "First of all
          I can't. But I don't want to take away the
          twelve years she did have, and turn them
          all into leukemia. Because they weren't."
          So despite the fact that she got -- ripped
          off, I do think it's important to remember
          that Monica got a lot out of life. She was
          the most fully developed person I
          personally have ever known. She was also
          impossible to get along with, but that's
          another story.
          Everybody laughs. 

                          EMILY (CONT'D)
          As most of you know, she had more than her
          share of trouble over the years. But that
          never diminished her compassion or stopped
          her from embracing life to the absolute
          fullest -- measure.

          You know what, Lisa? That's not good
          enough. That's not good enough.
          Shakespeare wrote something: What's your
          response? And don't tell me you don't have
          one because I don't buy it.

                         LISA
          I don't really have a lot to say. It seems

          I think it is self-evident. I think he's
          saying that human beings don't mean any
          more to the gods than flies do to little
          boys who like to torture them for fun.

                         DARREN
          (responding in kind)
          Thank you, Matthew. Yeah, I agree. Only
          it's not Shakespeare saying it: It's
          Gloucester. Maybe another character would
          have a different point of view.

                         JOHN
          OK: That's a valid point. Just because
          Shakespeare has one of his characters say
          it doesn't mean he personally agrees with
          it. Yes: David?

                         DAVID
          Yeah, maybe Shakespeare isn't saying the
          gods don't care about us. Maybe he's saying
          there's a higher consciousness that we
          can't see. That the gods' perception of
          reality is so much more developed than ours
          that compared to their perception, our
          perceptions are like comparing flies to

                         BOYS

                         JOHN
          OK...I don't think that's what he's getting
          at...I think what he's getting at here is a
          very dark view of the arbitrary nature of
          human suffering.

                         DAVID
          But maybe he's not. Maybe he's comparing
          human consciousness to divine
          consciousness, and he's saying that even
          though it seems to us that human suffering
          is just arbitrary, that's just because
          we're limited by our viewpoint. 

                         JOHN
          Well -- let's look at the text. Let's test
          David's hypothesis. "We are to the gods as
          flies to wanton boys. They kill us for
          their sport." I have to agree with Matthew,
          that seems pretty unambiguous.

                         DAVID
          Yeah, because he's saying there's a higher
          purpose that we can't see. He's saying that
          what seems like them killing us for sport
          could just be because our consciousness
          isn't developed enough to see what the
          higher wisdom of their killing us is.

          OK, but -- I still don't think that's what
          he's trying to say. Um...

                         DAVID
          No, like if you say they kill us for their
          sport, when our perception of the gods is
          so meager that we can't even tell what
          they're doing, then how can we be so
          arrogant as to think that they would bother
          to kill us for their sport?

          I don't think that's what he's saying at
          all. I think he's saying the gods don't
          give a shit about human beings and they
          just kill and torture us for fun --

                         MATTHEW

                         DAVID
          But if the gods' consciousness is so much
          more developed than ours that we seem like
          flies to them, then how can we be sure what
          they have in mind for us or why they do
          anything?

                         JOHN
          David, I think you've made your point.
          But it's not what Shakespeare meant.
          Scholarly opinion is pretty consistent that
          he's trying to say something about
          human suffering here --

                         DAVID
          I think he is saying that, because he's
          comparing human consciousness to flies, and
          he's saying that we can't see the truth
          around us because our consciousness is
          undeveloped.

                         JOHN
          No David, that's not what Shakespeare
          meant! He says it somewhere else in the
          play, but I don't want to get hung up on
          this any more because it's not what
          Shakespeare meant, and I would really like

          Karl, I was supposed to call them last
          week. You said you were gonna call her and
          you didn't. So then I called her, and she
          never called me back. So what do you want

          Joan starts coughing. Blood starts coming out with every
          cough, first a little, then a gruesome amount --
          LISA WAKES UP -- breathing hard short breaths. The room is
          dark and quiet. She calms down and gets up.

          She switches on the light --
          BLOOD is streaming out the faucet and filling the basin.

          cowboy hat --

          Yes, it's my cowboy hat that I wear
          sometimes to amuse myself on the bus, yes.
          I was probably wearing my cowboy hat, yes.
          What.

                         LISA
          If you could just let me...! From my point
          of view, I was out that day trying to buy a
          cowboy hat, so I was waving at you, becase 
          I was looking for one... and you were kind 
          of waving back...And I know the police 
          already decided it was No Fault, or No
          Criminality or whatever they call it --

                         MARETTI
          No Criminality, that's right.

                         LISA
          -- I guess partly because of what I told
          them. And I know I was distracting you,
          but -- I did see the bus go through the red 
          light. And that's when it hit that woman.

                         MARETTI
          OK. I'm gettin' a little confused over 
          here.

          Only nobody said that to them. And I just
          wanted to like, acknowledge with you that
          that's what happened.

                         MARETTI
          OK. First of all, I don't really know what
          you mean by wavin' at you...What were you,

          Yes. He wasn't even looking at the road.
          And I was definitely trying to get his
          attention...

          No, I get the picture. So you're flirtin'
          with this guy, he's wavin' at you, he runs
          the light, hits the decedent, she dies on
          the scene...the both of youse lie to me on
          both of your statements, and then
          somewheres in there you turn around, decide
          the guy belongs in jail. That right? That
          about right?

                         LISA
          I don't have any control over if he goes to
          jail or not. I certainly have my hopes. I
          just want to set the record straight, so
          that if he gets away with this I won't have
          been a part of it.

          OK. Well. Before we do anything, Lisa,
          anybody will tell you that just because he
          ran a red light is not a criminal offence.

          Even if you cause an accidental death, 
          that's right. For this to be a criminal
          offense, the law says you need two 
          aggravating circumstances. Like he ran a red
          light and he was speeding. Or he ran a red
          light and he was --

          manslaughter? Or second degree murder?

                         MITCHELL
          No. He could be charged with reckless
          driving, and fillip' out a false police
          report. Which, that's no joke --

                         LISA
          That's unbelievable! What does he have to
          do? Kill her on purpose?

                         MITCHELL
          Yes. Because that's the definition of
          murder. Killin' somebody on purpose.
          You're not sayin' he ran her over on
          purpose, are you?

                         JOAN
          But don't you know what I mean? I just feel
          kind of lonely when I'm with him. You know?

          You feel lonely when you're with him?

          Yeah. You never felt that way when you were
          with someone?

                         LISA
          I guess so. I feel that way all the time.
          You get used to it.

          Well ...I don't know how serious I want to
          get with somebody who makes me feel that
          way.

          little round elevator window. She looks old to herself, and
          haggard. She touches under her chin.

          She wipes her eyes quickly. A woman NEIGHBOR comes in.

          Lisa, Dave is one of my best friends.
          He's a terrific lawyer and if he doesn't
          know what to do himself he'll certainly
          know someone we can talk to.

          When someone is killed it's what you call a
          Wrongful Death Suit, which is a statutory
          case, which just means there's a statute
          passed by the legislature which gives you
          the right to bring the case.

                         LISA
          As opposed to what?

                         DAVE
          As opposed to common law, which is law made
          by judges. Which is why the damages are
          limited.

                         LISA
          I don't understand.

                         EMILY
          Look, just skip that part. We don't care
          about that.

                         LISA
          I thought we were trying to get the
          police to arrest this guy...!

          again.

                         DAVE
          I'm just telling you that even if they do,
          there is no way in this world they are
          gonna recommend to the DA that they charge
          this guy. That's why --

          That's OK -- That's OK, honey...

                          DAVE
           I'm just getting to that. You can't
           do anything unless you're a relative --

                          EMILY
           She didn't have any relatives, except for 
           those idiots in Arizona --

                          DAVE

                          (ON "EXCEPT")
           -- or -- hang on a minute -- unless you're
           executor of her estate --

                         EMILY
          I am the executor of her estate.

                         DAVE
          -- which is Emily. I know.

                         EMILY
          So good.

                         DAVE
          Yes. This is good. Because the executor of
          the estate Cdn bring a Wrongful Death suit,
          but the beneficiary has to be a relative.
          So let me explain about that. In a Wrongful
          Death suit you can sue for Pain and
          Suffering, Pecuniary Losses, Lose of
          Support or Services.. .And also what's
          called Care, Comfort and Society: --like
          advice, counseling of the parent that the
          kids aren't gonna get anymore...

                         LISA
          You can really sue for that?

                         DAVE
          Yeah, and that's probably what we would do,

                         LISA
          So -- I don't understand. Who are we suing?
          The bus driver?

                         DAVE
          Well, no, because the bus driver wouldn't
          have any money. You basically sue everybody
          and hope something sticks. The person who
          pays will be the MTA's insurance company.

                         LISA
          But do you think the driver would get
          fired?

          Maybe. I don't know.

                         EMILY
          But how much could they be liable for?

                         DAVE EMILY
          It depends: How badly do you think we
          could ever hurt them?

                         DAVE
          -- if she was alive, in great pain for an 
          extended period of time, they give more
          money for that.

                         LISA
          I'd say she was alive for ten minutes.

                         DAVE
          And I gather in a lot .of pain?

                         LISA
          Her leg was cut off.

                         DAVE
          Yes -- obviously. And -- but was she
          conscious? Awake, the whole time?

                         LISA
          I'm sorry, Emily. (To DAVE) Yeah, awake.

                         EMILY
          That's OK.

                         DAVE 
          Well, if she was in a lot of pain for that
          long ...I don't know. . .maybe 300,000 or a
          half a million dollars to get a sustainable
          verdict? A brain damaged baby would beâ¢ 
          three million. But the truth is, Lisa, 
          after all's said and done, it's not a very
          good case.

                         LISA
          Why not?

                         DAVE
          Because it's your word against his, and
          because you already lied on your first
          deposition. A red light case is a fifty-
          fifty proposition already. And with only
          one eyewitness, with two conflicting

          I understand. But no matter how you slice
          it, the fact that Lisa lied on her first

          for myself.

                         DAVE
          That's true-Since she have no financial
          interest she can't be impeached for bias.

          Impeached for what?

                         DAVE
          She can't have her credibility attacked on
          financial grounds because the jury knows
          you're not getting any money if you win.

          Well, I was just wondering what ever
          happened, if anything, with the case.

          You did? What happened?

                         MITCHELL
          Well, he basically stuck to his original
          representation, and that was pretty much
          it. I brought it up with my sergeant, but
          he agrees with me we still don't have
          enough to charge this guy, so there's
          really not a lot more we can do at this
          point.

                         MITCHELL 
          Hey, you know, Lisa, in the old days we'd
          just throw him in the back with a rubber
          hose and we'd get whatever answer we want
          out of him. But fortunately we don't do

          they all read how great it is, we get these
          big standing ovations every night, and it's
          the exact same show as before.

          wonderful show and a wonderful performance.

          No, it's not -- I'm not putting myself
          down. It's just that the audience always
          reacts differently if they've been told
          it's good. A lot of actors have that
          experience.

          Ramon and Joan are in his modernistic, scrupulously clean

          I'm sure they will go back eventually,
          because they like to do something for their 
          country. But it's a worry, because it's 
          very bad there now.

                         JOAN 
          Yeah...I haven't really been following it.

                         RAMON
          It's a big, big mess. Last year I helped to
          found an organization to work with children
          whose families have been killed, or the
          parents have been kidnapped, so they don't
          know if they are alive or dead. We try to
          find homes for them, preferably in
          Colombia, because if we lose our young
          people, that's it: That's the future. We
          have raised a lot of money, but there's
          only so much we can do. You don't like to
          say it's hopeless, but it's hard to see the
          solution.

                         JOAN
          Yeah. God...I wish I knew more about

          I know. You don't have to keep saying that.
          I've always wanted to travel. It's just a
          little difficult with two kids and no
          husband, but it's hard to make a lot of
          money in the theater. I was on a TV show a
          few years back and I socked away some money
          because of that, but my ex-husband --

          Karl's very generous with the kids when he
          can be, but he's struggling too: He's a
          director: he directs commercials, and now
          he's trying to produce them... Anyway, I'm
          not ignorant because I enjoy it.

          called this guy he knows who used to be a
          cop for the MTA. Did you know the MTA have
          their own police? The MTA police? They have

          sneak a look at your guy's file. And it
          turns out he's had two previous accidents --
          less than two years apart -- one of them on

          And if you read the paper, you'll know
          they're going through a protracted labor
          dispute at the MTA right now, and according
          to my PI, the management doesn't want to
          aggravate the situation by firing this guy.
          Especially since the police have concluded
          he was not at fault.

          very good case, because we can sue for
          what's called "Negligent Retention." Which
          means they should have known the guy was a
          bad risk and was irresponsible and they
          negligently retained him until he finally
          killed somebody.

          you gotta realize it's gonna take some

          But I can't let you pursue it to the point
          where it's taking over your life or
          interfering with your school work. (To
          EMILY) It's really come down to a question
          of homework. Lisa is on a half-scholarship
          at her school. And I know she feels a real

          I think that teenagers should definitely
          rule the world, because teenagers aren't
          corrupted by adult life yet, and they're
          idealists and they care. And I know a lot
          of people feel that teenagers are really
          naive, which they are, many of them. But
          they still haven't had a chance to get
          burned out by the disappointments and the
          harsh realities of learning how to play the
          game. So yes, I would vote yes.

          except I do think that teenagers don't
          always necessarily think things through
          very carefully, and they don't have enough
          experience to know what the right thing to
          do is all the time. I also think they tend
          to adhere to ideologies really easily

          me, or all around me. Sound confused

          Listen, Emily? I don't know what you're
          thinking, but Rob and I are thinking we
          should take Russel's recommendation while
          we can. Because if they won't fire the
          guy, they're not gonna fire him. And six
          months or a year from now we're gonna --

          we're gonna be in a situation where
          we're beggin' them for half this much,
          which is gonna hurt 'em half as much as
          now, and they're still not gonna fire this
          guy! Or maybe he'll have already quit and
          the whole thing will be moot by then.. Do
          you see what I mean?

                         LISA
          The entire point of the lawsuit was to get
          the guy fired so he doesn't kill somebody
          else -- !

          Lemme just clarify --

                         LISA
          -- it was not to get you three hundred and
          fifty thousand dollars you didn't know you
          were entitled to, for somebody you didn't
          even like... !

          And the only reason you're getting the
          money at all is because I started this
          whole fucking thing in motion! I'm sorry
          for swearing, but you should be willing to
          trade in all the money for getting this guy
          off the street --

          Well I'm sorry, but I have a responsibility
          to Monica and I take that responsibility
          very seriously. You are talking about an
          offer that is gonna be withdrawn if we
          don't do something about it right now.

          And rather than being abused over the
          telephone and cursed at for having the
          courtesy to involve you in these
          discussions, Lisa, I would hope you would
          be guided by our judgement. Unless I'm
          wrong about that.

          your interest in this?

                         LISA
          Because I'm the one who killed her! I'm
          the one who killed her! But at least I
          know I did it, and that guy has no idea!
          And he's wandering around blaming everybody
          else and all I want is for somebody to let
          him know that what he did was wrong! And
          if they don't fire him and all you want is
          the money and the police won't do anything,
          how is he gonna know he's wrong? You can't
          take the deal, Abigail! It wasn't so you
          could get any money, it was because we
          wanted to get him fired! It doesn't matter
          about the money! You wouldn't have gotten
          it before!

                         ABIGAIL
          Well it may not matter to you, but where I
          come from three hundred and fifty thousand
          dollars is an awful lot of money, and to my
          mind is a positive result of all this
          tragedy and not just negative. Not just
          getting someone fired for one mistake, no
          matter how bad it was --

          Don't get run over.

          It is him. Mom, that's the one...
          Joan and Lisa look at him. He's staring out ahead of him as
          people board the bus. He SEES Lisa and Joan but can't see
          their faces and doesn't recognize Lisa: He just sees two
          dolled-up women under the street light. He smiles dazzling at
          them and drives past with a short wave.

          Lisa is out on the terrace smoking a cigarette, looking out
          over Lincoln Center. Joan comes out and stands next to her,
          but Lisa won't look at her or interact.

                         JOAN
          Well, so far it's not the greatest opera I
          ever heard.

          What do you mean? It's OK.

           audience applauds the entering conductor. She picks her way 
           past the other patrons in the row, whispering "Excuse me" and
           takes her seat just as the MUSIC STARTS. Joan looks at her. 
           Lisa stares straight ahead. 

           The curtain rises. On stage, the two women start singing the 
          barcarole "Belle Nuit." It's very beautiful.
          Joan looks next to her at Lisa. Lisa is trying not to cry,
          but tears are dripping slowly down her face. She sniffs and
          wipes them away, but they keep coming.
          Joan looks at her again, but Lisa still won't look at her.
          Joan takes Lisa's hand and Lisa breaks down completely,
          clutching Joan's hand back, squeezing it hard. Joan starts
          crying too out of sympathy.

          As the duet goes on they sit side by side holding hands, Lisa
          crying and holding on and wiping her eyes with her free hand
          and Joan crying too, but not as hard, grateful finally that
          the spell has been broken.

          The duet ends and we CUT TO BLACK.
