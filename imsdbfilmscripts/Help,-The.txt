          INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

          AIBILEEN, black, 53, sits at a table in a small, green
          kitchen. She wears a yellow dress with black piping and
          grips a tattered spiral notebook.
          Although cracked, the window behind her is crystal clear.
          Three framed portraits hang on the wall above her: John F.
          Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and an UNKNOWN YOUNG
          BLACK MALE wearing thick glasses.
          Aibileen swallows hard.

                          AIBILEEN
           I was...born in 1911...on Piedmont
           Plantation in Cherokee County.
          An UNSEEN WOMAN interviews Aibileen.

           WOMAN (O.C.)
           Did you know as a girl, growing up,
           that one day you'd be a maid?

                          AIBILEEN
           Yes, ma'am. I did.

           WOMAN (O.C.)
           And you knew that because?

                          AIBILEEN
           Momma was a maid. My grandmother
           was a house slave.

           WOMAN (0.C.)
           Oh.
          The woman repeats Aibileen's answer slowly as she writes.

           WOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)
           A...House...Slave. Uh-huh. Okay.
          Aibileen squeezes the notebook in her lap.

           WOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)
           Now, did you ever dream of being
           something else?
          Aibileen gulps. She doesn't answer. The room is quiet.

           WOMAN (O.C.) (CONT'D)
           Well then, what's it feel like, to
           raise a white child when your own
           child's at home...being looked
           after by somebody else?

           2.

                         
          Aibileen's hand trembles as she sips from a glass of water.
          She glances sadly up to the picture of the young black male.

           FADE TO BLACK:

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           I done raised seventeen kids in my
           life. Lookin' after white babies,
           that's what I do.

                         

          INT. LEEFOLT HOME - MAE MOBLEY'S ROOM - MORNING

          MAE MOBLEY LEEFOLT, 2 1/2 years old, lies in a crib, crying.
          AIBILEEN enters. Her dark black skin contrasts angelically
          with a brilliant white work dress, white panty hose and shoes

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           I know how to get them babies
           asleep, stop cryin' and go in the
           toilet bowl before they mommas even
           get outta bed in the mornin.'
          Aibileen lifts Mae Mobley out of her crib and pulls her into
          her expansive bosom.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Babies like fat. They like big fat
           legs too. That I know.
          Aibileen sits with Mae Mobley in a rocking chair.

           AIBILEEN (V.O) (CONT'D)
           I work from eight to four, six days
           a week. Ninety-five cents an hour
           comes to a hundred seventy-two
           dollars ever month. I do all the
           cooking, cleaning, washing, ironing
           and grocery shopping, but mostly, I
           take care a baby girl...And law, I
           worry she gone be fat. Ain't gonna
           be no beauty queen either.
          Mae Mobley reaches up and touches Aibileen's face. Aibileen
          kisses her and whispers in her ear.

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           You is kind. You is smart. You is
           important.
          Mae Mobley's mother, ELIZABETH LEEFOLT, 21 and lanky, enters
          wearing a green dress very much under construction. Pins and
          double-stick tape hold it all together.
          Elizabeth has pointed features and a nest of teased, brittle
          hair.

                          ELIZABETH
           Aibileen, bridge club's in an hour!
           Did you finish the chicken salad?

                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
           Oh, and Hilly's deviled eggs. No
           paprika!
          Elizabeth rotates around like the Tin Man.

                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
           Does this dress look homemade?

                          AIBILEEN
           I reckon when you finish, it won't.
          Elizabeth exits with her pinned hemline sloping at a good
          twenty degree angle. Aibileen shakes her head.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Miss Leefolt still don't pick Baby
           Girl up but once a day. The
           birthin' blues had got holt a Miss

          A smoking RECEPTIONIST, 50, leads EUGENIA "SKEETER" PHELAN,
          23, across a smoke-filled news office. Even the light bulbs
          have yellowed.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           But, not Miss Skeeter...
          Skeeter has very frizzy blond hair cut short above her
          shoulders. She carries a red satchel.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           No babies...No man...And not
           lookin'.
          She wears flats, careful not to add more than a centimeter to
          her towering height. Dressed well, Skeeter tugs on her
          unfamiliar attire.

          The receptionist and Skeeter enter the office of MR. HAROLD
          BLACKLY, 68. He has greased, grey hair and the face of a
          mean man. Smoke pours into the room.

           MR. BLACKLY
           Shut the Goddamn door!
          He snaps his fingers over a chair. Skeeter sits down.

           Okay, let's see what you got.
          Skeeter quickly hands Mr. Blackly a resumé. He skims it
          over, marking it violently with a red pen.

          Mr. Blackly sighs, hands the resumé back to Skeeter.

           You got any references?
          Skeeter nods slowly. She takes a deep breath and pulls a
          letter out of her satchel. She hands it to Mr. Blackly.
          Mr. Blackly snatches the letter and reads it quickly,
          mouthing the words as he does. He drops the letter on his
          desk, and looks to Skeeter, flabbergasted.

           MR. BLACKLY (CONT'D)
           That...is a rejection letter.
          Skeeter's face flushes hot and quick.

           potential...Gain some experience
           and please apply again."
          Mr. Blackly pours the rest of the peanuts in his mouth.

          Mr. Blackly pulls up a box filled with letters and

          Minny and Missus Walters follow. Minny carries a chocolate
          pie. Hilly barks over her shoulder.

          Elizabeth reaches down and scoops up Mae Mobley like a sack
          of potatoes.
          Mae Mobley looks to Aibileen over her mother's shoulder, her

          The Leefolt's small, wood paneled, two bedroom "ranch" is
          destined to become income property one day.
          FIVE YOUNG WOMEN, early 20s, and Elizabeth hover around two
          collapsible card tables arranged in the living room.
          Aibileen methodically arranges grapes on a platter of chicken
          salad resting on Elizabeth's dining table. The table has a
          small L-SHAPED CRACK in the middle.

          Elizabeth glances anxiously to the dining table then catches
          eyes with Aibileen, nodding ever so slightly.

          Aibileen carefully slides the platter over the L-SHAPED CRACK

           After Treelore died, a bitter seed

           anymore.
          Hilly enters the front door holding Missus Walters coat.

          Hilly approaches Aibileen with the coat.

           Aibileen, I want you to have this
           coat. It's too big for Momma now
           and it's way too expensive to put
           in the coat drive.
          Hilly extends the coat with a smile.

          deviled eggs.
          Aibileen rushes in behind her wearing the cheetah collared
          coat. The sleeves are about a foot too short.

          Elizabeth takes a puff of her cigarette and fidgets with her
          cards.

          EXT. FOOTE ESTATE - BACKYARD - SAME DAY

          Celia delicately prunes two rosebushes. Her long pink
          fingernails wrap easily around a pair of sheers.
          As Celia stands back to admire her work, We widen to see the
          Foote estate. Ancient oaks dripping in Spanish moss surround
          a perfectly manicured lawn. "Tara" pales in comparison.
          Oddly, the two rosebushes have been planted in the center of
          the lawn, jeopardizing the Antebellum Feng Shui.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           Now, Miss Celia had her a man.
           `Bout the best lookin' man in all
           of Mississippi. But, no baby and
           no friends.
          JOHNNY FOOTE, 23, Celia's ridiculously handsome husband,
          sneaks up behind her as he removes his jacket and tie.

           17.

           Roses look like weeds next to you.
          Celia turns with a yelp. She slaps him playfully.

                          CELIA
           Johnny, you scared the daylights
           out of me!
          Johnny begins kissing her neck.

                          CELIA (CONT'D)
           You're home early.
          Celia pushes him back.

                          CELIA (CONT'D)
           Johnny, I can't get any of your old
           friends from school to call me
           back.

           Oh, who cares, honey. We got all
           we need right here.
          Johnny kisses her again and lowers her to the grass.

                          CELIA
           Johnny, honestly!

                          JOHNNY
           Doctor's orders.
          Johnny starts kissing Celia's breasts. She becomes uneasy
          and rolls out from under him.

                          CELIA
           I don't know what's taking us so
           long. I'm sorry.
          Johnny brushes hair from Celia's face.

                          JOHNNY
           Hey, we've never done it in the
           yard. Maybe that's the trick.
          Celia seductively bites her lower lip.

                          CELIA
           Watch my hair.
          Johnny's hand slides up her thigh.

          Bridge over, Skeeter smokes while watching through a window
          as Minny arrives in Hilly's car. Skeeter blows smoke toward
          Hilly and Elizabeth saying good-bye.

           18.

                         
          A sermon plays over an old AM radio nestled between
          canisters of sugar and flour.
          Aibileen enters with a stack of dirty coffee cups.

                          SKEETER
           Aibileen?
          Aibileen becomes nervous at the sight of Skeeter alone.

                          AIBILEEN
           Yes, ma'am.

                          SKEETER

           So...Would you help me?
          Aibileen nods and looks out to Elizabeth on the street.

                          AIBILEEN
           Miss Myrna gets it wrong lotta
           times. Be good to get it right.

                          SKEETER
           Thank you, Aibileen. I plan on
           splitting the pay with you, too.
          Aibileen doesn't respond. She grabs a basket of rolls.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           Listen...all that talk in there
           today. Hilly's talk I mean...I'm
           sorry you had to hear that.
          Aibileen quickly turns her back to Skeeter. A gospel choir
          begins singing on the radio.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           Is that Preacher Green's sermon on
           the radio?

                          AIBILEEN
           Yes, ma'am, it is.

                          SKEETER
           That reminds me so much of my maid
           growing up.
          Aibileen starts wiping down a serving tray.

                          AIBILEEN
           Constantine and me...were in church
           circle together.

          Skeeter turns to Aibileen as she puts out her cigarette.

           She loved me like you love Mae
           Mobley.

           Yes, ma'am.
          Skeeter moves closer to Aibileen.

                          SKEETER
           Aibileen? How could she just quit
           like that?
          Aibileen stops wiping and looks up to Skeeter...

                          AIBILEEN
           Quit?

                          SKEETER
           Yes. When I got home from school
           last week, Momma said she had quit.
           Back in March to go live with her
           people up in Chicago. She didn't
           leave me a note or anything.
          Aibileen turns and resumes wiping the tray.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           Could you do that to Mae Mobley?
          Aibileen slowly turns back to Skeeter.

                          AIBILEEN
           No, ma'am. I couldn't...

                          SKEETER
           Do you have an address for her or
           anything?
          Aibileen shrugs her shoulders, reeling it all back in.
          Just then, Elizabeth walks into the kitchen holding papers
          stapled together. She looks between Aibileen and Skeeter.

                          ELIZABETH
           I'm sorry. Did I interrupt
           something?
          Skeeter and Aibileen shake their heads.
          Elizabeth hands Skeeter the papers. Home Help Sanitation
          Initiative is written on the cover.

                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

          Skeeter speeds down a country road lined with ancient oak
          trees in a white Cadillac.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           I knew I had said too much to Miss
           Skeeter, but Constantine's story
           weren't mine to tell. Some things
           a girl shouldn't have to know about
           her own mother.
          Her frizzy hair swirls about as she passes a truck full of

          Skeeter looks ahead and sees an OLDER BLACK WOMAN walking
          with a LITTLE BLONDE GIRL, 6. They hold hands.
          The black woman smiles and waves as Skeeter passes. When
          Skeeter looks in her rear view mirror, they're gone.
          Skeeter suddenly stops the car just short of an intersecting
          gravel road.
          Skeeter slowly turns down the old road.

          Skeeter's car pulls into the overgrown yard of an old shack
          with a rusted-out tin roof.
          Two clapboard rooms are separated by an open breezeway. The
          front door is cracked opened.
          Skeeter gets out and walks toward Constantine's home.

                         

          INT. CONSTANTINE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Skeeter enters to find only a small bed, dresser, table,
          rocking chair and a wood burning stove.
          Past intruders have long since taken anything of value.

           21.

                         
          As Skeeter approaches Constantine's bed, an OPOSSUM scurries
          out from underneath.
          Skeeter screams as the opossum runs out the door. Her eyes
          suddenly catch something.
          Lying on the bed is an OLD CORN PIPE.
          Skeeter picks it up and brings it to her face. Her eyes
          begin to well up.

          porch.

           Momma?
          Skeeter's mother, CHARLOTTE BOUDREAU CANTELLE PHELAN, 50,
          glides into the room wearing a wig. Her floral print dress
          has a gazillion perfectly pressed pleats.
          Charlotte turns to a mirror and adjusts an auburn-colored,
          `pixie' cut.

           22.

                         
          Charlotte removes the wig with a sigh. Only now do we
          realize her decision to wear wigs isn't elective. Thinning
          hair detracts from her perfectly made up face.
          Charlotte puts on a classic bouffant/flip in dark brown.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)

           Come on, you try it on.

                          SKEETER
           What really happened?
          Charlotte winces with pain and grasps her stomach.

                          CHARLOTTE
           I told you...she went to live with
           her people in Chicago...Now,
           Skeeter, your mother is dying, and
           she wants to see you in this dress.
          Charlotte stands in her slip and bra holding the dress.
          Skeeter begins taking off her clothes.

                          SKEETER
           How could she just take off without
           telling me?

                          CHARLOTTE
           I told her not to write you. I
           didn't want you upset in the middle
           of final exams. Honey, we were
           just a job to her. With them it's
           all about money...Did I tell you
           Fanny Peatrow got engaged? After
           she got that teller job, her mother
           said she was just swimming in
           proposals.

                          SKEETER
           Good for "Fat Fanny Peatrow."
          She lowers the dress over Skeeter's head and zips it.

          The Phelan dining room is lit solely by candles.
          The Phelan's new maid, PASCAGOLUA, 40, rolls a cart of
          casseroles around the table.
          Charlotte sits at the head of the table. She's having a bowl
          of broth.
          Skeeter sits next to her Father, ROBERT PHELAN, 60.
          Skeeter's brother, CARLTON, 25, sits next to his fiancé,
          REBECCA, 21. They're perfectly groomed with Hollywood good

          As Charlotte leaves the room, Rebecca looks at Skeeter like
          she's the worst person on earth.
          Skeeter gets up and storms off into the entry foyer.

          Skeeter sits across the table from Aibileen, reading the
          `Miss Myrna' letters.

           31.

                         
          Outside, winds howl, and the sky grows dark. Jolene's
          forecast appears to be a bit off.

                          SKEETER
           "Dear Miss Myrna, How do I remove
           the rings from my fat, slovenly
           husband's shirt collar when he is
           such a pig and sweats like one
           too..."

           Which one she want a get rid of?
           Them rings or the husband?
          Skeeter chuckles and shrugs her shoulders.

           Tell her a vinegar and Pine-Sol
           soak. Then let it set in the sun a
           bit.
          Skeeter writes this down.

           Bout an hour. Let it dry.
          Skeeter keeps writing. Aibileen notices something outside.
          Hilly walks into the Leefolt backyard with her son, BILLY, 3,
          perched on her hip.
          A CONTRACTOR, 30s, follows holding a set of plans.
          Skeeter turns to the open window. It's already started to
          sprinkle outside.

                          HILLY
           Build it just like the one at my
           house, right against the garage.
          The contractor nods. Lightning strikes, thunder cracks.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           Oh, mercy!
          Hilly is off and running with Billy. Skeeter seizes the
          moment.

                          SKEETER
           Aibileen, do you ever wish you
           could...change things?
          Aibileen turns slowly from the window.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           I mean, all that talk yesterday and
           now with what Hilly's up to.
          Aibileen's eyes fall to the floor.

          Aibileen jumps up as another crack of thunder sounds out.

           Aibileen, I have an
           idea...Something I want to write
           about...But I need your help.
          Skeeter rises.

           I want to interview you...about
           what it is like to work as a maid.
          Aibileen stops at the refrigerator, gripping the life out of
          its handle.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           I'd like to do a book of interviews
           about working for white families.
           Show what it's like to work for,
           say...Elizabeth.
          Aibileen begins to perspire. She grabs the counter to steady
          herself, then moves toward her chair.

                          AIBILEEN
           You know what'd happen to me if
           Miss Leefolt knew I was tellin'

                          SKEETER
           I was thinking we wouldn't tell
           her. The other maids will have to
           keep it secret, too.

           Other maids?

                          SKEETER
           I was hoping to get four or five.
           To really show what it's like in
           Jackson. To see what y'all get
           paid, the babies, the bathrooms,
           the good and the bad.
          Aibileen shakes her head.

           They set my cousin Shinelle's car
           on fire just cause she went down to

          The storm has escalated. The Holbrook house is without
          power. Hilly runs around lighting candles.
          Missus Walters lies on the couch while Minny fans her with a
          newspaper.

           flapping your arm like that.
          Minny stops and begins squirming with discomfort. Missus
          Walters notices her looking out to the garage bathroom.
          Lightning strikes. Leaves blow across the yard. Hilly plops
          down in a chair with a candle.

           That should do it. Minny, go get

          against the garage bathroom.
          Boom! Another crash of thunder. Large hail stones begin

          There's a knock on the door. She freezes.

          Outside the house, an eerie, groaning sound, much like a

          Lying before her, is an old, thin, onionskin booklet curling

          Skeeter spies an old pickup truck parked on the side of
          Aibileen's house, completely covered in years of dust.
          Skeeter checks over her shoulder several times. The porch

          Aibileen motions for Skeeter to sit on a narrow sofa behind a
          coffee table covered in hand-tatted lace.
          A tray holds a teapot, two cups that don't match and cookies
          resting on folded napkins.

           Oh, Hilly, he's cancelled twice
           before. Maybe it's a sign.

                          HILLY
           Don't you dare say that!

                          SKEETER
           You know I won't be his type.
          Hilly grabs Skeeter by the shoulders.

                          HILLY
           It's your time, Skeeter. And
           damnit, I'm not going to let you
           miss this just because your mother
           convinced you you're not good
           enough for somebody like him.

                         

          INT. MINNY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

          Minny is again wearing her maid's uniform. She puts two
          plates of food down on the kitchen table.
          She sits next to her daughter, SUGAR, 15. Sugar wears a
          brand-spanking-new maids's uniform.

                          MINNY
           Eat up, Girl. Miss Woodra's like
           to not feed ya on try-out day.
          Sugar takes a bite of toast.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           I still say you're too young to be
           waitin' on white peoples...Now,
           Sugar, I want you to listen to me,
           and you listen to me good.
          Minny grabs Sugar's face and looks her right in the eyes.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           These are the rules for working in
           a white lady's house.
          Sugar jerks her face away and sticks her lip out.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           Rule Number One: Don't you ever let
           White Lady find you sittin' on her
           toilet.
          Sugar nods.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           Number Two: You keep your nose out
           of White Lady's problems, and don't
           cry to her with yours. White
           people ain't your friends.

                         

          EXT. RURAL BUS STOP - LATER THAT MORNING

          Minny steps off a bus and walks down an old country road.

           MINNY (V.O.)
           Number Three: When you're cooking
           white food, taste it with a
           different spoon. They see you put
           the tasting spoon back in the pot,
           might as well throw it all out.
           Spoon, too.

          EXT. FOOTE ESTATE - LATER

          Minny approaches the Foote estate. She stops just short of
          stairs leading up to the front porch.

           MINNY (V.O.)
           Four: You use the same cup, same
           fork, same plate every day.
          Minny takes her first step on the stairs.

           MINNY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Five: Don't hit her kids. White
           people do they own spanking.
          Minny slowly raises her hand to knock on the front door.

           MINNY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Six: No sass-mouthing!
          Minny knocks.

                          (TO HERSELF)
           Number six, Minny. Number six.
          The door flies open. Celia Foote answers. She's covered in
          tight pink clothes. Flour covers her face and hair.

                          CELIA
           Hey there! I'm Celia Rae Foote.
           Aibileen said you'd be on time.
          Minny looks down disapprovingly to Celia's bare feet.

                          CELIA (CONT'D)
           Can I get you a cold Coca-Cola?

                          MINNY
           No, thank you. I'm Minny
           Jackson... You...cooking
           something?

                          CELIA

          Minny enters behind Celia gawking at the flour massacre.

                          MINNY
           What in the hell-
          Minny catches herself.

          INT. FOOTE ESTATE - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Minny and Celia enter a huge dining room. Minny gawks at a
          dusty mahogany table surrounded by twelve chairs.

                          CELIA
           Johnny's momma wouldn't let me
           decorate a thing. If I had my way,
           this house would have wall to wall
           white carpet with gold trim and
           none of this old stuff.
          Minny spies a framed battle-worn Confederate flag complete
          with bullet holes.

                          MINNY
           Where you from?
          Celia lowers her head in shame...

                          CELIA
           Sugar Ditch. It's near Memphis.

                          MINNY
           I know Sugar Ditch. My cousin live
           there.
          Celia changes the subject.

                          CELIA
           Let's go meet Oscar!
          Celia grabs Minny's hand. Annoyed, Minny pulls it away.

                         

          INT. FOOTE ESTATE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Minny stands at the base of a massive, stuffed Grizzly bear.
          It clears the twelve-foot ceiling by an inch.

                          CELIA
           Johnny's granddaddy shot him up in
           Montana back in 1910 with Teddy
           Roosevelt.
          Celia points to fifteen guns mounted behind Oscar.

                          CELIA (CONT'D)
           We got five bedrooms and bathrooms
           here in the main house. The pool
           house has two more beds and baths.

           49.

                         

                          MINNY
           When you gone have some chillins,
           start fillin' up all these beds?
          Celia swallows hard. She places her hand on her stomach.

                          CELIA
           I'm pregnant now.
          Minny steps back and surveys Celia.

                          MINNY
           Gone be eatin' for two. Double the
           cookin'.
          Celia slumps her shoulders as she looks around the house.

                          CELIA
           I know it's an awful lot to do.
           Five other maids have already
           turned me down...Can I at least
           give you some bus money?

                          MINNY
           When you hear me say I don't wanna
           clean this house?

                          CELIA
           What? So...You'll do it?!
          Before Minny can nod. Celia throws her arms around her.
          Minny backs away.

                          MINNY
           No huggin', now. No huggin'.

                          CELIA
           I'm sorry. This is my first time
           hiring a maid.

                          MINNY
           We got to talk about some things
           first. I work Sunday through
           Friday.
          Celia bites her pinky nail.

                          CELIA
           You can't come at all on weekends.

                          MINNY
           Okay. What time you want me here?

                          CELIA
           After eight, and you have to leave
           at four.

                          MINNY
           Okay. Now what your husband say
           you can pay?
          Celia looks away.

           help.

                          MINNY
           And what's Mr. Johnny gone do if he
           comes home and finds a colored
           woman up in his kitchen?

                          CELIA
           It's not that I'd be fibbing. I
           just want him to think I can do
           this on my own...I need some help
           `til I get the hang of it. I need
           a maid.

           A course you do. Last one done got
           shot in the head.
          Minny sniffs the air.

           Oww! Dawgonit!
          She drops the burnt cake on the floor.

           You can't use no wet towel on a hot
           pan.
          Minny grabs a dry towel and picks up the cake.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           I'll take this burnt up cake with

          INT. FARM TRUCK - COUNTRY ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

          Chunks of mud fly off the tires. The June sun has set the
          truck's interior at a stubborn 115 degrees.
          Skeeter has no choice but to lower her window. The
          Shinolator meets its match.
          A mangy, STRAY CAT suddenly jumps out in the road. When
          towing 10,000 pounds of farm equipment, slowing down quickly
          isn't an option.

           61.

                         
          A loud thud sounds out from the truck's grill.

                         

          INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - PARLOR - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Hilly, her husband, WILLIAM, and Skeeter's date, STUART
          WHITWORTH, drink high balls and eat cheese in the Holbrook
          parlor. Gold swag curtains hang on the windows.
          Balding and pudgy, only William's family money once made him
          a desirable bachelor. Stuart, on the other hand, is very
          handsome, the "Marlboro Man" in a well-tailored suit.
          Yule May (who we met earlier at church with Aibileen) now
          works for Hilly. She clears empty glasses.

                          WILLIAM
           With your daddy's endorsement, I
           can win that Senate seat.
          Stuart feigns interest.

                          STUART
           I'll talk to him.
          Ice slams against Stuart's teeth as he downs his drink.
          Hilly pats William's leg then turns with concern to a
          grandfather clock announcing half past the hour.
          The front door flies open. Skeeter enters completely out of
          breath and sweaty. Her HAIR HAS TRIPLED IN SIZE. She waves.

                          SKEETER
           Hey.
          As Hilly races toward Skeeter, William and Stuart stand.
          Stuart is as tall as he is handsome.

                          HILLY
           Boys, we'll be right back. Y'all
           talk about quarterbacks or
           something. Yule May, get Miss
           Skeeter a Coca Cola.
          Yule May runs off. Hilly pulls Skeeter down the hall.

                         

          INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Skeeter sits on the toilet downing a Coca-Cola. Hilly twists
          the last of Skeeter's hair into giant rollers.

                          HILLY
           Skeeter, you don't even have on
           lipstick!
          Skeeter dabs her armpits.

          Hilly sprays Final Net.

                          HILLY
           Well...What do you think of him?
          Skeeter applies lipstick. Hilly removes the rollers.

                          SKEETER
           He looks handsome.
          Skeeter stands up and does a twirl for Hilly.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           All right, give it to me. One to
           ten?
          Hilly sprays Skeeter with perfume and stands back.

                          HILLY
           Seven.

                          SKEETER
           Really?! Seven?
          Hilly nods, lets out a little squeal.

                          HILLY
           Honey, you're beautiful. Just go
           on out there...you're gonna do
           great. It's your time, Skeeter. I
           just know it.
          Hilly hugs Skeeter.

          Hilly, William, Stuart and Skeeter sit at a round table
          adorned with white linens, silver and fine china.
          The room buzzes with Jackson's elite all trying to be noticed
          as a JAZZ QUARTET plays softly in a corner.
          A WAITER approaches. Stuart leans into Skeeter without
          making eye contact.

                          STUART
           You want a drink?

          Stuart nods. Hilly rolls her eyes.

                          HILLY
           "Roll Tide." We still love him.
          Hilly pinches Stuart on the cheek.

                          SKEETER
           Now you're in the oil business.
           Hilly says you're a rigsite leader.

                          STUART
           The money's good. If that's what
           you really want to know.

           That's not what I-
          Skeeter and Hilly watch as Stuart's and William's eyes fix on
          the front of the restaurant.
          Celia and Johnny have entered. Celia wears a tight green
          dress and the reddest lipstick ever put in a tube.

                          STUART
           Isn't that your old boyfriend,
           Hilly? Johnny Foote?
          Hilly scowls.

           Who's his girl? Lord, she's hotter
           than Delta asphalt.
          Celia spots Hilly and gives a self-conscious wave.

                          HILLY
           William! The Lieutenant Governor
           just walked in.
          Hilly jumps up and pulls William away. The waiter returns
          with Stuart's drink and the water backs.

                          STUART
           So, what do you do with your time?

                          SKEETER
           I write a...a domestic maintenance
           column for the Jackson Journal.
          Stuart smirks, taking a huge sip of his drink.

                          STUART
           You mean housekeeping?
          Skeeter nods and grabs her water.

           Nice to meet you.
          Hilly grabs the crook of William's arm.

           Well, you must be a genius. You
           figured out my whole scheme.
          Skeeter fumes as Hilly and William return and sit.

           I'm sorry, but were you dropped on
           your head as an infant?
          Stuart blinks and then smiles, somewhat impressed. Desperate
          to change the subject, Hilly claps her hands.

           Who? Is? Hungry?
          Skeeter stands.

          Hilly lowers her paper and nods. Yule May begins wrenching
          her hands.

          INT. WHITE GROCERY STORE - LATER THAT MORNING

          Minny and Aibileen, in uniform, push carts side by side in
          the grocery store. The white shoppers are dressed casually.
          Other maids in the store (all required to be in uniform while
          shopping) keep quietly to themselves.
          White women smile and chat with one another as they meander
          down the aisles as if the black maids aren't even there.
          Minny suddenly spots Celia in the produce section. She pulls
          Aibileen close as they peer around the corner.

                          MINNY
           That's her.
          Aibileen's mouth drops open at the sight of Celia's shorts
          and tight sweater. Celia is having trouble selecting
          produce.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           Lord, she's trying to shop.
          Celia walks up to a maid, grabs her, and pulls her to the
          tomatoes. The maid, clearly uncomfortable, selects a tomato,
          hands it to Celia, and scurries away.

           You know I ain't studying no line
           like that.

           Leroy's head. Lines between black
           and white ain't there either.
          Minny and Aibileen watch as Celia exits the store with her
          groceries and prances toward her car.

                          MINNY
           So, I ain't crossing no line if I
           tell Miss Celia she ain't good
           enough for Miss Hilly? Tell her
           she ain't in Miss Hilly's league?

           have no boundaries.
          Just then, MYRLIE EVERS, 30, (Medgar Evers wife) approaches
          the bus stop with her three Children. SONS, 10 and 3, and a

          DAUGHTER, 8.
          Aibileen and Minny nod as the Evers walk past and sit on a
          bench.

          A bus pulls up and the doors open. Minny, Aibileen and the
          other maids step aside to let the Evers family board first.

                         

          EXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - BACK YARD - LATER THAT DAY

          Aibileen has come along to aid Yule May with Elizabeth's baby
          shower.
          A table is set in the middle of the yard covered in white
          linens and Hilly's best sliver.
          Hilly's son sits on her lap. The other girls' children wear
          bathing suits jumping noisily in and out of two plastic kiddy
          pools.
          Yule May clears cake plates while Aibileen removes crumbs
          with a sterling crumb scraper.
          Mae Mobley wanders up to the table. Her belly almost looks
          distended crammed inside last year's one piece.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           Mae Mo hungry, Momma.
          Elizabeth turns to Mae Mobley but never gets up.

                          ELIZABETH
           She's always hungry.
          All the women laugh except for Skeeter.

                          SKEETER
           You know she can hear you,
           Elizabeth?
          Elizabeth looks down to her plate. Aibileen sets down the
          scraper and kneels down to Mae Mobley.

                          AIBILEEN
           I'm on cut you some cake, Baby.

                          ELIZABETH
           Aibileen, we gave that scraper to
           Hilly and William for their wedding
           present. Chantilly!

                          AIBILEEN
           It so pretty.
          Hilly begins bouncing William Jr. on her knee.

                          HILLY
           Aibileen, are you enjoying your new
           bathroom over at Elizabeth's?
          Hilly nods with a tight smile and glances to the ground at
          Skeeter's red satchel.

           70.

           Yes, ma'am.

                          HILLY
           Separate but equal. That's what
           Ross Barnett says, and you can't
           argue with the Governor.

                          SKEETER
           Not in Mississippi. Birthplace of
           modern day government.
          Hilly narrows her eyes at Skeeter and turns to Aibileen.

                          HILLY
           Aibileen, did you know that me and
           Mister Holbrook arranged for that
           bathroom? Sent the boys over and
           the equipment, too.
          Hilly stays on Aibileen, waiting for her to say something.
          Skeeter fumes, hoping Aibileen doesn't say it.

                          AIBILEEN
           Yes, ma'am...And I thank you.
          Hilly smiles and nods.

                          HILLY
           Well...You. Are. Welcome.
          Hilly shoots Skeeter a last look. William Jr. leans into
          Hilly and hugs her.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           One thing I got to say about Miss
           Hilly, she love her children.
           Always tellin' them they smart and
           beautiful. Can't go more than ten
           minutes without givin' one a kiss.
          Hilly kisses her son gently.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           And, law, do they love her back.
           When she starts up on me, I just
           try and think a my sweet Treelore
           and how much he loved me. That
           kind a love makes me cry. Even
           when it going to Miss Hilly.
          Hilly again glances to the red satchel, staring quizzically
          at the worn booklet of The Jim Crow laws sticking out.

          Yule May washes dishes as the women are heard saying their
          "good-byes" on the street. Skeeter slips into the kitchen.

           Yule May, I wanted to talk to you.
          Yule May turns off the sink faucet making sure Hilly is still
          cackling out on the street.

                          YULE MAY
           I know what you want to ask, Miss
           Skeeter. Aibileen and Minny
           already did.
          Yule May closes the kitchen door.

           YULE MAY (CONT'D)
           I'm trying to get my boys off to
           college. It's worthwhile what

           more.

           I understand.

           HILLY (O.C.)
           What do you "understand," Skeeter?
          Skeeter and Yule May turn to find Hilly standing in the
          swinging door leading into the dining room.

                          SKEETER
           Ah...Yule May was just telling me
           how excited she was that her boys
           were going to go to college.

                          HILLY
           Is that true, Yule May?

                          YULE MAY
           Yes, Ma'am.
          Skeeter notices that Hilly is holding the booklet of Jim Crow
          laws in her hand.

                          HILLY
           Did you also ask Miss Skeeter if
           you could borrow money?

                          SKEETER
           Of course not, Hilly!
          Hilly approaches Skeeter.

                          HILLY
           Skeeter, I'm starting to think
           you're intentionally not putting my
           initiative in the newsletter.
          Eyes down, Yule May hurries out of the kitchen.

          clean beneath it.
          Noticing something on the floor, Yule May leans over.
          She rises holding a SMALL RUBY RING. Years of dust and hair
          blanket the pitiful gem set in ten karat gold.
          The vacuum seems to roar louder now. Yule May breathes
          heavily. She shoves the ring into her uniform pocket.

          Only now does Skeeter notice the tray of champagne the waiter
          is holding. Stuart nods as two glasses are set before them.
          The waiter leaves.

          Hilly peers into the rearview mirror to get a better view.

          belly. Aibileen and Mae Mobley follow.
          A stream of people walk toward them, laughing.
          They round a corner to see FIFTY OLD TOILETS, in every shape
          and color imaginable, littering Hilly's lawn.
          Some have towering tanks with chain pulls at the top,
          providing amusement to the procession of cars driving by.
          The Holbrook's station wagon sits in the driveway, doors

          Two white men sit right behind the white driver.
          The bus slows to a stop in the middle of the road.
          In the distance, blue lights flash in front of a road block.
          A few people gather.

           Y'all stay put. Let me find out
           what's going on.
          As the driver gets up, a WLBT-TV news truck whizzes by
          followed by a police motorcycle. Aibileen leans in the aisle
          and looks ahead.
          The driver returns. The young black man speaks up.

          Aibileen turns to discover the young man is gone. She stares
          into the darkness. Scared, she begins to run.
          She cuts through a yard and trips over a hedge. She falls
          hard to her knees.
          Terrified, Aibileen begins to sob. She sees Minny's porch
          light and pulls herself up.

          anxiously to a radio on the table.
          Aibileen opens the screen door and falls to the floor.
          Minny jumps up to help her. She sees blood and grass stains
          streaking the knees of Aibileen's panty hose.

           I used to take a shortcut ever day
           to work at Doctor Dixon's house.
           Cut through this farmer's lower
           forty to get there. One day, that
           farmer was waitin' on me with a
           gun, said he'd shoot me dead if I
           walk on his land again. Doctor
           Dixon went and paid that farmer
           double for two a those acres. Told
           him he `bout to start farmin' too.
           But he bought it just for me. So I
           could get to work easy. He did.
          Skeeter closes her eyes for moment.
          When she opens them she sees A VISION OF CONSTANTINE STANDING

          BEFORE HER.
          Constantine smiles and grabs Skeeter's hand. She presses her
          thumb firmly in her palm. When Skeeter blinks again, the
          vision is gone.
          Standing in place of Constantine is GRETCHEN, 26.

                          GRETCHEN
           All these colored women have been
           real nice, haven't they?

           this? Every little thing about
           you. But you're so dumb, you think
           you're doing them a favor.
          Skeeter and the other maids are taken aback.

           You don't have to do this.

          Aibileen sits with Skeeter on the sofa reading and answering
          Miss Myrna letters. Aibileen is dressed very nicely.
          Several flower arrangements are placed around the room. An
          unwrapped present rests on the coffee table.

                          AIBILEEN
           Tell her to pour vinegar in her
           trash cans. Then them dogs will
           stay away.
          As Skeeter writes this down, someone walks onto Aibileen's
          front porch. Skeeter becomes worried. Aibileen looks to a
          wall clock and smiles.
          About a dozen letters and cards fall into a basket under the
          mail slot.
          Aibileen jumps up and starts sorting through the cards.

           And, from all over the county, my
           babies find they way home.
          Aibileen stops on one card in particular. She sits back down
          next to Skeeter.

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           Some even from overseas. Alton

           94.

                         
          Aibileen opens the card to find a twenty dollar bill inside
          along with a picture of the Spears family. Aibileen reads
          the card aloud.

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           I still don't drink coffee. Happy
           Birthday. Love Alton.
          Aibileen laughs and raises her hand to her mouth. Skeeter is
          touched.
          The doorbell rings. Aibileen jumps up and opens the door. A
          delivery man greets her with two more vases of flowers.
          Aibileen looks out to the street where a white woman gets out
          of her car with a huge country ham. Two little girls in
          matching dresses jump out behind her.
          The woman sees Aibileen on the porch and waves. Aibileen
          waves back and smiles.
          Catching it all, the moment soon grows bittersweet for
          Skeeter. She wipes her eye.

           No, Missus Walters. That Miss

           Momma can have a piece.
          Hilly slides the pie a little too fast down the counter
          toward Minny. Minny stops it before it falls to the floor.

                          HILLY
           Did what?
          Missus Walters immediately gets it. She bursts out laughing
          so hard she has to lower herself to the floor.

                          MISSUS WALTERS
           Well, Hilly, that's what you get, I
           guess. And you didn't just eat
           one. You ate two slices!
          Hilly starts to hyperventilate as everything sinks in.
          As Minny leaves, Hilly runs to the sink and throws up.

          The energy and look of the two hundred attendees feel like a
          throwback to the women's suffrage movement. Many older women
          wear heavy long black skirts and jackets.
          Hilly wears swathes of maroon-colored taffeta. Ruffles
          clutch her throat. She stands next to Jolene French and a

          Three dozen servers stand in a line. Minny and Aibileen are
          among them.
          Tables are covered with items donated for the auction.
          On the baked goods table, Minny's famed chocolate pie
          promises to again be a big money maker.
          Celia and Johnny enter the ballroom. Celia wears a hideous,
          pink and silver sequined gown. As usual, Celia's breasts
          command attention.
          The room locks on Celia as specks of light bounce off her
          dress and jiggle across the ceiling.
          A TITILLATED OLD HUSBAND tips his martini onto his wife's

          Jolene announces another round of winners loudly over the
          microphone, forcing Celia to raise her voice.

                          CELIA
           I don't know what you-

                          HILLY
           -You liar! Who did you tell?!
          Jolene loses her place on the list. The room grows quiet but
          Celia is still yelling.

                          CELIA
           Hilly, I got pregnant after you and
           Johnny broke up!
          The room echoes with Celia's words. Across the room, women's
          noses wrinkle.

                          MISSUS WALTERS
           Oh, shit.

                          HILLY
           Shut up, Mother.
          Stuart belts out with a laugh. Skeeter pinches his arm.
          Celia is mortified. Sweat beads on her forehead.

                          CELIA
           Johnny never cheated on you...At
           least, not with me.
          Celia starts to breathe heavily. Her eyes start to water.

                          HILLY
           Johnny would never-

                          CELIA
           And I'm sorry I thought you'd be
           tickled to win that pie.

                          HILLY
           You tell that nigra if she tells
           anybody, I will make her suffer.
          Horrified, Skeeter catches eyes with Minny and Aibileen.
          They all immediately look away.
          Johnny makes his way over. Celia holds her breath, shaking
          her head back and forth.

                          JOHNNY
           Celia, what's wrong, Honey?

                          CELIA
           Uh-oh.
          Celia leans over and vomits on the fleur-de-lis print carpet.
          The entire room gasps in horror.

           107.

                         

                          JOHNNY
           Oh, shit!
          Johnny tries to pull Celia back. She pushes Johnny away and
          runs for the bathroom. He follows.
          Hilly marches over to Aibileen who is standing nearby.

                          HILLY
           Get that cleaned up before it
           starts to smell.

          Minny's daughter, Sugar, stands over a large commercial sink
          filled with sudsy water, washing dishes.
          Minny approaches from behind as Sugar holds court with five
          other young girls.

                          SUGAR
           That big-boobed lady Momma works

          As the girls all laugh, Minny pops Sugar hard on the back of
          her head.

          Missus Walters steps up to Hilly.

                          MISSUS WALTERS
           I may have trouble remembering my
           own name and what country I live
           in. But there's two things I can't
           seem to forget. That my own
           daughter threw me in a nursing
           home...And that she ate Minny's
           shit.
          Missus Walters winks at Hilly and ambles to a waiting taxi
          cab.

          two other trays of uneaten food.

                          CELIA
           The way Hilly looked at me. Like I
           was trash on the road.
          Celia pulls a letter out from under the covers.

                          CELIA (CONT'D)
           She billed me for her dress. In
           lieu of payment, she's asked that I
           send two-hundred dollars to the
           African Children's Fund and then
           she banned me from all future
           League events.

           and accused me of getting her that
           pie. I wouldn't have thrown up if
           it wasn't for that! I can't do
           this anymore to Johnny. I'm going
           back to Sugar Ditch.

           Miss Hilly thought you knew `bout
           "The Terrible Awful," that you were
           making fun a her. It's my fault
           she pounced on you. But if you
           leave Mister Johnny, then Miss
           Hilly done won the whole ball game.
           Then she done beat me, and she done
           beat you.
          Celia lies there. Minny's concerned she's said too much.

          Aibileen grabs Faye Belle's hand stirring a sudden flash of

          Red-eyed, Skeeter enters Charlotte's room. A bowl rests on
          the bedside table with a wet rag draped over the side.
          Charlotte is wig free and terribly thin. Her collarbone
          protrudes long and narrow, but her eyes are as sharp as ever.

                          CHARLOTTE

                          CHARLOTTE
           Now, you look. I was good to
           Constantine. Oh, she talked back
           plenty of times, and I put up with
           it. But, Skeeter, she didn't give
           me a choice...

          Charlotte, much healthier, scurries around the house
          adjusting flower arrangements and straightening pictures.

           CHARLOTTE (V.O.)
           I was hosting a D.A.R. luncheon.
           Constantine was to do the floors
           that morning so they'd be dry in
           time.
          Charlotte finds Constantine mopping the foyer very slowly.
          The effects of arthritis are apparent.

           CHARLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Well, the floors were soaking wet
           when the first guest arrived.
          A guest unnecessarily grabs a table for balance, making a
          point about the damp floor...

                         

          INT. PHELAN PLANTATION (FLASHBACK) DINING ROOM - DAY

          Charlotte sits with twelve women at the dining table as
          Constantine pushes the casserole cart around and begins
          serving lunch.
          As the guests sip coffee, each woman grimaces and turns to
          Charlotte.

           CHARLOTTE (V.O.)
           Then, she burned the coffee. She
           had gotten so old, Skeeter.
          Charlotte shoots Constantine a look. Constantine nods
          sorrowfully. She picks up a woman's plate and begins filling
          it with food from the cart very slowly.
          Constantine strains to lower the plate in front of the woman.
          Her hands tremble.

           CHARLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Her mishaps were becoming a daily
           occurrence, and I had had it.
          The plate tilts causing peas to pour into the woman's lap.

                          WOMAN
           Watch out!
          With that, Charlotte stands up and slaps the table with her
          hand.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Get a hold of yourself,
           Constantine!
          Constantine slowly looks to Charlotte. Totally exhausted,
          she grips the casserole cart with both hands to steady
          herself.

           113.

                         

           CHARLOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           And that's when it happened.
          Constantine wets herself.
          Slowly the women begin realizing what's happening. The two
          women closest to Constantine gasp and quickly move away from
          her.
          Another woman rises from the table covering her mouth with a
          napkin and leaves the room.
          Just now realizing what has happened, Constantine looks down
          at her soiled dress. No one says a word. No one comes to
          Constantine's aid.
          Constantine looks to Charlotte.

          Constantine hobbles with a cane down a gravel road still

          at the Phelan Plantation...

                          CHARLOTTE
           I told her she couldn't work here

                          SKEETER
           How could you humiliate her like
           that?!

                          CHARLOTTE
           I didn't mean to.

                          SKEETER
           Why didn't you help her?

                          CHARLOTTE
           I was upset. I didn't know what
           else to do.

                          SKEETER
           So you just threw her away? That
           woman did you the biggest favor of
           your life. She taught me kindness
           and self respect and you just threw
           her away like a broken appliance.
          Charlotte starts to cry. Skeeter isn't affected.

                          CHARLOTTE
           I didn't throw her away, Skeeter.
           Your daddy went to her house the
           very next day to give her her job
           back. But she had already moved to
           Chicago. Left everything behind.

                          SKEETER
           `Cause she didn't have anything
           anymore. You broke her heart!

                          CHARLOTTE
           Please don't do this to me,
           Skeeter. I feel terrible. And you
           have to remember, they're not like
           us. They are different.
          Charlotte gets defensive.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           And you idolized her too much! You
           always have!

                          SKEETER
           I needed somebody to look up to.
          Skeeter turns to leave.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           I have to go find her. She needs
           me.

                          CHARLOTTE
           We finally found the address of her
           daughter in Chicago...so we sent
           Carlton up there to go get
           Constantine.
          Skeeter turns back to her mother.

                          SKEETER
           And?

                          CHARLOTTE
           When he got there...she was dead,
           Eugenia. I'm so sorry, Honey.
          Charlotte tries to comfort her. Skeeter rejects her mother's
          hand.

                          SKEETER
           Why didn't y'all tell me all this?

                          CHARLOTTE
           I knew you'd blame me...when it
           wasn't my fault. It just happened,
           and it was so unfortunate. I'm
           sorry, Eugenia.

                          SKEETER
           When did she die? How long had she
           been in Chicago?

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           Constantine's story finally made it
           in our book. But the reason she
           got fired did not. Miss Skeeter
           just couldn't put that kind a shame
           on her own mother.

          The front window of a bookstore displays many of the nation's
          top selling books.
          A clerk sets a tiny stack of books in the far corner.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           They printed a few thousand copies
           with the worst advance Miss Stein
           had ever seen.
          The stack is "The Help," in hardcover. It's wrapped in pale
          blue. A white peace dove spreads its wing under the title.

          Minny stands over the stove frying chicken as Sugar enters
          with the day's mail. Minny snatches the mail from her and
          sees an envelope from Harper and Row.
          Minny tears it open. Her eyes go wide.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           We got four hundred dollars. Got
           another four hundred when it got
           printed. Divided thirteen ways
           that came to sixty-one fifty-three
           a person.
          Minny hugs Sugar and runs out the screen door with her check
          as the chicken sizzles.

           Come on, Miss Celia! Get out a
           that bed and let me in. It's
           twelve noon. I did all the
           shopping just like you asked.
          The door slowly opens. Celia steps out onto the porch,
          looking beautiful, still dressed tacky.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           Well, look at you, Miss Celia.

                          CELIA
           I cooked it all by myself. I wanted
           to do something special. I wanted

           Greens got just the right amount a
           hock taste to `em. That's a good
           pot liquor, Miss Celia. Who taught
           you to cook like this?
          Minny winks as she dunks a piece of corn bread in the greens.

                          MINNY (CONT'D)
           Corn bread's happy now.

           Big house, big yard, good husband.

                          CELIA
           You know, if I were you, I'd give
           it right back to him. I'd hit him
           over the head with a skillet and
           tell him to go straight to hell...
          Minny starts to protest but is tired of excuses.

                          MINNY
           Maybe I will.
          Celia jumps up.

                          STUART
           Skeeter, I told Daddy I'm not going
           back on the rig.
          Stuart nonchalantly pulls out a ring from his front pocket
          and places it in Skeeter's lap.
          A huge diamond is surrounded by twelve small sapphires.
          Skeeter's smile quickly fades as she raises the ring.

                          SKEETER
           Stuart...I have to tell you
           something.

                          STUART
           How about "yes?!" I had this with
           me down in New Orleans, you know.
          Skeeter touches Stuart's face.

                          SKEETER
           I'm serious...and...you have to
           promise not to tell anyone.

                          STUART
           Hang on. Did you say `yes'?

                          SKEETER
           Yes.
          Stuart hugs Skeeter. She pulls back.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           But listen. Can I have your word?
          Skeeter has again ruined Stuart's big moment.

                          STUART
           Sure. You have my word.

          Stuart storms off the porch, dumbfounded. Finally.

                          STUART
           This is what you've been writing
           for the last twelve months?! What
           happened to the cleaning column?

                          SKEETER
           I did both.

          Skeeter approaches Stuart.

                          STUART
           So, the talk in town? I said they
           were dead wrong. Told them you
           were too smart to get mixed up in
           anything like that.
          Skeeter reaches to calm him. He pulls away.

                          STUART (CONT'D)
           That joke you played on Hilly with
           the toilets. Hell, that's funny.
           But this? I don't understand why
           you did this...why you even care.

                          SKEETER
           What?

                          STUART
           Things are fine around here. Why
           stir up trouble?

                          SKEETER
           I'm not stirring up trouble,
           Stuart. Trouble's already here.

                          STUART
           I guess it is.
          Skeeter grabs his arm.

                          SKEETER
           I had to tell you. You needed to
           know.
          Stuart shakes his head and pulls away...

                          STUART
           I guess I don't really know you,
           Skeeter. And I can't marry somebody
           I don't know.
          Stuart looks down at the ring.

                          STUART (CONT'D)
           That was my grandmother's.
          Skeeter hands the ring back. Stuart shoves it in his pocket.

                          STUART (CONT'D)
           Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

                          SKEETER

           Of course. He had to ask Daddy for
           your hand.
          She lifts Skeeter's ring hand. Seeing her bare finger,
          Charlotte's smile fades. Skeeter prepares for the worst.

                          SKEETER
           Just say it.

           Took this one a year. Anyway, my
           news. After a long talk with your
           daddy, I've made a decision. My

           But, as I said, I made a decision.

           Too late. I tried calling Fanny
           Mae's so I could make your hair
           appointments for the next twenty
           years, but they wouldn't allow it.
          Charlotte raises Skeeter's ring finger.

          Ernestine rides in the passenger seat.
          Hilly slows in front of the store's big glass entrance. She
          hurriedly waves Ernestine out of the car.

          louder than humanly possible.

          Knocking that has actually stirred Minny awake.
          Sugar and Kindra enter, jumping in bed with Minny.

          Aibileen glances proudly at the framed portrait of Dr. King.

          Skeeter pulls a letter out of her purse.

                          SKEETER
           I got a job offer from Harper and
           Row...in New York.

           I not taking it. I just wanted to
           share it with you both. There's no
           one else I can tell.

           What you mean you not takin' it?
           This is what you been dreaming of.

                          SKEETER
           I can't leave you two right when
           things are getting bad from a mess
           I created. I set out to write a
           book to make white people thankful.
           But in the end, what we should say
           is "sorry."

           If bad things happen, they ain't
           nothing you can do about it. And
           if they happen, at least now theys
           a reason behind it. A reason we
           can wrap our heads around and be
           proud of...
          Skeeter nods with little relief.

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           Now, I don't mean to rub salt in
           your wound, but...you ain't got a
           good life here in Jackson. Plus,
           your momma's getting better-
          Minny aggressively chimes in.

                          MINNY
           You ain't got nothing left here but
           enemies in the Junior League. You

           body know it. So don't walk your
           white butt to New York, RUN IT!
          Minny leans over, placing her hand on Skeeter's for the first
          time since knowing each other.

          EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - NIGHT

          Skeeter stands next to the barn smoking a cigarette reading
          the Harper and Row offer for the hundredth time.
          Tires crunch gravel down the drive. Skeeter sees a car
          moving toward her with the headlights off.
          Worried, Skeeter looks toward her home. Charlotte can be
          seen in an upstairs window.
          Skeeter soon recognizes the car as Hilly's.
          Hilly parks, lights a cigarette and gets out of her car.
          Skeeter charges toward her.

                          SKEETER
           What are you doing here?
          Hilly screams and throws her lit cigarette at Skeeter.

                          HILLY
           Don't you get an inch closer!
          Hilly's a mess. Her shirt is half tucked. Her shorts strain
          to contain a newly developed layer of fat.
          A horrible fever blister burns hot on Hilly's upper lip.

                          HILLY (CONT'D)
           I've contacted my lawyer, Hibbie
           Goodman. He's the best libel
           attorney in Mississippi. You're in
           big trouble, Missy. And you're
           going to jail.

                          SKEETER
           You can't prove anything, Hilly.

                          HILLY
           I one-hundred-percent know you
           wrote it `cause nobody else in town
           is as tacky as you. Those nigras of
           yours are in a lifetime of trouble.

                          SKEETER
           Exactly who are you talking about?
           You don't know anything.

           the next time she wants to write
           about my dear friend Elizabeth...uh-
           huh. Remember her? Had you in her
           wedding? Let's just say, Aibileen
           ought to've been a little bit
           smarter before putting in the L-
           shaped crack in poor Elizabeth's
           dining table. And that nigra,
           Minny? Do I have plans for her.

                          SKEETER
           Careful, Hilly. Don't give
           yourself away now.

                          HILLY
           That was not me WHO ATE THAT PIE!
          Hilly storms up the porch steps. Skeeter follows.

                          SKEETER
           I did not invite you here!
          Skeeter yanks Hilly's arm hard.

                          HILLY
           I've come to tell your mother what
           a hippie you've become. She's
           gonna be disgusted by you.
          Skeeter can't help but laugh.

                          SKEETER
           You're telling my mother on me?
          Hilly opens the door. Skeeter grabs her. They struggle.

                          SKEETER (CONT'D)
           You get out of here!
          Charlotte suddenly appears. Skeeter lets go of Hilly.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Why, Hilly...It's been such a long
           time, Dear. Everything okay, you
           two?
          Hilly is shocked by Charlotte's frail appearance.

                          HILLY
           Missus Phelan, I'm...I'm here to-

                          CHARLOTTE
           Hilly, you're a mess. Are you ill?
          Hilly self-consciously licks her fever blister.

                          HILLY
           Well, I...I didn't have time to get
           fixed up before-

           Darling, no husband wants to come
           home and see this.
          Charlotte peers closely at Hilly's cold sore.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           And that...that is horrendous.

                          HILLY
           Missus Phelan, I'm here-

                          CHARLOTTE
           You know, Hilly. If I didn't know
           any better, I'd say you've been
           eating too many...SWEETS?
          Hilly's face turns purple with embarrassment. Charlotte
          moves in for the kill.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           In fact. I'm sure of it. Now GET
           OUT OF MY HOUSE...before we all get
           one of those on our lip.
          Hilly looks back and forth between Skeeter and her mother,
          not knowing what to say.
          Hilly runs out of the house as Charlotte sashays quietly into
          the living room.
          Shocked, Skeeter stands alone in the foyer. Hilly sprays
          gravel across the Phelan yard as she speeds away.

           CHARLOTTE (O.C.) (CONT'D)
           Eugenia?

           Come in here, please.
          Skeeter gulps as she heads toward the living room.

           Ma'am?

                          CHARLOTTE
           Do you have plans tomorrow? Bible
           study? Anything like that?

           No, Ma'am.

           Good. We're going shopping.
          Skeeter lets out a big sigh of relief.

                          CHARLOTTE (CONT'D)
           `Cause no single daughter of mine
           is going to New York, representing
           the great state of Mississippi,
           without a proper cosmopolitan

           I'm very proud of you, Eugenia.

           How do you know about New York?

                          CHARLOTTE
           A friend of Constantine's told me.
          Charlotte reaches down and pulls up her copy of "The Help".

           Would you do me the honor of
           signing my copy?
          Skeeter nods. Charlotte hands Skeeter a pen. Her hand
          trembles as she signs the book, never having guessed how good
          it would feel.

           Good morning.
          Hilly licks her cold sore as she steps forward. She glides
          her hand across the L-shaped crack in the Elizabeth's table,
          drawing Aibileen's attention to it.

           When you returned it, three pieces
           were missing out of the felt
           wrapper. A fork and two spoons.

           for being a thief. And your
           friend, Minny? That nigra's got a
           nice surprise coming to her.
           Johnny Foote listens to what I say.
           She's as good as-
          Aibileen shouts, interrupting Hilly.

                          AIBILEEN
           Woman!...I know something about
           you. Don't you forget that.
          Hilly narrows her eyes.

                          AIBILEEN (CONT'D)
           From what Yule May says, they's a
           lot a time to write letters from
           jail. Plenty a time to write ever
           person in Jackson the truth about
           you, and the paper is free.

                          HILLY
           Nobody would believe something you
           wrote.

                          AIBILEEN
           I don't know. Already sold a lot a
           books.
          Fear floods into Hilly's eyes.

                          HILLY
           Get out of here!

                          MAE MOBLEY
           Don't go, Aibiee!
          Aibileen kneels down as Elizabeth returns with the syrup.

                          AIBILEEN
           Baby, you need to get back to bed.
           You got a fever.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           Noooo! Don't go, Aibee. Please
           don't leave.

                          AIBILEEN
           I gots to, Baby. I am so sorry.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           Why? Are you going to take care of
           another little girl?

                          AIBILEEN
           No, Baby, that's not the reason. I
           don't want to leave you, but...It's
           time for me to retire. You my last
           little girl.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           Noooo!

                          AIBILEEN
           Baby Girl, I need you to remember
           ever thing I told you. Okay? Do
           you remember what I told you?

                          MAE MOBLEY
           To wipe my bottom good?

                          AIBILEEN
           No, Baby. The other. What you
           are.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           You is kind. You is smart. You is
           important.

                          AIBILEEN
           That's right, Baby Girl.
          Aibileen squeezes Mae Mobley for the last time. They both
          cry together. Hilly speaks up.

                          HILLY
           You need to go now, Aibileen!
          Aibileen rises up from Mae Mobley and turns to Elizabeth.

                          AIBILEEN
           Give my sweet girl a chance.
          Elizabeth avoids eye contact. Aibileen turns and walks away.
          As Elizabeth leans down to pick up Mae Mobley....HER WATER
          BREAKS. She glares at Hilly with shock and regret.

                         

          EXT. LEEFOLT HOME - MOMENTS LATER

          Aibileen steps out of the house with her purse.
          She walks stoically down the driveway. Tears stream down her
          face.
          Mae Mobley runs to the living room window crying. She beats
          on the glass from inside.

                          MAE MOBLEY
           Aibeeeee! Don't go!
          Aibileen never turns.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           Mae Mobley was my last baby. In
           just thirty minutes, I felt like my
           whole life was done. Of the
           thirteen maids, seven of us got
           fired. Several other maids got
           fired who had nothin' to do with
           our book. Guess our stories
           weren't so unique after all...But,
           like Minny, we was all free.

                         

          INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

          Hilly, even fatter now, sifts through the day's mail.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           And we's was a lot freer than Hilly
           Holbrook.
          She comes across a piece from Celia Foote addressed to The
          Starving Children of Africa Fund. A smug smile forms.
          She opens the envelope to find a check for $200.00 made out
          to: TWO-SLICE HILLY!
          Hilly screams as she rips the check into pieces.

                         

          EXT. FOOTE ESTATE - YARD - DAY

          Minny folds laundry on a picnic table.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           Ever so often, we all get a nice
           piece of book money in the mail.
           `Manna from heaven' we like to call
           it.
          Minny looks across the table and smiles at Celia who is
          holding and playing with Minny's newborn child.

          Close on tombstone:

                         

                          CONSTANTINE JEFFERSON
           Born December 24th 1883
           Died March 15th, 1963
          A bouquet of flowers lay at the foot of the tombstone. A
          copy of "The Help" leans against it.
          In the distance, a cab slowly pulls away with Skeeter inside.

           139.

                         

          INT. AIBILEEN'S HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

          Aibileen sits at her kitchen table, typing on Skeeter's old
          typewriter. We watch as keys write out the rest of
          Aibileen's voice over.

           AIBILEEN (V.O.)
           Thousands of our books went out all
           over the world. We had got paid to
           tell the truth and we just couldn't
           believe it...
          Aibileen takes this last page out of the typewriter and
          places it behind two hundred other typed out pages.
          She looks up to the framed picture of Treelore and rises from
          the table with pride.

                         

          INT. HARPER AND ROW - SKEETER'S OFFICE - NEW YORK - DAY

          Skeeter smiles as she reads from a book in her corner office.
          The Manhattan skyline rises behind her. She wears Pucci.
          Her hair is perfectly styled. She looks gorgeous.
          She sets the book down on her desk and picks up the phone.
          The book's cover reads:
           "All My Babies"
           By Aibileen Clark
          Next to the book is a glass box. Constantine's corn pipe
          rests inside.

                         

          AIBILEEN'S NEW HOME - LIVING ROOM - FIFTEEN YEARS LATER
          Aibileen, 70, rises from a sofa. Her hair is gray. Reading
          glasses hang on a chain from around her neck.
          As she begins a slow walk down the hall, we see the
          surroundings of her new home for the first time. It's much
          bigger, well furnished and beautiful.
          She passes a study lined with shelves of books. A copy of
          "The Help" and "All My Babies" are placed side by side.
          At the end of the hall, Aibileen approaches the opened door
          of a brightly lit, sparkling white, bathroom.
          She enters the bathroom and closes the door.
