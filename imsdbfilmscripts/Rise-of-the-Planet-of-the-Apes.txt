          EYES. Expressive, alive. Human?
           No. They belong to a FEMALE CHIMPANZEE: BRIGHT EYES.

          EXT. GROVE OF TREES -- DAY

          She sits in a tree with ALPHA, her mate - large and muscular,
          a PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ACROSS HIS SHOULDER, LIKE A

          SHOOTING STAR.
          Around them, under the TREE CANOPY, a COMMUNITY OF
          CHIMPANZEES naps, eats, plays.

          EXT. WEST AFRICAN JUNGLE - DAY

          A DOZEN POACHERS on horseback slog through the jungle.
          They're working towards the GROVE, visible in the distance.
          As they near it, the LEADER points, sending the MEN moving
          quietly, NETS and RIFLES ready.

          EXT. CANOPY - DAY

          Alpha sits up, sensing something. BIRDS take sudden flight.
          He stands on the branch and YELLS OUT A WARNING. FEAR
          ignites the community - but too late.
          POACHERS BURST INTO THE CLEARING, horses' hooves kicking up
          dirt. CHIMPS SCATTER.
          Bright Eyes wants to stay by Alpha's side, but he bares his
          teeth and sends her off.
          Then he drops, landing firmly on the clearing floor. All
          around him, POACHERS pursue terrified apes, nets swinging.
          MALE CHIMPANZEES jump up and down, SHOUTING AND SCREECHING -
          an aggressive show. A futile attempt to protect the tribe.
          Alpha zeroes in on a POACHER attempting to scoop up a YOUNG
          CHIMP. He streaks across the clearing, KNOCKS THE POACHER

          FROM HIS MOUNT.
          Alpha POUNDS his CHEST, letting out a BATTLE CRY -- trying to
          rally a counter-attack.
          But the other chimps pay no heed. There's no organization to
          the defense. It's chaos.
          SHOTS RING OUT. The Chimps mauling the Poacher drop, one by
          one. Others take off.

          net. He RUSHES to save her, leaps in the air...

          A SHOT RINGS OUT.

          Will looks at a monitor showing the BRAIN SCAN OF THE CHIMP.
          The image starts to shake. Concerned, he looks to the other

          sometimes.
          He's oblivious to this, instead intent on getting the scan

          Good morning, Felix. Bam Bam.
          Monty. Hey - what's the matter,
          don't like my cooking?

          SUPER: TWO WEEKS LATER
          He pauses in front of Bright Eyes, huddled at the back of her
          cage.

                         FRANKLIN
          I'll check on her when we're done.
          Franklin unlocks a cage and leads a CHIMP - LUCKY - into the
          next room, where Caroline waits beside the CT scanner.
          Lucky's head is shaved, exposing a long, curving scar on his
          cranium.
          From Bright Eyes' vantage point she can see through the open
          door as Lucky's strapped down.

                         WILL
          I'm not good with this stuff.
          Jacobs puts a hand on Will's back, leads him inside.

          From the back of her cage, Bright Eyes watches through the

          can find a sanctuary.

          Bright Eyes - the mother. That's
          why she wouldn't let anyone into
          her cage.
          Will looks down at the helpless baby.

                         WILL
          I'm sorry, Franklin - I'm sorry -
          but there's nothing I can do here.
          He's got to be put down like the
          others.

          (producing a syringe)
          I'm done for the day. So you be my
          guest.
          Franklin hands the LONG NEEDLE to Will.
          It's quiet. Will can hear the baby's WHEEZY breath. He
          enters the cage kneels beside it, regards his tiny body, his
          little hands.
          Will readies the needle, brings it close to the chimp's
          belly... but there's no way he can go through with this.
          Angrily Will tosses the needle aside. Turns to Franklin, who
          watches from outside the cage.

                         WILL
          Two days. Then you have to figure

          INT. WALMART - NIGHT

          A BOX OF DIAPERS pulled from the shelf and tossed into a
          cart.
          Will moves down the aisle in a daze, the baby chimp - covered
          in a blanket - plastered to his chest.
          He stops at the powdered formulas, overwhelmed by the array
          of choices.

          EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Will pulls up in his truck.

          EXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

          Will's coat is pulled forward to shield the baby at his
          chest. He barely has the key in the lock when Irena opens
          the door.

                         IRENA
          It's Friday night. I had a date.

                         WILL
          I'm sorry - there was -
          She doesn't wait to hear his excuse, just moves down the
          walk, her footfalls pointed and angry.
           He pauses there. Apparently no end to this bad day.

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Will dumps the baby goods on the counter, heads for the
          refrigerator. The infant's still plastered to his chest.
          He opens the fridge, grabs a crisper drawer, empties its
          contents in the sink.
          Then Will REACHES INTO HIS JACKET POCKET AND TAKES OUT THE

          VIAL OF 112. CAREFULLY HE PLACES IT INTO THE DRAWER AND

          ROLLS THE DRAWER BACK IN THE FRIDGE.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Will sleeps the deep sleep of exhaustion. A HIGH PITCHED
          WAIL comes from another part of the house.
          Will sits up, remembering.

          INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

          Will enters, half asleep, turns on the light. The baby chimp
          lies in a cardboard box on the floor and he's obviously sick,
          making UNNATURAL WHEEZING NOISES.

          Will turns on the HOT WATER. SHUTS the door. Holding the
          limp, feeble chimp in his arms, he puts down the toilet seat
          and sits.

                         WILL
          It's okay. It's going to be okay.
          Awkwardly, he even rocks back and forth a little bit.
          Will looks down at the chimp, struggling for breath. The
          room fills with STEAM.

                         CUT TO:
          A LARGE MALE CHIMPANZEE IN THE WILD. He stands at the top of
          a tree, an alpha male, eyeing the CHIMPS around him.
          In a sudden BURST of movement, the CHIMPANZEE TAKES OFF,
          FLYING FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH with tremendous force, a FREIGHT

          TRAIN OF THREAT, POWER AND VIOLENCE.
          Teeth bared in a terrifying display, the ape easily
          intimidates all the chimps around him.

          REVEAL THAT THE CHIMP IMAGES ARE YOU-TUBE AND WILL'S WATCHING

          THEM ON HIS LAPTOP.
          Abruptly he closes it. Looks down at the infant, so peaceful
          in his arms.

          INT. HOUSE - DAY

          The chimp - looking like a toddler - walks out of the
          bathroom, hiking up a pair of shorts. WE FOLLOW HIM THROUGH
          THE HOUSE as he zig zags up and over furniture.
          The house looks warmer, cluttered, more lived-in.
          The chimp arrives at a hallway, where he leaps into the air
          and grabs hold of a CORD that hangs from the ceiling.
          As his weight pulls it down, there's a SQUEAK and a FOLD DOWN
          LADDER opens from above. WE FOLLOW HIM up the ladder into...

          .the attic. Beams of light streaming through a LARGE VENT
          TO THE OUTSIDE. Rings and pegs for climbing are set into the
          walls. Toys, books and puzzles scattered across the floor.
          SOUNDS of KIDS PLAYING and LAUGHING OUTSIDE.
          The chimp heads for the vent and peers through. WE GO OVER

          HIS SHOULDER TO SEE...

          EXT. THE OUTSIDE WORLD - DAY

          From up here, the chimp has a commanding view of the entire
          neighborhood. A group of CHILDREN rides bikes. A MAN mows
          his lawn.
          There's a HONK below, and the chimp watches as a TAXI pulls
          up to the HOUSE NEXT DOOR.
          HUNSIKER - A MAN in an AIRLINE PILOT uniform - kisses his
          WIFE and young DAUGHTER, ALICE, then climbs into the cab with
          his carry-on suitcase.
          Alice clutches a doll in her hand as she watches her daddy's
          Taxi disappear around the corner... Then TODD, the big
          brother, SWIPES THE DOLL FROM HER HAND and rides off on his
          bike. His FRIENDS LAUGH.
          The chimp watches, riveted, as the Alice BURSTS INTO OUTRAGED
          TEARS and runs after them.

          WILL (O.S.)
          Caesar! Breakfast!
          The chimp turns at Will's call. HIS NAME IS CAESAR.

          INT. HOUSE - DAY

          Will comes away from the ladder, heads for the kitchen.
          The living room floor is strewn with puzzles and games. One
          of them has been completed. Will considers it, looks around
          for the box, reads the side...
          AGES 12 and up. 12 and up.
          Caesar runs past, jumps onto d chair at the kitchen table,
          picks up a fork and starts eating his eggs and potatoes.
          Will walks over, sits across from him.

          The mouse moves effortlessly through the maze until it
          reaches an ORANGE CONE at a crossroads. The mouse stops,
          studies the cone.

          Walter's parked in front of the TV, not watching it.
          Caesar sits at the table looking at a flat board with three
          wooden poles. There are four colored blocks threaded on the
          first pole, stacked biggest to smallest, making a 'tower'.

          on a different pole. It's easy for him.
          Finished, Caesar looks up at him. Will fumbles in his
          pocket, HANDS CAESAR SOME M&MS.

          Will uploads the MPEG video of Caesar doing the puzzle and

           Will flips on a light. Enters. Closes the door behind him.
           Taking a key from his pocket he approaches a SMALL, PADLOCKED
           REFRIGERATOR and unlocks it. Opens the door.

          Will sits on the edge of the sofa, the VIAL of 112 in his
          hand. He's deep in agonized thought.
          Finally he takes a SYRINGE and FILLS IT WITH THE GREEN
          LIQUID. Then he stands, walks to a closed door.

          INT. WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

          The opening door sends a wash of light into the dark room.
          Walter's in bed. He opens his eyes, squinting at the

          NOTICE IMMEDIATELY THAT HE'S GROWN OLDER.

          SUPER: TWO YEARS LATER
          Caesar's features are more mature. He appears more like a
          "little boy" - and his EYES HAVE TURNED A DEEP GREEN.
          Back and forth Caesar goes, as high as he can manage.
          At the height of his forward motion, he peers down into the
          neighbor's yard where, for just an instant, HE CAN SEE TODD

          PLAYING BALL WITH ALICE AND ANOTHER KID.
          At the height of his backward motion he catches another
          glimpse.
          Caesar pumps his legs, eager to get a better look...

          WE FIND WALTER just sitting down on the piano bench. He
          begins playing a competent version of "CLAIR DE LUNE."

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Will pauses, listening to the MUSIC. He moves to the doorway
          to watch his father.
          The happiness - the relief - is clear on his face.

          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

          SQUEAK.SQUEAK of the SWING, the PIANO FAINT from out here.
          Caesar studies the harness that's keeping him in the swing.
          There's a clamp on either side and a clamp on the back. He
          undoes the one on his right side. CLICK. Then the left
          side. CLICK.
          Caesar wriggles the harness around so that he can reach the
          clamp on his back with his long chimpanzee arms.

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          Will returns to his sandwich making. It takes him a moment
          to notice that CAESAR HAS DISAPPEARED FROM THE SWING.
          The color drains from his face.

          EXT. HUNSIKER BACK YARD - DAY

           Caesar stands at the edge of the yard, unsure what to do
          next. All three kids - Todd, Alice and Todd's buddy - have
          stopped playing to stare at him.
          Caesar spots a BALL lying on the grass. He picks it up and
          tosses it to Todd's Buddy. The Boy catches it, throws it
          back to Caesar.

                         TODD'S BUDDY
          Check it. He wants to play.
          Thrilled at the contact, Caesar throws the ball to Todd. But
          Todd has an idea, and the idea makes him smile.
          Alice doesn't have a good feeling. She watches as her
          brother throws the ball to his Buddy OVER CAESAR'S HEAD.

          sure what's funny.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Will and Walter walk down the street looking for Caesar.

          Todd and his buddy throw the ball over Caesar's head, while
          Caesar jumps to try and catch it.

          TODD AND FRIEND
          Monkey in the middle, monkey in the
          middle...
          Caesar's having fun, unaware that the game has become keep-
          away from him. Until he NOTICES ALICE'S EXPRESSION - SHE

          FEELS SORRY FOR HIM.

          THEN, IN A STOMACH-LURCHING MOMENT CAESAR REALIZES WHAT'S

          GOING ON: HE'S THE BUTT OF A JOKE.
          They're making fun of him.
          "MONKEY", "MONKEY", "MONKEY"... The chanted words ring in
          Caesar's ears. He drops his arms and walks over to Todd,
          stepping close, hot rage escaping from his nostrils.
          Todd tries to laugh it off, but the fear's plain on his face.
          Alice runs inside.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Will and Walter search down the street. Then they hear it:

          Will JUMPS INTO THE YARD AND PUTS HIMSELF BETWEEN HUNSIKER

          Hold on - it's okay - he's
          harmless!

          Your monkey came onto my property!
          Threatened my kids!
          By now Caesar has climbed into Will's arms, burying his head
          in. his neck. Will backs toward the gate.

                         WILL
          It won't happen again...

                         HUNSIKER

          What does he do for fun?
          Will's brought Caesar in for a check-up. He's a little
          thrown by the question.

                         WILL
          Well we've got puzzles, games, a
          swing set...

                         WILL
          We'll work on that.
          Stewart continues examining Caesar. Will watches her listen
          to his heart. Closing her eyes for a moment, listening.

          understand the question.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          How about dinner and a movie?
          Stewart pulls the stethoscope from her ears.

                         STEWART
          I'm sorry, did you say something?
          He starts to try again - but the moment's gone.

                         WILL
          No - nothing.
          Caesar meets Will's eyes, obviously disappointed.
          Stewart lingers a moment, certain she's missed something -
          but Will doesn't say more.

          EXT. MUIR WOODS, ESTABLISHING - DAY

          From high above, WE PASS OVER the Golden Gate Bridge, the
          link between the bustling city and a huge, green FOREST.

          Caesar - driving with Walter and Will -- looks out the window,
          extremely excited.

          As Caesar scrambles out of the truck, WILL HOOKS A HARNESS
          TO HIS COLLAR and helps Walter from the car.
          The chimp looks around at the SOARING TREES. What is this
          place? The three of them head into the forest, Caesar
          tugging at the leash.

          They've walked deep into the park. No people here. Will
          kneels next to Caesar.

                         WILL
          Don't go far. Stay where I can see
          you.
          Will takes OFF CAESAR'S HARNESS. The chimpanzee runs, begins
          flying from tree to tree. Will watches, nervous. But it's
          gratifying to see Caesar so happy.
          The CHIMP DISAPPEARS around a corner. A moment passes, then
          another. The men follow... and discover CAESAR STANDING IN A

          GROVE OF TREES.

          I'd never find you.

          BUT CAESAR BARELY HEARS HIM. HE'S UTTERLY CAPTIVATED. THE

          SPOT IS BEAUTIFUL, WITH GREEN, LUSH BRANCHES JOINING TO FORM

          A CANOPY OVERHEAD.

                         WALTER
          Go ahead. Climb!
          The men sit down on a log, watching as Caesar swings from the
          branches. Free, elated. An animal in his element.
          Caesar begins climbing a redwood. Our view of him is
          obscured by the leaves. As his dark form ascends, Will and
          Walter become smaller and smaller down below.

          SUPER: THREE YEARS LATER
          RUSTLING LEAVES whisper Caesar upward. He moves with an easy
          grace, exhilarated by the freedom.
          At the TOP of the giant redwood CAESAR EMERGES THROUGH THE

          LEAVES - AND WE SEE THAT HE'S GROWN, FILLED OUT - THE CHIMP

          EQUIVALENT OF A FULL-BLOWN TEENAGER.

          HIS DISTINCTIVE LOOKS ARE MORE PRONOUNCED NOW: EYES A DEEP

          GREEN, FEATURES SOMEWHAT LESS SIMIAN, PERHAPS MORE HUMAN...
          Caesar looks across the bay to San Francisco, looks north at
          the mountains. Then down to Will below.
          Will's pointing to his watch.

          Will attaches the harness and they walk together. Caesar's
          much taller now - over five feet.

                         WILL
          Sorry to rush you - got to get home
          and check on Walter.
          They approach a WOMAN with a LARGE DOG on a leash - a GREAT
          DANE. The dog BARKS, lunging menacingly. The Woman
          struggles to control him.

          sweet.
          The big dog keeps BARKING.
          Annoyed, Caesar finally turns and gives him a LARGE,

          CHIMPANZEE SNARL, BARING HIS TEETH.
          The Great Dane immediately WHIMPERS - terrified - and pulls
          the Woman away.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Guess he had it coming.
          Caesar watches as the Woman walks off with the dog, HIS GAZE

           THEN HIS EYES MOVE TO HIS OWN LEASH. Is he a pet too?

          Will's deeply disappointed.

          EXT. ZOO - DAY

          Disoriented because of the construction, Will makes a wrong
          turn as he leads Caesar to the car.
          They find themselves in front of THE PRIMATE ENCLOSURE.
          Caesar goes rigid, staring at a DOZEN CHIMPS in the branches
          of the trees - behind bars. They stare back at him. One
          CHIMP, a GRIZZLED OLD MALE, STEPS FORWARD - OMINOUS. HE

          LOOKS AT CAESAR AS IF LOOKING INTO HIS SOUL.
          Caesar's transfixed.
          Will looks back and forth between the chimps and Caesar.
          Neither makes a sound.

                         WILL

          higher in the tree to watch. Suddenly they ALL BEGIN TO

          SCREAM IN A DEAFENING CHATTER.

          INT. ATTIC - DAY

          Caesar stands at the vent watching the neighborhood TEENAGERS
          walk home from school.
          One BOY walks with a blonde teenage GIRL, books clutched to
          her chest. Caesar watches the Boy flirt with her. The girl
          smiles, flirts back.
          One of the younger Kids runs by, bopping the Boy on the head.
          The BOY SHOOTS HIM THE FINGER and returns to the girl.
          Caesar's fascinated by these antics. He wants to be with
          these teens. He wants to be one of them.

          Caesar stands in front of a FULL LENGTH MIRROR, shirtless.
          He stands up straight, like a human. Tries to imitate their
          posture, their gait.

          BUT FROM THE MIRROR A CHIMPANZEE STARES BACK AT HIM. A

          CHIMPANZEE WITH GREEN EYES.

          THERE'S A PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ON HIS SHOULDER - JUST

          LIKE ALPHA'S.
           He runs two fingers down the length of it.

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Caesar, Walter and Will sit at the dinner table. There's
          tension here, but we can't place it yet.
          Then WE SEE that WALTER IS STRUGGLING TO EAT BECAUSE HE'S
          USING THE WRONG END OF THE SPOON. He clutches the utensil,
          staring at it.

                         WILL
          Turn it around, Dad. You're using
          the wrong end.
          Walter looks at Will, uncomprehending.
          With care and compassion, Caesar reaches over and helps the
          old man, adjusting the spoon.
          Will watches. Heartbroken.

          A MOUSE runs through a MAZE. It reaches a fork in the path,

          The Aide settles on a news show covering preparations for a

          Hearing the CRASH, Caesar jumps to his feet, rushes to the
          vent. He sees Hunsiker emerge from the smashed car, unhurt.
          Caesar watches as Hunsiker inspects the ruined front fender,
          then turns to YELL at someone.
          That's when Walter comes into Caesar's view.
          He's in the street, afraid, disoriented - while Hunsiker
          rages, jabbing a threatening finger towards Walter's chest.
          In a flash Caesar's down the attic stairs.

          Walter backs up as Hunsiker approaches, still jabbing the
          menacing finger.

          But Caesar's too carried away by his rage - he shrugs the old
          man off his back.

          Just as Hunsiker's about to reach his front door, Caesar
          flies from behind - his feet hitting the door - and lands to
          block Hunsiker's entrance.
          White with terror, Hunsiker - clutching his bleeding hand to
          his chest - takes off running down the sidewalk.

          Hunsiker runs for his life. He looks over his shoulder -

          He tries to speed up - can't go any faster. Again he glances
          over his shoulder - Caesar's closing in.
          Breath coming hard, Hunsiker sprints, scrambles, desperate to
          escape. He looks over his shoulder-but this time CAESAR

          HAS DISAPPEARED. HE'S NOT ANYWHERE, UP OR DOWN THE STREET.
          Unsure where to go, half-stumbling, Hunsiker keeps running.
          Then, OUT OF NOWHERE, CAESAR SWINGS DOWN FROM A TREE. HE

          LANDS SQUARELY IN FRONT OF HUNSIKER, BLOCKING HIS PATH.
          Hunsiker backs up, changes direction, runs across the street.

          branch and swings from tree to tree.
          with one giant jump, he makes it to the top of a tree across
          the street, tracking Hunsiker like prey.
          Hunsiker's running out of steam. Caesar swings down in front
          of him and KICKS him in the chest, sending him flying.
          Calmly he stands over Hunsiker, who cowers.

          Caesar pounds his chest, YELLING in triumph.

          pulls him out of his euphoria: WALTER - STRUGGLING, BLOODY -

          Will and a chimpanzee? Jacobs stares at the TV, dumbfounded.

          INT. MOVING CAR Â»- DAY

          Will and Caesar drive. Caesar's dressed up - khaki pants and
          a Polo shirt.

                         WILL
          We're visiting a place called "The
          Ranch". They have animals.

                         CAESAR
          Real animals?

                         WILL
          You bet. Apes. Chimpanzees,
          gorillas, orangutans...
          Caesar GRUNTS, excited.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          It'll be good. You'll like it very
          much.
          Caesar looks at Will, picking up on something.

                         CAESAR
          Will sad?

                         WILL
          What? No, I'm fine.

          EXT. THE RANCH - DAY

          As Will pulls into the entrance, Caesar's glued to the
          window.

          INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

          They pull into a CLEARING. Ahead is a new world - CONCRETE
          AND STEEL BUILDINGS set incongruously into the bucolic
          countryside.
          A HOUSE/OFFICE, a LIVING QUARTERS, a HORSE PADDOCK - all
          cold, efficient structures.

          EXT. THE RANCH - DAY

          As they climb from the car, MR. LANDON, 50's, emerges from
          the office. DODGE, 20's, hangs back.

                         WILL
          You must be Mr. Landon.

                         (SHAKING HANDS)
          This is Caesar.

          MR. LANDON
          Nice to meet you, Caesar. This is
          Dodge, helps me run the place.

                         WILL
          I've been telling Caesar about the
          animals you have here. How much
          fun it is.

          MR. LANDON
          Yes, we have a big play center
          where the chimpanzees like to
          climb.

                         (TO CAESAR)
          Want to see the play center?
          Caesar nods. Absolutely.

          EXT. CAGED ATRIUM - DAY

          A HUGE CAGED STRUCTURE, the size of a gymnasium. Inside are
          climbing constructions, ropes, toys, and, in the middle, a
          LARGE TREE, reaching up through the top bars.
          A CAGED-IN BRIDGE leads to a row of DARK DENS. But for
          now... it's empty. No apes in sight.
          Caesar approaches with will and Mr. Landon.

          MR. LANDON
          What do you think, Caesar? Want to
          give it a try?
          Trying to mask his growing dread, Will removes Caesar's
          harness.

          He watches Caesar - unsuspecting - move through AN OPEN, GATE-

          LIKE SLIDING DOOR.

          EXT. ATRIUM - DAY

          Caesar scampers up the ledges and leaps to a bar. He swings
          from bar to bar, then hits the ground and runs for the tree.

          EXT. OUTSIDE CAGED ATRIUM - DAY

          Will can barely watch AS DODGE ROLLS THE SLIDING DOOR CLOSED,

          LOCKING IT.
          He braces himself.

          EXT. ATRIUM - DAY

          Caesar joyfully climbs the sprawling tree until he HITS THE
          TOP OF THE CAGE. Branches continue through spaces in the
          bars, but HE'S REACHED...

          A DEAD END.
          CAESAR TURNS, FINDS WILL'BELOW. What he reads in Will's eyes
          gives him a sudden, sharp sense of dread.

          HE LOOKS TO THE CAGE ENTRANCE, SEES THAT THE GATE IS LOCKED.

          HE'S LOCKED IN. TRAPPED.
          Caesar SHRIEKS, speeds down the tree.
          Other SHRIEKS join in. EXCITED APE NOISES - coming from
          UNSEEN, CAGED APES - fills the atrium.
          The STRANGE ANIMAL VOICES FUEL CAESAR'S PANIC. He runs to
          the gate, tries to shake it open.

                         WILL
          It's okay, Caesar. It's going to
          be okay...
          The words are for him as much as Caesar.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          You're going to live here for a
          while. This is what the Judge says
          we have to do.

          frantically signs, desperate, pleading.
          The SHRIEKS of the UNSEEN APES continue, feeding Will's
          apprehension. Caesar doesn't belong here. It takes every
          bit of restraint he has not to take Caesar out, to run...

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          They'll take good care of you here.

                         DODGE
          That's about it for visiting hours.
          Will shoots him a look of daggers.

          MR. LANDON
          What Dodge means is, in our
          experience, longer you drag out the
          leave-taking, harder it is. On
          both of you.
          Caesar WHIMPERS, tries to bend the bars apart. When this
          doesn't work, he tries prying them open with his teeth.

                         WILL
          I'm sorry to trick you this way,
          but you would never have agreed. I
          was afraid they'd hurt you if they
          forced you -

          MR. LANDON
          He'll be fine.
          Will gives Caesar a last, long look. The pain in his eyes is
          matched only by Caesar's.
          WE STAY WITH CAESAR as Will forces himself to walk away.
          Caesar's SHRIEKS build. The SURROUNDING APES chime in...a

          CACOPHONY OF PRIMAL ENERGY.

          CAESAR HURTLES HIS BODY AGAINST THE CAGE.

                         DODGE
          Caesar. Hey. I can get you out.
          Dodge stands at the end of the atrium, BECKONING.

          Caesar follows Dodge to the far end of the play area, then
          through the CAGED-IN BRIDGE. Will's almost out of sight.
          Caesar can see that he's nearly reached the car.
          He GRUNTS with stress as he follows the bridge into...

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY

          .the Chimpanzee House - and stops in his tracks.
          This is the source of the APE NOISE. It has an open, indoor
          area in the center, bordered by cages of CHIMPANZEES.
          Caesar's TAKEN ABACK BY THE LOUD, DARK FORMS POUNDING AROUND

          THEIR CAGES.

                         DODGE
          Caesar - over here.
          Dodge stands at a cage door. Caesar sprints for it, as for
          salvation-but AS SOON AS HE CROSSES THE THRESHOLD, HE

          REALIZES IT'S A DEAD END.
          He turns, but DODGE SHUTS THE DOOR IN HIS FACE AND LOCKS IT.

          CAESAR FINDS HIMSELF TRAPPED IN A 10' BY 10' CAGE.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Stupid monkey.

          FOR A MOMENT CAESAR'S IN SHOCK, HIS MIND UNABLE TO PROCESS

          THE BETRAYAL.
          Then he begins frantically grabbing at the bars, jumping to
          the ceiling, searching for a way out.
          To his left: the faces of THREE HUGE, AGITATED CHIMPANZEES
          pound the concrete floor, YELLING at him. To his right:

          THREE MORE CHIMPANZEES.
          Caesar lets out a PRIMAL, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM. WE FOLLOW

          INT. CAESAR'S CAGE -- LATER

          Time has passed. Long shadows of late afternoon.
          Caesar sits on a bed of twigs and straw in a corner of the
          cage, heavy head resting on his arms.
          He slowly becomes conscious of a RHYTHMIC SCRAPING NOISE,
          followed by a LOUD BANG. He looks up.
          In the cage next door, Caesar sees a strapping, MUSCULAR

          CHIMP, JET BLACK, WITH A LONG SCAR RUNNING DOWN HIS FOREHEAD

          ACROSS HIS NOSE, PAST HIS MOUTH AND CHIN.
          This is ROCKET.
          He shoves a PLASTIC 'PLAY REFRIGERATOR' across the cage
          floor... then SLAMS IT AGAINST THE WALL.
          He repeats this movement over and over - all the time with a
          challenging eye to Caesar.

          SCRAPE AGAINST CONCRETE... BAM! SCRAPE... BAM!
          A terrifying display of power and dominance.

          DODGE (O.S.)
          Okay, assholes. Dinner time.
          Rocket - slowly and deliberately, with a last threatening
          look to Caesar - moves off.
          Caesar crawls to the edge of his cage and peers out.
          Dodge and another animal wrangler, RODNEY, move from cage to
          cage, SHOVELING PRIMATE CHOW INTO TROUGHS. Rodney tosses in
          an occasional rotted vegetable.
          The APES enthusiastically receive the food. Dodge shovels
          food into Caesar's trough. Caesar stares down at the wet-
          looking dog food.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Mmmm mmm. Grade A primate chow.
          Bet you don't get none of that in
          the suburbs.
          Caesar reaches into the disgusting goop and THROWS A HANDFUL
          IN DODGE'S FACE. The apes SCREAM with LAUGHTER. Rodney
          looks away so Dodge doesn't see him laughing too.

          you, you hairy prick?
          Caesar stares at Dodge... then SHOOTS HIM THE FINGER.

                         RODNEY
          Look at that!
          Infuriated, Dodge grabs a hose, drags it to Caesar's cage.

                         DODGE
          One thing you can count on: Long as
          there are humans on this earth,
          you'll always be a monkey in a
          cage.
          The BURST from the HOSE sends Caesar flying backwards.
          Pinned into a corner, he curls himself into a ball, using his
          back as a shield.
          The water BLAST is relentless.
          Eventually, Dodge turns the water off. The two men take a
          long look at Caesar. He's left battered and soaked on the
          floor.

                         RODNEY
          What about his clothes? Might
          cause problems with the other apes.

          Leave 'em.

          EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

          Walter's frail hand runs along the cold rail of Caesar's

           The Aide stands nearby, sending a text message.

          Will looks terrible. He's unshaven, pale, drawn. He sits on

          WE FOLLOW Will as he strides purposefully into the cafeteria.
          He's shaved, pulled himself together.
          Will spots Jacobs,'lunching with his Blackberry, in a corner.
          He heads for him. Jacobs looks up, sees will coming.
          Will slides into the seat across from him.

          Too sick to return my calls? You
          know it was a funny thing, but I
          was watching the news and they
          started talking about a seven-year-
          old chimpanzee that went nuts - and
          all of a sudden, there you were on
          the TV. A seven year old chimp,
          raised since birth.
          The cafeteria gets a little awkward as Jacobs raises his
          voice. Neither man cares.

                         WILL
          He's the son of chimp 4. And he's
          smart. Off-the-charts smart.
          Because of the 112. The genetic
          therapy was passed in utero - from
          the mother to the son. Without a
          single negative side-effect.

          Early morning sun through the tiny window of Caesar's cage.
          He wakes shivering with cold. Notices that the other cages
          are empty - that his cage door is open.
          Tentatively, he makes his way into the common area.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - MORNING

          Caesar looks around. No chimps. The hose lies on the wet
          floor, along with the detritus of feeding time.
          He can HEAR the APES in the distance.
          Caesar tries the GATE/DOOR to the outside. LOCKED. He
          pauses, then makes his way toward the BRIDGE.

          EXT. ATRIUM/BRIDGE - MORNING

           Caesar walks across the bridge. To his left, (connecting to
          the bridge) he sees TWO MORE APE HOUSES CONNECTING TO THE

                         BRIDGE:
          THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE - which is empty.
          And THE GORILLA HOUSE, which houses only one lone gorilla,
          BUCK, who stares out at Caesar. Caesar registers THE FACT
          THAT BUCK'S NOT OUT WITH THE OTHER APES. Then he moves on
          toward the atrium.
          The APES are visible inside. CAESAR GETS HIS FIRST GOOD LOOK.
          Over two dozen CHIMPANZEES and three ORANGUTANS roam around
          the atrium. The groups don't mix - chimps hang with chimps,
          orangutans with orangutans.
          They haven't noticed him yet.

          EXT. ATRIUM - DAY

          Caesar enters, heads for the tree. One by one, the apes take
          notice. They STOP AND STARE at this new arrival - DRESSED

          LIKE A HUMAN.

          HE'S ONE OF THEM, BUT LOOKS VERY SUBTLY DIFFERENT. GREEN

          EYES, FACE CONTOURED WITH SLIGHTLY HUMAN FEATURES, POSTURE

          MORE UPRIGHT...
          Caesar looks around, finds THIRTY PAIRS OF APE EYES ON HIM.
          Should he continue to the tree? Go back to the cage?

          He spots a BALL across the way. Moves to it - the eyes
          follow him. He picks it up. The eyes wait.
           Caesar rolls the ball to a nearby chimp. It receives the
          ball, gives Caesar nothing - no smile, no connection - then
          tosses it to Rocket.
          Eyes on Caesar, Rocket discards the ball like a piece of
          trash. His look is insolent, an unmistakable challenge.

          AFRAID, CAESAR TURNS, HEADS BACK TOWARD HIS CAGE. ROCKET

          SWINGS OVER A COUPLE OF BARS AND LANDS IN FRONT OF HIM.
          Caesar tries to walk around. Rocket blocks his path, reaches
          out and pulls at Caesar's sleeve, as if to examine the
          material. Caesar jerks his arm away.
          Rocket bares his teeth, raises his arms.
          Caesar considers the options - should he run? Before he can
          make a move, Rocket GRUNTS, grabs his shirt at the chest.
          Caesar tries to push Rocket away, but the larger chimp throws
          Caesar to the ground, pinning him.
          Caesar struggles to get away, accidentally SLAPPING Rocket
          across the face.
          OUTRAGED, Rocket SLAMS his hand on Caesar's chest and starts
          POUNDING him. Caesar tries to block the blows, but they're
          coming hard and fast: his head, his stomach, his chest.
          Apes SHRIEK, jump up and down, egging Rocket on.
          Caesar manages to break loose, crawling away. Rocket grabs
          at his shirt, drags Caesar closer.
          He opens his mouth wide, moving sharp teeth toward Caesar's
          face. Caesar struggles, barely holds him off - and...

          .ROCKET BITES HIS ARM. BLOOD SPURTS.
          BAM! A SHOT RINGS OUT. Chimps scatter.
          Stunned, Rocket spins around - HIS MOUTH FULL OF CAESAR'S
          BLOOD - AND SEES DODGE OUTSIDE THE CAGE, RIFLE IN HAND. He
          pulls a TRANQUILIZING DART from his shoulder.
          Caesar starts to move off -

          BAM! DODGE SHOOTS A TRANQUILIZER DART INTO THE SIDE OF

          CAESAR'S NECK - HE GRABS AT THIS THROAT AND FALLS.

          Caesar lies on a medical table, NECK AND LEFT ARM BANDAGED.
          His shirt's ripped, and he's still wearing the khaki pants,
          now filthy and torn. TIGHT STRAPS RUN ACROSS HIS CHEST,

          PINNING HIM TO THE TABLE.
          It's a small room furnished with meagre medical equipment.
          Rocket's across the way, unconscious but breathing,
          restrained to a medical table.
          Caesar opens his eyes. Takes a moment to get his bearings.

          his mouth, and moves drunkenly to the storage shed.
          40 He emerges with two BEERS, throws one to Rodney.

          Want a beer?
          The chimp reaches but Dodge pulls it away.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Here's a little taste of beer...
          He unzips his fly and PISSES INTO THE CHIMP'S FEEDING TROUGH.
          Caesar watches, disgusted.

          INT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE -- MORNING


          A LEVER THROWN OPEN.
          Caesar watches as Dodge opens all the chimpanzee house cages
          in succession.
          Rodney moves to the orangutan house. CAESAR PAYS CLOSE

          ATTENTION TO THE LOCK AS IT SLIDES OPEN.

                         DODGE & RODNEY
          Move it! Let's go!
          Dodge and Rodney herd the apes from their cages, brandishing
          ELECTRIC CATTLE PRODS. The primates rouse themselves, move
          across the bridge.
          On his way out, an orangutan, MAURICE - WISE COUNTENANCE,
          ORANGE AND WHITE BEARD - takes a moment to check Caesar out,
          then moves off to join the others.
          Caesar maneuvers to get a better view.
          Rocket walks, king-like, among the apes. Caesar watches him
          push a smaller MALE aside. The Male defers, extending his
          arm forward, palm up, supplicating. ROCKET CASUALLY RUNS HIS

          HAND, PALM DOWN, OVER THE OUTSTRETCHED ONE.
          Rocket's the cock of the walk - the ALPHA MALE.
          Caesar shifts his attention to the GORILLA, Buck - still
          alone in his cage, staring through the bars, miserable.
          Why doesn't the gorilla ever get to go out?
          Then something across the ranch catches Caesar's eye: WILL'S

          CAR'S DRIVING UP TO THE OFFICE.

          contain his excitement.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY

          Will waits at a picnic table as Dodge approaches with Caesar
          on a leash. He's immediately struck by Caesar's injured
          appearance, but he plasters a smile on his face. Caesar's
          clearly thrilled to see him.

                         WILL
          There you are! I heard what
          happened.

                         CAESAR

                         (SIGNING)
          Home now. Caesar home.
          He tugs Will away from Dodge.

                         WILL
          I'm going to get you out of here,
          but not today. I'm working on it.
          Caesar's face falls.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          Soon. I promise.
          Will notices Dodge's ELECTRIC CATTLE PROD.

                         (SIGNING)

          Still a question, a flicker of hope.

                         WILL
          (kills him to say it)
          Not yet. I can't yet.
          Caesar realizes: Will's going to leave him here.
          First incredulous - then outraged - Caesar turns away and
           starts walking back to his cage.

                          WILL (CONT'D)
          Wait a second - Caesar, where are
          you going?
          â¢ Caesar doesn't respond, doesn't turn, just keeps walking.
          Dodge catches up with him.

                         WILL
          Caesar - come back here!
          He watches Caesar's retreating back, Dodge trotting alongside
          him. Realizes Caesar's nearly breaking into a run.

          EXT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - DAY

          Dodge locks Caesar in his cell. Then moves around to the...

          EXT. STORAGE SHED - DAY

           .storage shed. He notices Will's car still parked in front
          of the office... just as -
          BAM! WILL DECKS HIM WITH A FIST TO THE FACE. Dodge hits the
          ground. Will stands over him, too livid to realize he
          might've just broken his hand.

                         WILL
          You son of a bitch.
          Dodge scrabbles to his feet, wipes the blood from his nose.

                         DODGE
          That was not a smart thing to do.
          Dodge is clearly much tougher, stronger than Will, but Will's
          too angry to care.

                         WILL
          If I find out Caesar's been hurt,
          if he's mistreated in any way, I
          swear I'll have you brought up on
          charges.
          Dodge looks towards Landon's house, restrains himself.

                         DODGE
          That wild-eyed chimp isn't yours
          any more. He's mine now.
          The truth of the statement is worse than any punch.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          And you're on private property.

          EXT. STORAGE SHED - LATER

          A bag of CHIPS AHOY COOKIES. Caesar - looking morose -
          watches as Rodney pops a cookie in his mouth and stuffs the
          bag into the shed...

          STEWART (O.S.)
          Morning Caesar.

          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - DAY

          The door slides open. Stewart enters, followed by Dodge.

                         STEWART
          How's your arm? Mind if I take a
          look?
          Stewart rummages in her MEDICAL BAG. CAESAR WATCHES AS SHE
          PULLS OUT A PAIR OF SCISSORS, cuts off his bandages.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          Looking good...
          Caesar makes eye contact with Dodge over Stewart's shoulder.
          She pulls a harness from her bag.

                         STEWART (CONT'D)
          I'm taking him out. Thought I'd
          cheer him up, show him the horses.

                         DODGE
          No way.
          As she walks to Dodge, CAESAR GLANCES INTO HER MEDICAL BAG.

                         STEWART
          What are you going to do? Use a
          cattle prod on me?

          If you're into that kind of thing.

                         STEWART
          I'm safer with him than I am with

          I can't take you.

          Maybe another time.

          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - NIGHT

          RAIN. The apes sleep. Except for Caesar.
          Standing in the corner of his cage, Caesar pulls STEWART'S
          SCISSORS and a roll of MEDICAL TAPE out from the STRAW.
          He kneels at his bedding, gathering sticks and straw. Then
          he begins weaving the tape through several sticks, binding
          them and extending them end to end.
          Caesar pauses, sensing something. He looks over his
          shoulder, discovers MAURICE THE ORANGUTAN watching him.
          They hold each others' gaze, Caesar taking his measure. Then
          Caesar puts a finger to his lips. "Shhhh."
          Maurice makes no movement, but the agreement is clear.
          Caesar returns to crafting the tool.

          Will enters - WE SEE THAT HIS HAND HIS BANDAGED.
          The apes watch as he walks along the cages, eyes searching
          the dark chimpanzee faces.

          EACH LAB CHIMP HAS A DIFFERENT COLORED IDENTIFICATION WRIST

          BAND.

          Chimpanzees stare back at him, giving him nothing.
          NOISE FROM BEHIND. Will turns. Down the row, A CHIMPANZEE

          ARM EXTENDS FROM A CAGE, PALM UP - WITH A RED BAND.
          Will walks to the cage, chimp #11, reads the label beside it.

          STREAKS DOWN EACH CHEEK. A SINISTER FACE.
          He DROPS AN M&M INTO KOBA'S PALM. Eyes on Will, Koba secrets
          it to a "storage spot" inside the cage.
          Then he puts out his hand again.

          Koba doesn't resist as Will straps him to the table.
          He watches as a HANDLER -- EVANS - moves into the next room,
          opens a refrigerator with a strange BIOHAZARD SYMBOL and
          pulls out CANISTER labeled ADENOVIRUS 113.
           Evans and Will each slip on HAZMAT masks, making sure they're
          secure. Then Evans hands the 113 to Will.
           All of this avidly taken in by Koba's dark eyes.
          Will inserts the adenovirus 113 nozzle into a plastic oxygen
          mask.
          Koba's eyes are on him as he brings the mask toward the
          chimp's face.

          Will tilts the nozzle, releasing a BLAST OF AEROSOL MIST INTO

          KOBA'S NOSE AND MOUTH.

          THE CHIMPANZEE CONVULSES ON THE TABLE.

          INT. STEWART'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

          CHOP STICKS digging into take-out Chinese. Stewart and Will
          sit in her kitchen, eating. It's clear from their state of
          dress (or undress) that they've been intimate.
          Because his hand is still bandaged, he's having a hard time
          with the chopsticks.

          chopsticks.

                         WILL
          I'm going to get him out of there.

          INT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - NIGHT

          Caesar tapes sticks together. WE SEE that he's created a
          THREE-FOOT LONG "ARM". He tapes the scissors firmly to its
          end, finger holes sticking out. Finished.
          Silently he moves to the edge of the cage. USING THE

          CONTRAPTION, HE LOOPS THE FINGER HOLES OVER THE LATCH.
          He tries once. Misses. Twice. Misses again. Caesar keeps
          trying... until finally the loop's in place.
          Then he begins to tug. Tug. Tug. CLICK - the LATCH OPENS.
          He glances over to Maurice, who silently watches.
          Caesar pushes open the cage door. MAURICE'S EYES FOLLOW HIM

          INTO THE NIGHT.

          unlocks the door latch and opens the cage door.
          He waits, but Buck doesn't budge. He's still fast asleep.
          Caesar hesitates. Then he slowly...

          INT. BUCK'S CAGE - NIGHT

          .enters the cage, edging up to the sleeping gorilla.
          From this vantage point, Buck looks enormous, his vast chest
          rising and falling with sleep. Caesar very carefully wiggles
          his toe.
          There's a GRUNT and a WHIRL OF BLACK FURRY MOVEMENT. Caesar
          finds himself staring into the huge, angry gorilla face.
          Caesar - nervous - beckons toward the open door.
           Buck understands but can't believe it. For a moment he
           doesn't move. Caesar makes the gesture again -- "Come on,
          let's go."
           Before he can finish, Buck bursts past him...

          .across the bridge...

          EXT. ATRIUM - NIGHT

          .and into the atrium. Caesar follows.
          The full moon shines down on Buck, the tree, the climbing
          structure.
          The gorilla feels his feet on the grass, savoring every step.
          Then he begins to run. He runs as fast as he can, all the
          way across the atrium, then all the way back.
          Back and forth, GORILLA WIND SPRINTS of freedom.
          Caesar stands back, silently watching.

          The CAGE DOOR'S CLOSED, BUCK INSIDE. Dodge shovels primate
          chow into the gorilla's trough.

          BUCK TAKES A HANDFUL AND LOOKS ACROSS TO CAESAR, WHO RETURNS

          HIS GAZE FROM THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE.

          common area - toward the door -
          Where WHAM! CAESAR WHACKS HIM IN THE HEAD WITH ROCKET'S

          PLASTIC REFRIGERATOR.

          ROCKET STAGGERS, TRYING TO RECOVER, AND LANDS ON HIS BUTT.

          HE LOOKS UP TO SEE CAESAR... AND BEHIND HIM, STANDING LIKE A

          MOUNTAIN: BUCK.
          Buck raises his arms and SLAMS them down with a MIGHTY ROAR;
          Caesar slings the plastic refrigerator aside, sending it
          SKITTERING across the CONCRETE.
          The chimpanzees, awake now, watch to see what will happen.
          Rocket looks from Buck to Caesar. He's beaten.

          STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND, PALM UP, ROCKET MAKES THE

          A COLLECTIVE GASP OF AWE moves through the ho-use.
          Rocket crawls back to his cage, defeated. Caesar - walking
          at full height - follows. He CLOSES ROCKET'S CAGE DOOR AND

          LOCKS HIM IN.
          Then Caesar walks upright around the cages once more, making
          eye contact with each and every chimpanzee. He exits with
          his Lieutenant, Buck, in tow.

          Chimp after chimp convulses on the table.

          easily among the apes, his Alpha Male status clear as the

          Rocket sleeps. The FEEDER BIN OPENS AND SHUTS, waking him.
          Tentatively, Rocket peers inside the bin: A COOKIE. Never
          seen a cookie before. Rocket picks it up. Smells it. Takes
          a taste. Wow. He gobbles it down.
          At that moment Rocket's CAGE DOOR OPENS.
          Caesar stands holding a LARGE BAG OF CHIPS AHOY. He tosses a
          cookie to Rocket. Beckons him out of the cage.

          Rocket exits warily, on his guard for anything...

          He hands the cookie bag to Rocket.
          Rocket watches - confused - as CAESAR PULLS THE MAIN LEVER,

          OPENING ALL THE CAGES AT ONCE.
          CHIMPS EMERGE, bewildered.
          Rocket stands with the cookie bag, unsure what to do. Caesar
          makes a motion with his hand.
          Now Rocket understands. He gives a cookie to the nearest
          chimp. Then another one. Then another.
          The chimps go crazy for the cookies. THEY GATHER AROUND

          ROCKET, WHO PROUDLY DISTRIBUTES THEM. A TRANSFORMATIVE

          MOMENT - ROCKET'S FOUND HIS FOOTING.
          Now Caesar opens the orangutan and gorilla cages. A moment
          of discomfort as Caesar leads the other apes in.
          Caesar pulls an orangutan over to Rocket. Rocket hands the
          orangutan a cookie. The other orangutans and Buck
          immediately line up. Discomfort's gone - now it's one big
          â¢ party.

          know if you need anything.

          REVEAL EVANS, LYING IN BED, DEAD - a streak of brown dried
          blood across his cheek -- as if draining from his lifeless
          eye.

          EXT. RANCH - NIGHT

          Deep night at the ranch. A moon half-hidden by clouds.

          INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - NIGHT

          Caesar uses his contraption to get out of the cage. Maurice
          grabs his arm.

                         MAURICE
          Where go?

                         CAESAR
          Find Mother.

          EXT. RANCH/PRIMATE HOUSES - NIGHT

          Caesar slips out of the orangutan house, heads toward the

          GATE.
          As he passes the chimpanzee house HE HEARS A CHIMPANZEE CALL
          OUT. He turns. Finds Rocket staring out at him, wanting to
          go with him.
          Caesar hesitates. Rocket CALLS OUT LOUDER.
          To quiet him, Caesar walks over to Rocket's cage, but as he
          gets closer, he sees something that gives him pause: ROCKET'S

          EYES HAVE CHANGED.
          Caesar gets right up against the bars of Rocket's cage, takes
          Rocket's face in his hands and looks into his eyes: THEY ARE

          UNMISTAKABLY GREEN.
          Reeling, Caesar tries to make sense of this. And then he
          remembers the bite. Rocket bit him. He looks down at the
          wound on his arm, now nearly healed.
          Has Caesar's blood changed Rocket?
          Caesar opens Rocket's'cage. The chimp emerges, ready for
          anything.

          EXT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Caesar and Rocket barrel across the ranch, past the living
          â¢ quarters, past the barn, onto the winding road leading away.

          EXT. NEAR-DESERTED TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          Middle of the night, only a few cars.
          Caesar and Rocket stick to bushes and shadows. They wait for
          a break in traffic, cross the highway.

          EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - NIGHT

          In the distance the LIGHTS of the TOWN give a glow to the
          night sky. Caesar and Rocket gallop toward it.

          EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

          Dark, quiet. RUSTLING IN THE TREES, as if a storm is coming.

          SUDDENLY CAESAR BURSTS THROUGH, SWINGING FOR THE NEXT TREE
          A moment later ROCKET FOLLOWS.
          Swinging from tree to tree, they make their way down the
          suburban street.

          INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT


          CLOSE ON WILL'S SLEEPING FACE.

          CREAK, CREAK... CREAK, CREAK.
          WILL'S WAKENED by the NOISE. What is that?

          CREAK, CREAK. . .CREAK, CREAK.
          It's coming from outside.
          REVEAL STEWART asleep next to Will. He gets out of bed,
          moves to the window, looks into the back yard.

          THE SWING MOVES BACK AND FORTH, AS IF RECENTLY OCCUPIED.
          Will scans the grounds - no movement, nothing to see.
          Satisfied, he climbs back in bed and closes his eyes.

          THAT'S WHEN A SHADOW PASSES OVER THE BED.
          It's CAESAR'S SILHOUETTE, noiselessly emerging from the
          darkness.
          He stands there, looking down at Will and Stewart.
          His face is impossible to read.

          INT. WILL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Rocket's fascinated by photos of Caesar with Will and Walter
          along the mantle.
          Caesar emerges from Will's room and makes his way down the
          hallway.

          INT. WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Stripped bed, a couple of packed boxes. Caesar stands at the
          doorway, taking it in.

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Feet pounding the pavement, Caesar and Rocket head away from
          Will's house.

          EXT. OUTSIDE LAB - NIGHT

          GEN-SYS RESEARCH SIGN. The grounds are deserted. A SECURITY
          GUARD listens to RADIO in the guard kiosk.
          Caesar and Rocket - eyes on the Security Guard - stop at a
          spot hidden by a tree and scale the fence.

          EXT. LAB GROUNDS - NIGHT

          Caesar and Rocket drop down to the grass. They SNIFF THE
          AIR, head toward the Primate House.

          INT. SECURITY KIOSK - NIGHT

          The Security Guard yawns, checks his watch. Over his
          shoulder, on a monitor, WE SEE the dark forms of two
          chimpanzees run across the grounds.

          EXT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Caesar and Rocket arrive at the Primate House. Caesar tries
          the big double door - locked. He looks upward, spies a ROW
          OF AWNING WINDOWS near the roof.
          Rocket pushes a dumpster close to the building wall.
          Then Caesar jumps on the dumpster and catapults himself to
          the window's ledge. Hanging by one arm, he swings himself in
          through the window.
          Rocket follows.

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE/OFFICE NIGHT

          Franklin's got the graveyard shift. He's watching a movie on
          the office computer - doesn't hear anything.

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Eerie, darkly lit. SLEEPING CHIMPS stir. CAESAR and ROCKET
          drop to the cement floor.
          Now they have a clear view of the cramped cages, DARKENED
          FIGURES INSIDE. Caesar walks alongside them, peering into
          each one, studying the shadowy, simian faces.

          A HAIRY ARM EXTENDS THROUGH THE BARS, PALM UP - IT HAS A RED

          BAND AROUND ITS WRIST.

          IT'S OFFERING AN M&M.
          Caesar approaches the cage... FINDS HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH

          KOBA.

          HIS EYES ARE BEADY, A STEELY GREY.

          THE TWO CHIMPANZEES SIZE EACH OTHER UP. EACH SENSES

          SOMETHING IN THE OTHER, BUT NEITHER KNOWS WHAT IT IS.
          Caesar moves on. HE'S INTENT, LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.
          Rocket barrels forward, grabs the M&M from Koba's hand.
          Koba offers up ANOTHER M&M. But ROCKET'S EYES ARE ON THE RED

          IDENTIFICATION BAND - THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS.

          KOBA CAN SEE THIS. HE OFFERS IT UP - IN RETURN FOR OPENING

          HIS CAGE.

          ROCKET CONSIDERS A MOMENT, THEN MOVES TO THE LATCH.
          ANGLE ON Caesar.
          He's nearly reached the last of the cages, and the

          DISAPPOINTMENT IS PLAIN ON HIS FACE.
          These chimpanzees are distant, strange. No familiar face.

          NO CONNECTION.
          Caesar reaches the last cage, where A YOUNG CHIMP, sick,
          stares back at him.
          Caesar turns away, crestfallen.

          He YELLS for ROCKET, and the two of them take off. The LAB
          CHIMPS start to SCREAM.

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE/OFFICE - NIGHT

           HEARING THE COMMOTION, Franklin puts down his book, heads...

          INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

          .into the Primate House. Where he stops in his tracks.

          KOBA STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM, UPRIGHT.
          They stare at each other.
          Then Koba LEAPS FOR HIM.

          EXT. LAB GROUNDS/GUARD KIOSK - NIGHT

          Caesar and Rocket head for the fence. A GUARD approaches on
          his nightly rounds.
          They look at each other, lay low.
          To protect Caesar, Rocket takes off running. The SHOCKED

          SECURITY GUARD SEES HIM, GIVES CHASE, FUMBLES FOR HIS WALKIE-

          TALKIE.
          But Rocket's too fast - in a moment he's out of sight.

          EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE LAB - NIGHT

          Caesar's waiting when Rocket runs up. They take off
          together.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - NIGHT

          Caesar and Rocket enter. That's when WE NOTICE: CAESAR'S

          KHAKI PANTS ARE GONE - HE'S NO LONGER DRESSED LIKE A HUMAN.
          Caesar opens Rocket's cage. As soon as the door closes
          behind him, the huge chimp collapses, exhausted.
          Caesar walks around the chimpanzee house, images of the night
          swirling through his head. Around him, the chimps sleep,
          oblivious.
          Except for CORNELIA - she's wide awake. Staring at him.

           INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

           The apes have calmed down. Koba slips back into his cage and
          â¢ closes the door.

          EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - EARLY MORNING

          Dawn of a new day.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/CORNELIA'S CAGE - EARLY MORNING

          Sunlight reaches through the bars and streaks across Caesar's
          face. He opens his eyes. Looks at Cornelia, still asleep.
          Caesar creeps toward the open entrance to her cage.

          INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - EARLY MORNING

          Caesar emerges into the common area. The chimps are still
          asleep.
          There's a CLANKING as the OUTSIDE GATE OPENS.
          Caesar freezes.
          Dodge enters with the wheelbarrow of Primate Chow and the
          shovel. Locks the door behind him.
          He hasn't seen Caesar yet.

                         DODGE
          Rise and shine, assholes.
          The chimps wake. One by one they notice Caesar, standing in
          the common area.

          THEN DODGE SEES HIM.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          What the hell -
          (seeing Cornelia's open

                         CAGE)
          You sly son of a bitch. How'd you
          do that?
          Dodge is careful, slow, as he picks up the shovel and holds
          it in front of him.
          He circles around the common area toward Cornelia's cage.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          We're gonna go slow here, alright?
          You're gonna go back in your cage,
          you're not going to give me no
          trouble.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.
          The apes - chimps, orangutans, the gorilla - are silent,
           riveted, waiting to see what will happen.
          Cornelia stands, watching.
          Caesar doesn't take his eyes off Dodge, but his expression is
          unreadable.
          Dodge reaches Cornelia's cage. He VIOLENTLY BANGS THE SHOVEL

          AGAINST THE BARS.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Back!
          Caesar reacts, a snarl curling his lips.
          Keeping his eyes on Caesar, sweat dripping down his temples,
          Dodge KICKS CORNELIA'S CAGE SHUT.
          Now he starts moving forward, trying to back Caesar toward
          the orangutan cage.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          We're going to have you fixed,
          Einstein, that's for damn sure...
          But first we're going to figure out
          how you pulled this off...

          CAESAR INCHES BACK, KEENLY AWARE OF EVERY APE'S EYE ON HIM.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Go on. Get in that cage.
          Caesar stops, refusing to go any farther.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          I said get!
          But Caesar doesn't move.
          Dodge pokes the shovel at him, then SLAMS it to the cement
          floor.
          He edges closer to Caesar, grip tightening around the shovel
          handle. Then he rears it back, face contorted in rage.

                         DODGE (CONT'D)
          Get in that cage, you damn dirty
          ape!

          â¢ CAESAR'S EYES NARROW. HE STANDS TALL, STRETCHING TO HIS FULL

          HEIGHT.

          THEN HE STARES DODGE FULL IN THE EYES, DIGS DEEP, AND WITH

          TREMENDOUS EFFORT... SPEAKS.

                         CAESAR
          (with his voice)
          No!

          STUNNED SILENCE.

          THE WORLD STOPS SPINNING.
          Dodge is thunderstruck - nearly loses his balance.
          Caesar has spoken. Actually uttered a word.
          Maurice, Rocket, Buck, and all the apes stare, dumbfounded,
          trying to comprehend what has just happened.
          And then... they go nuts.

           SCREAMING. YELLING. JUMPING UP AND DOWN.
           That's when Caesar attacks.
           He rushes Dodge, wrestling the shovel from his hands.
           Dodge spins around to defend himself - and CAESAR HITS HIM IN

           THE SIDE OF THE HEAD.
          Dodge staggers back.
          Caesar SLAMS the shovel in his stomach.
          Dodge crumples forward.

          CAESAR SWINGS THE SHOVEL UP, SMACKING HIM IN THE FOREHEAD.
          Lights out.
          Caesar drags Dodge to Rocket's cage and opens the door.
          Rocket helps pull him inside.

          THEN CAESAR OPENS ALL THE DOORS TO ALL THE CAGES - AND THE

          APES COME STREAMING OUT.
          They gather around Caesar, who holds up STEWART'S SCISSORS

          AND SLICES OPEN HIS OWN PALM.
          Then he walks to Rocket, who gets down on his knees and puts
          out his hand in the supplicating gesture. CAESAR TAKES THE

          SCISSORS AND SLICES ROCKET'S PALM, THEN PRESSES THEIR TWO

          HANDS TOGETHER.

          He moves to Maurice, who offers up his hand. Caesar slices
          the palm and places his hand against it.
          Then he turns to Buck - who stands up tall, beats his chest
          and YELLS... BUT THEN OFFERS UP HIS HAND.
          And now Caesar looks around, as EVERY APE LINES UP, THEIR

          OPEN PALMS WAITING.

          INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - DAWN

          Will wakes, climbs out of bed, careful not to wake Stewart.

          INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

          He moves down the hallway, approaching Walter's room. He
          pauses, puzzled, at the door - which is AJAR.
          Strange.

          THE PHONE STARTS TO RING.
          Will ignores it -- slowly pushes the door open... AND SEES

          CAESAR'S TATTERED PANTS LAID ACROSS THE STRIPPED BED.
          He stands there, stunned.

          JACOBS (O.S.)

          INTERCUT WITH JACOBS AT THE LAB.

                         JACOBS
          The animal handler - Franklin - was
          killed last night. In the primate
          house.

                         JACOBS
          Something very powerful broke his
          neck. Snapped it in two.

          the kicker: One of our security
          guards swears he chased a
          chimpanzee off the grounds last
          night.
          Will - with growing dread - looks out the window at Caesar's
          swing.

          dialing her cell phone.

          Mr. Landon answers the RINGING PHONE. He's in his pajamas.

          ape houses. Can't see anything wrong.

          He HEARS THE BACK KITCHEN DOOR OPEN. RUSTLING NOISES in the

          The two CHIMPANZEES drag Mr. Landon toward the Ape Houses.
          Rocket follows, munching cereal from a box of Cheerios.

          visible.
          Will thinks a moment, gets out of the car.

          trembling.

          It's going to take them at least
          half an hour to get here.
          He begins rummaging in drawers, in cabinets. There's an
          empty cookie bag, but Will's able to put his hands on a
          couple of stray COOKIES.
          He has an idea.
          Under the sink he finds what he's looking for: RAT POISON.

          A BLACK SHADOW passes by the window. Then another. Stewart
          turns. Now there's another.
          They're surrounded. She SCREAMS.
          Will barricades the back door with a table.
          Chimpanzees at every window BANGING ON THE GLASS, wanting in.

          We have a situation at Gen-Sys
          Laboratory! Approximately two
          dozen apes, gorillas, I don't know
          what the hell they are -

          Jacobs, a Security Guard and the two Officers are huddled

          from the safety of the parking lot. They suddenly realize
          that everything has GONE SILENT.
          A moment later, LAB DOORS FLY OPEN.

          They duck as the apes run by - some of them right up and over
          the car they're crouched behind.
           BAM! BAM! BAM! as the chimp's hit and leapfrog over the squad
          car - and their heads.
          The apes stampede across the parking lot, where several use
          Jacobs' BLACK JAGUAR to VAULT OVER THE FENCE.
          The last is BUCK, whose weight CRUSHES the car.
          And then they're gone. Every last one of them.
          Quiet now, except for CAR ALARMS.

          INT. LAB - DAY

          Jacobs enters the lab. In front of him is utter silence and
          devastation. Like the morning after a huge, destructive
          party.
          Out of the quiet there's the PADDING SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS ON

          BROKEN GLASS.
          Jacobs freezes.
          KOBA APPEARS from around a doorway. He and Jacobs look at

          Jacobs takes a stumbling step backwards, KICKING SOMETHING

          A hillside park overlooking San Francisco bay. THICK FOG

          KIDS EVERYWHERE - slides, seesaws, climbing structures.
          A LITTLE GIRL plays in a sandbox. Her MOTHER reads on a

          WAY DOWN THE SLOPE.
          suddenly the Little Girl's not so sure.

          Suddenly Caesar doubles back from the lead. He scoops her up
          and puts her down out of harm's way.
          Then he continues herding the apes forward. He knows where
          he's going.
          SIRENS APPROACH. Squad cars give chase.

          Enclosure. The ZOO APES are agitated and anxious - they know
          something's coming.
          Suddenly the phone is ripped from wall. The Wrangler cowers,
          turns to see Caesar and his apes.
          Rocket rattles the door, bares his teeth.

          Caesar BARKS a command at BUCK - who waits by the last car
          with a PACK OF GORILLAS and some chimps.
          Then Caesar starts to climb. Shimmying up a cable and into
          the fog. Rocket's right behind.
          The remaining apes follow.

          INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

          From the sky Will sees Caesar divide up his army.
          Chimps ascend cables, disappearing in and out of patches of
          fog.
          Orangutans and apes descend below the bridge deck.
          And Buck with his gorilla, take refuge in the stalled
          traffic.

          BELOW THE BRIDGE
          Maurice finds bars and support beams. He and the below-deck
          apes begin swinging their way toward the.north end.

                         ABOVE BRIDGE
          Apes shimmying up cables appear out of the fog, arriving at
          the MAIN CABLE - the thick one running along the top.
          They start scampering and swinging north, the FOG MOVING AND

          SWIRLING, CHANGING SHAPE AROUND THEM.
          A SHARPSHOOTER from a helicopter takes a SHOT.
          A CHIMP FALLS TO HIS DEATH. It's a long fall, until - SPLASH
          the chimp hits the water.
          They keep moving.

          ON THE BRIDGE
          The FOUR PATROL CARS stop, creating a barricade. The
          Sharpshooters line up their rifles, ready to shoot.

          DODGE SEARCHES A SQUAD CAR, FINDS A RIFLE, AND LOCKS AND

          LOADS.
          They FIRE at the apes above them, but it's tough going - the
          apes are in constant motion, and the fog obscures them.
          BULLETS can be heard RICOCHETING off cables.
          Another chimp falls to its death.
          Then a heavy patch of fog rolls in, engulfing the middle part
          of the bridge, surrounding the barricade. Visibility's
          practically zero.

          NOW THE MEN AT THE BARRICADE CAN HEAR THE APES MOVE PAST THEM

          IN THE FOG.

                         OFFICER
          They're all around us!
          Apes swing above them, scamper by them. Movement - WHOOSH -

          WHOOSH...
          DODGE - nervous - crouches low. He edges backwards, hopeful
          of some visibility.
          That's when he SEES CAESAR, CLEAR AND OUT OF THE FOG,

          CLIMBING UP THE ASCENDING CABLES OF THE NORTH SIDE.

          WITH RELISH, DODGE READIES HIS RIFLE, AIMS AT CAESAR'S BACK.
          There's glare from a ray of sunlight that's broken through
          the fog.
          He SHOOTS, BARELY MISSING. The bullet RICOCHETS off the main
          cable.
          ROCKET, climbing behind Caesar, looks down - SEES DODGE
          AIMING AGAIN. He starts swinging towards Caesar.
          Another shot from Dodge. This time the BULLET GRAZES

          CAESAR'S SHOULDER, AND CAESAR STUMBLES, STARTS TO FALL.

          ROCKET REACHES HIM IN TIME - SNATCHES HIS ARM, HOLDING CAESAR

          UP.
          Then, using all his strength, ROCKET PULLS CAESAR BACK UP TO

          THE MAIN CABLE.

          He and Caesar make eye contact as ROCKET FALLS OFF THE

          BRIDGE, TUMBLING TO HIS DEATH.
          Caesar SCREAMS, looks down at Dodge, who aims again.
          But Dodge is diverted by a RUMBLING - like an EARTHQUAKE ON

          THE BRIDGE.
          The GORILLAS ARE IN MOTION. LEAD BY BUCK, THEY CHARGE TOWARD

          THE BARRICADE.
          Like a freight train of menacing power.
          Helicopters FIRE, MEN at the barricade SHOOT as they try to
          back up.
          A gorilla falls... but they keep on coming.
          And now, climbing up from below - behind the barricade --
          MAURICE AND THE ORANGUTANS join in.
          Their sheer numbers and power are unstoppable.

          BELOW THE BRIDGE
          Koba hangs back. He's away from the action, but the battle
          waged above is audible.
          He creeps along toward the North end of the bridge.

                         AERIAL VIEW
          As the fog lifts for a moment, WE SEE APES SWINGING ON

          CABLES, APES RAMPAGING DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE BRIDGE, AND

          APES SCAMPERING BELOW.
          Vanquishing the humans.

          ON THE BRIDGE

          THE GORILLAS RUN UP, OVER THE BARRICADE, CRUSHING GUNS AND

          Will, Stewart and Huffs watch, dumbstruck, as DODGE'S BODY

          HITS THE WATER.
          Below, the victorious ape army finishes off the battle of the
          bridge and follows Caesar through the north exit...
          .disappearing into the dense park.

          EXT. MUIR WOODS PARK/PARKING LOT - DUSK

          POLICE REINFORCEMENTS and EMERGENCY VEHICLES arrive.
          HELICOPTERS above.
          Will's helicopter has set down. He and Stewart stand near an
          ASSEMBLING ARMY -- an amalgamation of 'human special forces.'
          Huffs and a small GROUP OF OFFICERS debate nearby.

                         OFFICER #1
          We can't gas the forest! The
          slightest wind would take it over
          to Tiburon.

          Not to mention rounding them all

          Will and Stewart stand at the edge of the woods. They're at
          the path Caesar and Will used to take.
          She's terrified, trying to mask it.

          turns to look at her.

          the woods.

          EXT. DEEP WOODS - DUSK

           Will walks. FLASH OF BLACK up ahead. His pulse quickens -
          he follows it.
          CRACKLING of BRANCHES.
          More BLACK, swinging through the trees. Is it Caesar?
          Will follows.

          EXT. PARK/CLEARING - DUSK

          Will enters the clearing.
          He knows this place. Up ahead is the GROVE OF TREES with the
          CANOPY that Caesar always loved.

          EXT. MUIR WOODS/PARKING LOT - DUSK

          Huffs stands looking at his watch. He looks up, turns to an

                         WILL
          Caesar! ...
          He keeps walking, almost there. A DARK FIGURE DROPS DOWN IN

          FRONT OF HIM.

          IT'S KOBA.
          Will takes a step back, fear crawling up the back of his
          neck.

                         WILL (CONT'D)
          You.
          Koba stands up tall. Eyes Will.
          He takes his time - like he's enjoying every second of
          this... He walks towards will, bares his teeth.
          Suddenly CAESAR APPEARS, SLAMMING INTO KOBA, knocking him
          away.

          ENRAGED, KOBA STARTS TO CHALLENGE CAESAR... BUT CAESAR JUST

          STARES HIM DOWN.

          KOBA - THE COWARD - SLINKS OFF, DISAPPEARING INTO THE WOODS.
          Which leaves just Will and Caesar.

          No. I'm staying with you.
          Caesar pushes him. Will staggers backwards, falls down.
          At that moment, HUFFS and his ARMY step into the clearing.
          Huffs takes aim at Caesar.

          Huffs and his men are taken by surprise. SHOTS are fired,
          but not fast enough.

          Caesar lays Will out on the forest floor. There's a lot of
          blood.
          Will tries to speak. He looks up at Caesar.
          Caesar takes him in his arms, cradles him with love.
          Will looks into Caesar's green eyes. He relaxes. Lets go.
          Then the life passes out of him.

          Stewart sits in the back of a locked Police Car, looking out

          CLOSE ON WHEELS TURNING. Hunsiker pulls his suitcase on
          wheels through the airport terminal.
          It's teeming with TRAVELERS. Holding on to the bannister,

          As the ape search continues, a
          virulent flu strain has exploded in
          and around San Francisco, sending
          shock waves and panic throughout
          the community.

          EXT. CLEARING - DAY

          We move along the ground of a clearing toward a lush canopy
          of trees. As we get closer, we notice flashes of movement.

                         NEWSCASTER VOICE #2
          Authorities suspect the origin of
          the deadly virus might be Gen-Sys
          Laboratories - the same private
          company from which several
          laboratory chimpanzees escaped
          earlier this week -
          We're still fifty yards away from the trees, but we can see
          it's filled with apes - chimpanzees, orangutans, gorillas.
          We keep pushing in, closer and closer to the trees. As we
          move past the leaves WE FIND BUCK. MAURICE. AND, SITTING

          APART FROM THE OTHERS... KOBA.
          All of them have eyes in varying shades of GREEN.
