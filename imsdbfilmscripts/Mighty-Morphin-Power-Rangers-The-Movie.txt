  BLACK SCREEN

  Words SCRAWL UP ON SCREEN and we hear a RESOUNDING VOICE.

                              VOICE
               In a time of great strife, a
               legendary interdimensional being
               known as Zordon, came to the city
               of Angel Grove to establish a
               vanguard in the never ending
               struggle against evil.  with the
               aid of his trusted assistant,
               Alpha 5, the noble master sought
               out six extraordinary teenagers
               and gave them the power to
               transform into an unstoppable
               fighting force.  In time of great
               need, the young heroes could now
               call upon colossal assault
               vehicles known as "Zords".  while
               the identity of the six remained
               a guarded secret, their
               courageous exploits soon became
               the stuff of Legend, earning them
               the title...  The Mighty Morphin
               Power Rangers.

We hear PUMPING ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC as the POWER RANGER'S LOGO
BURST'S ONTO THE SCREEN.  Now the logo EXPLODES, revealing


1   EXT.  PROP PLANE / FLYING - DAY                             1

A prop plane whisking across the deep blue sky.

                              ROCKY
               YeeeoowwWWWWW!!!


2   INT.  PROP PLANE / FLYING - DAY                             2

The six Power Rangers, TOMMY, KIMBERLY, BILLY, AISHA, ADAM and
ROCKY sport sleek sky diving suits, parachute packs and 
helmets.  Tommy is strapped into a high-tech airboard.

                              ROCKY
               We're OUTTA here!!

                              KIMBERLY
               Easy, Rock.        

                              TOMMY
               Once we hit the target zone we've
               got fifteen seconds to make the
               drop.

                              BULK  (0 . S .)
               Step aside, pinheads.

BULK and SKULL push their way through the Rangers, decked
in bizarre skydiving regalia, topped off by World War II
leather caps and aviator goggles.
     
                              BULK
               The Stealth Eagle is about to
               fly.

                              SKULL
               Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.

The Rangers exchange amused looks.  Aisha gestures to them

                              AISHA
               Lead on, flyboys.

Bulk and Skull swagger to the door and open it - the ground
is a dizzying distance below.  They swallow hard.

                              SKULL
               Bulk... where'd the earth go?
               
                              BILLY
               Five seconds to the target zone!

                              TOMMY
               Aisha  you' re  on !

Bulk and Skull step aside, Aisha LAUNCHES herself.

The others follow through the opening with flair.

                             ROCKY
               Stylin!

                             ADAM
               On your tail!
              
                             BILLY
               All systems

Tommy and Kimberly share an infectious glance, Kimberly
a hand, indicating Tommy should go first.

                             TOMMY
               Surf's up!

He's gone.  Kimberly stands backwards in the doorway.

                             KIMBERLY
               Catch you on the flipside.

Bulk and Skull watch wide-eyed as she BACK-FLIPS
out of the plane.


3   EXT. SKY  -  DAY

ROCK AND ROLL fills the track as the Rangers plunge towards
earth, executing a series of MIND-BOGGLING MANEUVERS: SPINS,
FISHTAILS, POWER DIVES, BACK FLIPS, you name it.

4   INT. PROP PLANE  -  DAY                          4

Bulk and Skull psyche themselves up.

                              BULK
               Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.

                              SKULL
               Be the swallow.  Be the
               swallow...

They take deep breaths then CHARGE THE DOOR.

                              BULK AND SKULL
               Aaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!

Naturally, they get STUCK, wedged shoulder to shoulder.
THE PILOT glances back, CHUCKLES and BANKS THE PLANE.


5   EXT. PROP PLANE - BARREL-ROLLING - DAY

Bulk and Skull rotate into frame.  Now, facing straight down --
they FALL INTO CAMERA, CLINGING TO EACH OTHER DESPERATELY

                              BULK AND SKULL
               YEAAAAAAHHHHHH!!

6   EXT.  SKY  -  DAY

The Rangers pull off more SPECTACULAR MANEUVERS
then swoop TOGETHER, interlocking hands and forming a
PERFECT CIRCLE

They look to one another and a moment of pure magic passes
between them.  It's not  usual the exhilaration of flight they're
sharing, it s the exhilaration of togetherness, of being part
of a team.

                              TOMMY
               Let's BREAK!!

They disperse and yank their rip-cords.  The sky BURSTS TO LIFE
WITH SIX BLOSSOMING PARACHUTES -- white, pink, blue, yellow ,
red and black in color.

7   EXT.  ANGEL GROVE PARK  -  DAY                               7

FAMILIES eat hot dogs and cotton candy at a huge fundraiser .
A large banner proclaims "SAVE THE OBSERVATORY."  We see
diving teams with labeled uniforms -- the BOWLING TEAM, ANGEL
GROVE P.D.  and the FIRE DEPARTMENT.  There s a large white
"BULLSEYE" spray-painted on the grass.  The city's
spectacular large skyline rises out of the b.g.

A SPUNKY MR. KELMAN stands at a podium, speaking into a mic.

                              MR. KELMAN
               Okay, so the firemen landed four
               out of six inside the target --

A BOWLER shouts out playfully.

                              BOWLER
               How `bout a show tune?!

Mr. Kelman feigns seriousness.

                              MR. KELMAN
               Somebody wanna keep chose bowlers
               in line.

A hip thirteen year old, FRED KELMAN, yells out as he points
to the sky.

                              FRED
               Hey dad, get with the program!

                              MR. KELMAN
               Ladies and gentlemen, it's Angel
               Grove High

ANGEL ON TARGET - AS AISHA touches down flawlessly.
                       
                              MR. KELMAN
               And that's one!  A perfect
               landing!

Aisha clears, then Billy and Adam land toqether.

                              MR. KELMAN
               Three for three.  Look at `em go!
 
Billy and Adam clear and now Rocky and Kimberly come in.
          
                              MR. KELMAN
               That's five perfect landings!
               Now it's all up to Tommy Oliver.

Everybody watches with dumbfounded expressions as Tommy SAILS
IN ON HIS AIR BOARD AND SLIDES INTO DEAD CENTER.  He spreads
his arms wide.

                             TOMMY
               Touch down.

The families CHEER and APPLAUD as they surge forward to
congratulate the Rangers.

Mr. Kelman and Fred approach Tommy -  Fred and Tommy exchange
stylish hand slaps.

                              FRED
               Looking good up there.

                              TOMMY
               Thanks, man.

                              MR. KELMAN
               Congratulations - the
               Observatory's got a new lease on
               life.

                              FRED
               Awesome!   Ryan's Comet is passing
               over in two days!

The other Rangers approach.

                              AISHA
               Who's up for lunch?

                              ROCKY
               You read my mind.

                              KIMBERLY
               Last one to Ernies buys.

                              ADAM
               Let's roll!


8   EXT.  ANGEL GROVE PARK  -  DAY                              8

We hear a VOCIFEROUS SISSING SOUND, but we can't see where  it's
coming from. - Suddenly the six Rangers come SCREAMING AROUND A
CORNER ON STATE-OF-THE-ART ROLLERBLADES.  These kids are FLYING!!
 
We hear FULL-THROTTLED MUSIC as the kids WEAVE, DUCK and SWERVE
like blading virtuosos.  Tommy LEAPS in the air, does a 180 and
SKATES BACKWARD.


THE HIGH BRANCHES.past a large tree as Bulk and Skull DROP INTO
FRAME

                              SKULL
               Stealth Eagle, huh?  The Lame
               Duck is more like it!

9   EXT.  CITY STREET - DAY                                     9

The Rangers GLIDE around another corner -- there's buildings on
one side of them and a construction site on the other.

                              TOMMY
               Let's take the shortcut!

Tommy leads them up a plywood ramp -- they LAUNCH TEN FEET
THROUGH THE AIR, PULLING OFF HAIR-RAISING FREE STYLE MOVES THEN
MAKE SPECTACULAR LANDINGS on the construction site parking
structure.

As they shoot across the concrete, the CAMERA PUSHES IN on:

10   EXT.  INNER CITY CONSTtZUCTION SITE - DAY                   10

... WORKERS operating heavy machinery -- cranes, bulldozer ,
etc., Construction Worker  jackhammers solid rock.  Drill
makes a CLANGING SOUND as it HITS METAL!  A baffled look comes
over him as he stops the jackhammer, brushes away debris..
uncovering an ANCIENT IRON PLATE.  He gapes at it, too stunned
to speak.

11   EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - SHORT TIME LATER                  11        

A large hook has been fastened to the iron plate -- a crane
ENGINE ROARS as it HOISTS THE PLATE UP, revealing a CAVERNOUS
OPENING.
    
TWO MORE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS have joined the first, all of
them look on in amazement.

                              CONSTRUCTION WORKER #2
               Whadda you figure it is?!

                              CONSTRUCTION WORKER #1
               Hey, ya got me.

Suddenly a PURPLE STEAM POURS from the opening.  And now
something really amazing happens.   ..

A menacing STONE CLAW RISES UP, CRADLING A HUGE STONE

                              CONSTRUCTION  WORKER  # 1
               ... I'll be damned.

As though drawn by it's power, he moves to touch it.

KZAAAAAAP?!!  APURPLE BEAM OF LIGHT BLASTS HIM -- SENDS HIM
FLYING TEN FEET THROUGH THE AIR!
  
                              CONSTRUCTION WORKER #1
               AHHHHHHHHH!


11A   EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY                                11A

A T.V.  REPORTER is talking into camera.

                              REPORTER
               We're here at the World Center
               Construction Site, where a
               mysterious object was just
               uncovered in a freak accident in
               which one workman suffered minor
               injuries...

                                                                    12

13A  INT.  ERNIE'S WATERFRONT CAFE - DAY                           13A

CLOSE ON - T.V.  SCREEN

We see the reporter then a few cuts of GEOLOGISTS combing the
site with scanning equipment and COPS sealing off the area with
yellow tape.

                              REPORTER
               ... Angel Grove Police have
               cordoned off the area until it
               can be determined whether or not
               the unidentified object poses any
               threat.  The injured workman was
               quoted as saying...

PULL BACK TO REVEAL A CAFE.

The Rangers are at a table -- Tommy is teaching Fred martial arts
moves.

                              TOMMY
               It's one smooth move and then
               you've gotta explode off the top.

Tommy executes a wicked JUMPING ROUNDHOUSE KICK.  Fred is
wowed.  He drops into position.

                              TOMMY
               Nice and easy.

The jovial proprietor, ERNIE, approaches the Rangers' table
with a loaded tray.  Fred pulls off a dazzling JUMPING
ROUNDHOUSE KICK and almost knocks Ernie's tray over.

                              ERNIE
               Hey, no Karate on the patio!

                              FRED
               Actually, Ernie, it's Tae-Kwan
               Doe.

                              ERNIE
               Well Tae-Kwan-Do-it some place
               else.

Fred moves off as Ernie serves the desserts.
     
                              ERNIE
               So, what're the plans for the
               weekend?

                              KIMBERLY
               Aisha and.I are checking out a
               new dance spot.

                              AISHA
               I heard that!

                              BILLY
               I'll be at the Observatory
               Sunday.
     
                              ERNIE
               That's right - Ryan's Comet.

                              ROCKY
               We should throw a little comet
               shindig.

                              ADAM
               Any excuse for a party.

Aisha reacts to something off screen.

                              AISHA
               The Eagle has landed.

Bulk and Skull swagger past followed by a GROUP OF KIDS.

                              BULK
               The earth was hurtling toward us
               at seven hundred miles per hour,
               and we knew at that moment that
               we were facing death straight in
               the eye.

                              SKULL
               We could smell it's breath.

Ernie moves off after Bulk and Skull.  Tommy's wrist
communicator BEEPS.  The kids exchange glances than look for a
private area.

                              ROCKY
               There's a spot over there.
 
They move out of everybody's sight.

                              TOMMY (into  communicator)
               What's up, Alpha?

                              ALPHA 5 (V.O.)
               Rangers, we need you at the
               Command  Center,  L.R.N. !

Aisha gives Kimberly a puzzled look.

                              KIMBERLY
               'Like Right Now.'

                              TOMMY
               We're on our way.

They hit their wrist-communicators and instantly TRANSFORM
INTO SIX IRIDESCENT COLUMNS OF COLOR.  The columns SHOOT UP
THROUGH a giant oak tree, KNOCKING LEAVES LOOSE.

14   EXT. COMMAND CENTER  -  SUNSET                               14

Zordon's remote headquarters protrudes from a craggy
mountain top -- silhouetted by a glorious sunset.  The SIX STREAK 
OF COLOR slice downward into the roof.

15   INT.  CONIMAND CENTER  -  NIGHT                              15

Everything's gone haywire   buttons BLINK, emergency
lights FLASH, there's a CACOPHONY OF ELECTRONIC SOUNDS.

ALPHA 5 works frantically amidst the array of computer
banks while ZORDON looks on from his COLUMN OF LIGHT.

The six Rangers MATERIALIZE, Tommy turns to Zordon.

                              TOMMY
               What's happening?

                              ALPHA 5
               Ay,  yi,  yi,  yi,  yi !  Our
               thermionic-sensors have been hit
               by a CATACLYSMIC surge of evil!

                              ZORDON
               Rangers, you must act swiftly.
               The planet is in GRAVE danger!

                              KIMBERLY
               Danger from what?

                              ZORDON
               Six thousand years ago a
               morphological being known as Ivan
               Ooze, ruled the world with a
               reign of unparalleled terror.
               Finally, a rebel factor known as
               the "Order of the Meledon" lured
               him into a hyperlock chamber and
               buried him deep underground.

                              ALPHA 5
               In a place that came to be known
               as Angel Grove.

                              ZORDON
               The chamber has been accidently
               UNCOVERED!  You must return it to
               the depths. or  anyone should
               open it and Ivan is released!

                              ALPHA 5
               To assist you I have retro-fitted
               your helmets with new Opti-Scan
               devices.

                              ZORDON
               Use extreme caution, Rangers.
               You are dealing with an evil here
               that is beyond ALL comprehension.


16   EXT.  INNER CITY CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT           
 
Barricades and police tape surround the egg.  A  SECURITY GUARD
passes his sleeping CO-WORKER, drops into a chair, sips his
coffee.                   

BZZWAPP -- ZEDD, RITA, GOLDAR and a short, fat, furry creature
named MORDANT appear.

                              RITA
               Another Saturday night and I'm
               traipsing around the galaxy with
               the THREE LITTLE PIGS!  My mother
               warned me this would happen!
               Rita, she said, after 89
               marriages you might wanna think
               about throwing in the towel.  Why
               didn't I listen to her?!

Zedd grumbles to himself.

                              ZEDD
               That's a good question.

The stunned guard stirs his sleeping buddy.

                              FIRST SECURITY GUARD
               Uh... Kurt...  you might wanna
               take a look at this.

Kurt looks up groggily.

                              ZEDD
               No need to wake him.  In fact,
               why don't you take a little nap
               yourself.

Zedd ZAPS THE GUYS with a bolt from his staff -- they are
knocked out.

Goldar steps back from the blast and accidentally steps or
Mordant's foot.  Mordant KNOCKS on Goldar's metallic leg.

                              MORDANT
               Hey bonehead, get off my hoof!

Goldar is oblivious.  Zedd, stands reverently before the
glowing egg shape.

                              ZEDD
               After two thousand years of
               searching...  I have finally
               found you.

Mordant BANGS on Goldar's leg again.

                              MORDANT
               Yo, earth to Bigfoot!

Goldar SWATS Mordant.

                              GOLDAR
               Watch your mouth, fuzz-ball!

                              ZEDD
               SILENCE!

                              RITA (to  Goldar)
               Where did you FIND this rabid
               little rodent, anyway?!

                              GOLDAR
               Mordant's my second cousin three
               times removed on my mother's
               side.  He`s just visiting for the
               summer.

                              RITA
               Well put a muzzle on him!

Mordant GRUMBLES under his breath.  Meanwhile, Zedd aims  is
staff at the chamber and BURSTS a blast of energy.  The egg
opens up with a wHOOSH of decompressing air.  webs of
ELECTRICITY BRANCH OUT, followed by a SWIRL OF BLACK SMOKE.

When the smoke clears we see a BUBBLING, PURPLE, PHOSPHOSCENT
OOZE.  The group gathers around -- Rita sticks a finger in  o
the sticky substance.

                              RITA
               What... you spent two thousand
               years looking for this tub of
               SNOT!

As if in response, the ooze BOILS AND FROTHS.  Zedd and Rita
are too busy arguing to notice this.

                              ZEDD
               Don't you ever have anything nice
               to say?!

                              RITA
               Well, if I did I certainly
               wouldn't say it to you!

We hear a SLITHERING SLURPING SOUND as the substance RISES UP
AND TAKES ON THE GHASTLY SHAPE OF IVAN OOZE.  Mordant tugs at Zedd.

                              MORDANT
               Boss.

                              ZEDD
               For your information this is not
               just your average, run-of-the-
               mill tub of snot ! 

                              RITA
               You're trying to tell me there`re
               different levels of snot?!

                              MORDANT
               Boss.
                        
                              ZEDD
               WHAT!

Zedd and Rita finally notice Ivan, standing with his lips
apart, revealing jagged teeth, one of which is made of
GLISTENING SILVER.

He stretches his sinewy arms, releases an enormous YAWN, puts
his hands on his head, CRACKS it.

                              IVAN
               Ahhhhhhhh.

Now he SMACKS his lips together, opens his arms theatrically
and gives his trademark stance.

                              IVAN
               Ladies and Gentlemen... the OOZE
               is back!!

Rita blushes.
     
                              RITA
               He's so cute.

Zedd flashes her an angry look, turns back to Ivan.

                              ZEDD
               I am Lord Zedd, sworn enemy of
               all that is good and decent.  It
               is a supreme honor to finally
               meet you.

Ivan gives a slight bow.

                              IVAN
               How can I ever repay you?

                              ZEDD
               Do you recall the name...  Zordon
               of Eltare?

Ivan's face goes dark, THUNDER RUMBLES and the site LIGHTS UP
WITH A FLASH OF LIGHTNING.  Mordant turns to Goldar.

                              MORDANT
               Seems to ring a bell.

                              ZEDD
               I want you to destroy Zordon, so
               that my evil may once again reign
               SUPREME.

                              IVAN (hissing)
               I will not only destroy him, I
               will OBLITERATE his entire being.
               It will be like Zordon
               of Eltare never EXISTED!

                              RITA
               Finally, a real man.

Goldar hands Ivan a scrap of paper.

                              GOLDAR
               Here's his address.

                              IVAN (reading)
               "... left off Interstate 12?!"

                     (puzzled)
               What's an "interstate"?

                              MORDANT
               It's like a freeway.  How long
               have  you  been  locked  up? !

                              ZEDD
               We shall leave you to weave your
               wicked ways.

                              RITA
               Now we go out on the town.  First
               dinner, then dancing, then --

BZZWAPP!!  The foursome DE-MATERIALIZE.

                              IVAN
               What is that odious stench?

His eyes come alive.

                              IVAN
               Smell's like...   TEENAGERS!

17   OMITTED

18   EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT                             

On cue, the Power Rangers TELEPORT into the construction site.

They're surrounded by rock piles, pools of water and a plethora
of building supplies.  Billy looks down at the mud puddle he's
standing in.

                              BILLY
               Remind me to have a word with
               Alpha about his teleporting
               calculations.

They survey the construction site for a moment.

                              AISHA
               Anybody see anything?

                              TOMMY
               ... Let's take a look over there.

They advance up a slope -- the egg comes into view.

                              ROCKY (alarmed)
               It looks like it's been opened!

The kids get close to the egg, looking it over with
fascination.  Suddenly a hand falls on Aisha.

                              SECURITY GUARD (O.S.}
               Hey!

They all whirl around and see the first Security Guard.  He
half smiles, shaking his head.

                              SECURITY GUARD
               You had me scared there.

                              AISHA
               Makes two of us.

                              KIMBERLY
               You haven't by any chance seen
               a ... morphological being lurking
               around?

                              SECURITY GUARD
               The only thing I've seen is you
               teenagers.
                              (beat)
               And you know... if there's one
               thing in the world I reeeeally
               hate....

CLOSE ON HIS FACE as it SHAPE-SHIFTS INTO THE+ HIDEOUS VISAGE OF
IVAN OOZE.

                              IVAN
               It's TEENAGERS

                              KIMBERLY
               GroSS!

                              IVAN
               You're too kind.  Allow me to
               introduce myself.  I am the
               infamous, world-reviled,
               universally despised, IVAN OOZE!

                              ROCKY
               Well, pack your bags cause we're
               sending you back where you came
               from!

                              IVAN
               Gee, a teenager with a big mouth.
               Not much has changed in six
               thousand years.

                              KIMBERLY
               we're not just teenagers, raisin-
               head.

                              TOMMY
               We're the Mighty Morphin Power
               Rangers!

Ivan puts his hands to his face in mock fear.

                              IVAN
               Ooooh, where's my autoqraph
               book?.

He looks them over reproachfully.

                              IVAN
               Power Rangers, huh?  So Zordon is
               still using a bunch of rug-rats
               to do his dirty work.  And
               speaking of rats...

Ivan raises both hands -- ELECTRICITY SHOOTS OUT HIS FINGERS
and the kids DIVE CLEAR as the bolt ZAPS A THRONG OF RATS.

Now, incredibly, the RATS GROWN INTO GRUNTING, SNARLING MAN
SIZED RAT-BEASTS.

                              IVAN
               From this moment forth, the world
               as you know it SHALL CEASE TO
               EXIST!

Ivan raises his arms -- thunder CRACKLES and LIGHTNING RIPS
ACROSS THE SKY.

                              IVAN
               WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE!

An EXPLOSION OF PURPLE SMOKE CONSUMES IVAN.

                              ROCKY
               He's  gone. 

The RATS ATTACK!

                              ADAM
               Let's take these beasts!!

Tommy gets off a stellar CROSS-HOCK TAKEDOWN, Kimberly delivers
a world class HEEL STOMP, Billy executes a lethal REVERSE
HANDSWORD.  Despite their valiant efforts, the Rangers ar
being overwhelmed by the fierce combatants.

19   INT.  COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT                               

SMOKE POURS from various circuit boards, numerous control
panels VIBRATE.

                              ZORDON
               Alpha, my sensors tell me the
               Rangers were too late!  Ivan is
               on his way here!
               
                              ALPHA 5
               Hey, NOBODY enters the Command
               Center without a power coin!

There's a BLEET, BLEET -- emergency lights start FLASHING near
the entrance.  Alpha watches, forlorn, as OOZE SEEPS through
the hairline cracks in the door.

                              ALPHA 5
               Well...  ALMOST nobody.

The ooze SLITHERS AND GURGLES ACROSS THE FLOOR, once again
IVAN RISES UP.  He takes in the state-of-the-art surroundings.

                              IVAN
               Gee... pretty fancy-shmancy.  I
               guess if you invest your money
               well over SIXTY centuries you can
               buy something pretty nice.

Alpha drops into a Karate stance, makes some BRUCE LEE NOISES
then LUNGES.

                              ALPHA 5
               HI ,  YAH !             

Ivan holds his arm out, ZAPS Alpha with an electrical charge
Alpha starts spinning.

                              ALPHA  5
               Welcome to Wiener World.  May I
               take your order, please?
     
                              ZORDON
               You haven't changed, Ooze.
               You're still picking on creatures
               smaller than yourself.

Ivan slowly circles Zordan's column of light, Zordon turns
with him.

                              IVAN
               Put a cork in it "Z" .  Ten
               minutes out of the egg and I'm
               already listening to one of your
               lectures.
                           
               (he explodes furiously)
                      
               You robbed me of my PRIME!  I was
               the Supreme Ruler of the most
               foul Empire in the Universe.  I
               was the King of Calamity.  The
               Duke of Destruction.  The big man
               on campus!
                              (beat)
               And then you came along.  You
               locked me into your stuffy little
               hyperlock-chamber and tossed me
               into the depths like yesterdays
               TRASH!

                              ZORDON
               It worked for six thousand years.

                              IVAN
               Don't remind me!

                              IVAN
               Do you have any idea what it's
               like to be cooped up in a rotten
               egg for six thousand years?  It's
               BORING!  Not to mention I've had
               a Charlie horse since the
               Renaissance!  But now the tables
               are turned.  Now...
     
IVAN raises his hands - he  is holding  a flute and he PLAYS A FEW
NOTES

                              IVAN    
               ... it's time to pay the PIPER!

He uses the flute like a lightning rod --  A BOLT OF LIGHTNING
BLASTS A PANEL TO SMITHEREENS.

                              IVAN
               Oh, the things that I have
               missed.  The BLACK PLAGUE!

He blows up another PANEL.

                              IVAN

               The SPANISH INQUISITION!

                         (another bolt)
             
               The  70's!

HE BLOWS UP ANOTHER PANEL.  Ivan CASTS ANOTHER LIGHTNING BOLT,
DEMOLISHING AN ENERGY PILLAR.

                              IVAN
               And now, finally, I have the
               strength to DESTROY your pathetic
               powers FOREVER!!

                              ZORDON
               YOU WON'T GET AWAY WITH THIS!

                              IVAN
               I've got a NEWS flash for you
               LIGHT-BRIGHT -- I ALREADY HAVE!

Now Ivan begins to THROW LIGHTNING EVERYWHERE, LAYING
THE  COMMAND CENTER TO WASTE.

Ivan laughs in the b.g.  as Alpha continues to spin,
moving  his arms in and out.

                              ALPHA 5
               You put your left probe in, you
               put your left probe out, you put
               your left probe in and you shake
               it all about.  You do the hokey-
               pokey and you turn yourself
               around...


20   EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT                        
 
Two rats charge Aisha and she LEAPS UPWARD - the pair SMASH
into each other.

Rocky picks up a two-by-four and starts SPARRING with another
rat.

Billy SHOVES A HUGE WOODEN-SPOOL down a slope and it
ROLLS INTO A COUPLE OF RATS, BOWLING THEM OVER.

One rat CRACKS IT'S TAIL like a whip, KNOCKING Adam to
the ground.

Another rat gets Kimberly in a bear hug and she makes a
face.

                              KIMBERLY
               RAT breath!!

She grabs a handful of his whiskers.

                              KIMBERLY
               Somebody needs a shave.

She YANKS THEM OUT, the rat SQUEALS and releases her.  The
fight well, but the rats start to get the upperhand.

                              TOMMY
               IT'S MORPHIN TIME!

The Rangers click their power coins into their power morphers.

                              KIMBERLY
               PTERODACTYL!

                              BILLY
               TRICERATOPS!

                              ROCKY
               TYRANNOSAURUS!

                              ADAM
               MASTODON!

                              AISHA
               SABER TOOTH TIGER!

                              TOMMY
               WHITE TIGER!

                              RANGERS
               MORPHENOMENAL!

They JUMP INTO THE AIR and they're ENGULFED IN A DAZZLING
GOLDEN LIGHT as we do a 3D MOVIE VERSION OF THEIR
TRANSFORMATION INTO COSTUME.

They all LAND and there's a WHIRRING SOUND as all six of the
face pieces POLARIZE so we can see their faces.  The rats
immediately scurry off.
               
                              TOMMY
               Let's teach these vermin a few
               manners.

                              AISHA  
               Activating Power Beam!

A YELLOW BEAM SLICES THROUGH THE DARKNESS.  Aisha leads the
group through the site.

                              KIMBERLY
               Everybody stay alert.

They pass a bulldozer, some scaffolding

                              ADAM
               Hold it...

They come to a stop.

                              ADAM (pointing)
               I heard something over there.

                              BILLY
               Activating Audio Enhancer!

AN AUTO-PHONIC RECEIVER POPS OUT of the side of Billy's
helmet.  As he turns his head, the receivers ROTATE.

SOUND EFFECT:  We hear silence and then... a RASPY
BREATHING, followed by a GUTTURAL SNARL.

                              BILLY
               They're on the other side of that
               wall.

The Rangers advance along a cement wall, slowly round a
corner.  Aisha's light PANS THROUGH THE GLOOM.

                              TOMMY
               Anybody see them?

                              ROCKY
               Activating Power Scope!

A SCOPE SNAPS into place over Rocky's left eye.

P.O.V.  - THROUGH POWER TRACKER

We see HEAT SENSOR OUTLINES, PULSATING WITH COLOR.  COMMAND
GRAPHIC:  SEARCH MODE.

Lines VECTOR and SCAN as Rocky searches the area.  Eventually
he looks up and the lines LOCK ON TO THE PULSATING FORMS  OF
THE RATS.

                              ROCKY
               THEY'RE ABOVE US!!

The creatures LEAP DOWN and we see the Rangers pull off  
KICKS, SUCKER PUNCHES, SPINBACK-ROUNDHOUSES, you name it.

One of the beasts TACKLES Tommy and the pair go TUMBLING 
OWN A TWENTY FOOT ROCK PILE.  Aisha picks up a handful of dirt

                              AISHA
               Hey, handsome!

A beast turns -- Aisha FLINGS dirt in his eyes.

                              AISHA
               My mistake.

She follows through with an OVER SHOULDER THROW --
the beast CRASHES INTO A JOHNNY-ON-THE-SPOT.

Rocky fights another beast and the creature SWINGS
UP THROUGH SCAFFOLDING with phenomenal dexterity.  Rocky goes
after him.

                              TOMMY
               SABA SABER?

The talking Saber appears in Tommy's hand.

                              SABA (yawning)
               What a DREAM I was having!

                              TOMMY
               We've got company.

Saba sees the rats.

                              SABA
               Rats!  I hate rats!

We hear a PRIMITIVE CRY as a beast SLAMS INTO ADAM,
SENDS HIM CATAPULTING.  Adam rises, speaks in a low growl.

                              ADAM
               Bad move, Willard!
              
He holds his hand in the air.

                              ADAM
               STEGA-STINGER!

The STEGA-STINGER appears in Adam`s hand.  He aims
it toward an overhang, FIRES.  A thin wire SHOOTS OUT -- the
Stinger at the end PIERCES the overhang.

                              ADAM
               Coming through!

Adam leaps off a platform, SWINGS THROUGH THE AIR like Tarzan,
SLAMS into the rat and sends him CATAPULTING.

                              ADAM
               Target Neutralized?

                              KIMBERLY
               Raptor-Ribbon!

A contraption APPEARS in Kimberly's hand and she throws her arm
out -- a LONG RIBBON SWIRLS out and tangles itself around the
rat.

                              KIMBERLY
               Now you see `em.

She yanks the ribbon pulling the rat into an opening -- he
DISAPPEARS.

                              KIMBERLY
               Now you don't.

Billy takes a hit, ROLLS across the ground.  He stops inches
away from a twenty foot drop-off.

The beast CHARGES HIM, he ducks and the beast GOES FLYING
THROUGH THE AIR AND SPLASHES DOWN IN ONE OF THE MUDDY POOLS
OF WATER.

                              BILLY
               Not the brightest of beasts.

Rocky is now up in the scaffolding.  He DROPS TEN FEET through
the air, LANDS ON ONE END OF A BOARD.

There's a beast at the other end and he goes FLIPPING THROUGH
THE AIR.

Tommy throws Saba Saber and the knife SWOOPS THROUGH THE AIR
and zings around the beasts as they try to knock him down.

                              SABA
               Na na na na na!

The rats chase after Saba as he heads into a water-slicked
area.  There's a large power cable running across it.  Once 
all the rats are in the water, Saba kamikaze dives into the
cable, SLICING IT OPEN WITH AN ERUPTION OF SPARKS.  The water
SIZZLES WITH ELECTRICITY and the rats GO UP IN A PUFF OF SMOKE.

                              SABA
               Fried mice, anyone?

We see the six original small rats scurry away, SQUEAKING.

Suddenly, there's an EXPLOSION OF ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY and the
Rangers watch, stunned, as their COSTUMES DE-MATERIALIZE and
they appear back in civilian clothes.
     
                              KIMBERLY
               What's going on?!

Billy tries his wrist communicator.

                              BILLY
               Alpha, come in!

There's no response.

                              TOMMY
               We'd better get back.

They all hit their communicators and nothing happens.

                              AISHA (worried)
               Something's wrong!

                              TOMMY
               Come on, guys...

They hurry off.

21   EXT.  COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT                         21

The Rangers climb a mountain path, all of them looking alarmed.
Up ahead, there's a PILLAR OF BLACK SMOKE rising from the
Command Center.


22   INT.  COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT                          22

The place is trashed -- there's SMOKING debris, ravaged  panels,
exposed wires and mechanisms.  The kids move through the
wreckage in numb silence.

                              TOMMY (barely audible)
               ... what happened here?...

Adam spots Alpha's arm protruding from a mound of rubble.

                              ADAM
               Guys!

The kids quickly uncover the battered robot.

                              BILLY
               Alpha, are you okay?!

                              ALPHA 5
               I'll GET you my pretty, and your
               little DOG toa!!

                              BILLY
               He must've blown an anitromic
               demodulator!

                              KIMBERLY (stunned)
               Oh, no...

Everybody follows Kimberly's gaze, thunderstruck expressions
coming over them.

Laying on a destroyed bed of crystals is Zordon.  He is still a
SHIMMERING SPECTRAL being, only now he s aged a good fifty
years.

The kids stand over him, forlorn.

                              AISHA
               ... What's happening to him?'
              
                              BILLY
               Outside of his time warp he's
               aging at a vastly acellerated
               rate!

                              KIMBERLY
               We have to help him!

Zordon opens his eyes.

                              ZORDON
               ...  Rangers... thank goodness
               you're safe.

The kids drop down beside him.
               
                              TOMMY
               We have to get you back inside
               your time warp.
 
                              ZORDON
               I'm afraid that's impossible...
               The power has been destroyed.
               It's gone... The Zords, the
               weapons...  all of it.
                              (beat)
               The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers
               are no more.

The kids are stunned.  Kimberly gently takes Zordon's hand.

                              KIMBERLY
               Zordon... you can't leave us.
               Ever since you came into our
               lives... you've been like another
               father `to  us  all.-

                              ZORDON
               ... You must be strong... Ivan
               almost overthrew the planet
               once...  and now I'm afraid he
               has the strength to see his
               scheme through.

Zordon closes his eyes.  Tommy puts a hand on Kimberly's
shoulder.  The kids slowly rise, all of them looking utterly
despondent.  Billy turns to Alpha.

                              BILLY
               what're we going to do?

                              ALPHA 5
               I do not LIKE Green Eggs and Ham!
               I do not like them, Sam-I-am!

Billy opens a panel on Alpha's back, makes an adjustment.
Alpha's head rolls back like he's going to sneeze.

                              ALPHA 5
               Ah-Ah-Ahhhh-CHOO!!

SPARKS BURST from where his nose should be.  He SNIFFS.

                              ALPHA 5
               Thanks, Billy.

Rocky hands Alpha a hanky, Alpha wipes his nose area.

                              ADAM
               There has to be something we can
               do.

                              TOMMY
               Come on, guys, think!

Aisha turns to Alpha.

                              AISHA
               Alpha.  Is there any way we can
               defeat this  monster?  Any way at
               all?

                             ALPHA 5
               ... Perhaps there is a way... I
               have heard tales of another
               power.

                             ADAM
               What?!

                             ALPHA 5
               ... They say that somewhere
               beyond the Hyperion Constellation
               there exists a mythological power
               that is beyond all comprehension.

                             TOMMY
               How can we get to it?

                             ALPHA 5    
               As the legend goes, the power is
               impossible to obtain.

                             ROCKY
               We have to try, Alpha.  It's our
               only hope.

Alpha shakes his head.

                             ALPHA 5
               It's far too dangerous.  Zordon
               would never allow it.

                             AISHA
               If we don't try, Zordon won't
               survive!

                             ADAM
               If Ivan  Ooze  isn't  stopped,
               nobody will survive.

Alpha heaves a sigh.

                             ALPHA 5
               Ay, yi, yi, yi.
                              (beat)
               The legend speaks of a Master
               Warrior who lives on the planet
               Phaedos... This is the only
               person who knows the secrets of
               the power.

                              AISHA
               How can we reach Phaedos?

Alpha heaves a SIGH.

                              ALPHA 5
               Zordon's going to have my
               orbicular spheroids when he hears
               out about this!

The kids exchange curious looks as Alpha opens a compartment
and removes a vile filled with RADIOLUMINESCENT ENERGY.

                              ALPHA 5
               This is an emergency reserve of
               morphonic emissions.  It should
               be enough to get -you there.

He approaches a damaged panel, loads in the vile.

                              ALPHA 5
               There is one problem.  I only
               have enough reserve to send you
               Phaedos...  I can't bring you
               back.

                              ADAM
               So how do we get back?

Alpha gives them a grim look.

                              ALPHA 5
               ... You'll have to pray that the
               legends are true.

Alpha keys in coordinates.

                              ALPHA 5
               You're sure you want to do this?!
               The Rangers share purposeful looks.

                              TOMMY
               It's our only hope.

Alpha shakes his head, punches in the final codes.

                              ALPHA
               Safe journey, Rangers!

He pulls a lever.

                              ALPHA  5
               BE CAREFUL!!
  
The kids TRANSFORM INTO SIX STREAKS OF COLOR AND BLAST 0FF
THROUGH THE CEILING.  Alpha shakes his head in despair.

               Ay, yi, yi, yi.  They're DOOMED!!

28    EXT.  EARTH - NIGHT                                  28

We see the SIX COLORED STREAKS BLAST away from earth and SHOOT
PAST the moon.

The CAMERA MOVES IN on Zedd's ominous palace which rises up out
of the tortured landscape.  Zedd, Rita, Mordant and Goldar are
standing on the balcony.

29   INT.  ZEDD'S PALACE - NIGHT                           29

Zedd, Rita and their minions are inside Zedd's dark palace
Goldar looks through Rita's telescope as Rita rants.

                              RITA (outraged)
               How could he let them slip
               through his hands?!  He's no
               better than the rest of the hired
               help around here!

Goldar looks up from the telescope.

                              GOLDAR
               According to the TX Tracker,
               they're headed for Phaedos.

                              ZEDD
               I'm gonna fire that slimeball so
               fast his not gonna know what hit
               him!

Ivan sweeps regally into the room.

                              IVAN
               Hi, honey, I'm home !

                              RITA
               You garlic-sucking DINGLEBRAIN!
               The Rangers are going after the
               Great Power
                              (to  Zedd)
               I thought you said this guy was
               the Master of Disaster?
                              (to  Ivan)
               He's nothing but a slime-
               infested, jelly-bellied blob of --

Ivan SNAPS his hand -- a WAD OF OOZE FLIES OUT, SPLATS RITA
across the mouth, muffling her.

                              RITA
               Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!

                              ZEDD
               How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up
               Rita but me!

                              IVAN
               Sorry, slick, there's been a
               slight'change of plans.
                              (arms out in trademark stance)
               The "booger man" is taking over.

Ivan drops regally into Zedd's chair.

                              ZEDD
               Nobody double-crosses Lord Zedd
               and lives!

Mordant slips behind Goldar, using him as a shield.

                              MORDANT
               Zedd's gonna kick this snotball
               into next week!

Zedd SHOOTS A BLAST from his staff -- Ivan is COVERED IN SPARKS.

                              IVAN
               Ooooh, that tickles!

Ivan raises his hands and the sparks DISAPPEAR.

                              IVAN
               My turn.


He ZAPS Rita and Zedd, and with a BRILLIANT FLASH, THEY'RE GONE.

Mordant moves to a snow-globe on the table, his mouth falling    
open.  Zedd and Rita are INSIDE IT!!

Rita wipes the ooze off her mouth, RANTS IN A MUNCHKIN VOICE.

                              RITA
               This is all your fault!  If you'd
               taken me out tonight like you
               were suposed to, none of this
               would've happened.

Ivan turns menacingly to Goldar and Mordant.

                              IVAN
               Now you have a choice, either
               serve me, or join those
               insufferable cheesedongs.

Mordant and Goldar exchange a look, then turn back to Ivan.

                              GOLDAR
               We never liked the cheesedongs in
               the first place.

                              MORDANT
               Couldn''t stand them -- low-class
               all the way.  And did you catch
               a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's
               like having a conversation with
               a couple of ONIONS!  Not to
               mention...

Goldar throws a hand over Mordant's mouth, MUFFLING him.

                              GOLDAR (apologetic)
               He's just visiting for the
               summer.
                              (beat)
               Now what about,the Rangers, oh
               hideous one?

                              IVAN
               Ah yes, the RANGERS!!!

He makes a HOARKING SOUND then SPITS OOZE ONTO THE FLOOR,

                              MORDANT
               Gasunteidt.

Now the OOZE GROWS INTO TEN TENGU WARRIORS -- BIRD-LIKE     
CREATURES WITH LONG BEAKS AND ENORMOUS WINGS.

THEY GOBBLE, SQUAWK AND CHIRP like newborn chickens, the
CACOPHONY GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER until...

                              IVAN
               SHUT YOUR BEAKS !!

The Tengu fall dead silent.

                              IVAN
               Tengu Warriors, you will fly to
               Phaedos, find the Power
               Rangers...  and TEAR THEM APART!

The creatures make HORRENDOUS SQUAWKING SOUNDS AS THEY SPREAD
THEIR REPTILIAN WINGS.

                              IVAN
               Mordant, go with them and report
               back to me!

                              MORDANT
               You know boss, I'd really like to
               help out but I've got this
               gastronomic condition which rules
               out all space trave--

One of the Tengu grabs hold of Mordant and the FLOCK WINGS OFF
LIKE COLOSSAL BATS.

                              MORDANT
               IIIIIII!!!      

ANGLE ON - SNOW GLOBE

Zedd waves his arms around in outrage.

                              ZEDD
               Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We
               finally do somebody a good turn
               and just look what happens!

                              RITA
               From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO
               exceptions!

                              RITA (optional line)
               It just goes to show, ya never go
               into business with a booger.

The Tengu warriors sweep toward us -- we see Mordant dangling
from one of the Tengu's talons.

                              MORDANT
               Watch the HAIRRRRRRRR!!

He SWINGS PAST CAMERA and out of sight.

The STREAKS OF COLOR hit the jungle floor and only FIVE  RANGERS
MATERIALIZE.

SPARKS erupt from the panel, SINGING ALPHA.  He snarls.

He SPLASHES DOWN in a puddle.
                              AISHA

The others quickly gather around him.

               You okay?

                              BILLY
               I think so.

Billy looks down at the puddle.

                              BILLY
               This puddle thing is really
               getting on my nerves.

They help Billy up then take in the exotic jungle environment.
They hear all sorts of EXOTIC ANIMAL SOUNDS.

Tommy gives them all an invigorating look.

               Let's see if we can find this

33   INT.  CHEMICAL PLANT - DAY                              33

Ivan is walking through a giant chemical plant with Goldar

                              IVAN
               Taking over the world is one
               thing.  It's finding good help to
               run it for you that's the killer.

                              GOLDAR
               You want me to place a few calls?

Ivan shakes his head.

                              IVAN
               No need.   I'm going to use the
               young minds of Angel Grove.

GOLDAR digs for buried treasure deep in his nose.

                              GOLDAR
               No offense, boss, but they might
               find you a little disgusting.

                              IVAN
               Yes, well, I suppose you'd know
               a little something about that.
                              (beat)
               Not to worry.  I'll ever so
               gently lure them in and mold them
               into an army of devils!  And what
               better way to entice them ...
               than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!

Ivan approaches an enormous vat, turns a tap -- it BURPS and
GLOPS as PURPLE OOZE pours out.

                              GOLDAR
               But boss, what about their
               parents?

                              IVAN
               Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm
               going to SCOURGE their puny
               minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S.
               And then I'll put them to work
               rebuilding my empire.

Bulk and Skull enter waving a "help wanted" flier.  Both
them are wearing their garish blazers and dark sunglasses.

                              SKULL
               I understand you're looking for
               a few new assistants.

Bulk does a G.Q. stance.

                              BULK
               Well put your mind to rest `cause
               now you've got the best.

Ivan doesn't look too pleased.

                              IVAN
               What is this?!  I advertised for
               brilliant and good looking
               assistants!

Skull extends his hand.

                              SKULL
               Hi, I'm brilliant.

                              BULK (hand extended)
               And I'm good looking.

Ivan steps forward.

                              IVAN
               And I'm Little-Bo-Peep.

Bulk and Skull lower the sunglasses and take a good look
Ivan.  Both of them swallow hard.

                              SKULL
               Bulk... why don't we give Mr.
               Peep here a chance to think it
               over?

                              BULK   
               A stellar idea, Skull.

They start to back away.

                              IVAN
               Not so fast, greaseballs.

Goldar blocks their way.

                              IVAN
               You'll have to do.

39   EXT.  PHAEDOS JUNGLE - DAY                          39   

The Rangers move through foreboding jungle terrain, their ears
alert to all the UNEARTHLY SOUNDS around them.  Tommy watches
Kimberly, who seems to be lost in thought.

                              TOMMY
               Hey.

Kimberly glances up.

                              TOMMY
               You okay?

Kimberly takes a moment to answer.
 
                              KIMBERLY
               I was just thinking about
               Zordon...  everything we've been
               through together.

                              AISHA
               You know, meeting Zordon...
               teaming up with you guys, it's
               the best thing that's ever
               happened to me.

                              ROCKY
               It's the best thing that's ever
               happened to all of us.

                              ADAM
               ... He's gonna make it, guys.

The others nod in agreement.

                              TOMMY
               We'll get this warrior...  save
               Zordon...  and send that
               SLIMEBALL Ivan Ooze back to the
               SEWER he crawled out of.

Tommy's words sink in.  He stops suddenly, sensing something.

ANGLE ON - MORDANT hiding behind a tree, watching the Ranger's
pass.

There's a HORRIFIC SCREECH -- the kids look up as the TENGU
WARRIORS COME SWEEPING OUT OF THE SKY

                              ROCKY
               TAKE COVER!

It's too late.  The Tengu attack with unbelievable ferocity
They SLASH with their claws, STAB with their beaks and BATTER
with their wings.

                              KIMBERLY
               THEY'RE T00 STRONG??

                              ADAM
               WE NEED OUR POWERS!!

Rocky is hurtled into some bushes, Aisha is knocked against a
tree, Adam splashes down in a small creek.  Mordant watches
of this from the sidelines.  He gets so excited that he starts
throwing punches and kicks.

                              MORDANT
               WHAM!  KAPOW!  BOOM!

He accidently punches a tree.

                              MORDANT
               #0!@!#!

One of the Tengu gets Kimberly in a choke-hold,

                              TOMMY
               HANG ON, KIMBERLY.

Tommy rushes to help her and another Tengu trips him -- he
TUMBLES HEAD OVER HEELS DOWN A SLOPE.  We hear an OTHERWORDLY
CRY as a small, hunched figure wearing a tattered robe SWINGS
IN ON A VINE.

He proceeds to pull off what is nothing short of a miracle.
       
He uses the STICKS for weapons as he executes a ROUNDHOUSE
KICK, a SCISSOR-KICK TAKEDOWN, a SITTING SIDE KICK, a
ROUNDHOUSE DROP SPIN BACK KICK, a PARALLEL BLOCK FROM THE
OUTSIDE, a REVERSE HANDSWORD and so on.

The creature punctuates the hits with an exotic variation of
BRUCE LEE NOISES.

                              MORDANT
               What's the matter with you
               woodpeckers!  Take this guy out!

The Tengu SQUAWK and SQUEAL as the little dynamo WAILS ON THEM.

                              MORDANT
               The Tengu Warriors my butt!  The
               Tengu TURKEYS is more like it!

Finally the Tengu retreat, WINGING UP THROUGH THE TREES.

                              MORDANT
               Hey, aren't you bird-brains
               forgetting something?!

One of the Tengu SWOOPS IN AND SNATCHES Mordant up.

                              MORDANT
               Watch the meathooks!!

The Rangers recover and exchange expressions of utter disbelief
           
                              KIMBERLY
               Wow!  That was amazing for such
               a little dude!

The figure speaks in a HOARSE WHISPER.

                              FIGURE
               You're trespassing.
                              (beat)
               Now state your business.

                              TOMMY
               We're looking for the Master
               Warrior.  Do you know where we
               can find him?

                              FIGURE
               The Master Warrior doesn't
               entertain visitors  -

                              KIMBERLY
               But we have to find him.  Our
               leader Zordon is dying.

                              FIGURE
               Zordon?

Now the most amazing thing happens.  The figure RISES TO FULL
HEIGHT OF SIX FEET, while simultaneously shedding it's robe.

Underneath is a SCANTILY CLAD, STUNNING AMAZONIAN WOMAN.  We're
talking B-U-I-L-T.  Meet the Master warrior, DULCEA.

The Rangers stand there with stunned expressions.  Dulcea looks
to Tommy.

                              DULCEA
               How did this happen?!

Tommy just gapes.  Kimberly gives him a cold glance and THUNKS
him one with her elbow.

                              KIMBERLY
               The lady asked you a question.

                              TOMMY
               Huh ... Oh, uh, we re, ah...

Kimberly intervenes.

                              KIMBERLY
               He was attacked by this horrific
               being -- Ivan Ooze.

                              DULCEA
               Ivan Ooze is free?!  We are all
               in mortal danger!

She moves off - the Rangers just stand there staring at each
other.

                              DULCEA
               Let' s go.

The Rangers quickly follow her through the brush Aisha turns
to Kimberly, speaks under her breath.

                              AISHA
               Kind of bossy, isn't she?


39A.. EXT.  ANGEL GROVE PARK - DAY      (OLD SC 38)         39A

CLOSE UP - OOZE CONTAINER

There's a label with a picture of Ivan -- he's wearing make-up
to make him a little more presentable.

DOZENS OF KIDS Ranging in age from eight to seventeen, are swarming
Bulk and Skull, who have set up a booth with a large banner
that reads:      "FREE OOZE!"

Some kids STRETCH the ooze, others MOLD it, others THROW it at
each other.  It's an ooze free-for-all.

                              IVAN
               Boys and girls, girls and boys,
               gather round and feast your eyes.
               This ain't sludge and this ain't
               guck... this is the one and only
               Ivan's Ooze!  Yesireebob.  It's
               ooey, gooey and even kind of
               chewy.  But best of all it's
               FREE!

Bulk and Skull run a booth.   A banner screams "OOZE RULES".      
Kids crowd around.

                              BULK
               Here you go!  No pushing!

                              SKULL
               There's enough for everybody!

Fred approaches.

                              FRED
               So where'd this guy come from?

Bulk and Skull exchange apprehensive looks.

                              SKULL
               Uh... that's classified, top
               secret, confidential, undercover
               information.

                              BULK
               If we told you -- we'd have to
               kill you.

Fred looks at the container in his hand but he doesn't open it.
Skull sees a kid HURL some ooze at him.

                              SKULL
               INCOMING!

Skull ducks and Bulk gets SPLATTERED in the face.  Bulk glares at
Skull, wipes some goop off, FLICKS it at Skull.

                              WIZARD
               Come on, come all -- it's an COZE
               FREE FOR ALL!

He smiles, revealing a glistening silver tooth.

40   thru   42   OMITTED

42A   EXT.  DULCEA'S MOUNTAINSIDE COMPLEX - DAY            42A

An oriental garden set against a stunning hillside vista.

43    EXT.  DULCEA'S CAMP / PHAEDOS - DAY                  43

The kids are seated on rocks by a lakeside, all of them
drinking from clay mugs.  Dulcea finishes handing out bowls.
Aisha stares into hers with a grim expression.

                              AISHA
               Is this... food!

                              DULCEA
               They're called squirbs.

Kimberly lifts out an EEL-LIKE CREATURE, and watches it SQUIRM
between her fingers.

                              KIMBERLY
               Mine seems to be a little
               undercooked.

Dulcea sprinkles hers with brown flakes.

                              DULCEA
               Add a few dried weevils and
               you'll never know the difference.

The other Rangers watch as Billy holds one of the squirbs over
his mouth and drops it in.  He chews a few times, lets out  a
BURP.

                              BILLY
               ... Not bad.
              
                              TOMMY
               Listen, we appreciate your
               hospitality, but we really don't
               have much time.

Dulcea looks to Tommy.

                              DULCEA
               What do you know of the Great
               Power?

                              KIMBERLY
               Only that we need it to defeat
               Ivan Ooze.

Dulcea's eyes move from Ranger to Ranger.

                              DULCEA
               It is said that to those who
               possess the Power... all things
               are possible.

                              BILLY
               Where did it originate?

                              DULCEA
               In another time, another
               dimension.  It was brought here
               long ago by the "Nathadians", a
               people who are now all but
               extinct.
               They built an impenetrable stone
               Monolith to store the power and
               keep it from their enemies.
                              (ominous)
               For thousands of years, beings
               from all over the Universe have
               tried to obtain it... ALL have
               perished.

Dulcea's words hang heavily in the air.

                              AISHA
               So how can we get to it?

                              DULCEA
               The only way to obtain the power
               is to achieve the highest state
               of being...

                              TOMMY
               And how do we do that?

                              DULCEA
               By learning the ancient art of
               Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of
               what you on earth have come to
               know as the Ninja.
                              (beat)
               It is the perfect union of mind,
               body and spirit.

                              ROCKY
               Look, Zordon doesn't have much
               longer to live.  And for all we
               know, Angel Grove could already
               be under attack.  We don't have
               TIME for this.

As Rocky is talking, a flubbery looking SNOUT works it's way
over Kimberly's shoulder.  She hasn't noticed it yet.

                              DULCEA
               You don't understand.  If you do 
               not have the Ninjetti, the power
               will destroy  you.
                              (beat)
               To reach the Monolith we must
               traverse the Neola jungle.  We
               will train today, and set out on
               foot tomorrow.

The snout works it's way underneath Kimberly's chin -- she
SCREAMS FOR ALL SHE'S WORTH.

INCLUDE - A TERRIFIED SNOGGLE.
 
This is Dulcea's ant-eater like assistant.   He jumps up and
down, YAMMERING and GESTICULATING.

                              SNOGGLE
               HNUGLHLU PHUNGLUMP BUGHLSMRPH
               GBUJIPHN HUPHLGMPNORU!!!

                              DULCEA
               Snoggle, you watch your language!

Snoggle now re-fills Aisha's tea-cup.

                              SNOGGLE
               Slnughyu buglhugrmrph?

                              AISHA
               Excuse me?

                              SNOGGLE
               Slnughyu buglhugrmrph?

                              DULCEA
               He wants to know if you'd like a
               cube of sugar in your tea.

                              AISHA
               Ah... sure.

We hear a PHOOT as Snoggle BLOWS A CUBE OF SUGAR OUT HIS SNOUT
AND IT SPLASHES INTO AISHA'S TEA.  Aisha stares at the cube a
moment.

                              AISHA
               Ah... thanks.

The other Rangers watch as Billy holds one of the squibs above
his mouth and drops it in.  He chews a few times, lets out a
BURP.

                              BILLY
               ... Not bad.

43A   EXT.  ANGEL GROVE LANE - DAY   (OLD SC 40)                43A

Night has fallen on Angel Grove.  We PAN ACROSS a quiet, middle-

43B   INT.  LIVING ROOM / KELMAN-RESIDENCE - DAY   (OLD SC 41)  43B

CLOSE ON - OOZE CONTAINER

We PULL BACK to reveal it's sitting on a table.

Mr Kelman enters, looks it over curiously.  He picks it up,
opens it and sticks his finger inside.

Suddenly a CRACKLING ELECTRICAL CURRENT RUNS OVER HIS ENTIRE
BODY.  His face goes blank and his eyes momentarily GLOWS     
PURPLE.  Now he strides purposefully out the door.

43C   thru   47   OMITTED                                         

48   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - DAY                   48

Dulcea and the Rangers are gathered around a bird-bath stand
with FLAMES leaping out of it.

                              DULCEA
               In the language of the
               Nathadians, "Nin" stands for
               "man", "jetti" stands for
               "animal".  Ninjetti  - man and
               animal, together as one.
                              (beat)
               Now, put your hands inside the
               flame.

                              AISHA
               Yeah, right.

                              DULCEA
               It will not harm you.

The kids hesitate a moment, then reluctantly put their hands
inside the flame.  Aisha makes a horrific expression...

                              AISHA
               Just kidding.

They remove their hands -- they're filled with sand.

                              AISHA
               Wow.  Sand.

                              DULCEA
               Now tell me... what do you see?

Aisha studies the sand for a moment -- it MAGICALLY TAKE ON
THE SHAPE OF A BEAR.

                              AISHA (bedazzled)
               I see... a bear

                              DULCEA
               Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart
               and bold.

                              AISHA
               Stylin'!

Dulcea turns to Rocky.  His sand MAGICALLY TAKES ON THE SHAPE
OF AN APE.

                              ROCKY
               I see... an Ape.

                              DULCEA
               Rocky, you are the Mighty Ape.

We see each of them DISCOVER THEIR ANIMAL.

                              BILLY
               I see... a fox

                              DULCEA
               Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf,
               cunning and swift.

And now Kimberly.  She studies hers for a moment.  It looks
like a bird.

                              KIMBERLY
               I think its some kind of bird.

                              DULCEA
               Kimberly, you are the Crane,
               agile and sublime.

Now Adam.

                              ADAM
               That's gotta be a frog.

                              DULCEA
               Adam, you are the Frog, quick as
               lightning.

And finally, Tommy.

                              TOMMY
               It's... an eagle?

                              DULCEA
               Look closer.
 
                              TOMMY
               ... A falcon?

                              DULCEA
               Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged
               Lord of the Sky.  

Kimberly regards Dulcea with true admiration.

                              KIMBERLY

               How do you know so much about the
               Ninjetti?

Dulcea stands tall and proud.

                              DULCEA
               I... am the sole living
               descendant of the "Nathadians".
                              (beat)
               Now prepare yourselves for the
               most intense physical and mental
               training known to man and animal.

Fred enters the living room and searches for his Dad.

He heaves a frustrated sigh.

48C   EXT.  KELMAN HOUSE  -  DAY    (OLD SC 46)                 48C

Fred comes outside as several KIDS approach, all of them
looking forlorn.

                              KID #1
               You seen my parents?

                              FRED
               I can't find my dad either.

                              KID #2
               What's going on?!

Suddenly a WILD KID wearing grunge clothes runs by HOWLING LIKE
A BANSHEE.  He's holding a container of ooze in one hand and a
baseball bat in the other.  He SMASHES a couple of trash  cans
with his bat.

                              WILD KID
               Ooze, ooze, ooze rules!!

The kid BASHES IN a mailbox then runs off.  Fred looks
startled.

                              FRED
               That guy was the student body

Kimberly and Snoggle observe as Dulcea walks ON HER HANDS
across a narrow bamboo log that spans a pond.  A waterfall
churns in the b.g.

               mind, body and spirit.

She leaps into the air, does a ROUND-HOUSE KICK, lands
perfectly on the narrow span.

                              KIMBERLY
               Awesome!

Dulcea reaches the end of the log, flips through the air lands    
flawlessly on the ground.

Kimberly heaves a sigh, climbs onto the bamboo and start
walking across, balancing precariously on her hands.

She gets about a quarter of the way, loses her balance, and
falls into the shallow pond.

Snoggle laughs, making a loud HONKING SOUND.  Kimberly
recovers, shoots him a look.

                              KIMBERLY
               Let's see you do it .

                              SNOGGLE (indignant)
               Ghun Phnug Gnouphl.

He marches to the pole, Dulcea holds him back.

                              DULCEA
               Snoggle, we don't have time for
               you to show off

52   thru   53   OMITTED

53A   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - DAY                  53A

Dulcea and Rocky are standing at the bottom of a twenty foot pole
with an exotic oriental carving

                              DULCEA
               The ape is strong, but more
               importantly it is flexible and
               free.

Dulcea now SCRAMBLES UP THE POLE WITH THE NIMBLENESS OF A
SPIDER.  In less than ten seconds she reaches the top.  Rocky
shakes his head in disbelief.

                              ROCKY
               Who is this lady?

Now she SLIDES DOWN like a firewoman, drops beside Rocky.  He
takes hold of the pole, focuses for a moment.

                              ROCKY
               Here goes!

It starts SCURRYING UPWARD.  He gets about fifteen feet in the
air, loses his grip, PLUMMETS AND SLAMS TO THE GROUND.

54A   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - DAY   (OLD SC 53)       54A

Dulcea and Billy circle one another, fighting with spinning      
WHISTLING sticks.

Dulcea is blindfolded, Billy isn't.                    

                              DULCEA
               The wolf relies on it's enhanced
               senses to guide it...  He can
               hear what we cannot hear, he can
               smell what we cannot smell.

Billy takes SWING after SWING -- Dulcea easily DEFLECTS every
blow.

Now Dulcea takes numerous SWINGS, THWACKING Billy repeatedly
and finally KNOCKING him INTO THE WATER.

54B   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - DAY                    54B

Dulcea, Adam and Snoggle stand in an area filled with FLYING
INSECTS.

                              DULCEA
               The frog remains still and silent
               while it assesses its target...
               then strikes out in the blink of
               an eye.

We hear a TRILLING SOUND as Dulcea watches some kind of insect
dart around her.

THWAP!  The TRILLING SOUND is gone.  Dulcea has literally
caught the insect in the blink of an eye.  Adam shakes his head
in disbelief.

He waits a moment, hears a TAT-TAT-TAT sound and watches a
insect zip around him.  He lashes out numerous times,
missing the insect completely.

THWUMP!  With lightning speed Snoggle VACUUMS the fly into his
snout.  CRUNCH, CRUNCH, CRUNCH.

Adam speaks under his breath.

                              ADAM
               Show off.

54C   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - DAY   (OLD SC 52)    54C

Aisha watches as Dulcea goes into a bear stance.

                           DULCEA
               The bear is sturdy as a towering
               tree.  Nothing can uproot it.

Snoggle CHARGES Dulcea, SLAMS INTO HER.  She remains as rooted
as a tree.  Snoggle meanwhile suffers some serious bodily
damage.

                              AISHA
               Girl, you've got to be kidding
               me.

Snoggle recovers and faces Aisha.  Aisha shrugs, goes into a
bear stance.  Snoggle charges, SLAMS INTO HER and sends HER
FLYING!

54F   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - DAY                  54F

Dulcea and Tommy are standing on a towering rock rising out of
a dark lake.

                              DULCEA
               The falcon never struggles with
               the air, but rather becomes one
               with it.

Now Dulcea does the impossible.  She LEAPS OFF THE ROCK, SOARS
FIFTY FEET through the air, AND LANDS on another protruding
rock.  Tommy is stunned.

                              DULCEA (calling out)
               JOIN WITH THE FORCES OF NATURE!

Tommy psyches himself up.

                              TOMMY
               You can do this.  You can do
               this.  You can do this...

He spreads his arms out, LEAPS... and DROPS LIKE A ROCK
exploding into THE BLACK WATER.

54G   INT.  COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT      (OLD SC 54E)     54G

Alpha fusses over Zordon, who is looking a good ten years older.

                              ZORDON
               ... Alpha, I am deeply concerned
               about the Rangers...

                              ALPHA 5
               I told them it was too dangerous,
               but they wouldn't listen.

                              ZORDON
               ... We must try to communicate
               with them.

Alpha looks out over the decimated Command Center.

                              ALPHA 5
               Perhaps if I could locate a
               vertical-deflector then I could
               assemble a holographic-comlink.

Zordon shudders in pain, closes his eyes.  Alpha watches over
his mentor, shakes his head in anguish.

                              ALPHA
               Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi .

55A   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - NIGHT                  55A

Dulcea leads the kids through a circular opening in one
wall, all of them look completely wiped out.  She reaches an
ornate doorway, faces the Rangers.

                              DULCEA
               Each of you must reach deep
               within and draw upon your natural
               instincts...  Only then will you
               know the way of the Ninjetti.
                              (beat)
               Rest for a few hours.  We will
               continue at daybreak.

She heads through the door.

                              KIMBERLY
               So where are we supposed to
               sleep?

Snoggle points to the campfire.

                              SNOGGLE
               Buhph nghujr.

He pushes Kimberly toward it making a "Na na na na na" sound
through his snout.  He then hurries inside and SLAMS the door.

                              KIMBERLY
               That guy's cruisin' for a
               bruisin'.

The kids approach the dying fire, all of them limping a little.

                              BILLY
               I can hardly walk...

                              AISHA
               I've never been this sore in my
               life.

They drop around the fire, a few of them GROANING.  They stare
into the orange coals for a long moment, all of them looking
disillusioned.

                              BILLY
               Do you guys really think we can
               pull this off?

It takes a moment to get a response.

                              ADAM
               Maybe if we had more time.

                              TOMMY  
               ... I wonder... We've been
               relying on our Morphin Powers for
               so long... maybe we've forgotten
               how to rely on ourselves.

There's a somber silence.

                              TOMMY
               We should get some rest.

They all settle in for the night.

55B   EXT.  INNER CITY CONSTRUCTION SITE  -  NIGHT  (OLD SC 47) 55B

A PURPLE HAZE OF SMOKE has settled on the construction site.
Suddenly, mysteriously, SWARMS OF ZOMBIFIED PARENTS emerge from
the vapors - We see Mr. Kelman amongst them.

Ivan steps forward, followed by Goldar.

                              IVAN
               Ladies and gentlemen, Simon
               says...  STOP!

All the parents stop.

                              IVAN
               Simon says... stand on one foot!

All the parents stand on one foot.  Ivan seems to be taking a
perverse glee in all this.

                              IVAN
               Simon says...

                              GOLDAR
               Quack like a'duck!

All the parents start QUACKING LIKE DUCKS.   Ivan slowly turns
to Goldar, gives him an icy stare.

                              GOLDAR
               It just slipped out.

Ivan turns back to the QUACKING parents.
     
                              IVAN
               SHUT UP!!

The parents keep quacking.

                              GOLDAR
               You didn't say "Simon says".

                              IVAN (irritated)
               Simon says SHUT UP!!!
 
(they shut up)
               Now, as soon as I give the word    
               I want all of you to start
               digging.
                              (beat)
               Do I make myself perfectly --

The zombie parents have already started going to work.  Ivan
shakes his head in exasperation.

                              IVAN
               This is the Iast time I use
               parents for anything!

55C   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - NIGHT             55C

The Rangers are fast asleep.  A night wind WHISTLES through the
trees, causing the branches to shiver.

After a moment, there's movement in the bushes.  Suddenly,
amazingly, a WOLF emerges -- his mane glistening in the

moonlight, his eyes GLOWING LIKE FIRE.

He surveys the sleeping clan, moves straight toward Billy.  He
stands inches away from him, watches him with an intense gaze.
Billy stirs slightly.

The embers cast an orange glow on Kimberly's sleeping face      
A SHADOW moves over her and two CRANE LEGS step into frame.

There's a FLURRY OF FLAPPING WINGS as a FALCON SWOOPS DOWN and
lands on a rock directly above Tommy.  The bird fixes on Tommy
with its piercing eyes.

We hear a GRUNTING SOUND as the SILHOUETTE OF AN APE APPEARS:

Now a FROG HOPS through the air and lands inches away from
Adam.  The frog sits there a moment, it's THROAT THROBBING

Now we hear a DEEP GROWL and a tree SHAKES.  Aisha fidgets in
her sleep as an ENORMOUS BEAR SHADOW FALLS OVER HER.

Now, all at once, the six animals VANISH INTO THIN AIR LIKE
SPIRITS OF THE NIGHT.

55D    EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT  (PART OLD SC 55B)     55D

Ivan and Goldar patrol the parents who are busy digging.

                              IVAN
               Let's pick it up here!  I've got
               a schedule to keep.  In twenty
               four hours the ooze is gonna hit
               the fan!

Goldar suddenly point to the sky.

                              GOLDAR
               Hey, boss!

THE TENGU DROPS INTO THE SCENE, SQUEALING

                              MORDANT
               What kind of landing was that?!
               These clowns are a menace to the
               sky

                              IVAN
               How did you fare?

Mordant waves Ivan off.

                              MORDANT
               Oh, it couldn't've gone better.
               The Power Rangers didn't know
               what hit them .

The Tengu appear, one of them SQUAWKS and makes grand gestures.

                              MORDANT
               That's right.  And then we threw
               one of them off a mountain and
               another one into a raqing river!

                              IVAN
               So they've been destroyed?

The Tengu SQUAWKS some more.

                              MORDANT
               "Basically".

                              IVAN
               What do you mean "basically"?

                              MORDANT
               Well... we were about to finish
               them off... when this huge
               monster came out of nowhere!

                              MORDANT
               Okay, maybe he wasn't so huge.
               But you should've seen the size
               of his STICKS

A pensive look comes over Ivan...

                              IVAN
               Did these sticks make a whistling
               sound?

                              MORDANT
               How'd you know?

                              IVAN
               Dulcea!
                              (beat)
               That miserable, manipulating
               loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!!

To help make the point Mordant SPITS on the ground.

                              IVAN
               How could you let them get away?!
               If Dulcea leads them to the Great
               Power, everything will be ruined!
               They must be OBLITERATED!

One of the Tengu SCREECHES again.

                              MORDANT
               What're you talking about?!  It
               wasn't my fault!  You're the
               featherbrains that let them get
               away!

Ivan looks up to the sky.

                              IVAN
               I call upon the Powers of
               Darkness to enrich the evil of my
               creatures by tenfold!

LIGHTNING RIPS from the sky and ZAPS THE TENGU, CAUSING THEM TO
GLOW RADIANTLY.

                              IVAN
               And now the coup de grace, to
               lead my tribe to victorious
               battle!

He shoots a BOLT OF ENERGY AND CREATES THE OUEEN TENGU!  She is
a different color than the rest and her eyes GLOW RED.  Mordant
shakes his head in wonder.

                              MORDANT
               Where does he come up with this
               stuff?

The Queen spreads her wings and makes the most HORRENDOUS
SCREECH imaginable.

                              IVAN
               Queen Tengu, lead-your warriors
               to Phaedos, FEAST YOURSELVES UPON
               THE POWER RANGERS AND BRING ME
               DULCEA!

Once again, the Tengu take to the sky like GIANT BATS.

CLOSE ON KIMBERLY

Snoggle's snout works it's way toward her making SNORTING
SOUNDS.

Kimberly bolts awake and SLAMS his snout with her fist.  She
YELPS LIKE A CHILD as he grips the protrusion and JUMPS
UP AND DOWN.

                              SNOGGLE
               BUGHU PHUNGL MURHPUGNU!!!

All the Rangers spring awake.  As they get out from under their
blankets they're shocked to discover that they're all wearing
Ninjetti costumes with animal symbols on their chest.

                              TOMMY
               How the heck?!...

                              ROCKY
               What's going on?!

                              KIMBERLY
               I don't believe it!

Dulcea approaches, a wondrous expression on her face.

                              DULCEA
               You have been visited by the
               animal spirits... they have given
               you their blessing.

The Rangers continue to admire their symbols in silent wonder.

55G   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - MORNING  (OLD SC 55E)   55G

MONTAGE

HARD DRIVING MUSIC KICKS IN.

1.  We see Aisha standing on a rock, her whole body flowing in
    a martial art exercise.

2.  Billy and Dulcea continue to fight with whistling sticks.
    Billy is starting to get the hang of it.  He hits Dulcea a few
    times, then she CLOBBERS him.

3.  Kimberly balances along the bamboo log again.  She does a
    FLIP and lands it, however one foot slips off and she struggles
    to maintain her balance.

4.  Tommy stands on the protruding rock again, spreads high
    like a falcon, SOARS THROUGH THE AIR.  He gets about ten feet
    then DROPS INTO THE WATER.

5.  Rocky climbs up the oriental pole -- this time he makes it
    up about FIFTEEN FEET before he slips.  He only drops five
    feet.

6.  Adam stands amidst overhanging trees and goes into his frog
    animal stance, his entire being focused on his actions.

7.  Billy stands off alone practicing with the whistling
    sticks.  The weapons are now a BLURR in his hands.

8.  Kimberly balances along the log, executes a FLIP, lands it
    perfectly, throws her arms up triumphantly.

9.  Adam stands on the lakeshore, cncentrating on a buzzing
    insect.  He strikes out at it, but  just misses it.

10.  Aisha also does something appropriate.

55H   EXT.  ANGEL GROVE PARK - DAY   (OLD SC 55F)       55H

HUNDREDS OF KIDS AND TEENAGERS fill the park, all of them
wearing PURPLE CLOTHES.  They're all dirty and grunged out
They jump around, breaking stuff, sparring with each other
It's total pandemonium.

Suddenly, an ERUPTION OF SMOKE -- and Ivan, disguised as the
wizard, MAGICALLY APPEARS.  The crowd CHEERS, Nuremburg style,
fists raised.

                              CROWD
               OOZE!  OOZE!  OOZE!  OOZE!

                              IVAN
               Thank you!  Please!  You're too
               kind.
                              (sotto voce)
               Finally. a little appreciation
               where it's deserved.

                              VOICE
               We love you Ivan!

                              IVAN
               Right back at ya!-
                              (he smiles)
               Now, WHO MISSES SCHOOL?!

                              CROWD
               NOT US!

                              IVAN
               AND WHO MISSES RULES?!

                              CROWD
               NOT US!

                              IVAN
               AND WHO WANTS TO JOIN ME IN
               RAISING HELL ACROSS  THE
               UNIVERSE?!

                              CROWD

               WE DO!

At the edge, Fred discreetly approaches Bulk and Skull.

                              FRED
               Can I have a word with you guys?
                              (he pulls them aside)
               What's really going on here?!
               Where are everybody's parents?

Bulk and Skull exchange a look.

                              SKULL
               Like we said before, that's
               classified, top secret...

Fred decides to be tricky.

                              FRED
               Look, Ivan wants me to go dump a
               load of garbage all over them.

                              BULK
               Well, why didn't you say so?!

                              SKULL
               They're at the World Center
               Construction Site.

Fred nods.

                              FRED
               Uh.   OOZE RULES!

He does a ridiculous mock salute.  Bulk and Skull repeat it.

                              BULK AND SKULL
               OOZE  RULES !                

Fred rolls his eyes and hurries away.

58    EXT.  JUNGLE / PHAEDOS - MORNING                         58

Dulcea leads Snoggle and the Rangers up a stone path.  They
approach a bush filled with exotic berries.  All of them start
eating the berries.

                              TOMMY
               Dulcea... how do you and Zordon
               know each other?


Dulcea reminisces.

                              DULCEA
               We belonged to an interstellar
               Peace Keeping Force known as the
               "Order of the Meledan".
                              (beat)
               Zordon was widely regarded as the
               finest Commander in the Galaxy.
               He was a true Legend... If it
               wasn't for him, the Universe
               would be a very different place                 
               from what it is today.

The kids are overwhelmed by what they're hearing.

                              ROCKY
               So...  what happened?
 
                              DULCEA
               Over time our enemies were
               defeated...  I returned to
               Phaedos, Zordon moved on to
               continue the struggle elsewhere.
                              (beat)
               Until you kids showed up, I
               hadn't heard from him for
               centuries.

The Rangers are silent for a moment.

                              DULCEA
               He was always an inspiration...

Dulcea speaks with grim-visaged intensity.

                              DULCEA
               This is why I'm taking you to the
               Nathadian Monolith.  That is why
               I'm teaching you the Ninjetti.
                              (beat)
               If Zordon dies... then a piece of
               all of us dies... and the force
               of good within the Universe will
               be dealt an irreparable blow.

These words strike deep in the kids.

59   EXT.  INNER CITY CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY                    59

The bulldozers and earth movers have dug out a twenty foot pit.
IVAN leads Goldar and Mordant through the site, passing dozens
of laboring parents.

                              MORDANT
               As soon as we've taken over the
               world I'm gonna change my name to
               Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR
               Mordant?!

                              GOLDAR
               How about Major Moron?

                              IVAN
               How about the two of you shut Up
               and pay attention!!

The entourage comes to a stop, Goldar and Mordant can't believe
what's before them.

                              MORDANT
               What is THAT!

INCLUDE - A HUGE MECHANICAL ARM AND LEG EXTRUDING FROM THE DIRT.

                              IVAN
               Feast your eyes upon the
               exoskeleton of the barbaric
               HORNITOR!
                              (to parents)
               KEEP DIGGING.  THE DREADFUL
               SCORPITRON SHOULD BE CLOSE BY.
                              (beat)
               ONCE I HAVE MY ECTO-MORPHICON
               MACHINES UP AND RUNNING, I SHALL
               ANNIHILATE ANGEL GROVE... AND
               THEN... THE WORLD

ANGLE ON FRED as he darts through the construction site, taking
care not to be seen.  He hunkers down behind a stack of
two-by-fours, searches the area.  He spots his dad, speaks under
his breath.

                              FRED
               Dad...?!

He glances around to make sure the coast is clear, then sprints
off to where his dad is digging, grabs his hand.

                              FRED
               We have to get out of here!

                              MR. KELMAN
               Dig... dig... dig...
 
                              FRED
               Dad?!... It's me, Fred!

Mr. Kelman just gives Fred a blank stare.

                              MR. KELMAN
               Dig... dig... dig...

Suddenly an ARM FALLS ON FRED'S SHOULDER.

                              MORDANT (O.S.)
               Gotchya!

Fred whips araund, finds Mordant standing behind him.     He
SPRINGS TO ACTION pulling off a lightning quick IRON HAMMER
FIST STRIKE, a PALM HEEL BLOCK, A FRONT KICK WITH JUMPING
KICK.

Mordant is getting pummeled.  The last kick sends him FLYING
BACK INTO THE DIRT.  Fred takes off as Goldar stands over
Mordant.

                              MORDANT
               Just shut your gap!

                              GOLDAR
               Did I say anything?

61   INT.  COMMAND CENTER - DAY                              61

Zordon is looking more decrepit than ever.  Alpha inserts
tube into a make-shift electronic contraption.

                              ALPHA 5
               By bouncing ultra-high
               frequencies off one of the
               network satellites, I can send a
               long-range pulsar signal to
               within TWO FEET of the Rangers
               coordinates.     

                              ZORDON
                              (with difficulty)
               ... I just pray we're not too
               late.

Alpha continues making adjustments.

                              ALPHA 5
               Let's give it a whirl.
      
He flicks a switch and the screen LIGHTS UP WITH STATIC.  The
the same reporter we saw at the opening of the movie appears.

                              REPORTER
               Angel Grove Police have been
               fielding hundreds of calls from
               concerned citizens as the number
               of missing gersons continues to
               grow 

There's more STATIC, then IVAN APPEARS AS THE WIZARD.

                              IVAN
               Hi, folks, Ivan Ooze here.

                              ALPHA 5
               Ai,  yi,  yi,  yi,  yi 

As Ivan speaks we see Mordant behind him waving into camera.

                              IVAN
               Are you bored with your work?
               Are you bored with your family
               Are you bored with your 1ife

The group reaches the crest of a ridge -- off in the background
we can see the outline of the Nathadian Monolith.

                              DULCEA
               The Monolith is there in the
               distance.

The kids strain to get a better look.

                              DULCEA
               This is as far as I can take you.

The kids are thrown by this.

                              KIMBERLY
               You're leaving us?!

                              DULCEA
               I have taught you all that I
               know.   Now you must achieve the
               Ninjetti on your own.

The kids share glances, not quite knowing what to say.

                              DULCEA
               It is said that once you've
               reached the power... you have
               only ten triacs to release it.

                              BILLY
               What's a Triac?

                              DULCEA
               About twenty seconds in your
               time.

                              TOMMY
               And how do we release the power?

                              DULCEA
               The legend goes that you release
               the power with the power.

                              ADAM
               What does that mean!

                              DULCEA
               That is a question that even I
               cannot answer.
                              (beat)
               Remember, ten triacs.  After that
               something bad will happen.

                              KIMBERLY
               Like...how bad?

Dulcea gives them a grim look.

                              DULCEA
               They say the power will throw off
               a super-heated, radioactive
               fireball, instantly reducing you
               to ash and bits of charred bone.

Aisha nods.

                              AISHA
               That's pretty bad.

                              TOMMY
               Thank you, Dulcea.  For
               everything.      

Dulcea catches her hand and six Rangers put their hands on top
of hers.

56   INT.  CHEMICAL PLANT - DAY                             66

The parents have finished assembling the STEEL TOWER -- thick
cables run from the base to the skeletal heads of Hornitor and    
Scorpitron.

We see a group of parents fastening clear plastic pipes to the
skeletal feet -- the pipes are attached to the vat of ooze.

Mordant videotapes Ivan as he struts past a giant mechanical
foot.

                              IVAN
               Finally, after centuries of
               waiting, my Ecto-Morphicon
               machines are ready to take on the
               world!

Mordant gets the camera a little too close to Ivan.

                              IVAN
               GET THAT THING OUT OF MY FACE!

Ivan SWATS Mordant and the camera FLIES up through the air and
SMASHES against a wall.

                              MORDANT
               Oh, man, that was a rental!

ANGLE ON - FRED watching from behind a generator, an alarmed look
on his face.  Ivan steps up onto a platform.

                              IVAN
               Mordant... let the ooze flow!

Mordant pulls a lever and the OOZE SLITHERS THROUGH THE 
PIPES AND STARTS FILLING OUT THE GIANT EXOSKELETONS.

                              IVAN
               Goldar... the roof!

Goldar presses a button and the roof of the plant ROLLS OPEN,
REVEALING THE TUMULTUOUS SKIES ABOVE.

                              IVAN
               Looks like a fine day for raising
               HELL!

Ivan holds his arms up to the heavens.

                              IVAN
               HECALE MENNIPUS LIBRI MAGUS!

               LIFE!!  Give my creatures LIFE!

Mordant admires Ivan.

                              MORDANT
               This guy is the King!

Now the most amazing thing of all happens...

The SCINTILLATING BEHEMOTHS AWAKE FROM THE DEAD, THEIR EYES AND
MOUTHS OPENING, THEIR ARMS REACHING UPWARD.  The beasts ROAR    
OUT IN THUNDEROUS RAGE.

Mordant's HAIR LITERALLY STANDS ON END -- he quickly retreats
behind a drum.

FRED looks on in horror.

                              IVAN
               PARENTS OF ANGEL GROVE.

All of them turn their attention to Ivan.

               YOU HAVE SERVED YOUR PURPOSE.
               NOW YOU WILL RETURN TO THE
               CONSTRUCTION SITE AND LEAP TO
               YOUR DEMISE!      

The parents just stand there with blank expressions.

                              IVAN
               What're you waiting for??...

Goldar taps him on the shoulder and he spins around.

                              IVAN
               What!

                              GOLDAR
               You forgot to say 'Simon says."

Ivan shakes his head dismally.

67   EXT.  ROPE BRIDGE -  DAY                              67

The Rangers crest a hill and Adam, who's in the lead, suddenly
drops down - the others following suit.

They peer over the ridge -- their eyes wide.

Before them, a tenuous rope bridge leads to a vast rock landing.
The ocean RAGES BELOW.

On top of the island is the Nathadian Monolith.  It's a  mind-
boggling wonder from another time and place.

Between the Rangers and the bridge, the Tengu Warriors are on
patrol.

                              KIMBERLY
               Man, these are the last guys I
               wanted to see.

                              AISHA
               Whadda we do now?

Kimberly surveys the area.

                              BILLY
               That's the only way to the
               Monolith...

                              ROCKY
               We can take these guys!

Tommy pulls all of them into a huddle.

68   EXT.  ROPE BRIDGE -  DAY                                  68

The Tengu are on full alert.  One of them hears something,
snaps around, there's nothing there.

Another Tengu looks down as a frog hops between his leg.  He
SCREECHES and STOMPS down his taloned foot, missing the     
creature by inches.

We hear a CAW and the Queen Tengu squints as she spots a falcon
circling in the sky above.  The Queen is perched on top of a 20
foot rock face. She looks around hesitantly.

Now the Rangers ATTACK, some of them LUNGING OFF ROCKS, others
BURSTING out of crevices, others coming over the walls.

Billy wields his WHISTLING sticks -- misses several times, then
starts BASHING and THWACKING the feathered beasts.

The Queen SHOOTS A LASER BLAST from her eyes -- it EXPLODES
before Tommy.

Kimberly battles another Tengu and the creature forces her back
on to the rickety bridge.

The Queen FIRES ANOTHER BLAST.

                              ROCKY
               LOOK OUT!

Rocky DIVES, knocking Aisha away from the bolt.

Adam and one of the Tengu circle each other warily.

                              ADAM
               The frog silently assesses its
               target, then strikes out...

Suddenly the Tengu is HURTLED BACKWARD TEN FEET THROUGH THE
AIR.  We didn't even see Adam move.

                              ADAM
               ... in the blink of an eye.

Tommy steps up behind a Tengu.

                              TOMMY
               Yo, Tweety!

The Tengu turns around and Tommy WHALLOPS HIM WITH A SPINNING-
HEEL KICK.  A Tengu faces down Aisha and she goes into a bear
stance.

                              AISHA
               The bear is sturdy as a towering
               tree.  Nothing can uproot it.

The Tengu CHARGES LIKE A BULL, SLAMS INTO AISHA.  She holds
fast and the bird EXPLODES INTO A CLOUD OF FEATHERS.

                              AISHA
               Bye, bye birdy.

Kimberly continues balancing precariously on the bridge as she
EXCHANGES BLOWS with her foe.

She finally drops into a crane stance... then just like Dulcea
she LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR, EXECUTES A BRUTAL SPINNING HELL KICK
and sends the birdman TUMBLING OFF THE BRIDGE.

In a movement that seems to defy gravity, she lands perfcctly
back on the swinging bridge.

                              KIMBERLY
               Hasta la Pasta, Bigbird!

Billy swings his sticks, BASHES one of the Tengu in the beak --
the creature EXPLODES INTO A CLOUD OF FEATHERS!

                              BILLY
               AIM FOR THEIR BEAKS!

Tommy reaches the top of a rack.  He sees a Tengu making a
KAMIKAZE DIVE TOWARD KIMBERLY.  TOMMY DIVES, SOARING THIRTY
FEET THROUGH THE AIR -- HE INTERCEPTS THE TENGU AND THEY SPIN
TOWARD EARTH TOGETHER.  They HIT the ground and EXCHANGE BLOWS
AS THEY FALL OVER ONE ANOTHER.

Rocky SLAMS another Tengu in the beak, KABLAM  -- the creature
is OBLITERATED.

Tommy LEAPS INTO THE AIR, NAILS two Tengu in the beaks.  They
BOTH BURST IN AN EXPLOSION OF FEATHERS.

The Queen shoots another BOLT OF ENERGY --  a rock EXPLODES,
SHOWERING THE KIDS WITH SHRAPNEL.  Aisha turns to Rocky.

                              AISHA
               It's up to you.

Rocky takes a deep breath, goes into a crouch position.
Incredibly he SCALES THE WALL IN THE SAME WAY HE WENT UP THE
POLE.  HE FLIPS OVER THE TOP and lands right before the Queen
Tengu.  He looks her dead in the eye.

                              ROCKY
               Polly wanna cracker?

With that, he executes a devastating SPINNING-HEEL KICK and the
Queen BURSTS INTO OBLIVION.

                              KIMBERLY
               ALL RIGHT, ROCKY!

Instantly, the remaining Tengu retreat, SQUAWKING and CAWWING  in
rage.  The kids turn to eaeh other, sharing in a moment of triumph.

                              ADAM
               WE DID IT!!


72   EXT.  ANGEL GROVE TOWER - DAY                               72

We're on top of a high tower overlooking the entire city
There's a BURST OF PURPLE SMOKE -- Ivan, Mordant and Goldar
appear.  Ivan looks out on the city, holds up his arms
theatrically.

                              IVAN
               ANGEL GROVE... I'D LIKE TO
               INTRODUCE YOU TO A COUPLE OF MY
               NEAREST AND DEAREST FRIENDS...
               HORNITOR!

HORNITOR APPEARS on the street ROARING like a fiend.  His
enormous foot DROPS DOWN AND CRUSHES A CAR INTO OBLIVION.

                              IVAN
               And his trimetallic partner in
               crime... SCORPITRON!!

SCORPITRON APPEARS on the street and BASHES IN THE SIDE OF A
BUILDING, SENDING GLASS AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE.

                              IVAN
               THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!

                              GOLDAR
               GO IVAN!!

Mordant turns to Ivan and throws his arms up in jubilation.

                              MORDANT
               LONG LIVE THE BOOGER MAN!

73   INT. COMMAND CENTER - DAY                                   73

Zordon, now barely alive, watches as Alpha makes more
adjustments to his contraption.

                              ALPHA 5
               That should do it.  we won't be
               able to hear them, but they
               SHOULD be able to hear us.
                              (beat)
               Here goes.
             
There's STATIC and then we see the reporter again.

                              NEWS REPORTER
               ... the Mayor has declared a
               state of emergency and asked that
               the city be immediately
               evacuated.  He has reiterated the
               need for everyone to remain calm.

We see images of PEOPLE SCREAMING THEIR GUTS out as they
CLAMBER PAST CAMERA.

                              NEWS REPORTER
               Angel Grove has never before
               known such a crisis and we can
               now only pray for the swift
               arrival of the Power Rangers!

                              ALPHA 5
               Ay, yi, yi, yi!

Zordon speaks in a whisper.

                              ZORDON
               ... Alpha, keep trying!

75A    EXT.  MONOLITH - DAY                                      75A

The kids climb up on top of the rock bluff -- before them is a
huge black Monolith.  There's all sorts of charred bones and
skeletons strewn around it, some of them human, some of them
alien.

They approach the massive block, stand before it in awe struck
silence.  In the middle of the Monolith there's a large circle
with the six animals of the Ninjetti carved into it.

                              ROCKY
               ... The Nathadian Monolith...

Kimberly looks at all the bones -- instinctively puts her hand
on her animal symbol.

                              KIMBERLY
               I guess these guys weren't so
               lucky.

A few of the kids walk around the Monolith, examining it more
closely.

                              AISHA
               We've come all this way for a
               rock wall?!

                              BILLY
               There should be a way to open it.

Billy &;Tommy latch their hands over the block, searching for
an opening.

                              BILLY
               ... Nothing.

                              ROCKY
               Release the power with the power.

Rocky steps back, THROWS HIS SHOULDER into the Monolith with a
THUMP, winces in pain.

                              AISHA
               Not that kind of power.

The kids exchange discouraged looks.

                              BILLY
               ... There has to be something
               we're missing.

The kids look crestfallen.

                              ROCKY
               It can't end like this...

Suddenly a SIZZLE OF ELECTRICITY forms in front of them.

                              KIMBERLY
               What NOW!

The kids mouth's fall open as... a HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGE OF
ZORDON'S WITHERED FACE APPEARS.  He speaks in a barely
audible voice.

                              ZORDON
               Rangers... Ivan has invaded the
               city... time is running out...

Zordon's image FLICKERS a few times then STABILIZES again.

                              ZORDON
               Each of you are now in possession
               of miraculous skills... but only
               when the six become one will you
               have the strength to harness the
               Great Power.

His IMAGE FLICKERS then FADES AWAY.

                              KIMBERLY
               ZORDON!!

Billy studies the circle with zealous eyes.

                              TOMMY
               Six become one... the combined
               forces of the Ninjetti.

                              ROCKY
               Strength in numbers!!

They silently assemble in a line, all of them interlock:
hands.  They face the Monolith with fire in their eyes.

                              BILLY
               I am the wolf, cunning and swift!

                              KIMBERLY
               I am the crane, agile and
               sublime!

                              AISHA
               I am the bear, stalwart and bold!

                              ADAM
               I am the frog, quick as
               lightning!

                              ROCKY
               I am the mighty ape!

                              TOMMY
               And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord
               of the Sky!

                              RANGERS
               WE... ARE THE NINJETTI!!!

A mysterious HALO OF LIGHT SHROUDS the Rangers and they dissapear
INTO THIN AIR.

75B   OMITTED                                                    75B

75C   INT.  MONOLITH - DAY                                       75C

The kids BURST THROUGH A WALL OF LIGHT and come down together
inside a vast cavern.  There's a pyramid shaped steel object in
the center of the room, a RADIANT LIGHT SHINING FROM IT.

                              AISHA
               What HAPPENED?!

                              ADAM    
               Where are we?!

                              BILLY
               Of course!  The power is of
               another world.  Another
               dimension.

                              KIMBERLY
               WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE
               TOAST!!

                              ROCKY
               That's twenty seconds!!

The kids advance toward the pyramid.

                              TOMMY
               Release the power WITH the power.

                              AISHA
               What does that mean?!

Adam notices their symbols are glowing.

                              BILLY
               Our SYMBOLS.

The kids ogle the radiant emblems.  Kimberly takes hold of hers
and it COMES OFF in her hand -- there's a mirror on the other
side.

                              ROCKY
               Ten seconds and counting!!

                              KIMBERLY
               It's some kind of mirror!

Kimberly looks at her reflection and primps her hair.  The
other's remove their symbols.

                              AISHA
               Release the power with the
               power.

                              BILLY
               I've got it!  We use the mirrors
               to reflect the light back into
               itself!!

                              ROCKY
               THREE SECONDS!!

                              TOMMY
               LET'S DO IT!?

All of them turn their mirrors toward the pyramid.  A BEAM OF
LIGHT SHOOT FROM THE POWER; INTO THE MIRRORS AND BACK IN TO THE
POWER.
 
We hear a RUMBLING SOUND as the earth starts to SHAKE.  The
Rangers look to each other, horrified.

Then everything falls still and silent... and then a miracle
happens.

We hear a HARMONIOUS, OTHERWORLDLY CHORUS as the pyramid OPENS
UP, REVEALING THE MOST GLORIOUS SOURCE OF LIGHT IN THE
UNIVERSE.

The kids shield their eyes from the brilliance, all of them
wearing wonder-struck expressions.

SIX BEAMS OF COLORED LIGHT SHOOT OUT AND HIT EACH OF THE
RANGERS...  AND THEIR POWER RANGERS UNIFORMS MATERIALIZE ON
THEM!  Their visors are clear so we can see their faces.

                              TOMMY
               WE HAVE THE GREAT POWER!!

Now the symbols in their hands TRANSFORM INTO...

                              ROCKY
               NEW POWER COINS!!

                              BILLY
               OUR MORPHERS ARE ON LINE!

                              AISHA.
               WE DID IT!!

                              ADAM
               HANG ON, ANGEL GROVE.

                              KIMBERLY
               WE'RE ON OUR WAY!

They hit their communicators -- they instantly TRANSFORM INTO
SIX IRIDESCENT COLUMNS OF COLOR AND BLAST OFF.

75D   EXT.  MOUNTAIN SIDE / PHAEDOS - DAY                        75D

Dulcea and Snoggle watch as the COLUMNS OF COLOR streak away
from the planet, leaving behind a RAINBOW with the six colors
of the Power Rangers.

               Great Power of the Ninjetti!

76   EXT. GEORGE STREET  -  NIGHT     (OLD SC 75B)               76

We see the mass of parents as they march intently down a dark
city street.

76A   EXT.  ANGEL GROVE PARK - ERNIE'S  -  NIGHT  (OLD SC 64)    76A

Ernie's is packed with crazed kids and teenagers who are
ripping the place apart.

Bulk and Skull watch while gorging themselves on pizza.

                              BULK
               There goes the neighborhood.

                              SKULL
               A real shame.

Suddenly Fred appears and shouts out.

                              FRED
               EVERYBODY, LISTEN UP!

The place falls silent.

                              FRED
               You've been brainwashed!  This
               Ivan is no Wizard.  He's some
               kind of DEMON!

                              KID #4
               Shut up, squirt.

                              KID #3
               You can't talk that way about our
               leader.

Enraged, they move in on Fred.

                              FRED
               You gotta believe me -- he's
               EVIL!

The crowd gets angrier.  They move closer... Fred gulps with
fear... glancing around for help, he notices a HOSE.  He lunges
for it, cranks on the water, and TURNS IT ON THE CROWD!
SPLASH!  They get SPRAYED DOWN!

Suddenly -- they stop in their tracks, slowly blinking,
confused.  The spell is broken.  We hear: "What's going on ?!"
"What am I doing here?!", etc.

                              FRED
               Listen to me!  Our parents are in
               danger!  If we don't help them
               they're going to be killed!

He hurries off.  A few follow him, then a few more... until
pretty soon everybody joins him.  Bulk and Skull share a look.

                              SKULL

               What about the pizza?

Bulk considers the dilemma.

                              BULK
               We could take it with us.

Skull nods, relieved.  They gather up the pizza and move off
after the others.

78    INT.  COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT                               78

The Rangers MATERIALIZE in the Command Center with their
helmets off.

                              AISHA
               ALPHA?!

Alpha approaches, speaks in an anguished voice.

                              ALPHA 5
               Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too
               late.

                              AISHA
               What?!

                              ALPHA 5
               Zordon...  he's gone.

The Rangers are too stunned to speak.  They approach Zordon's
lifeless form looking absolutely devastated.

                              KIMBERLY
               ... This can't be...

They stare at Zordon with gut-wrenching expressions.  They're
utterly defeated.

Eventually, Tommy looks to the others and speaks in a fervent
voice.

                              TOMMY
               "To those who possess the Great
               Power...   all things are
               possible."

The kids gradually exchange zealous looks.  They form a circle
around Zordon and interlock hands.

They close their eyes, bow their heads...

After a long moment, a SHIMMERING ENERGY BEGINS TO FLOW DOWN
FROM THE RANGERS, INTO ZORDON'S ASTRAL FORM.

Zordon grows BRIGHTER and BRIGHTER and then there's a DAZZLING,
STROBOSCOPIC EXPLOSION.

When the LIGHT FADES WE SEE THE COMMAND CENTER BACK IN ITS
ORIGINAL, PRISTINE FORM.

Zordon's youthful face once again looks down from within his
pillar of light, his eyes filled with a fierce pride.

                              RANGERS
               ZORDON!!

                              ZORDON
               Welcome back, kids.

                              ADAM
               It's good to be back.

Alpha jumps up and down like a child.

                              ALPHA 5
               HE'S ALIVE!  HE'S ALIVE!

                              KIMBERLY
               We thought you...

                              ZORDON
               It's good to see you again, too.

Alpha sees the Ecto-Morphicon machines on the VIEWING GLOBE.

                              ALPHA  5
               AI, YI, YI, YI, YI   Ivan s Ecto-
               Morphicon machines are leveling
               the city!

                              ROCKY
               We've got news for you, Ivan...

                              TOMMY
               The Power Rangers are BACK IN
               BUSINESS!!

They TELEPORT out.

79   EXT.   ANGEL GROVE TOWER - NIGHT                            79

CLOSE ON IVAN as he TURNS INTO CAMERA, a startled look on his face.

                              IVAN

               I... SMELL...

He looks down on the street as the COLUMNS OF LIGHT SHOOT DOWN
AND THE POWER RANGERS APPEAR.

                              IVAN
                              (outraged)
               POWER RANGERS!

80   EXT.  CITY STREETS                                          80

The Rangers watch as Hornitor and Scorpitron come THUNDERING
down the street toward them.

                              KIMBERLY
               What're THOSE?!

We hear Alpha on Tommy's wrist communicator.

                              ALPHA 5  (V. 0.)
               Rangers, call for your new animal
               Zords!

                              TOMMY
               Let's DO it!

One after another they click their new coins into their
morphers and go into their stances.

                              KIMBERLY
               NINJA CRANE ZORD!

                              BILLY

                              TOMMY
               NINJA FALCON ZORD!

From the sky, the six new ANIMAL ZORDS BURST FORTH LIKE
THUNDERING, MECHANICAL GODS.  The Rangers look up at the
TOWERING ASSAULT VEHICLES in awe.

81   INT.   COCKPITS                                             81

We see VARIOUS SHOTS of the Rangers DROPPING INTO their
respective cockpits.

81A   EXT.  MONORAIL STATION - NIGHT   (OLD SC 69)               81A

Fred, Bulk and Skull watch a sleek monorail pulling in.  Skull
talks with a mouth full of pizza.

                              SKULL
               Look, kid, I don't think you
               realize who you're dealing with.

                              FRED
               I don't think he realizes who
               HE'S dealing with.

The train glides to a complete stop and the doors SLIDE OPEN .

                              FRED
               EVERYBODY ON BOARD!

The youngsters pile through the doors, quickly filling up the
entire monorail.

81B   EXT.  CITY STREET                                          81B

The parents round a corner, advance down the street like machines.

82    EXT.   THE ECTO-MORPHICON MACHINES                         82

ATTACK WITH A RELENTLESS FEROCITY.  There's all kinds of
CRASHING and BASHING and EXPLOSIONS!

There's a BLAM, BLAM, BLAM as Scorpitron REPEATEDLY FIRES his
cannon arm at the Bear Zord, who in turn DEFLECTS THE VOLLEYS.

Hornitor shoots a BLAST from it's stinger, the Crane Zord
dodges the FIERY ERUPTION.

                              KIMBERLY (V. O.)
               Nice try,  Pinhead!

Scorpitron repeatedly KICKS at the Frog Zord with it's BLADED
FEET, SENDING UP OSCILLATORY DISCHARGES, at the same time
SLASHING WITH IT'S LETHAL CLAWS.

                              ADAM  (V. O.)
               Somebody back me up, here!

Hornitor BORES IT'S DRILL ARM INTO THE APE ZORD, SENDING
EXPLOSIONS OF SPARKS.

                              ROCKY  (V. O.)
               These things are FEROCIOUS!

The Bear Zord CHARGES HORNITOR and the two Mastodons go
CRASHING BACKWARD.

                              AISHA  (V.O.)
               The bear kicks butt!

Hornitor SEARS the Wolf Zord with it's needle-nose.  In
retaliation, the Wolf Zord POUNCES, KNOCKING HORNITOR INTO THE
STREET.  Now the Falcon Zord SWOOPS THROUGH THE AIR.

                              TOMMY  (V.O.)
               Heads up!

He FIRES BOOSTER ROCKETS, STRAFING SCORPITRON WITH AN INTENSE
FUSILLADE.

Hornitor gets back up -- the Ape Zord SWINGS DOWN FROM
BILLBOARD, RAMS HIM FEET FIRST, SENDS HIM CATAPULTING BACK.

                              ROCKY  (V.O.)
               Hope you've got a good mechanic.

Scorpitron FIRES A VOLLEY at the Frog Zord -- the Zord BOUNDS
THROUGH THE AIR, AVOIDING THE BLAST, COMES CRASHING DOW ON TOP
OF SCORPITRON.

The Falcon Zord swoops in and blasts Scorpitron who BLOWS UP
INTO A BILLION FLAMING PARTICLES!

                              KIMBERLY (V.O.)
               WE GOT HIM!!

                              IVAN
                              (outraged)
               These brats are ruining
               EVERYTHING!

Mordant and Goldar watch popeyed as IVAN'S BODY STRETCHES OUT
LIKE A HUGE PIECE OF GUM.

He STRETCHES and STRETCHES until his head BURSTS THROUGH THE
STOMACH OF SCORPITRON.

We hear a resounding SNAP AS IVAN'S FEET ARE RELEASED FROM THE
ROOFTOP AND HIS ENTIRE BEING SPURTS INSIDE THE GIANT'S BELLY.

Now there's all sorts of GURGLING and SLURPING sounds as the
monster's face SHAPE-SHIFTS INTO IVAN'S FACE!

He grins, revealing his silver tooth.

                              IVAN
               Let's TANGO!

                              TOMMY  (V.O.)
               We need Ninja MEGAZORD POWER,
               NOW!

There's amazing PYROTECHNICS AS FIVE ANIMAL ZORDS MERGE
TOGETHER AND TRANSFORM INTO THE NINJA MEGAZORD.

82A   INT.  COMMAND CENTER                                       82A

little jig.

There's plenty of GRINDING and SCRAPING as the MEGAZORD RISES
UP TO ITS FULL, TOWERING HEIGHT.

                              BILLY  (V.O.)
               All systems go!

                              KIMBERLY (V.O.)
               This guy is messing with the
               wrong teenagers!

The behemoths CHARGE each other and the mother of all battles
begins.

The battle continues.  Remarkably, these enormous machines pull
off DOUBLE PUNCHES, DROP KICKS, ROUNDHOUSE HOOKS, SPINBACK
KICKS -- YOU NAME IT!

                              KIMBERLY  (V.O.)
               ENGAGING KNUCKLE ROCKETS!

BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM -- The Megazord STRAFES Ivan/Scorpitron
with EXPLODING MISSILES.

                              IVAN/COLOSSUS
               Don't make me LAUGH!

Ivan/Scorpitron SINGES the Megazord with a DEVASTATING LASER
BLAST, SENDING IT TUMBLING BACKWARD.

                              RANGERS  (V.O.)
               WHOOOAAAHH!!

The Falcon Zord SWOOPS IN, STRAFING Ivan/Scorpitron with
gunfire.  Ivan/Scorpitron now turns to Angel Grove Tower and
grabs hold of it.

88   EXT.   TOWER                                                88

Mordant grabs on to Goldar.

                              GOLDAR
               I'm outta here.

                              MORDANT
               Wait for me!

Goldar TAKES FLIGHT with Mordant CLINGING DESPERATELY TO ONE OF
HIS LEGS.

                              GOLDAR
               GET OFF ME!

                              MORDANT
               BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!

                              GOLDAR
               SECOND COUSIN, THREE TIMES
               REMOVED.  NOW  GET OFF ME!

89   EXT.  MAIN STREET                                           89

Ivan/Scorpitron RIPS THE TOWER OUT AND USES IT AS A SWORD TO
BATTLE THE MEGAZORD.

                              IVAN/SCORPITRON
               UN GARDE!

The giant SWINGS THE TOWER, BATTERING THE MEGAZORD MERCILESSLY.

                              ROCKY  (V.O.)
               POWER SWORD, NOW!

The POWER SWORD DROPS FROM THE HEAVENS, PIERCES THE GROUND.
Megazord grips the handle, raises it to the sky.

                              ADAM (V.O.)
               HIGH POWER ENGAGE!

The sword is STRUCK BY THUNDERBOLTS and now the behemoths SLASH
and PARRY WITH CATACLYSMIC BURSTS OF SPARKS.

Ivan/Scorpitron takes a swing and the TOWER SMASHES INTO
MONORAIL, SHATTERING A TWENTY FOOT SECTION OF AN OVERPASS

Ivan/Scorpitron continues backing the Megazord toward an
enormous power station.

                              IVAN/SCORPITRON
               Time to recharge your batteries,
               FLOWER Rangers!

He takes a final, DEVASTATING BLOW, SENDS MEGAZORD HURTLING
THROUGH THE AIR AND DOWN INTO GIANT GENERATORS.

There's an APOCALYPTIC FIREWORKS DISPLAY AS TEN MILLION VOLTS
COURSE THROUGH MEGAZORD.

               OUR SEMI-CONDUCTORS ARE DOWN!

IVAN PICKS UP THE PROSTRATE MEGAZORD, RAISES IT OVER HIS HEAD AND THROWS
IT.

                             IVAN/COLOSSUS
               NEXT STOP, ANGEL GROVE FIRST
               NATIONAL!

He HURTLES THE MEGAZORD INTO A BUILDING with a sign that
"Angel Grove First National Bank".  The ENTIRE SIDE OF THE
BUILDING IS DEMOLISHED.

                              TOMMY (V.O.)
               One more blow like that and we're

up at the stormy skies.

There's more SLURPING and BUBBLING AS HIDEOUS, BAT-LIKE WINGS

The wings FAN OUT and Ivan/Colossus DIVES INTO THE AIR AND
SOARS UP INTO THE HEAVENS.

LUMINESCENCE and GLORIOUS WINGS SPREAD OUT FROM IT'S BACK.

Fred, Bulk, Skull and the entourage of kids come rushing toward

Zedd and Rita are now half-buried in snow, both of them blue in
the face.  As usual, Rita is ranting away.

                              RITA
               You call yourself a hell-hound?!
               A basset hound is more like it.
               If you were a real outlaw you
               would've gotten me out of this

Zedd shakes his head in misery.

               This is the last time I marry a
               witch.

Zedd and Rita react as they see Ivan/Colossus and Megazord
shooting out into the stars.

Fred is standing beside the water truck holding a large hose
Bulk and Skull are in the truck cabin trying to start the
engine.  It turns over but it won't catch.

                              FRED
               Come on!  Come on!

The parents are now five feet from the drop off.
Bulk turns the key again and the engine starts up.

                              FRED
               All right!

He LETS IT RIP -- A POWERFUL JET OF WATER ARCS THROUGH THE AIR
AND SHOWERS DOWN ON THE PARENTS.

They're about a foot away from the drop when they come to a
standstill, all of them sharing confused looks.

There's all sorts of CHEERS as parents and kids are reunited.
Fred runs into his father's arms.

                              FRED
               DAD!!

Bulk turns to Skull, holds out his arms.
