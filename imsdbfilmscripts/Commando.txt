          BLACK SCREEN. One word explodes towards us with cold
          brutality: COMMANDO. It FADES... leaves us in darkness.
          And we HEAR a growing ROAR... a frightening RUMBLE.

          TIGHT ON the churning compactor of a garbage truck.
          The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we SEE the truck, battered
          and olive-grey. A bored garbage man with a kerchief
          over his mouth hangs on the back of the truck as it
          moves along the street.

          end of the long driveway.
          Lawson flings the green plastic bags into two battered
          and half-full metal cans, starts running down the
          driveway.

          stumbles his way towards it, smiles.

          COOKE -- The man behind the truck -- pulls an Ingram
          submachine gun INTO VIEW. At the same moment, the cab
          of the garbage truck is kicked open and DIAZ, the
          driver, leans out, similarly armed.

                         COOKE
          Don't worry-we won't.
          And they cut Lawson down, the bullets raking across his
          body and the cans.

                         LONG SHOT 7
          Lawson falls back, spread-eagled. The garbage cans,
          pierced and leaking, roll TOWARD THE CAMERA, blocking
          our view just as Cooke moves close to administer a
          coup de grace.

          closing the trunk of a big new Cadillac. He's showing

          Forrestal continues the hype.

          That's power-that's performance

          Forrestal has said this last because Diaz has thrown
          the car into reverse, knocking down a big display.

          Diaz slams the car into forward, hits the accelerator
          and ROARS across the display room floor.
          The car SLAMS into Forrestal, flinging his body across
          the hood. The car continues on, CRASHES through the
          outside window and disappears down the street.

          This is COLONEL JOHN ALEXANDER MATRIX. He's in his
          mid-thirties ...a man of raw power and vitality...and
          something else: Joy. Joy, and a sense of calm.
          Matrix reaches a shed behind the cabin. He puts down
          the log and chain saw, then picks up firewood and begins
          to SPLIT it with awesome single swipes of an axe.

          and jimmies...he gets away with this twice before she

          The two young soldiers with him are HARRIS and JACKSON.

          Jenny comes out of the cabin toward the two men.

          Matrix gives her a sharp look and Jenny grudgingly goes
          back inside. Kirby and Matrix begin to walk as clouds
          billow high above the mountaintops around them.

          before machine gun fire BLASTS the cabin. The VOLLEY

          a round in the shoulder, SPINS to the ground, then

          He races to the shed, unlocks it, goes inside to a
          high-tech cabinet and opens it.
          Inside is an H&K assault rifle, two big banana clips of
          ammunition and a Baretta JS pistol. Matrix pulls
          the weapons out and readies them.

          one hand on the wheel, the other on the door frame, he
          begins to push the car.
          He steers it not towards the dirt road, but towards the
          shoulder where a steep incline leads downward. Since
          the Blazer is pointed the wrong way, Matrix is pushing
          it uphill-the effort is incredible... the veins on his
          neck stand out...with a SCREAM, he puts everything he's
          got into it... and finally it begins to roll downwards.
          Matrix leaps in. Snaps on the driver's shoulder belt...
          reaches over and wraps the passenger belt around his
          body as well.

          wrestle him to the ground. He forces his way up again, the
          three men still all over him.

          dance and mingle about. Sully can dig this scene --
          he puts his dark glasses back on. He sits at a
          table, puts the briefcase next to his leg and orders
          a drink.
          A LATIN MAN wearing a leisure suit, looking completely
          out of place in a joint like this, enters the bar, and
          stares at a girl with purple hair.
          He continues into the bar, catches Sully's eye and
          sits down at the table with him. He reaches under the
          table and slides the briefcase away from Sully until
          its next to himself, then hands Sully, still under the
          table, a bunch of passports.

           Matrix swerves the Sunbeam at the last moment, just
          grazes by the truck, and keeps going.
          Cindy has slid down in her seat and covered her face
          with her hands. She now opens her fingers, peeks
          through, then lowers her hands. She looks at Matrix.

          He REVS the engine, bringing the car right up behind
          Sully, and RAMS it against the back of Sully's
          Corvette. BAM!
          They swerve around another curve. Matrix brings the
          car up close again. Sully half glances back and
          fires a wild shot.

          BLAM!
          The windshield on the Sunbeam SPLINTERS. Matrix
          floors the car and completely SMASHES it into the back
          of Sully's car. WHAM!
          Sully's car SKIDS off the road, FLIPS a couple times,

          Gun in hand, Sully crawls dazedly out of the destroyed
          car. Matrix approaches, kicks the gun out of Sully's
          hand and picks the gun up.
          Matrix empties Sully's pockets and finds his wallet
          and a motel key. He picks Sully up, an ankle in each
          hand, so that he's holding Sully upside down. He
          begins walking with him.

          Matrix is approaching the Sunbeam as Cindy is getting
          out. He swings Sully by the heels and BEATS Sully's
          head against the fender, leaving another dent in the
          already beat-up car.

          Sully tries to thrash about as the blood rushing to
          his face starts to redden it.
          Matrix lets go with his right arm. Sully's head
          drops a foot, Matrix's left arm drops a little, then
          adjusts to the new weight.

          Matrix moves into the bathroom and turns on the shower.
          Cindy tears the covers off the bed, musses up her
          hair and unbuttons her blouse to show some cleavage.
          Matrix and Cindy edge up to the door and Matrix flattens
          himself aginst the wall close to the door.

          Cooke looks back through the door at her. Matrix, at

          Cindy moves away from the door. Matrix tenses, ready
          to attack. Cooke looks into the room at the rumpled
          bed, suitcase and fast food containers.
          The shower SOUNDS continue to echo from the bathroom.
          Cooke cautiously enters the doorway. WHAM!
          Matrix SLAMS the gun against the brawny Cooke's head.
          Cooke crashes back against the wall, but doesn't go
          down. He grabs Matrix's gun hand by the wrist and
          the two of them STRUGGLE for the gun.
          BLAM! BLAM! The gun FIRES into the ceiling as they
          wrestle around the room. They BREAK a table and CRASH

          SHATTERING the lamp near Cindy, making her duck for
          cover.
          Cooke slowly FORCES the gun toward Matrix's face. The
          barrel gets CLOSER... CLOSER... then almost points right
          at Matrix.
          With a sudden SURGE of power, Matrix lifts Cooke off
          the ground, pushes him toward the wall and the two of
          them CRASH RIGHT THROUGH THE DOOR into the adjoining
          room.

          the wall.
          BLAM! The gun FIRES, SHATTERING the mirror above the
          young couple and they SCRAMBLE to safety on the floor
          on the other side of the bed.
          Matrix and Cooke come off the wall and SLAM onto the
          floor, the gun coming out of Matrix's hand. Cooke
          picks it up before Matrix can reach it.
          Cooke points the gun right at Matrix's face, pulls back
          the trigger, then smiles.

          approaches and swallows as she looks down at his body,
          the stake coming out of his chest.
          Matrix starts emptying Cooke's pockets. There's a wallet
          containing only cash. Matrix tosses it to the floor.
          He brings out a lighter and a package of cigarettes,
          examines the lighter, then tosses both objects to the
          floor.

          The soldiers move weapons, metal containers and wooden
          crates from the trucks to the jeeps. A soldier's feet
          walk right in front of Matrix, the soldier unloads a
          crate onto the jeep above Matrix, then the feet move
          away.

          the door forward.

          Matrix SLAMS his fist into Vega's stomach, then quickly
          MOVES into the room, puts a choke hold around Vega
          with his left arm, then carefully closes the door with
          his right.
          As soon as the door closes, the FOOTSTEPS and
          CONVERSATION pass right by the door outside in the
          corridor.
          Matrix pulls Vega toward the back of the room, SMASHES
          his Adam's apple, opens a closet,,drops the dead Vega
          inside, then closes the door.
          He moves to the door leading outside the warehouse,
          opens it and Cindy enters. They begin to whisper.

          Matrix looks at Cindy in desperation for a beat, then
          they begin to look around the room.
          The room is designed as the aircraft control room. There
          are aerial charts on the tables and the walls. There are
          photos of several military planes and a civilian
          amphibious plane. There are copies of weather reports
          situated around the room and there is a VHF radio.

          8734-5245; 8142-5938; 7565-5474. A "Scale line" is

          a deflated and compressed rubber raft and paddle and
          tosses them in, too.
          He takes the cart and SHOVES it down the aisle, the
          cart coming to a rolling crash among the debris at
          the front of the store. Cindy takes the cart and
          quickly rolls it out of the store.
          Matrix moves to the next aisle, takes another
          shopping cart and moves down the aisle. He grabs
          O.D. fatigue pants, an assault-extraction survival
          vest, a camouflage sweater, black survival boots,
          and combat knives.
          He gives the cart a shove and it rolls crazily down
          the aisle into the debris. Cindy quickly rolls the
          cart outside.
          Matrix moves to the counter and starts feverisl-rly

          The wind and spray SLAP against Matrix as he watches
          the seaplane closing the gap on the boat.
          He climbs from the ladder onto the wing of the plane,
          the propellers only about five feet away from him.

          behind them. They HEAR the SOUNDS of the explosions.

          EXT. BEACH - DAY 398

          Bennets STABS at Matrix and Matrix grabs his wrist.
          With his free hand, Matrix STABS at Bennett and Bennett
          grabs Matrix's wrist.
          They are locked hand in hand, staring death into each
          other's eyes.

                         JENNY 399
          Jenny, watching the fight, notices Matrix's gun on the
          beach near her and hesitates to pick it up.

          MATRIX AND BENNETT 400
          Suddenly Matrix falls backward to the ground, pulling
          Bennett with him and FLIPS Bennett over him HARD to
          the sand.
          Matrix jumps up quickly to finish Bennett. Bennett
          quickly THROWS SAND in matrix's eyes.
          Matrix, blinded, stumbles badly.
          Bennett immediately grabs Matrix's knife hand around
          the wrist, then SINKS his own knife into Matrix's
          side.

                         MATRIX

          AAAHHH!
          Matrix's eyes go glassy, then he drops his knife.
          Bennett lets Matrix's wrist go, looks at Matrix's
          glassy eyes for a beat, then he pulls his knife out of
          Matrix's side.
          Matrix STAGGERS for a beat, then STUMBLES a few steps
          and drops to one knee against the front outside hull of
          the boat.
          Bennett slowly approaches Matrix from behind, casually
          feeling the blade of his knife.
          He looks at Matrix's wide, unprotected back and Bennett
          smiles.
          Bennett pulls the knife back with his arm, preparing to
          plunge it into Matrix's back.

          CLOSE ON MATRIX 401
          Out of Bennett's sight, Matrix slips the knife out of
          his boot and GRIPS the knife.

                         BENNETT
          Fuck you, asshole...
          He PLUNGES the knife down toward Matrix's back.
          Matrix moves LIKE LIGHTNING to the side. The knife
          misses him and GETS STUCK in the hull of the boat.
          Matrix turns toward Bennett.

                         MATRIX
          (shaking his head)
          No...
          Bennett tries desperately to get his knife unstuck from
          the boat hull, but he can't. Fear FLOODS his eyes.
          Matrix moves close to Bennett.

                         MATRIX
          Fuck YOU, asshole...
          He DRIVES his knife into Bennett's throat so hard the
          knife goes through Bennett's neck and comes out the
          other side.
          Still holding the knife, Matrix then DRIVES the knife
          into the hull of the boat.
          The knife STICKS into the hull, holding Bennett's neck
          there like a thumbtack holds a note on a bulletin board.
          BOOM? Suddenly there is another, larger EXPLOSION in
          the fiery back of the boat and the whole boat EXPLODES
          into FLAMES, leaving Bennett lost in the fireball.

          MATRIX AND JENNY 403
          Matrix limps away from the flames, Jenny rushes into
          his arms and he holds her close. She's crying.
          She shows him she was holding his gun.

                         JENNY
          I wanted to shoot...but I
          couldn't, I just couldn't.
          Matrix looks at her.

          You know something? I'm glad
          you couldn't.
          He takes the gun from her and tosses it past the burning
          boat into the ocean.

          MATRIX'S P.O.V. 404
          He sees two Army helicopters approaching from the air
          and Cindy bringing her seaplane to the beach.

          EXT. BEACH 405

          Matrix lies down, his head in Jenny's lap, and tries
          to still his bleeding.
          The two copters land. Kirby gets out of one and two
          medical corpsmen with a stretcher get out of the other.
          The corpsmen bring the stretcher to Matrix and gently
          ease him onto it. They start to carry him as Jenny
          walks alongside.

                         KIRBY
          I just saw what's left of Arius'
          estate... You're the best I've
          ever known, John... I've saved a
          place for you if you want to
          join up with me again.
          Matrix notices as Cindy joins Jenny standing next to
          him. Matrix looks at the two of them, then up at
          Kirby.

                         MATRIX
          This was the last one...
          The corpsmen carry Matrix into the copter and Jenny
          joins him inside.
          Kirby and Cindy watch him from outside the chopper.

          Matrix looks at Cindy.

                         MATRIX
          Two might not be enough...
          The chopper wings have started and the chopper is
          preparing to liftoff.
          Matrix and Cindy are looking at each other.
          The chopper starts to liftoff.
          Cindy suddenly RUNS to the chopper and JUMPS in the door
          as it lifts off.
          Matrix puts his arm around her, then he looks back
          toward Kirby.
          Matrix holds up three fingers and smiles.

          EXT. OCEAN - DAY 406

          Kirby waves good-bye as the chopper rises high above
          the beach and flies out over the ocean.
