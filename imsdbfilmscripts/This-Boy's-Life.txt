    FADE IN:

1   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY                                          1
    It is 1957, and we are in the deserts of Utah. TONY
    BENNETT sings "Rags to Riches" on the SOUNDTRACK.
    Breath-taking scenery stretches out on either side of a
    highway.
    The CAMERA MOVES to reveal a Nash Ambassador as it labors
    up a hill. Twelve cars are caught behind the thirty-mile-
    per-hour pace. Two cars decide to ignore safety and
    cross the solid yellow line to pass the pokey car.


2   INT. NASH AMBASSADOR - PARALLEL TIME                        2
    Two people are in the straining car -- a woman and her
    son. The woman is CAROLINE WOLFF. Somewhere in her 30s,
    she is a pretty woman who can look beautiful if she works
    at it. (Just now, though, her prettiness is marred by a
    fading bruise on her right cheekbone.) She is bright and
    energetic and lively. Even more important than these
    qualities, though, is her humor. And most important of
    all is a sensual quality she exudes. Her sensuality is
    effortless -- as natural to her as the color of her eyes
    and hair. Men turn on the street to stare at her.
    The boy is TOBY WOLFF. A    pleasant-faced boy with won-
    derful eyes, he is 13 --   teetering on the brink of
    adolescence, so that one   moment he seems like a self-
    assured teenager, and the   very next like a ten-year-old
    kid.
    Just now the ten-year-old kid has the upper hand: bored
    and weary with the long trip, Toby has been arguing with
    Caroline, who is ignoring him.
                              TOBY
               ... Well,  I mean it. I'm serious
               -- I do.   You promise and promise,
               and then  you change your mind,
               just like  that.
                             CAROLINE
                      (totally oblivious)
               ... Uh-huh.
                             TOBY
               You wait 'til you ask me for
               something. Just wait. See if you
               get it.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                            CAROLINE
                     (as above)
              Toby, hush. Let me just...
    So concentrated on her driving she doesn't even finish
    her sentence, she nurses the car upward. Finally the car
    crests the hill and starts down. Caroline sighs with
    relief. She turns to Toby with a smile.
                            CAROLINE
              What'd you say?
                            TOBY
              I said -- for the twentieth time
              -- if a person promises somebody
              something, they can't just turn
              around and take it back.
                            CAROLINE
              Oh, honey, Jesus. Don't start
              with that again.
                             TOBY
              Why not?
                            CAROLINE
              Because I'm the mother, and I
              get to tell you what to do every
              minute of your life 'til you're
              eighteen. Seriously, we've got no
              money. I can't buy you the
              moccasins.
                            TOBY
              I bet if you'd promised Roy some
              moccasins he'd of got 'em.

                            CAROLINE
              No talk about Roy, okay? And ditto
              the moccasins. We, can't, afford,
              them.
                            TOBY
              Yeah, but you did promise...
                            CAROLINE
              Sue me. Take me to court. Oh,
              Toby, I know you're disappointed,
              but...
                             TOBY
              Jack.   Call me Jack.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           3.
2   CONTINUED:   (2)                                            2
                            CAROLINE
              You're going to drive me to an
              early grave: I'm never going to
              make Salt Lake City.
                            TOBY
              Seriously. If a person can't get
              a stinking miserable pair of
              moccasins, at least he ought to be
              able to choose his own name...
                     (loud)
              ... and I wanna be called Jack!
                            CAROLINE
              Fine.  And you can call me...
                     (she thinks)
              ... Jeanette. Jeanette Marie.
                            TOBY
              Oh, you're so stupid sometimes,
              I...
    The BAWLING of an AIRHORN interrupts him. Both of them
    look through the back window and see a huge tractor-
    trailer truck, out of control, bearing down on them.
    Caroline brakes and steers a hard right, SKIDDING the
    NASH safely onto the side of the road.
    The truck, its HORN BLASTING steadily, shimmies and
    slides past them, and then, hideously, fails to make the
    next curve: it smashes through the guard rails and into
    empty space, its HORN still BLARING.
    Caroline and Toby look at each other, then scramble out
    of the car.


3   EXT. BROKEN GUARD RAIL - DAY                                3
    Other drivers have stopped to look: hundreds of feet
    below, the truck lies on its back among boulders.
    Caroline glances, then turns away. She pulls Toby
    away, one arm around his shoulder.

4   EXT. NASH AMBASSADOR - MINUTES LATER                        4
    Caroline fills the Nash's steaming radiator with a can of
    water.
                             CAROLINE
                     (not much heat)
              Goddamn thing.
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                        4.
4   CONTINUED:                                          4
    She glances back to where a larger crowd of people stare
    avidly down at the truck. She bites her lip.
                            CAROLINE
              Oh, that poor man.
    There is a pause.   Then Toby speaks:
                            TOBY
              I hope to hell this isn't some
              kind of omen.
    Caroline turns to Toby, her face worried. Then she sees
    the look in Toby's eyes -- he's ragging her. She grins
    and gives his shoulder a light, affectionate shove.


5   INT. NASH AMBASSADOR - NIGHT                               5
    Toby (feet up on the dashboard wearing a brand-new pair
    of Indian moccasins) and Caroline sing "Mood Indigo"
    together. Toby holds  a complicated-looking, black con-
    traption which looks something like an antique flashlight.
                            TOBY
              How's this thing work, anyway?
                            CAROLINE
                     (not confident)
              It makes a black light that, uh,
              causes uranium traces to glow.
                            TOBY
              And we just walk along the street
              and find this glowing uranium?

                            CAROLINE
              Well, it was everywhere in Moab,
              they say -- just like gold in the
              gold-rush days.
                            TOBY
              But we were too late in Moab, and
              that guy at the office said
              nobody'd found any uranium in Salt
              Lake City.
                            CAROLINE
              Well, that means we'll have the
              place pretty much to ourselves,
              huh? Honey, this could be a big
              break for us. If this works out,
              oh, just think: we'll get us a
              house, get rid of this damn Nash
              Ambassador -- no money worries...
              It'll be like heaven on a June day.

                                                        5.
6   INT. CAR - DAWN                                           6
    We hear "MOOD INDIGO" on the car RADIO and see that a
    weary Caroline has driven through the night and Toby is
    slumped against the passenger door. Toby stirs, then
    opens his eyes.
                            CAROLINE
              Ask me how far we are from Salt
              Lake City.
    Toby is instantly awake, excited. Caroline points to a
    small highway sign and both she and Toby yell out.
                            CAROLINE/TOBY
              Forty-seven miles to go!

    Both of them are laughing with excitement. Toby claps
    his hands together once, very hard, and Caroline yells --

7   EXT. HIGHWAY - MORNING                                    7
    Well, hell. The Nash Ambassador sits by the side of the
    road, its hood up, its radiator steaming. Caroline and
    Toby sit in a patch of shade by the car.
                            CAROLINE
              If I could have one wish right
              now -- only one wish -- you know
              what I'd like? I'd like to burn
              this damn Nash Ambassador to a
              crisp.
                     (as Toby laughs)
              I'm serious. I hate it. I hate
              the factory that produced it, and
              I hate the man who invented it.

                            TOBY
              It almost makes me want to see Roy
              -- he was the only one could make
              the thing stop overheating.
                     (a beat)
              My God, he was boring. Boring and
              mean: you sure got crappy taste in
              boyfriends.
    At the mention of Roy's name, Caroline lightly touches
    the bruise on her right cheekbone. Not enjoying the talk
    about Roy, she pours the water into the radiator, and
    speaks directly to the car.
                            CAROLINE
              I'd like to burn you to the ground.
                     (to Toby; big smile)
              Let's go get rich in Salt Lake
              City!

                                                         6.
8    EXT. SALT LAKE CITY (DOWNTOWN) - DAY                       8
     Toby waits beside the Nash Ambassador, looking toward a
     three-story concrete building. He holds a portable
     RADIO, which PLAYS DEAN MARTIN singing "Volare."

9    INT. BUILDING - PARALLEL TIME                              9
     Caroline, holding the imitation Geiger counter, stands
     across the counter from a MAN who is looking at her
     very strangely.
                             MAN
               You're pulling my leg, right?
                             CAROLINE
               No, I came here to look for
               uranium.
                             MAN
               My God, lady. If you're looking
               for uranium, why didn't you go to
               Moab?
                             CAROLINE
               We went there, but everybody'd
               beaten us there. We were too late.
                             MAN
               So you came here just on the
               chance you'd find uranium?
               Listen, you mind me saying
               something to you might sound rude?
               Lady, you got more courage than
               you got common sense.


10   EXT. NASH AMBASSADOR - DAY                                 10
     Caroline exits the building, dumps the Geiger counter in
     a trash can and strides to the car. She gets in, and
     says two words:
                             CAROLINE
               Don't ask.

11   INT. NASH AMBASSADOR - DAY                                 11
     Caroline turns the key in the ignition and gets only a
     maddening RER-RER-RER-RER noise from the ENGINE:
     wearily, she rests her forehead on the steering wheel.

                                                             7.
12   EXT. NASH AMBASSADOR - TWENTY MINUTES LATER             12
     Caroline and Toby have the hood up and are peering into
     the engine.
                              TOBY
               That mechanic in Colorado said it
               needed points.
                             CAROLINE
               I know. Don't tell me what I
               already know. This thing's a
               bottomless pit. I don't know what
               to do. No matter how much money I
               pour into it...
     Suddenly a WOMAN in pedal-pushers and a thin, inexpensive
     sweater stops. She's vaguely low-class, but friendly and
     sympathetic.
                             WOMAN
               I'd rather be whipped with a belt
               than have car trouble. 'Course
               these days I don't have to worry
               about that. My husband got laid
               off at the mill, and they
               repossessed the car, so wherever
               I wanna go, I just have to hoof
               it, you know?
     Caroline smiles, then her face changes.
                                CAROLINE
               You don't have    a car?
                      (as the    Woman
                       shakes    her head)
               You want this    one?

     Shocked, the Woman says --
                             WOMAN
               I... uh... I...
                             TOBY
               You're gonna give our car away?
                             CAROLINE
                      (to the Woman)
               Seriously. It needs points, and
               it overheats constantly, but you
               can have it if you want it,
               because my hand to God, I can't
               look at it one more minute.
                                WOMAN
               Well, sure...
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             8.
12   CONTINUED:                                              12
                             CAROLINE
               Get the bags out. Get the owner's
               slip out of the glove compartment.
               We're rid of this son-of-a-bitch
               pink and white albatross. You
               don't mind taking a car with a big
               dent in the passenger door?
                             WOMAN
               Hell, no.
                      (she looks)
               There's no dent there...
     Caroline draws back her leg and delivers a terrific,
     flat-footed kick to the door, leaving a dent the size
     of a dish-pan.
                             CAROLINE
               Oh, yes there is!
     Toby hands the Woman the owner's slip, Caroline gives her
     the keys.
                             WOMAN
               ... you really just giving me this
               car?
                             CAROLINE
               It's done. It's yours. You got
               yourself a Nash Ambassador!
                      (to Toby)
               Let's go!
     Both of them pick up two bags apiece -- all they have in
     the world -- and off they go, feeling good.


13   EXT. CITY STREET - DAY (FEW MINUTES LATER)                   13
     1957 is all around us: gas is 29.9 cents a gallon; bread
     is 19 cents a loaf; cars are curved and heavily chromed;
     people occasionally nod and smile at strangers; children
     carry hula hoops. In all, a gentler time. Caroline and
     Toby stride along briskly, as if they knew where they
     were going.
                             CAROLINE
               ... find ourselves a cheap room
               someplace, we'll get you into
               school, I'll brush up on my typing
               and get a job, and things'll start
               looking up. I feel it: the good
               times are coming. And at least
               we're rid of that damn Nash
               Ambassador!
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                              9.

                             TOBY
               Yeah, and like Dad used to say,
               'We may be broke, but we're never
               poor.' And later, if we get a
               house with a big yard, I could
               get a collie, you know? One like
               Lad or Grey Dawn. And someday
               maybe a palomino. And I'm going
               to try harder in school, too...
     The two of them walk on -- a bit foolish, but, in an
     odd way, brave as hell.

14   INT. VICE PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY                            14

     A subdued Toby sits in front of the VICE PRINCIPAL.
                             VICE PRINCIPAL
               ... like to give new boys the
               benefit of the doubt, but this
               is the second time in two weeks
               that you've been in front of me,
               and I don't like that.
                      (picks up a telephone)
               Now I think you better just call
               your mother and tell her to come
               down here.
                              TOBY
               She works.   She's working.
     Silent, the man continues to hold out the telephone to
     Toby. Finally he takes it and dials.


15   EXT. SCHOOL - AFTERNOON                                       15
     Caroline and Toby exit.   Toby sullen; Caroline angry.
                             TOBY
               It wasn't me broke their stupid
               windows.
                               CAROLINE
               Liar.
                             TOBY
               Gee, thanks a lot, Mom -- believe
               them instead of me.
                             CAROLINE
               If you care anything about me at
               all, you'll shut up.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                              10.
15    CONTINUED:                                              15
                              TOBY
                Yeah, well if you'd stayed married
                to Dad none of this would've ever
                happened.
                              CAROLINE
                Look, don't you put that    on my
                back: I can't make your     father
                call you. I can't make     your
                brother write you. They     dumped
                you. Yes. But it's not      my fault.

16    INT. CAROLINE AND TOBY'S ROOM - AFTERNOON                     16

      The place is pretty bleak: a room and a half, Murphy
      beds, linoleum floors, and a bath down the hall.
      Caroline and Toby enter. She pulls down the Murphy
      bed and falls onto it fully dressed, saying:
                              CAROLINE
                My head is killing me.
      Toby heads for his room.

16A   SAME SCENE - DUSK                                       16A
      Caroline wakes up with a start, then sees Toby sitting
      in a chair, watching her.
                              CAROLINE
                What time is it?
                                TOBY
                Seven.    Almost.
                              CAROLINE
                Why didn't you wake me?
                              TOBY
                I started dinner. The potatoes
                are frying, and I'm heating up the
                hot dogs.
      Caroline sees that he's trying to make it up to her, and
      pats the bed for him to sit down next to her. He moves
      to sit beside her.
                              CAROLINE
                Hold your mother's hand.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            11.
16A   CONTINUED:                                            16A
                                TOBY
                I'm sorry.
                              CAROLINE
                I know you are, honey. Ah, well
                -- it wasn't fire, and nobody
                bled, so I guess we're okay.
      The TELEPHONE RINGS and she answers it.   When she hears
      the VOICE on the other end she once again  touches her
      right cheekbone with a finger -- the spot  where the
      bruise had been. She sags back against a   wall.
                                CAROLINE
                Yes...
                         (listens)
                Yes...
                       (listens)
                Yes, I know...
                       (listens)
                You're right...
                       (listens)
                All right, yes... in an hour,
                then.
      Caroline hangs up.
                                TOBY
                Who was that?
      She closes her eyes.
                                TOBY
                Who was that?
      Caroline laughs aloud, then slides down the wall until
      she's on the floor still laughing.
                              CAROLINE
                We've got a guest for dinner:
                it's Roy. He tracked us down.
      Toby groans and falls full-length onto the sofa.

17    INT. CAROLINE AND TOBY'S KITCHEN - ONE HOUR LATER           17
      Caroline, Toby and ROY are eating at the tiny table. Roy
      is good-looking in a meaty, hairy-chested sort of way.
      Though he is on his very best behavior just now, there is
      a mean streak in him.
      Toby, delighted, holds a Winchester .22 rifle across his
      lap -- a peace-making gift from Roy.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                              12.
17   CONTINUED:                                               17
                              ROY
               ... I found me a room, but it's
               clear the hell and gone 'cross
               town. And I think I got a job
               lined up doin' tune-ups in a
               Texaco station. How you like it
               at Winstead's?
                             CAROLINE
               How do you know where I work?
                             ROY
               I been here almost a week.
                             CAROLINE
               You followed me around?    For a
               week? Watching?
     Roy doesn't answer.   He just wiggles his eyebrows like
     Groucho Marx.
                             CAROLINE
               And how did you ever find me?
     Again, Roy does the Groucho Marx.    He turns to Toby.
                             ROY
               You like the rifle, Toby?    'Jack,'
               I mean.
                             TOBY
               It's the best present I ever got.
               I just love it.
                      (to Caroline)
               I'm going to pretend I'm shooting.

                             CAROLINE
               Don't point that thing at anybody
               or I won't teach you to shoot.
                             TOBY
               It's not loaded!
                               CAROLINE
               You heard me:    anybody or any
               thing.
                             TOBY
               It's got no bullets, for God's
               sake.
                             CAROLINE
               Don't make me speak to you again.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                            13.
17   CONTINUED:   (2)                                             17
                             TOBY
               I'll point it at the sky, then.
     Caroline sighs. Toby opens a screenless window and
     points the gun up into the night sky, pretending to fire
     it over and over. Caroline starts to clear the table.
     Roy jumps up to help her.

18   INT. LIVING ROOM - TWO HOURS LATER                           18
     Caroline and Roy are   kissing on the sofa, and he is all
     over her: his hands    are on her breasts, her thighs,
     everywhere. Aroused    in spite of herself, Caroline pulls
     away, indicating the   light in the other room.

                              CAROLINE
               Don't.   Toby's still up.
     Roy leans back, smiling, and eyes Caroline.
                             ROY
               You are one sweet thing, baby:
               just the sight of you makes my
               dick hard.
     He pulls her to him, starting to kiss her. She fends him
     off, looking worriedly toward the room where Toby's light
     burns.
                             ROY
               Aw, he won't hear anything.
     Again he pulls her toward him; again she turns her head
     from the kiss.

     Then it happens.
     A spasm of anger passes across his face and he shoves
     Caroline away from him. It's a hard shove, but nothing
     that could really hurt her. Violence has happened before
     between these two, and they recognize it. Caroline is
     immediately on guard, and Roy is apologetic.
                             ROY
               Shit, baby, I'm sorry. I didn't
               mean that. I'm just so glad to
               see you.
     He slides toward Caroline, kisses her. This time she
     accepts the kiss -- feels she has no choice.

                                                             14.
19   INT. KITCHEN - PARALLEL TIME                                  19
     Dressed for bed, Toby stands by an open window. He can
     hear every WORD of ROY'S, who continues to apologize
     between kisses. The room is illuminated by a nearby
     streetlamp. The frosty air from the open window causes
     his breath to steam. He raises two fingers to his lips,
     pretends to take a drag on a cigarette and blows out the
     steam from his breath. The VOICES in the other room grow
     a bit LOUDER, almost to an argument, and then SUBSIDE
     again. Toby takes another drag from his pretend cig-
     arette. He looks very young.

20   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - AFTERNOON                           20
     Toby wanders toward the rooming house. He stops to watch
     TWO fiftyish WOMEN who are working in a garden. One
     Woman looks up.
                               WOMAN #1
               Hi.
                               TOBY
               Hello.
     The Woman stops to take a breather, lights a cigarette,
     pokes her companion.
                             WOMAN #1
               My Lord, look at the eyes on
               him -- won't he be a heartbreaker
               in three, four years?
                               WOMAN #2
               Bedroom eyes.
     Toby smiles.

                             WOMAN #1
               You live in the neighborhood,
               sweetie?
                             TOBY
               Over there.
                      (a beat)
               I won't be here long, though,
               'cause my dad's coming to get me.
                               WOMAN #1
               Oh, yes?
                             TOBY
               Yeah. I'm gonna live on his
               ranch in Phoenix. The "Lazy B,"
               it's called.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             15.
20   CONTINUED:                                              20
                             WOMAN #2
               That sounds like fun.
                             TOBY
               It is. I've got a palomino horse
               and a collie, and Dad lets us go
               on hunts all by ourselves. He
               gave me this Winchester .22, and
               last year I shot a mountain lion
               with it. And Lad -- that's my
               dog -- found a nest of rattlesnakes
               one time, and killed all twelve
               of them...
     The two Women exchange a glance.     It's obvious the boy
     is lying.

21   INT. CAROLINE AND TOBY'S ROOMS - AFTERNOON (SAME DAY)21
     Toby enters.   Four packed suitcases lie on the bed behind
     Caroline.
                             TOBY
               What're you doing home so --
                      (as he sees
                       suitcases)
               We going someplace?
                               CAROLINE
               We sure are.
                               TOBY
               Where?
                               CAROLINE
               I don't know.    Got any suggestions?
                               TOBY
               Phoenix.
                             CAROLINE
               Good. I was thinking of Phoenix
               or Seattle -- lots of opportunities
               in both those places.
                             TOBY
               What about your fabulous
               boyfriends? What about the
               fabulous, boring Roy? Is he
               coming, too?
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             16.

                             CAROLINE
               Not if I can help it. I looked
               out the window at work today, and
               he was parked across the street,
               watching.
                             TOBY
               Roy's so uncool. So boring.
                             CAROLINE
               You liked him well enough last
               night.
                      (imitating Toby)
               'Oh, Roy, I just love my rifle
               so much! It's the bestest present
               ever!'
                              TOBY
               Oh, shut up.
     But he's smiling, completely unbothered.
     Suddenly Caroline laughs, stands up, and begins to close
     the suitcases. Toby laughs, too.
                             TOBY
               Now? We're going now?     What about
               all the food?
                              CAROLINE
               Leave it.
                             TOBY
               Even the canned stuff?
                              CAROLINE
               Leave it!
     They grab the four heavy suitcases and head out the door.
     Both of them are laughing.

22   INT. BUS STATION - AFTERNOON                                  22
     Caroline and Toby stand at a ticket counter,
     disappointed.
                              TOBY
               Well, ask him when the next one
               to Phoenix is.
                             TICKET SELLER
               Tomorrow morning, eleven
               forty-five.

     Toby and Caroline groan, then Caroline brightens.
                             CAROLINE
               What about Seattle?
                             TICKET SELLER

               Leaves in nine minutes.
     They look at each other.

23   EXT. BOARDING AREA                                            23
     Toby and Caroline hurry onboard a Greyhound bus with
     Seattle as its destination.
                             CAROLINE
               ... I've always had a good head
               for figures, and if I could get
               my C.P.A. license, I believe we
               could make a real go of it in
               Seattle. I'll advertise for
               roommates, and I bet we find us
               a real cute house to rent.
                             TOBY
               If there's a big yard, can I get
               a collie?
                             CAROLINE
               Sure. Oh, honey, I feel a wind
               at my back: I think this is
               going to work out good.
                             TOBY
                      (as they board
                       bus)
               Yeah -- like heaven on a June day.
     The DOORS of the bus close. WHOOSH! The bus begins to
     move. Caroline and Toby's faces are at the window:
     Seattle or bust.
                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

24   EXT. TRACT HOUSE (SEATTLE, WASHINGTON) - AFTERNOON            24
     The house is a nasty little thing with peeling paint.
     From inside we hear:
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                          18.

                              CAROLINE (O.S.)
                ... and if you cut school again
                I'll just wear you out -- do you
                hear me? I'm tired of it!
                                TOBY (O.S.)
                Yeah, yeah...
      Toby exits the house.
      But, Jesus, what a new Toby: he's turned cool. A few
      months have passed.  He now wears T-shirts and jeans
      which ride way low on his hips. As he walks along, he
      combs his hair into a duck's ass in back, and forward
      into a curl at the center of his forehead. He's 1957 hip
      -- or thinks he is.  He strolls on, feeling cool.

24A   EXT. TRACT HOUSE/FURTHER DOWN STREET - AFTERNOON          24A
      From one of the houses TERRY TAYLOR emerges, falling into
      step with Toby. He's Toby's age, and is almost an exact
      replica of him.
                                TOBY
                Hey, Terry.
                              TERRY TAYLOR
                Hey, Jack. What'd your mom say
                about skipping school today?
                                TOBY
                Who listens?
                              TERRY TAYLOR
                You go over to Wanda's house last
                night?
                       (as Toby nods)
                You make out good?
                       (as Toby nods again)
                How good?
                              TOBY
                I fucked her 'til her nose bled.
                                TERRY TAYLOR
                Sure you did!    Oh, Wolff, you're
                rich.

25    INT. APARTMENT - AFTERNOON                                25
      TERRY SILVER opens the door to admit Toby and Terry
      Taylor. Silver is a clone of both Toby and Terry Taylor.

                                                             19.
26   INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON                                  26
     As the three boys troop through the room, they pass Terry
     Silver's two SISTERS, who are sprawled sensually on a
     sofa.
                             SISTER #1
               Oh look -- it's Elvis, Elvis,
               and Elvis.
                             TERRY TAYLOR
               Excuse me, but does your face
               hurt? 'Cause it's killing me.
     With that piece of high wit, they're out of the room.


27   INT. TV ROOM - AFTERNOON                                27
     The boys light up three cigarettes (opening a window so
     the smoke will disappear), then throw themselves onto the
     floor in front of a black-and-white TV.
     Superman is ON. When Lois Lane comes on, Terry Taylor
     starts moaning as if sexually aroused; Terry Silver jumps
     to his knees and licks the TV screen repeatedly, also
     moaning. Toby closes his eyes, also as if in sexual
     transport.
                             TOBY
               Oh, Lois. Oh, baby, come here --
               I got six hot inches just waiting
               for you.
                             TERRY TAYLOR
               Man, look at her! Look at that
               body-y-y-y.

                             TERRY SILVER
                      (continues licking
                       screen)
               Um-m-m-m. M-M-M. Oh, Annette, I
               want you. I want you so bad.
                             TOBY
               Oh, babybabybabybabybaby...
               You make my dick hard!
     The three carry on for a few more seconds.
                                THREE OF THEM
               Yum, yum, yum.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             20.

      Making wet kissing noises, or just rocking their heads
      back and forth as if tempted beyond endurance. Then,
      slowly, they shut up and lie back down.

27A   SAME SCENE - LATER                                           27A
      And this is what they really wanted: absolutely silent,
      all three boys stare fixedly at the screen. They are
      totally absorbed, caught up in the sweetness and warmth
      of the show.
      Not one of these boys has ever touched a girl's breast;
      all three are at least two years from their first shave;
      all three are pre-pubescent, and their sexuality is all
      bravado -- now we see them for what they are: three
      skinny-armed 13-year-olds, fascinated by Superman.

28    INT. TOBY AND CAROLINE'S KITCHEN - DUSK                      28
      Caroline pirouettes for her two roommates, KATHY, a
      diffident, sweet-faced young woman, and MARIAN, a
      heavyset, loud, red-faced woman who eats compulsively
      from a package of oatmeal cookies. Both of the women ooh
      and aah over Caroline's dress.
                              KATHY
                That belt just makes it.
                              CAROLINE
                It does pick up the green, doesn't
                it?
                              MARIAN
                And you say he's getting serious
                already?
                              CAROLINE
                Yes, I think. He keeps talking
                about marriage, keeps saying he
                wants to meet Toby.
                              MARIAN
                Well, that's it -- three dates and
                you got 'im good.
                              CAROLINE
                I don't know if I want him --
      She stops as Toby enters the kitchen.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

               Don't want who?
                             KATHY
                      (about Toby)
               Little pitchers...
                             MARIAN
               Well, it's the tough guy who can't
               be bothered to go to school.
                             CAROLINE
                      (to Toby)
               Oh, it's nothing -- we were
               talking about Dwight. I told you
               about Dwight.
                             TOBY
               He the one drives down from the
               boondocks? The mechanic? Dwight.
               What a stupid name.
                      (he draws the name
                       out)
               Dwiiiight. Duhhhhwight.
               Dwight-tah-h-h-h. Dwighttahhhhh.
     There is a KNOCK    on the front door. Toby sticks his head
     around the door,    looking into the living room. A man is
     outlined against    the sunset, only his black silhouette is
     visible. It is     our first glimpse of DWIGHT.
     Has the man heard him?     Toby doesn't know for sure.
     Caroline brings Dwight into the kitchen.     He is older
     than her, an attractive-enough man. He     is well-built,
     has a full head of brown hair, and very    white teeth.
     Those are his good points. On the minus     side: his over-
     eagerness to please, his nervous smiles    and his clothes.
     He wears two-tone shoes, a hand-painted    tie, and a
     monogrammed handkerchief, folded beyond    perfection, in
     the pocket.
     Caroline introduces him to Marian and Kathy.     Then she
     introduces Dwight to Toby.
     Dwight is all smiles.
                             CAROLINE
               Would you like coffee before we
               go? Or a Coke?
                              DWIGHT
               You know, I believe I could stand
               a cup of java.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

     As Caroline pours the coffee, Dwight turns to Toby.
                             DWIGHT
               So you're Toby.
                             TOBY
               No.
                             DWIGHT
               You're not Toby?
                             TOBY
               No.
                             CAROLINE
               Oh, he wants to be called 'Jack.'
               It's so silly... ever since he
               read Jack London.
                             DWIGHT
               Well, I'll call him anything he
               wants.
                      (to Toby,
                       confidential)
               I always say people can call me
               anything they want, long as they
               don't call me late for supper!
     Kathy and Marian think it's pretty funny.     They laugh.
     Caroline smiles. Toby just stares.
                             DWIGHT
               So, Jack, you like school?
                             TOBY
               No.

                             MARIAN
               He might like it if he ever went
               there and tried it.
                             TOBY
               Oh, have another cookie, Marian --
               keep your strength up.
                             MARIAN
               I'd like to just yank that nasty
               tongue of yours out by the roots.
                             CAROLINE
                      (to Dwight, light)
               My son's decided to try to drive
               me into an early grave. Truly.

               You straighten up and be polite,
               you hear me?
     Dwight takes a swallow of the coffee.     His eyes widen.
                                DWIGHT
               Who made this?
                                CAROLINE
               I did...
                             DWIGHT
               Well, well, well, all I can say is
               that you people are pretty lucky
               to live in a house where -- oh.
     Marian puts a cigarette into her mouth. Dwight jumps up,
     pulls a velvet case from his pocket and extracts a mono-
     grammed Zippo. He snaps open the top of the lighter
     against his leg, and holds the flame in front of Marian's
     face. She lights her cigarette. Then Dwight perform the
     Zippo drama in reverse.
     What a conversation stopper.     Finally, Kathy speaks to
     Toby.
                             KATHY
               I hear you're invited up to
               Dwight's next week for
               Thanksgiving.
                             DWIGHT
               Aw, you'll love it. Great air,
               great water. For scenery, all you
               have to do is step outside your
               front door and open your eyes.
               And there's a turkey shoot
               Thanksgiving Day. Your mom said
               you might like it, so I signed you
               up.
     Toby sits up, eager.
                             TOBY
               Really? I can shoot my Winchester?
               Great! I bet I could be the one
               to get the turkey.

               Well, amazing: it can sit up and
               talk like a normal human being.
                      (notices the time)
               Dwight, we're going to be late.
     She grabs her coat (which Dwight jumps up to hold for
     her) and they exit. As Dwight leaves he kisses his hand,
     then throws the kiss toward Marian and Kathy. The
     instant the front door slams:
         TOBY                MARIAN                      KATHY
      What a geek.      I love a man knows      He's so appealing.
                        how to dress.


29   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - AFTERNOON                            29
     We hear SCREAMING. Toby and Terry Taylor race BY the
     CAMERA on stolen tricycles, yelling as if they're attack-
     ing Indians. Behind them comes Terry Silver, on foot.
     Atop a small hill, both boys jump off, letting the
     TRICYCLES SMASH into a parked car. Then they run like
     hell with Terry Silver bringing up the rear.

30   INT. CAROLINE AND TOBY'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING                 30
     Caroline is dressed casually. Toby has on a shirt and
     sweater. He is pretending that he's buck-toothed.
     Caroline finishes packing a small suitcase.
                             CAROLINE
               I want you to be polite to Dwight
               this weekend.

                               TOBY
                        (buck-toothed speech)
               Okay.
                             CAROLINE
               I mean it, now.
                             TOBY
                      (buck-toothed speech)
               I said 'Okay,' didn't I?
                             CAROLINE
               Hey, c'mon, maybe the weekend'll
               be fun... maybe Concrete will be
               pretty.

               Oh, Concrete, my favorite town.
               Welcome to beautiful Concrete!
                                CAROLINE
               And stop that.
                             TOBY
                      (buck-toothed speech)
               Stop what?
                             CAROLINE
               Sometimes I could kill you as free
               as I could eat a bite.

                               TOBY
                        (buck-toothed speech)
               Ditto.
     A car stops and through a window, we see Dwight.
     Caroline turns to Toby.
                             CAROLINE
               Please be nice.
     Toby stops the buck-toothed thing and speaks normally.
                                TOBY
               All right.

31   EXT. ROAD - MORNING                                        31
     We see Dwight driving his shiny Buick, Caroline and Toby
     beside him. As the CAMERA TRACKS the car with VARIOUS
     SHOTS, we hear:
                             DWIGHT (V.O.)
               ... air like wine at my place, and
               I don't mind saying I wouldn't
               live anywhere else, and that's the
               God's honest truth. There's good
               schools, honest people, and some
               of the best fishing in the world.
               Ted Williams -- you like baseball,
               Toby? That is, Jack, I mean --
               you like baseball? 'Cause Ted
               Williams, whom I believe is one of
               the all-time greats, is also a
               world-class angler. Many's the
               day he and I've talked over the
               best way to get a fish to say yes
               to a hook.

                       (a beat)
                Hunting, too: there's game
                everywhere you look. I don't
                think I flatter myself by saying
                that I'm something of a whiz with
                a rifle, and Concrete gives me
                every opportunity to prove it...

32    EXT. SMALL BRIDGE - DAY                                      32
      The three stand by the edge of the bridge, looking down
      into the water.

      They see salmon fighting the last few yards of their
      yearly battle to spawn. Against the rapid current, they
      leap again and again. Long strips of flesh hang from
      their bodies.
                              DWIGHT
                They always show you salmon
                fighting to get upstream, but they
                never show you what they look like
                when they get there.
      Her face strained, Caroline leans over for a closer look.
      The salmon swim in slow, stunned circles, some with an
      eye missing or hanging by a membrane, a hideous sight.
                                 CAROLINE
                It's pitiful.     Awful.
                              DWIGHT
                They'll spawn, and then they'll
                die. They're dying now.

      As Toby and Caroline move to the passenger side of the
      car, Toby speaks so Dwight can't hear:
                              TOBY
                I hope to hell it's not an omen.
      Caroline has to fight back a smile.

A33   EXT. CONCRETE SILO - DAY                               A33
      The Buick drives into town past an enormous disused
      Concrete silo where "Welcome To Concrete" is painted in
      huge faded letters.

                So here we go. Welcome to
                Concrete. Dwight's home sweet
                home. Finest people in the whole
                state of Washington, you ask me.
                Lots of churches, too. A neighbor
                of mine says, "Looking for nice
                churches, come to Concrete.
                Looking for sin, go to hell." I
                think that's funny...
      Caroline and Toby are severely underimpressed with their
      first impression of Concrete.


33    EXT. DWIGHT'S HOUSE - DAY                                   33
      Dwight's Buick pulls to a stop; Dwight, Caroline, and
      Toby get out. The scenery is as beautiful as Dwight said
      it was.
                              DWIGHT
                All the houses are converted Army
                barracks, made into duplexes --
      Three children exit the    house. SKIPPER, a pleasant boy
      who is average in every    way, is 17. NORMA is 18, slow-
      spoken and sensual, Toby    cannot take his eyes off her.
      The third is PEARL, two    years younger than Toby. Pearl
      has a bald spot the size    of a dollar, high on the side of
      her head.
                              DWIGHT
                Well. Let's see here. Kids, this
                is my pretty friend, Caroline
                Wolff, and her boy To...

                      (he catches himself)
               Jack Wolff. These are my kids:
               Skipper, Norma and my baby, Pearl.
     Everybody says hello, shakes hands, then they all head
     into the house.

34   INT. DWIGHT'S LIVING ROOM - DAY                               34
     They enter and look around: well,     it's not awful, but
     it sure as hell isn't wonderful.     The room is dark, on
     the small side, and shows the lack    of a woman's hand.
     Caroline looks a bit taken aback,    but tries to hide it
     by saying the word "nice" over and    over.
     The CAMERA FOLLOWS them FROM room TO room:
                             DWIGHT
               Okay, so that was the living room;
               over here is the kitchen -- I plan
               on getting all new fixtures in
               here -- and down that hall are the
               three bedrooms and the bath.
     He stops at an extra, no-particular-purpose, nondescript
     room furnished only by two easy chairs and a card table.
                             DWIGHT
               This is sort of a lounging area.
                      (as nobody says
                       anything)
               You know, just in case you want
               to...

     He searches, can't think of how to finish the sentence in
     any impressive way. He gives up, finishes weakly:
                             DWIGHT
               ... lounge.
     Skipper snorts with laughter, but cuts it off when Dwight
     gives him a look. Toby, trying to be good, bites his lip
     to keep from laughing.

35   EXT. BUSINESS STREET - DAY                                    35
     The business area is small and rather forlorn. The six
     of them walk in pairs -- Dwight and Caroline, Skipper and
     Norma, and last, Toby and Pearl. (Toby's eyes are glued
     to the movement of Norma's body.)

               How about you guys? You like it
               here?
     They glance at each other.

               SKIPPER                        NORMA
       Fine.                          Yeah, it's fine.

                             NORMA
               It's a little isolated, is all.
                             DWIGHT
               Not that isolated.
                             NORMA
               Well, maybe not that isolated.
               Pretty isolated, though.
                             DWIGHT
               Aw, there's plenty to do in
               Concrete if you kids would take a
               little initiative. When I was
               growing up we didn't have T.V. --
               we used our imaginations. We read
               the classics. We played musical
               instruments. You show me a bored
               kid, I'll show you a lazy kid.
                             CAROLINE
               I didn't know you played an
               instrument, Dwight. What do you
               play?

               Sax.   Tenor sax.
     Skipper and Norma glance at each other, then look away.
     Caroline takes a cigarette from her purse. Again Dwight
     jumps to her service: we are once more treated to the
     mini-drama of Dwight unsheathing the Zippo from its
     velvet case, opening the top on his pants leg, etc.

               There isn't one. We go to
               Chinook.
                               NORMA
               Chinook High.
                             DWIGHT
               It's a few miles downriver.
                               SKIPPER
               Forty miles.
                             DWIGHT
               Come off it -- it's not that far.

                             SKIPPER
               Yeah, I clocked it: thirty-nine
               miles.
     In spite of the fact that he's eager for this day to go
     well, Dwight's bottom teeth begin to show.
                              DWIGHT
               Ah, you'd bellyache if the goddam
               school was in your fugging
               back yard. Just shut your god-
               damn pie-hole.
     They all shut their pie-holes. The six walk in a tense,
     uncomfortable silence for five full beats. Then Pearl
     tries to help out:
                             PEARL
               I'm in fifth grade.

     Nobody seems to care.

36   INT. DWIGHT'S LIVING ROOM - HOUR LATER                        36
     Dwight has recovered his good mood. Dressed in a
     marksman's coat with a padded shoulder, Dwight is laughing
     as he attempts to assemble Toby's Winchester .22.

               'Turkey shoot' is just a figure of
               speech.
                             TOBY
               There's no real turkey?
                             DWIGHT
               No, it's just regulation paper
               targets. It's a test of skill.
                      (a beat)
               And, Jack, I just found out
               yesterday that they won't let
               kids shoot.

                             TOBY
               But you said I could!
                             DWIGHT
               I know, but they got it all
               screwed up somehow and told me
               wrong at first.
     Toby starts to argue, but Caroline touches his arm.
                             CAROLINE
               Dwight, you did tell him.
                             DWIGHT
                      (an edge)
               I don't make the rules, Caroline.
               If I made the rules, I might make
               different ones, but I don't make
               the rules.


37   EXT. OPEN FIELD - DAY                                         37
     A sullen Toby stands with Pearl. Dwight is giving his
     name and the entry fee to a MAN. As the Man moves away,
     Caroline stops him and holds out some money.
                              CAROLINE
               Wolff.   Caroline Wolff.
                             MAN
               You mean you want to enter? I
               think it's against the rules.

                             CAROLINE
               Well, that sign says this is an
               N.R.A. club, and I'm a dues-paying
               N.R.A. member. That gives me the
               right to participate in the
               activities of other chapters.
                             MAN
               You'll be the only woman shooting.
     Caroline just smiles. The Man shrugs, takes her money
     and writes down her name.

38   EXT. SHOOTING RANGE - DAY                                    38

     The shooting match has begun. The contestants have ten
     turns to fire ten shots apiece at a large paper bull's-eye
     fifty yards away. The scores and rankings are on a
     portable scoreboard.
     A contestant finishes SHOOTING. There is a pause.
     Everyone watches as his score is raised from behind the
     concrete wall on which the bull's-eye hangs.
     The score comes:     84.
     There is a smattering of applause, and it's Dwight's
     turn.
     From his stance, Dwight looks as if he is a pretty good
     shot. He's nervous, though, because Caroline is going
     to shoot, and he squeezes off his TEN SHOTS in RAPID
     SUCCESSION, hardly pausing to breathe. A pause, and then
     his score is raised: 73. Dwight smiles an inappropriate
     smile and hands the Winchester to Caroline.

     There are a couple of whistles as Caroline takes her
     position, and someone in the crowd yells out, "Oh, Mama,
     shake that thang!" Caroline ignores it, taking her
     shooting stance, which is surprisingly graceful and
     professional-looking.
     She SHOOTS her TEN BULLETS, taking time to breathe once,
     deeply, between each shot. The pause, and her score is
     raised: 93. There is a moment of surprised silence, and
     then the crowd gives Caroline a sincere round of
     applause.

     SAME SCENE - LATER
     Dwight looks stunned, and Toby is almost equally
     surprised.
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                             32.
38   CONTINUED:                                                    38
     On the scoreboard, we see that Caroline is in second
     place and by only two shots. As the next-to-last round
     finishes, Caroline is surrounded by a few people who are
     complimenting her shooting. Dwight's smile is even
     bigger: Oh, he wanted to be the one to win.
     The last round starts. A MAN, evidently the one in first
     place, heads to the shooting alley for his turn. As he
     passes Caroline, trying to rattle her, he speaks
     confidently.
                             MAN
               That second-place trophy ain't
               bad, honey.

                             CAROLINE
                      (big smile)
               Then you won't feel too bad about
               carrying it home, will you?
     Several people laugh, and the Man, bested, turns away.
     Everyone turns quiet to watch the Man shoot. He is
     evidently the one who's nervous, though, for after he
     SHOOTS and waits, the score is raised: 95. There is
     an immediate stir -- Caroline can win if she shoots a
     virtually perfect round.
     Dwight's name is called. He takes his position, but
     clowns around, SHOOTING first left-handed, then right-
     handed, then with both eyes closed.
     His score is raised: 24. There is scattered laughter,
     and Dwight leads it -- hell, it's all a joke to him, his
     attitude says.
     Caroline takes her stance. Rock-steady, she SHOOTS her
     TEN SHOTS and waits. And then it comes: 98. She's won.
     The second-place Man wheels away angrily, but everyone
     else congratulates the laughing Caroline, as an official
     presents her with a small trophy of a gold rifle on a
     pedestal, and a huge ham.
     In the midst of the hubbub, Toby manages to get close
     enough to congratulate his mother. Caroline glances
     toward Dwight as she whispers to Toby:
                             CAROLINE
               That was for you, honey.
                             TOBY
                      (impressed)
               I didn't know you were a member of
               the N.R.A.

39   INT. DWIGHT'S KITCHEN - DAY                                   39
     Caroline, Toby and Pearl enter. Norma is cooking
     Thanksgiving dinner. Dwight WALKS HEAVILY down the hall
     to his bedroom and SLAMS the DOOR.
                             NORMA
               What gives?
                             TOBY
               Mom won the turkey shoot.
                             NORMA
               Oh, boy. Now we're in for it --
               he thinks he's some kind of big
               hunter.
                             PEARL
               Well, he killed a deer once.
                             NORMA
               That was with the car.
     They all laugh.

40   INT. DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON                                  40
     Though there are some occasional sentences like    "Could I
     have the potatoes, please?" or "This dressing is    really
     delicious," mostly there is just silence and the    noise
     of SILVERWARE ON PLATES. Dwight is working hard     on the
     wine.
                             DWIGHT
               I got just one thing to say.
                      (as everyone
                       stiffens)
               I'm sitting at the table with the
               best damn shot in the county!
     Everybody relaxes, and general conversation begins.

41   INT. DWIGHT'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                             41
     Norma plays "Blue Monday" on an upright piano whilst Toby
     sings it. After finishing the song, Norma launches into
     "On Moonlight Bay." Everybody joins in.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

      Toby and Caroline glance at each other and smile.

41A   SAME SCENE - MIDDLE OF NIGHT                              41A
      Caroline, who is sleeping on the sofa bed, returns from
      the bathroom. She sees that Toby's awake on his pallet
      on the floor. She sits on the floor beside him. (The
      whole conversation is conducted in whispers.)
                              CAROLINE
                So what do you think?
                              TOBY
                They're okay. What's that bald
                spot on Pearl's head? Ugh.
                              CAROLINE
                Some sort of infection.
                                TOBY
                Norma's nice.
                              CAROLINE
                They're all nice, but Dwight keeps
                rushing me, keeps talking about
                marriage. And I don't really want
                to get married -- not now anyway.
                               TOBY
                That's fine with me.
                        (a beat; new tone)
                I wish you would've stayed married
                to Dad.
                              CAROLINE
                Oh, don't wish Duke back on me.
                God.
                              TOBY
                That woman he married?    Is she
                really rich?
                              CAROLINE
                Like King Midas. Okay, look,
                we'll go back to Seattle and see
                how things go. I've been thinking
                about taking a course in
                stenotyping. A court reporter's
                pay is real high. Kathy got
                engaged, so either I find us
                another roommate or I've got to
                make some more money. And this
                stenotyping thing sounds just
                right. This could turn out good,
                honey.

                                                             35.
42   INT. BOYS' BATHROOM AT SCHOOL - DAY                           42
     Toby, Terry Silver and Terry Taylor lounge against the
     wall, smoking.
                             TOBY
               I mean I blew it off, man -- I
               blew his fuckin' turkey's head
               off.
     Terry Silver takes a long slow drag on his cigarette.
     The other boys glance at each other: they don't buy it.
                                TERRY TAYLOR
               With a .22.
                               TOBY
               Fuckin' A.    Winchester .22.   Pump.
                             TERRY TAYLOR
               Wolff, you are so full of shit.
                             TOBY
               Don't believe me -- see if I care.
                             TERRY TAYLOR
               All a .22 bullet would do is make
               a hole in his head.
     Toby takes a drag on his cigarette.
                             TOBY
               One bullet, maybe.
                             TERRY TAYLOR
               Oh. Oh, I see -- you hit the
               turkey more than once. While he
               was flying. In the head.

     Toby nods. Silver     and Taylor howl with laughter.
     Furious, Toby says    "Fuck you" over and over. He pulls
     out a rat-tail and    scratches the words "FUCK YOU" onto
     the soft paint of    the bathroom wall.

43   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - AFTERNOON                           43
     Toby stands at the top of a small hill with Terry Silver
     and Terry Taylor. They are too casual, their faces too
     innocent: something's up.
     They wait until a middle-aged man raking leaves turns
     and disappears around a corner. Then the three of them
     open the door of a car, take off the emergency brake, and
     start it rolling down the hill.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

43   CONTINUED:                                             43
     The car rolls silently down the hill. It CRASHES into
     another car at the bottom, making a LOUD NOISE.
     The three boys run like the wind out of sight.

44   INT. CAROLINE AND TOBY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                     44
     Caroline, Toby, Marian and Kathy sit at the table eating
     dinner.
                             KATHY
               ... exactly what I wanted for my
               dress. It's a Simplicity pattern,
               and I'm pretty sure I can make it
               myself. It's got big puff
               sleeves...
     Caroline takes out a cigarette. Then everybody jumps
     as Toby yells and jumps up knocking his chair over
     backwards.
                             TOBY
               Oh!
     Toby grabs Caroline's lighter, and begins to imitate
     Dwight: saying, "Oh!" and "Oh, yes!" and Oh, my!"
     and "Here, let me!" and "I'll do that!"
     It's a mean, accurate imitation of Dwight. All three
     women laugh in spite of themselves. Caroline keeps
     saying "Jack, that's enough," and Marian says, "Dwight's
     not that bad." But they can't help laughing. Toby
     offers the other two women a light, then offers a broom,
     the back door, and the refrigerator a light.


45   INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY                                45
     The principal, MR. SHIPPY, sits behind his desk. Toby,
     looking scared, sits across from him. A secretary lets
     Caroline into the room. Mr. Shippy rises and introduces
     himself. Caroline doesn't respond to the introduction.
                             CAROLINE
               What did he do?
                             MR. SHIPPY
               He violated the school property
               and flouted the law.
                             CAROLINE
               Can you say that in English?
                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                           37.
45   CONTINUED:                                                  45
                             MR. SHIPPY
               He wrote obscene words on the
               wall.
                              CAROLINE
                      (to Toby)
               Did you do it?
                      (as he shakes his
                       head "no")
               He didn't do it.
                             MR. SHIPPY
                      (strong)
               He wrote obscene words on the wall.

                             CAROLINE
               What obscene words?
                             MR. SHIPPY
                      (after a beat)
               'Fuck you.'
                             CAROLINE
               That's one obscene word.
     Mr. Shippy looks stymied.   There is a pause.
                              MR. SHIPPY
               Look, Mrs. Wolff, Jack's teachers,
               like him but they think he's fallen
               in with the wrong kind of friends.
                      (peers at Toby's
                        hand)
               Is that nicotine stain on your
               fingers?
                      (as Toby shakes his
                        head "no")
               I hope not. Let me tell you a
               story: I started smoking in
               college. Two packs a day. I ate
               'em.
                      (a beat)
               One night I went to have a
               cigarette and lo and behold, the
               pack was empty. I went downstairs
               and started to rummage through the
               garbage cans. But as I reached
               down -- I mean, right down into a
               garbage can -- I suddenly thought,
               'Whoa. Hold on right there,
               Buster.' I went back to my room
               and to this day I haven't smoked
               another cigarette.

                              MR. SHIPPY (CONT'D)
                       (a beat)
                After that, every day I saved the
                exact amount of money I would've
                spent on cigarettes. In three
                years, I put it all together, and
                you know what I bought? I bought
                myself...
                       (a dramatic pause;
                        big finish)
                ... a Nash Ambassador.
      Caroline gives a bark of laughter. She brings out a
      handkerchief and coughs, as if she has a cold. Mr.
      Shippy looks puzzled.

                              MR. SHIPPY
                Well, back to the point:   I think
                two weeks' suspension.

46    INT. CAROLINE AND TOBY'S HOUSE - SAME DAY (LATER)              46
      Caroline and Toby enter the house. Caroline goes into
      the bedroom, shuts the door. Toby sits on the couch.

46A   SAME SCENE - NIGHT                                             46A
      Late afternoon sun slants through the venetian blinds.
      Toby sits exactly as he sat before. Then Caroline comes
      out of the bedroom, ominously calm. She sits down.
                              CAROLINE
                So what shall we do?

                              TOBY
                What do you mean?
                               CAROLINE
                Ever since Duke and I got divorced,
                you're a different boy. I know
                he never calls you and I could
                kill him for it -- but that's how
                Duke is. And Gregory's in
                Princeton now, so I guess...
                       (refocusing)
                So what shall we do? Because this
                isn't working.
                       (a beat)
                We barely have enough money,
                Kathy's moving out, and on top of
                it all, you've gone wild. You
                lie...

                No I don'...
                              CAROLINE
                Yes, you do. You steal from
                Marian's purse -- I just can't
                handle you anymore, and it scares
                me. I don't know what to do.
                So, you tell me what to do.
                              TOBY
                       (he means it)
                I can be better. I will be.
                       (it bursts out of
                        him)
                And I hate the way I am anymore!
                I don't know why I do it!
                       (a beat)
                What about that stenotyping
                thing you were gonna do?
      With peculiar intensity, Caroline speaks in a soft,
      odd voice:
                              CAROLINE
                It won't happen. It won't happen.
                It won't happen. Things aren't
                going to turn out well, things
                aren't going to start looking up,
                and it's never going to be like
                heaven on a June day. There is
                no uranium. There is no
                stenotyping. There is no C.P.A.
                license. There isn't...
      She stands for a few moments as if listening for a
      far-off sound.
                              CAROLINE
                ... I talked to Dwight: after
                Christmas, he wants you to come
                up to Concrete and live with him
                for a few months -- go to school
                there.
                              TOBY
                What are you going to do, just
                give me away to him?
                              CAROLINE
                If you two can get along, if it
                works out, then I guess he and I
                might get married.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             40.
46A   CONTINUED:   (2)                                             46A
      The two stare at each other.
                              CAROLINE
                I can't think of anything else to
                do. But first I want your
                approval.
      Again the two stare at each other.
                                   TOBY
                All right.
      Caroline nods, turns away.


47    INT. CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY                            47
      Christmas is over: a few scattered pieces of wrapping
      paper lie scattered on the floor, and a small Christmas
      tree with bubble-lights glows in a corner.
      Caroline shuts a suitcase and looks at Toby.
                              CAROLINE
                I put in both your sweaters. You
                wear them now, the nights are so
                chilly up there.
                                   TOBY
                Okay.    I will.
                              CAROLINE
                You don't have to go if you don't
                want to, honey.
                                   TOBY
                No, it's okay.       I'll go.
      O.S. we hear a KNOCKING and Dwight's cheery voice.
                              DWIGHT (O.S.)
                Here I am, you lucky people!

48    EXT. CAROLINE AND TOBY'S HOUSE - DUSK                        48
      Dwights hustles    the bags into the trunk, tells Toby to
      kiss his mother,    and hops into the car, all smiles, all
      cheeriness. The     Buick pulls away, leaving Caroline
      white-faced and    miserable.

                                                               41.
49   INT. BUICK - NIGHT                                              49
     Dwight    takes a pull from a pint bottle of whiskey and
     gives    Toby a sneering, contemptuous look. Toby reaches
     over,    SNAPS ON the RADIO. Immediately Dwight SNAPS IT
     off.     Then, in the headlight's glare, Toby sees a dark
     shape.
                                TOBY
                 Hey, look:   is that a raccoon or
                 a beaver.
     Dwight swerves deliberately to hit the animal. There is
     a sickening THUMP, and Dwight stops. As he backs up:
                               DWIGHT
                 Go get it -- the pelt's worth
                 fifty bucks, minimum.
                               TOBY
                 That thing's probably got rabies...
                                DWIGHT
                        (low)
                 Get it!

50   EXT. ROAD - NIGHT                                         50
     Toby moves to where the dead beaver lies on its back,
     its eyes open, in the red glow of the taillights. Toby
     picks the thing up and lugs it back toward Dwight, who
     has the trunk open.

51   INT. BUICK - NIGHT                                              51
     Dwight is still drinking, between swallows, he gives Toby
     sneering glances. Dwight is driving very fast. The
     road begins a series of curves. Dwight doesn't slow
     down, and the TIRES begin to SCREAM on the curves.
     The road runs along a steep gorge. Dwight increases
     the speed, and the car begins to fishtail.
                               TOBY
                 I'm a little sick to my stomach.
                               DWIGHT
                 Sick to your stomach?   A hotshot
                 like you?
                               TOBY
                 I'm not a hotshot.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                             42.
51   CONTINUED:                                                    51
                             DWIGHT
               That's what I hear. I hear you're
               a real hotshot. Come and go where
               you please, do what you please.
               Isn't that right? Yeah, regular
               man about town. Performer, too.
               That right, Jack? You a performer?
                             TOBY
               No, sir.
                             DWIGHT
               That's a goddamned lie.
     Dwight keeps glancing from the road to Toby, and back
     again.
                             DWIGHT
               If there's one thing I can't
               stomach, it's a liar.
                             TOBY
               I'm not a liar.
                             DWIGHT
               Sure you are. You or Marian. Is
               Marian a liar? She says you're
               quite the little performer. Is
               that a lie? You tell me that's a
               lie and we'll drive back to Seattle
               so you can call her a liar to her
               face. You want me to do that?
                             TOBY
               No.

                             DWIGHT
               Then you must be the one's a liar,
               right?
                      (as Toby nods)
               And you're a performer?
                             TOBY
               I guess.
                             DWIGHT
               You guess? You guess? Let's see
               your act. Go on. Do your act.
                      (when Toby is silent)
               I'm waiting.
                             TOBY
               I can't.

                                                             43.

               Sure you can.

               No, sir.
                                DWIGHT
               Do me.     I hear you do me.
     Again Toby shakes his head, and then gasps as the CAR
     SKIDS hideously close to the cliff's edge. Dwight is
     oblivious to the danger.
                             DWIGHT
               Yeah, I hear you're good at doing
               me. Here. Do me with the lighter.
               Go on. Take it.
     Dwight holds out the velvet-covered Zippo, driving with
     one hand, and the car is all over the road. Dwight puts
     the lighter back into his pocket. The car slows a bit.
                              DWIGHT
               Hotshot. You pull that hotshot
               stuff around me and I'll break
               every bone in your body. You
               understand me?
                      (a beat)
               You're in for a change, mister.
               You got that? Huh? You got that
               good?
                      (so scary)
               You're in for a whole 'nother
               ballgame.


52   EXT. DWIGHT'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   52
     Dwight's Buick pulls to a stop as Norma, Skipper and
     Pearl come out to meet them. Dwight is calmer now.
                             DWIGHT
               Skipper, go get that washtub out
               back, and Pearl, bring the hose
               around and fill it up. Hotshot
               and me hit a beaver. We'll salt
               him down.
     Skipper and Pearl move out on the run. Dwight slits the
     beaver from throat to testicles, guts it, then pulls the
     skin off.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

52   CONTINUED:                                                     52
                              DWIGHT
                I know you think you're better
                than me. Caroline told me all
                about your rich daddy and your
                prep-school brother, but your
                fancy days are over: you're a
                Concrete boy now. I'm gonna give
                you a big injection of Concrete.
                That's right -- inoculate you.
                Oh, my, yes. You're gonna find
                out that in Concrete we have to
                be able to do more than sing Fats
                Domino songs, we work...
     Skipper and Pearl bring the tub with four blue stars
     painted on its side, Dwight plops the skinned beaver
     into the water. The hairless carcass stands in the
     tub, its chin on the edge. Pearl shudders and turns
     away.

53   INT. DWIGHT'S KITCHEN - SAME NIGHT (LATER)                     53
     Dwight, Toby, Norma, Skipper and Pearl are eating dinner
     at the kitchen table. Norma speaks to Toby.
                              NORMA
                You'll be in Miss Graham's class?
                              TOBY
                Yeah, is she nice?
                               NORMA
                She's okay.   She's pretty.
                              TOBY
                I hate changing schools.
                              DWIGHT
                Speaking of changing, I had a talk
                with Jack on the way up here, and
                he says he wants to be a better
                boy. And that's good, 'cause
                things weren't going well for him
                in Seattle: the police actually
                came to his house to talk to
                Caroline about him. Uh-huh, the
                police.
                              PEARL
                       (very low; to Toby)
                Criminal.

                             DWIGHT
               So here's what I think: I think
               idle hands are the devil's
               workshop, and so I found our Jack
               a little something to do.
                      (to Toby)
               I picked up two barrels of horse-
               chestnuts in the park. You can
               spend your evenings hulling 'em.
               And I enrolled you in the Boy
               Scouts, and you've got a paper
               route, starting Monday, every
               afternoon from three to six-thirty
               -- pays fifty-five bucks a month.
               What d'you say?

     Toby glances around the table, he is subdued.
                             TOBY
               I'll do it.
                      (means it)
               I want to be... better.
                             DWIGHT
               That's what I like to hear. Okay,
               you guys get these dishes cleaned
               up. Let's show Jack how we do it
               in Concrete.

54   INT. SCHOOL ROOM - DAY                                       54
     MISS GRAHAM stands in front of the class.    Toby is midway
     back in the room.
                             MISS GRAHAM
                      (reading)
               'Of course I prayed -- and did God
               care? He cared as much as on the
               air a bird had stamped her foot
               and cried, "Give me".' Now. What
               is the tone of this short poem?
                             GIRL
               Is it religious?
                             MISS GRAHAM
               No -- even though it talks about
               God, I wouldn't say it was
               religious.
                              BOY
               It's sad.

                             MISS GRAHAM
               Well, closer, maybe. But no.
     There is a pause.     Finally, Toby raises his hand.
                                MISS GRAHAM
               Jack?
                             TOBY
               It's angry, sort of bitter.
                             MISS GRAHAM
               Very good, Jack. Bull's-eye.
     From the front of    the room, a tall,   thin, effeminate
     boy, ARTHUR GAYLE,    turns to look at   Toby and holds
     the gaze for three    full beats, then   turns around and
     faces the front.     What the hell does   it mean?

55   INT. SKIPPER AND TOBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                           55
     The room is dark. Skipper is asleep. Toby lies in a
     cot. Dwight leans against the wall near the head of
     Toby's bed. He speaks in a low, reasonable voice:
                             DWIGHT
               ... 'cause I don't believe that
               crap, you know? I believe there
               is such a thing as a bad boy --
               bad clear through. And it's gonna
               be my job to turn you around, to
               kill or cure. Kill. Or. Cure.
               Understand? And I'm up to the
               job, oh yes, believe me, hotshot,
               I am ready, willing and able to
               take you on -- you and that
               jibagoo music you like to sing.
               I'm just the guy to knock that
               music out of your head and put in
               some respect and obedience.
                      (a pause)
               Now your mother has just about
               washed her hands of you -- that's
               obvious, 'cause she's shipped you
               off up here. I mean, she has had
               it with you. She told me: she
               said 'Dwight, I just can't handle
               him anymore.' So don't go crying
               to Mama, 'cause Mama won't listen.
               Mama is sick to death of her baby
               boy.

               a shit about you, 'cause Caroline
               told me they haven't even written
               in over two years. So it looks
               like I'm all you got now -- it's
               just you and me. Feels sort of
               inevitable, doesn't it, hotshot?
               It's like we were fated for each
               other, like I'm the one guy on
               Earth could set you straight.
               And don't you ever think I won't

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

     SERIES OF SHORT SCENES TO INDICATE TIME PASSING

55   A)   (AFTERNOON) Toby delivers papers in a sack filled        55
          with papers slung over one shoulder which thuds
          against his hip with every step making him tilt
          to one side against the weight.
55   B)   (NIGHT) Toby   sits in a utility porch. The floor     55
          around him is  two feet deep in horse chestnuts. With
          a knife and a  pair of pliers he husks the chestnuts.
          His hands are  covered with scrapes and cuts and the
          chestnut hulls  bleed a juice that has dyed them a
          bright yellow.
                             CAROLINE (V.O.)
               Dear Toby, I sure do miss you,
               honey -- the house is like a tomb
               since you left. So quiet. My
               only entertainment tonight was
               watching Marian eat a whole pint
               of ice cream. I hope you're
               liking it up in Concrete. I just
               know you'll try hard in school and
               be good and mind Dwight. I worry
               about you so much, and I hope this
               will be just what you need.
55   C)   (DAY)   Toby rubs futilely at his yellow hands with      55
          a cloth  and watches Norma, who is drying her hair
          in her  bedroom. She bends over so her head is in
          a patch  of sunlight. Toby is riveted by the girl
          and her  hair gleaming in the sunlight.

55   D)   (AFTERNOON) Again see Toby delivering  his papers. 55
          He sees Arthur Gayle coming toward him in the
          street. His hips sway as he walks, and  his head
          tilts to one side. As he and Toby pass  one another,
          he raises one arm and points at Toby.  The he walks
          on.
                             TOBY (V.O.)
               Dear Mom, Thanks for the birthday
               present. It fit fine. You don't
               have to worry so much. I'm okay
               here. The weather is nice, and I
               like Scouts a lot. Dwight took us
               all to see Bridge on the River
               Kwai. I liked it. So things are
               all right with me, except for
               stupid Pearl, who I hate. Don't
               worry all the time...
55   E)   (NIGHT) Dwight introduces Toby at a Scout              55
          meeting. All the other boys have on Scout
          uniforms.
55   F)   (DAY) Toby is on the utility porch  husking the 55
          horse chestnuts. His hands are now  orange. Pearl
          stands in the doorway watching him work. Norma
          appears beside Pearl. Norma's face  turns
          sympathetic.
                             NORMA
               You remind me of that boy in the
               fairy tale who had to spend twenty
               years sifting sand to find a
               golden needle. Remember that one?
          Toby doesn't answer. The two girls move away.    Toby
          sighs, and picks up another chestnut.
55   G)   (DAY) Toby, keeping an eye on the door to make 55
          sure he's unobserved, reaches under the mattress
          of Skipper's bed and pulls out several billfold-sized
          black and white pornographic photographs. The hair
          styles of the women in them are decades old.
          Toby takes the photographs into the bathroom,
          shutting the door behind him.
                             CAROLINE (V.O.)
               Dear Toby, Just a note before
               going to bed. Dwight tells me
               that the two of you are getting
               along like a house afire. I'm
               so glad. I wanted this to work
               out for you. You left your sock
               cap here. Do you need it...?

55   H)   (NIGHT) Skipper is asleep in his bed. Across the 55
          room, Toby lies with his portable RADIO against his
          head. We hear, very, very softly, ROSEMARY CLOONEY
          crooning "Hey, There." He's tired. He's lonely.
          He's miserable.
                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

56   INT. DWIGHT'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON                        56
     Toby and Pearl are playing a card game called "Slap-
     Jack." Toby slaps a card down hard, yelling "I win
     again!" and Pearl pouts.

                              PEARL
               That's no fair. You make me sick.
               I don't know why you have to live
               here, anyway. Daddy says we
               should think of it like you were
               a charity kid.
     Toby takes out his comb, combs his hair a bit, then
     holds it out to Pearl, an exaggerated look of innocence
     on his face.
                             TOBY
               Wanna comb your hair, Pearl?
     Pearl covers her bald spot with one hand.
                             TOBY
               Probably you do, since you've
               got such pretty hair.  I know if
               I had hair as pretty as yours,
               Pearl, I'd comb it all the time.

     Pearl is on the verge of tears. There are THREE TREMEN-
     DOUSLY LOUD FLAT-FOOTED KICKS against the front door.
                             DWIGHT (O.S.)
               Open the hell up! I got us a
               treat!
     Pearl opens the door revealing a beaming Dwight holding
     two dishpans piled high with snow. We see through the

     anywhere.
                             PEARL
               We're gonna have snowcream!

                                                             50.
57   INT. DWIGHT'S KITCHEN - LATER                                 57
     Dwight, Toby, Skipper, Norma, and Pearl are enjoying
     the snowcream.
                             DWIGHT
               ... heard there was a fresh snow
               this morning, so I drove up to
               the mountains. I stopped in a
               field where it was all clean. I
               was finished packing it up high
               when somebody said...
                      (prissy voice)
               This's private property, in case
               you're interested.
                      (normal voice)
               I turned around and there was this
               woman...
                      (he shudders)
               Yechh! Ugliest woman I ever saw
               -- ugly as a madman's ass she was.
               And frowning on top of it.
     Everybody laughs.
                               NORMA
               Oh, Daddy!
                               DWIGHT
               She was!
                              TOBY
                      (to Pearl; soft;
                       happy)
               You're ugly as a madman's ass.
                               PEARL
               No, you are.

                             SKIPPER
               What'd you say to the ugly woman?
                             DWIGHT
               I didn't say nothin' -- I ran.
     Everybody laughs again.    They eat in silence for a beat.
                             DWIGHT
               I'm gonna get you a Scout uniform,
               Jack.
                             TOBY
                      (surprised, pleased)
               Really?
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                              51.

                             PEARL
               Can I join the Girl Scouts?
                             DWIGHT
               I'm getting one for me, too.
               Don't believe in doing anything
               halfway. If you're serious about
               the Scouts...
                      (as Toby nods)
               ... then I want you to do it right.
               We'll do it right together.
     Dwight takes out a magazine entitled Boy's Life.    He
     hands it to Toby.

                             DWIGHT
               I got you a subscription to this.
               I'll take the price out of your
               paper route money.
                             TOBY
               Boy's Life?
                             DWIGHT
               It's the official Scout magazine.
               Tells about what it means to be a
               Scout, what kind of boy you need
               to be, and, oh, about merit badges
               and stuff like that.
     Toby opens the book at random, reads from it.
                             TOBY
               'Suggested good turns a Scout can
               do: assist a foreign  boy with
               some English grammar.  Help put
               out a burning field.  Give water
               to a crippled dog.'  I could do
               those.
                             DWIGHT
               Hell, yes, you could. You're a
               bright kid. I want this Scout
               thing done right, okay?
     Toby nods, enthusiastic, happy.

58   INT. TOBY AND SKIPPER'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON              58
     Toby stands in front of a full-length mirror wearing a
     huge Scout uniform that's been unsuccessfully cut down
     for him.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

58   CONTINUED:                                             58
     The shirt-sleeves have been shortened but the shoulders
     extend two inches beyond the ends of his shoulders. The
     pants legs have been cut off and hemmed but the crotch of
     the trousers hangs down three inches too low, giving him
     a stumpy, dwarfish look. Toby yells to someone O.S.
                                TOBY
               I'm not going.
                             DWIGHT (O.S.)
               The hell you say.
                             TOBY
               I'm not. Cut down Skipper's old
               stuff, and he's twice as big as
               me -- I'm gonna stay home.
                             DWIGHT (O.S.)
               You're gonna shit and fall back in
               it -- that's all you're gonna do.
               Now get out here.

59   INT. DWIGHT'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON                        59
     As Pearl watches Dwight also stands in front of a mirror,
     adjusting his hat. He is resplendent in a brand-new
     Scout uniform. Toby stalks into the room. Pearl laughs
     loudly.
                              DWIGHT
                      (to Pearl)
               Shut your pie-hole.
                      (to Toby)
               You look fine.

                             TOBY
               I look like an idiot.
                             DWIGHT
               You act like an idiot, you look
               fine.
                             TOBY
               You said you'd get me a new
               uniform.
                              DWIGHT
               I said I'd try to get you a new
               uniform. Beside, this one is new
               -- new to you.

               But look at the sleeves and how it
               hangs down between my legs!
                             DWIGHT
               Oh piss and moan -- all you can do
               is piss and moan.
                             TOBY
               Yeah, piss and moan -- I notice
               you're all jazzed up in new stuff.
                             DWIGHT
               They didn't have second-hand
               uniforms in my size.

                             TOBY
               Oh, yeah, pull the other leg, it's
               got bells on it!
     Toby throws himself down on the sofa.
                             DWIGHT
               And what're you gonna tell
               Caroline this weekend? You gonna
               say you wouldn't join the Scouts
               because... him didn't wike his
               widdle uniform?
     Dwight picks up the copy of Boy's Life and thumbs through
     it, He reads:
                              DWIGHT
               'No boy given over to dissipation
               or negativity can stand the gaff.
               He quickly tires and gives up. He
               is the type who usually lacks
               courage at the crucial moment. He
               cannot take punishment and come
               back smiling.'
     Dwight looks at Toby expectantly.   Toby hesitates, then
     gives up.
                             TOBY
               All right, but this stinks.
     Toby walks outside.   Dwight follows.
                             DWIGHT
               Hotshot, you don't know it yet,
               but me and Concrete are in your
               blood. We're going to make a
               man of you yet -- and in years to
               come you'll thank me. You'll
               remember me. Me and Concrete.

                                                             54.
60   EXT. CAROLINE'S HOUSE - DAY                                   60
     Dwight's Buick pulls up and Caroline bursts out the front
     door. She runs to the car and hugs Toby.
                             CAROLINE
               Oh, I missed you!
                                TOBY
               Me, too.
                                CAROLINE
               You look good.     How are you?
                               TOBY
               I'm okay.    I'm fine.

     Dwight comes around the car, kisses Caroline, and the
     three head into the house.
                             CAROLINE
               I said to hell with the budget and
               bought a roast. I made dumplings --
               God, what's wrong with your hands?
                             TOBY
               It's just juice from some
               chestnuts -- it'll wear off.
                              CAROLINE
               I hope so.   My, your hair's short.

61   INT. CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY                             61
     Dwight, Caroline and Marian are having a drink. Toby
     plays FATS DOMINO'S "Blue Monday" on the RADIO, the
     VOLUME LOW.

                             MARIAN
                      (to Dwight)
               Well, it's done him a world of
               good to be up there with you.
                             DWIGHT
               Oh, we have us some pretty good
               times. Don't we, Jack? Have us
               some good times?
     Toby, not looking away from the radio, nods.
                             DWIGHT
               We go to the Scouts together every
               week. He's got a good start
               already on merit badges...

               one for dental hygiene...
                      (to Caroline)
               ... and we had snowcream one
               night, and, oh, just lots of

     Caroline glances at Toby, then at Dwight, then back
     again.

62   EXT. CAROLINE'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON                             62

     Toby and Caroline walk slowly, idly down the rail tracks.
     Toby avoids her eyes.
                             CAROLINE
               How is it in Concrete?

                             TOBY
               School's school. My grades are
               okay.
                             CAROLINE
               You haven't been in any trouble?
                      (as he shakes his
                       head)
               Good. How're you and Dwight?
                             TOBY
               He made us all snowcream, like he
               said.
                             CAROLINE
               Stop that, honey.

                      (stops walking)
               Well, you've got your eyes out of
               focus. Look at me. Now, are
               things all right?

                Well, good. I'd feel awful if it
                hadn't worked out.
     A pause.

                              CAROLINE
                I told Dwight I'd marry him. In
                two weeks. I don't know what else
                to do. I mean, he's been helping
                me with the rent since Kathy left.
                And you need a father. I think
                it's the best thing all the way
                around -- what d'you think?
     There is a pause as they look at each other.
                              TOBY
                I think it's the best thing.
                              CAROLINE
                I think it's the best thing, too.
     Caroline smiles, smooths his hair, then goes into the
     house. Toby continues to walk. Suddenly, he spins
     around and tears out toward the house. By God, he'll
     tell her just what's been going on. He bangs through the
     front door and up the stairs.

     Toby stops dead as he sees Dwight and Caroline locked
     in a busy kiss. He stops dead and shrinks back into the
     hallway, defeated.

     Toby is alone in the room    in his Boy Scout shirt and hat
     in front of a mirror. A     copy of Boy's Life magazine is
     open in front of him with    drawings of Indians performing
     sign language. Watching     himself in the mirror, Toby
     makes a sign.

                Hungry.
      He makes another sign.
                                 TOBY
                Food.
      He makes another sign.
                                 TOBY
                Want.
      He makes another sign.

                                 TOBY
                Great mystery.
      He makes another sign.
                                 TOBY
                Father.
      He stares silently at himself in the mirror.

A65   INT. DWIGHT'S LIVING ROOM - DAY                             A65
      Tarpaulins are everywhere. Toby stands surrounded by
      seven five-gallon cans of paint. Carrying paintbrushes,
      Dwight enters, dressed in old clothes singing "In The
      Still Of The Night."
                              DWIGHT
                Now that's a song. Not all this
                Elvis Presley shit. Elvis sings
                about like I do brain surgery.
      He imitates Elvis -- moves his hips slightly and sings a
      few notes:
                              DWIGHT
                '... uh-huh-huh, my blue suede
                shoes.'
      Dwight gives Toby a flash of his teeth and Toby smiles
      back.
                              DWIGHT
                Let's get this place ready for
                Caroline.
      They begin painting.   After only a few strokes, though,
      Toby looks doubtful.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                               58.

                                  TOBY
                 It's so white.
                               DWIGHT
                 I got a good deal on this paint.
                        (stands back;
                         appraises)
                 It'll darken up when it dries.

65    SAME SCENE - LATER                                             65
      The walls and ceiling are almost finished, but the paint
      has not darkened.

      As he paints, he absentmindedly sings "Blue Suede Shoes."
      Then he stops painting, as he notices Toby looking at the
      walls.
                                DWIGHT
                 What?   I like it. It looks clean.
                               TOBY
                 Yeah, but it makes everything else
                 look so dark.
      Dwight's face changes.      He has an idea.

           On the SOUNDTRACK, ELVIS BLASTS OUT "Blue Suede
           Shoes." Dwight and Toby paint the coffee table and
           lamp base white.
65    B)   SAME SCENE - LATER                                        65
           Dwight and Toby, working faster, are painting the
           end tables white.

           The walls and ceiling are white, Dwight and Toby are
           painting the dining table white.

          Dwight and Toby are painting the cabinets and kitchen
          table white.
65   F)   INT. LIVING ROOM - NEXT MORNING                        65
          Everywhere we look is white, the walls, ceiling,
          furniture -- all of it. Only the old Baldwin upright
          piano has escaped painting. Dwight eyes it
          suspiciously.
                             DWIGHT
               Sort of stands out, doesn't it?

                             TOBY
               Yeah, you could say that.
65   G)   SAME SCENE - LATER                                     65
          They paint the Baldwin white. Dwight hesitates, then
          starts to paint the foot pedals.
65   H)   SAME SCENE - LATER                                     65
          Dwight's face tells us that something still doesn't
          suit him. He glances at Toby, Toby nods, and they
          converge on the piano.
65   J)   SAME SCENE - LATER                                     65
          Very carefully, Dwight and Toby finish painting the
          dark ivory keys to match the rest of the room. ELVIS
          SCREAMS OUT the last line, "You can do anything, but
          stay off of my blue suede shoes!"

          They stand up, look around -- Arctic white is every-
          where. Dwight likes it. Toby is less sure.
     The MONTAGE ENDS.

66   EXT. DWIGHT'S HOUSE - DAY                                   66
     Skipper and Norma are carrying Caroline's suitcases into
     the house from Dwight's Buick. From inside the house we
     hear a WOMAN'S LAUGHTER.

67   INT. DWIGHT'S LIVING ROOM - PARALLEL TIME                   67
     Caroline is trying to stifle her laughter, as she stares
     at the wilderness of white. Dwight and Toby, Skipper,
     Norma, and Pearl all stand watch.
                                                 (CONTINUED)

               Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry... don't
               know what's the matter with me...
               you're right... it does look
               clean...
     But she can't stop laughing.    Her laughter has just a
     tinge of hysteria.

68   INT. SMALL CHURCH - MORNING                                     68
     Dwight and Caroline are being married. Caroline wears
     a pale blue suit, and Dwight looks good in a navy single-
     breasted. Aside from Toby and Dwight's children, the
     only guests are Marian, Kathy, and three people we
     haven't seen before -- friends of Dwight's.

69   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT                 69
     The bed is a rat's nest of twisted sheets as Dwight   and
     Caroline make love. He takes his lips away from
     Caroline's breast and moves so that his head is at   the
     bottom of the bed. Holding her foot up, he kisses    the
     instep, then runs his tongue over the same spot and   then
     down under the arch of her foot. A sexy scene.
                             DWIGHT
               M-m-m. There's not a straight
               line on you -- everything's
               curved.
     Caroline draws him up   to her, and they kiss. Then
     Dwight turns Caroline   on her side, away from him, pre-
     paring to enter her.    Caroline makes a small sound of
     protest, turning back   toward him.
                             CAROLINE
               Oh, Dwight, not like that.    Not
               this time -- not tonight.
                             DWIGHT
               It's good this way.
                             CAROLINE
               But I want to see your face while
               we make love.
                              DWIGHT
                      (uncomfortable laugh)
               Oh, no -- I just don't... uh...
               like that way.

69   CONTINUED:                                             69
     Dwight continues to stroke Caroline, his hands everywhere,
     but now she is unresponsive.
                             CAROLINE
               You mean you don't like to make
               love face to face?
                             DWIGHT
                      (same laugh)
               No, I don't like it. I can't
               handle it -- I don't like to see
               the face.
                                CAROLINE
               You mean ever?

     Dwight murmurs an assent.    Caroline is appalled.
                             CAROLINE
               But that's grotesque...
                             DWIGHT
                      (stung; flares up)
               Look, you can get it doggie-style
               or you can get it laying on your
               side -- those are your only
               choices. This is my house, and I
               get to say. Wherever McGinty sits
               is the head of the table, you
               know?
     Disgusted, Caroline turns back away from Dwight. He
     shifts down on the bed a few inches, again preparing to
     enter her.


70   INT. KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING                                  70
     Toby is eating toast at the kitchen table. Norma has
     made a big breakfast, and she hurriedly pours the coffee
     when she hears Dwight and Caroline's bedroom DOOR OPEN.
                             NORMA
               Happy Wedding Breakfast!
     Caroline's eyes    are red and swollen. Dwight turns ON a
     RADIO, sips his    coffee, and chats with Norma. Toby gives
     Norma's rear-end    an appreciative glance, then comes up
     behind Caroline,    speaking sotto voce:
                             TOBY
               So how's the bride?
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                             62.

                               CAROLINE
               Don't.
                             TOBY
               The bride doesn't want to chat?
                               CAROLINE
               Stop it.
                             TOBY
               Well, the bride is sure snotty
               this morning.
     Smiling, Toby waits for some response to his teasing,
     but there is none. She turns away and sits at the table.


71   EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - AFTERNOON                     71
     Toby, his news bag slung over his shoulder, stands
     talking idly with two boys from school, OSCAR BOOKER and
     JIMMY VOORHEES. One of them says, "Uh-oh," and jerks his
     head to indicate where Toby and the other boy should
     look.
     They look in the direction indicated, and see Arthur
     Gayle coming down the road toward them, followed by a
     small black dog called Pepper. As the boys watch
     Arthur's approach:
                             TOBY
               What's his name again?
                               OSCAR
               Arthur Gayle.

                               JIMMY
               What a homo.
                             TOBY
               He sure walks like a girl.
                             JIMMY
               And runs like one and talks like
               one and throws like one. Probably
               takes a pee like one too -- just
               squats right down.
                             TOBY
               He smarted off to me the other
               day -- told me I was a bourgeois.
                             JIMMY
               What the frig's a bourgeois?
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                         63.
71   CONTINUED:                                          71
                             OSCAR
                      (to Toby)
               Call him a sissy.
                              TOBY
               Why?
                             OSCAR
               Just see what he says.
                              JIMMY
               Yeah, do it.
     By this time Arthur is next to them. Smiling a superior
     smile, he stops and glances at all three of them as if
     they were just the oddest things he's ever seen. Then
     his eye falls on Toby's yellow hands.
                             ARTHUR
               Oh, my, my -- look at all that
               yellow: Didn't your mama teach you
               to wash your hands after you pee?
                              TOBY
               Oh, shut up.
                             ARTHUR
                      (rolls his eyes;
                       heavily sarcastic)
               Now that's what I like -- an
               insult with some originality.
               Did you just make that up? Just
               now? So clever.
                             TOBY
               Why don't you take a long walk
               off a short pier?
                             ARTHUR
                      (though he's not
                       nearly close enough
                       to smell Toby's
                       breath)
               Excuse me, but has anyone ever told
               you your breath would gag a maggot?
     Both of Toby's friends laugh.
                             TOBY
               Well, at least I'm not a great
               big sissy!
     Two things happen instantly: the superior smile vanishes
     from Arthur's face, and Toby's friends exchange a single
     expectant look: "Here it comes."
                                                (CONTINUED)

71   CONTINUED:   (2)                                             71
     Without warning, Arthur swings a fist at Toby, catching
     him on the ear. Arthur's second blow hits him in the
     back of the head.
     The fight is on.
     Arthur throws   punches sidearm, with lots of wrist action,
     but there are   so many of them. Before Toby can react,
     Arthur has hit   him four times, including one wild haymaker
     that puts Toby   on his knees.
     While Toby's still on his knees, Arthur tries to kick
     him in the stomach. The kick is deadened by the papers
     in Toby's bag, Arthur bends over Toby, screaming as if he
     has lost his mind:

                             ARTHUR
               GET UP! GET UP, YOU SON OF A
               BITCHING MAGGOT GAGGER! I'LL
               STOMP YOUR GUTS OUT! I'LL KILL
               YOU!
     Toby gets up, and again Arthur sails in with those wild
     roundhouse swings. Then Toby gets in a solid punch to
     Arthur's face that rocks the bigger boy back on his
     heels. Arthur grabs his head and roars like a wounded
     buffalo. Almost immediately Arthur's eye puffs and
     begins to swell shut. Snot streaming from both nostrils,
     still roaring, Arthur flies at Toby again. Toby closes
     with him, to hold those flailing arms still, and the
     two stagger around the street like drunken dancers.
     They separate, exchange a few blows, then grapple with
     each other again.
     Then Arthur hooks Toby's leg, trips him, and the two
     roll off the shoulder of the road and down an embankment.
     They hit the muddy bottom of the gully still hitting,
     flailing, kicking -- first Toby is on top, then Arthur,
     then Toby, then Arthur. By now they are panting, each
     breath is a heave, a gasp. Then, suddenly, Arthur gives
     out completely -- he falls on top of Toby, pressing him
     deeper into the mud. With his last bit of strength Toby
     throws the bigger boy off him and sits up, while PEPPER
     BARKS FURIOUSLY at him and threatens to nip his leg.
     Toby staggers to his feet and starts to climb the gully.
     He looks relieved -- at least it's over.
     No, it's not.
     From behind him he hears three words.
                               ARTHUR
               Take it back.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                               65.
71   CONTINUED:   (3)                                                71
     Toby turns   to see a bloody-faced, swollen-eyed Arthur
     clambering   up the hill after him, like some monster
     that won't   die. Both boys reach the top and stand
     facing one   another.
                                 ARTHUR
                Take it back.
     Arthur's words are not angry anymore.    Toby's worn out
     too...
                                 TOBY
                Okay.
                                 ARTHUR
                Say it.
                               TOBY
                Okay.   I take it back.
                              ARTHUR
                No, say 'You're not a sissy.'
     Toby glances at Oscar and Jimmy. Their faces are gleeful
     but he doesn't care what the hell they think.
                              TOBY
                You're not a sissy.
     Arthur immediately turns and walks away, but Toby ignores
     them and walks away in the opposite direction, delivering
     his hated newspapers.

72   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON         72

     Caroline is painting the white walls a soothing buff
     color.  On the sofa lie half-finished curtains she's
     making.  She is totally focused. She hears Toby, turns,
     sees his filthy clothes. Her shoulders sag.
                              CAROLINE
                I won't do it, you know. I won't
                be a referee between the two of
                you.
                                 TOBY
                Who asked you?
                              CAROLINE
                You both do. You do. Just by
                coming home like this you ask me
                to take your side when he raises
                hell.

                             CAROLINE (CONT'D)
               Well, the answer's 'No.' I'm going
               to make this marriage work. No
               fights.
                             TOBY
               Oh, the bride is calm.   Who the
               hell cares?
     Caroline refuses to argue. She picks up a piece of
     material and holds it up to the window to see if her
     choice of color was a good one.
                             CAROLINE
                      (to herself)
               ... seems like this place is so
               ugly. Seems like everywhere I
               look there's something... ugly.

73   INT. SKIPPER AND TOBY'S ROOM - EVENING                       73
     A worried Toby sits dreading Dwight's arrival. Behind
     him, on the wall, Toby has pinned the covers of fifteen
     copies of the Scout magazine: so that, above Toby's
     head are the words BOY'S LIFE fifteen times.
     There is a MURMUR of VOICES, and FOOTSTEPS COMING toward
     Toby. Toby expects the worst. But, surprisingly, Dwight
     is beaming.
                             DWIGHT
               Who won?
                             TOBY
                      (surprised)
               Uh, well, uh... he's the one can't
               see out of one eye.
                             DWIGHT
               Hot damn! You actually gave
               little Lord Gayle a black eye?
                             TOBY
               Well, it wasn't black yet.
                             DWIGHT
               But it was all puffed up?
                      (as Toby nods)
               Then it was a shiner.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                             67.
73   CONTINUED:                                              73
     Dwight sits down next to Toby, eager for details.
                             DWIGHT
               How'd it start?
                             TOBY
               I called him a sissy.
     Dwight hoots with laughter and slaps his leg.
                             DWIGHT
               Well, he sure's hell can't sue you
               for slander. That boy fights for
               the pink team. Did you make him
               cry?

                             TOBY
               Well... he was just ready to. I
               called him a big-assed, squat-
               to-pee sissy.
                      (as Dwight slaps his
                       leg again)
               I'd have won bigger except he hit
               me when I wasn't looking.
                             DWIGHT
                      (suddenly serious)
               He dry-gulched you. Now that's
               your fault. You gotta keep your
               guard up. There's no excuse for
               getting dry-gulched. I'll show
               you a couple moves after supper
               that'll leave Miss Arthur Gayle
               wondering what month it is.


74   INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING                                    74
     Still excited, Dwight is holding forth for the whole
     family. (We hear THUNDER of an approaching storm)
                             DWIGHT
               ... so he says, 'You and who
               else's army?' 'Just the three of
               us,' I say. 'Me, myself and I.'
                      (a beat)
               Well, after school he's waiting
               for me and he yells something -- I
               tell you, with people like that,
               you got to hurt 'em, gotta inflict
               pain, or they'll never leave you
               alone.

                      (a beat)
               So it was real hot out, okay? And
               there were these horse turds laying
               all over the place. I picked one up
               and went up to him, but not acting
               tough, okay? Acting more like, 'Oh
               gee, I'm so scared, please don't
               hurt me.' Sort of like this:
     Dwight slumps his shoulders, drops his chin, and looks up
     through his eyebrows, a simpering expression on his face.
                             DWIGHT
               So I say, 'Excuse me, but what's
               the problem?' And he starts in on
               me again, blah, blah, blah, and I
               jam a horse turd right into that
               big mouth. Then I give him a
               sucker punch in the breadbasket,
               and he goes down like a...
     Dwight goes on, relishing the story.

75   EXT. UTILITY PORCH - NIGHT                                   75
     A steady downpour falls outside the porch. Dwight and
     Toby, both stripped to the waist, are boxing. Dwight is
     totally serious about this, absolutely sincere.
     The sweat streaming off the two, Dwight patiently corrects
     Toby's movements, or catches the boy's fist to suggest
     better form. Their feet shuffle, squeak on the floor.
                             DWIGHT
               No, no. From the shoulder.
               Straight.
                      (demonstrates)
               Like this. This. Otherwise you
               leave yourself wide open.
                      (as Toby tries)
               Yeah, better, better... and keep
               those feet moving, shuffle,
               shuffle, that's right... now try
               for my face... good...

76   INT. LIVING ROOM - PARALLEL TIME                             76

                      (listens)
               No, he's not mean to me...
                      (listens again)
               No, he's good about that: comes

               Oh, Marian, I don't know -- maybe
               I just got my hopes too high,
               although I don't think so. All I
               want is a little...

               ... a little son-of-a-bitching
               sweetness. That's all.
                      (listens; laughs)
               You think so, huh? You always did
               have an eye for Dwight, didn't
               you?

                       Dwight and Toby)
               The thing is, he's out on the
               porch teaching Jack to box right
               now. I keep thinking if I can
               hang on, things'll settle down.
               If I can just hang on long enough,
               it'll work out and my kid'll have
               a father. You know?

77   EXT. UTILITY PORCH - LATER                                    77
     Both Dwight and Toby sweating heavily.    They lean against
     a wall, resting.

                             TOBY
               You said you'd show me how to
               dry-gulch somebody.
                             DWIGHT
               Okay. Now you can always  kick
               somebody in the balls, but I like
               this one better: What you  do is
               hit 'em in the throat with the
               side of your forearm. You  wait
               'til -- hah!
     Without warning, Dwight lunges at Toby and swings the
     side of his arm toward Toby's throat. Toby dodges
     wildly, falling backward over a box of sports equipment.

               Now that's dry-gulching. Hit 'em
               in the throat, but do it before
               they're expecting it. Now you try.
                             TOBY
               I'm afraid I'll hurt you.
                              DWIGHT
               You won't.
                              TOBY
               But I might.
     Finally Toby gives a half-hearted "Hah!" and swings the
     side of his forearm toward Dwight's throat. Dwight
     catches the arm easily.
                              DWIGHT
               Come onnn.   You're not trying.
     Again Toby hesitates, again he says "Hah!" and gives a
     lukewarm swing at Dwight's throat.
                             DWIGHT
               Well, don't go all shy and delicate
               on me -- you're as sissy as little
               Miss Arthur Gayle. Yeah -- I'll just
               call you 'Little Miss Jackie Wolff.'
               Ooh, my, yes -- Hello, Jackie.
     Toby's eyes flare up, then he lowers his head, biting
     his lip, sniffling a bit.
                             DWIGHT
               Aw, Jesus Christ, if you're gonna --

     Without warning, Toby lunges at Dwight, screaming "HAH!"
     trying for the man's throat. Caught off guard, Dwight
     stops the main force of Toby's arm, but is slammed onto
     the ground stunned.
                             TOBY
               You just about got dry-gulched, my
               man.
     Dwight manages a grin, but he is not happy to have been
     bested.

78   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                    78
     Dwight and Caroline lie on the bed, kissing passionately.
     It is clear that Caroline is as excited as Dwight.

      The rest of the word is jerked out of her as Dwight turns
      her onto her side, away from him, and proceeds to make
      love again in his favorite manner.
                              DWIGHT
                You just don't know what's good,
                Sugar. You're too tense. You
                just relax and Dwight'll take you
                on a little trip. Okay? You'll
                have a good time.
      Caroline closes her eyes.

78A   SAME SCENE - HOURS LATER                            78A
      Dwight leans back against the headboard of the bed.
      Caroline sits between his legs, her back against his
      chest. With one hand, Dwight strokes Caroline's hair.
      The other hand is curled around her throat.
                              DWIGHT
                ... are the prettiest thing I've
                ever seen. I mean it. You are.
                The way your hair curls up right
                there. So pretty. I just love
                you so much. I don't know what
                I'd do if you ever left me. I
                couldn't take it.
                       (smiles)
                Guy I knew in the Navy had a
                saying: 'If you love her, here's
                what to do: Let her go visit
                places new. If she loves you,
                she'll come back to you.   If
                she don't come back... hunt the
                bitch down and kill her.'
                       (laughs)
                That's awful, I guess. I don't
                feel that way, but close. My
                pretty thing...
      We see that Caroline realizes the enormity of her
      mistake.

                                                             72.
79   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - MUCH LATER           79
     Smoking a cigarette and wearing a nightgown, Caroline
     walks to the front door.
     She opens the front door and stands looking out. Then
     she puts her finger on the door and slowly pushes it shut
     with one finger. She does this once more. Then she does
     it again. She turns, walks toward Toby's room.

80   INT. SKIPPER AND TOBY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                       80
     Caroline enters and stands by Toby's bed. She bends over
     the boy and she starts to touch his hair, decides not to.
     She stares at Toby for a few beats.


81   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                    81
     Caroline enters, looks down at the sleeping Dwight. She
     gets back into the bed and Dwight throws a sleepy hand
     over her. Caroline hesitates, but forces herself to put
     a hand over Dwight's.

82   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S KITCHEN - MORNING                  82
     THROUGH a window, Dwight, dressed in his coveralls,
     leaves for work. Caroline is sewing on a machine whilst
     Toby leans against the kitchen sink.
                             TOBY
               ... but ask him again, why don't
               you? I hate it so much.
                             CAROLINE
                      (never stops sewing)
               I asked him a week ago, I asked
               him this morning -- he wants you
               to keep the paper route.
                             TOBY
               Then make him give me the money.
               It's mine, I earned it. It's
               $220.00 already.
                             CAROLINE
               He won't. He says he'll keep it
               for when you really need it.
                              TOBY
               That's not fair. I ought to be
               able to have my own money.
                      (as Caroline shrugs)
               But it's mine.

                             CAROLINE
               You remind me of a baby bird --
               you know those frantic little
               things with their mouths wide
               open, wanting, wanting.
                             TOBY
               Well, at least ask him about my
               gym shoes again. I can practice
               barefoot but for games I gotta
               have shoes.
                             CAROLINE
               I'm not a referee. I won't do
               it.

                             TOBY
               Oh, we know, we know: the bride
               won't argue. The bride won't
               raise her voice.
                             CAROLINE
               Well, I'll tell you what    the bride
               will do: the bride will     get up
               and walk over there and    slap hell
               out of the bride's son.     Now does
               the bride's son want his    face
               slapped?
                             TOBY
               Oh, I hate it here! I wish we
               could just get up and go.
                             CAROLINE
               I don't have another 'get up and
               go' left in me! You understand?
               I'm telling you I've hit a god-
               damn wall. I can't run anymore.
               Now this whole thing isn't perfect
               for me, either... let me impress
               that on you real strong, okay? I
               don't wake up singing every morning.
               But I'm going to make this marriage
               work -- I won't join in any fights,
               you got that? I won't even raise
               my voice!
     Caroline points to the sink.
                             CAROLINE
               See those two roses? He picked
               them for me on his way home last
               night.

               Big deal.
                             CAROLINE
               I'm trying to concentrate on the
               good stuff.
     Norma appears in the kitchen door, wearing her cap and
     gown. She strikes a pose.
                             NORMA
               What d'ya think? I think I look
               like a fool.
                      (shrugs)
               Who cares? Six weeks to graduation,
               and California, here I come!
     Norma snaps her fingers and goes back to her bedroom.
                             CAROLINE
                      (lamely)
               Seriously: you have to
               concentrate on the good stuff.
     Caroline turns her attention back to the curtains.

83   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - SAME NIGHT           83
     (LATER)
     "The Lawrence Welk Show" is ON the TELEVISION. Dwight,
     Caroline, Skipper, Norma and Pearl and Toby watch an
     Irish tenor sing a lugubrious ballad. Dwight stands in a
     corner of the room, his saxophone to his lips. He's
     playing along with the MUSIC, but silently.

     Occasionally he gets overcome and accidentally causes
     the saxophone to squawk.
     The Irish ballad ends, and Lawrence Welk's Champagne
     Orchestra strikes up a lively polka. Dwight takes a sip
     of his drink and grabs Caroline, pulls her to her feet,
     and begins to dance with her.
     A polka can be a decorous, contained dance. He dances
     Caroline vigorously around the living room, out into the
     kitchen, around the table, and then back again.
     Dwight is really good, and Caroline matches him every
     step of the way. Skipper turns the  VOLUME UP and Dwight
     kicks the dance into an even higher, wilder gear: The
     kids clap on the beat, the two whirl and stamp and spin.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                             75.
83   CONTINUED:                                              83
     Faster and faster -- Caroline's heel catches an end table
     and sends it spinning and faster they go. Caroline's
     head is thrown back; she's laughing with pleasure.
     As the MUSIC reaches its CLIMAX, Dwight spins Caroline
     back to the sofa, lets her go, and WHAM! she lands back
     where she was seated exactly on the last note of the
     song. Amid the general laughter and applause, Caroline
     smiles at Toby.
                             CAROLINE
                      (breathy)
               Try to find the good stuff, honey.


84   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON            84
     Dwight and Toby face one another in the living room.
     Both wear their Scout uniforms. Dwight holds a box of
     chocolate-coated cherries in one hand.
                             TOBY
               I'm telling you I didn't.
                             DWIGHT
               And I know damn well you did.
                             TOBY
               Well, you're wrong.
                             DWIGHT
               About some things, yeah. Not
               about this. You're a goddam hog,
               and I proved it.
                             TOBY
               How do you know Skipper didn't eat
               it? Or Norma? Or Pearl?
                             DWIGHT
               I told all three of them to stay
               away from this candy for twenty-
               four hours.
                             TOBY
               Well, how do you know I even ate
               any?
                             DWIGHT
                      (a triumphant smile)
               I counted them. You hogged down
               eleven chocolate covered cherries
               since yesterday afternoon.

               So what?
                             DWIGHT
               So that makes you a hog. I just
               wanted to establish that fact, and
               now I have.
     Caroline and Skipper enter, carrying throw pillows and
     materials.
                             DWIGHT
                      (to Caroline and
                       Skipper)
               Hey. Mr. Hotshot Hog and I've
               just been establishing some facts,
               and what we come up with is this:
               One, he's a pig who gobbles down
               everybody's candy; two, he lies
               about it; three, he lays around
               on his lazy ass day and night
               reading, reading; and four, he's
               not getting any ten-dollar gym
               shoes. That's about what we've
               come up with so far.
                             SKIPPER
               Oh, Dad...
                               DWIGHT

                        voice)
               Oh, Dad!
     Skipper leaves the room. Caroline sits down, begins to
     try various materials as coverings for the pillows.

                             TOBY
                      (to Caroline)

               Why don't you ever help me
               straighten that boy out?
     Caroline doesn't even look up. She threads a needle and
     begins to sew. Whilst Dwight paces around the room.
                             DWIGHT
               All he does is read or listen to
               records or sing.

                       "Blue Monday")
               I'm so sick of that shit! And
               when he isn't singing, he's
               watching T.V.
                      (to Toby)
               And don't say you don't 'cause
               when I come home I always put my
               hand on top of it to see if it's
               warm, and it always is. This is
               the news, kid -- I'm wise to you.
                              TOBY
               Oh, big, big deal, who cares, and
               as long as we're passing out news
               here, I don't want to do my paper
               route anymore.

               hog like you'd rather lay on his
               ass and read, wouldn't you?
               Let me tell you something: you're
               gonna deliver those papers if I
               have to walk behind you with a
               horsewhip ever' step of the way.

               Then give me the money I earn!
                             DWIGHT
               Hell, no. I'm putting that in the
               bank for you for when you really
               need it -- cuss me now, thank me
               later.
                              TOBY
               Mom,  won't you at least make him
               let  me have the shoes for gym?
               How  can I play basketball without
               gym  shoes? I'm the only one who --
     Toby stops suddenly. He looks at Dwight for a beat or
     two, and then speaks in a different tone:
                             TOBY
               It's not the shoes, is it? Or the
               candy. It's me, isn't it? You
               just can't stand the fact of me.
     Dwight glances at Caroline, who still looks at her
     sewing.

               I, well, no, it's not that -- I
               just want you to be well-behaved.
               Your rich daddy 'Duke' doesn't
               care anything about you, and so
               somebody's got to train you, and
               one of the things you've gotta be
               trained about is not to be a hog
               and eat everybody's candy like a --
     Dwight stops short as Caroline says one word.
                               CAROLINE
               Oh.

     Dwight and Toby glance at each other nervously.      What
     is this?
                               CAROLINE
                        (her eyes still on
                         her sewing; soft)
               Oh.
                             DWIGHT
               What's the matter, honey?
                               CAROLINE
                        (louder)
               Oh.
               TOBY                                 DWIGHT
     Are you sick, Mom?                   Don't you feel good?
                               CAROLINE
               OH-H-H-H!

     A furious Caroline raises her head, doubles up both
     fists, and yells.
                                CAROLINE
               I.    Will.   Not. Referee.
                             DWIGHT
                      (taken aback)
               Jack, I think you've made your
               mother nervous, so why don't we
               just go on to Scouts and let her
               rest?
                      (to Caroline)
               You lay down and rest awhile.
     Dwight and Toby grab their caps and hotfoot it out the
     door.

85    INT. SCOUT MEETING - NIGHT                                  85
      Father and son photographs are being taken. Dwight is
      the only father who wears a complete uniform and cap.
      When Dwight and Toby's turn comes, Dwight puts on a big
      smile and throws an arm around Toby's shoulder.
                              DWIGHT
                Check for the tongue tonight --
                you forgot it last week.
                Otherwise you won't get your
                life-saving badge.

85A   SAME SCENE - LATER                                          85A
      Six boys are lying on the floor pretending unconscious-
      ness. Six other boys, Toby among them, are going through
      several life-saving steps such as turning the bodies
      over, checking for pulses, etc.
      The BOY on whom Toby is working is a heavy, pimple-faced
      lout.
      Toby checks if the Boy's breathing is obstructed.
      Gingerly, he tugs on the Boy's chin, starting to open the
      Boy's mouth.
      Suddenly the Boy opens his mouth wide, exposing a half-
      chewed mass of cheese n' crackers. Toby gives the lout
      a knee in the ribs.
                               TOBY
                Bastard.   Swallow that.
                              BOY
                       (laughing)
                Give my pud a big squeeze while
                you're at it, why don't you?
      Toby and the life-savers on either side of him laugh a
      bit.

86    EXT. SCOUT HALL - NIGHT                                     86
      As Toby kneels down to tie his shoelace, a small black
      dog runs up to him. Toby pets it. Arthur Gayle, his
      black eye healed, stands ten feet away.
                              ARTHUR
                You like my dog?
                              TOBY
                Yeah, he's nice.

               Smart, too -- he can talk.

                      (smiles)
               Sure -- I just about believe you.
                             ARTHUR
               Hey, Pepper -- what's on a tree?
     As PEPPER BARKS TWICE:
                             ARTHUR
               Bark! Way to go, Pepper -- pretty
               smart. Oh, I was wondering,
               Pepper -- I wanted to ask you
               something: how's the world
               treating you?
     As PEPPER BARKS ONCE:
                              ARTHUR
               Rough!   Yeah, I know what you
               mean.
                             TOBY
               That's dumb. A little funny,
               though. How come your dad never
               comes to meetings with you?
                             ARTHUR
               I don't have a dad. Never did. I
               sprang full-blown from my mother's
               forehead. You want to walk home
               with me and Pepper?

                              TOBY
               Sure -- compared to a ride home
               with Dwight, it'll be like heaven
               on a June day.

87   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT                               87
     Toby and Arthur are eating ice cream cones and smoking
     cigarettes at the same time. They walk slowly,
     desultorily. Though still effeminate, Arthur has dropped
     much of the flounciness that he uses in public.
                             ARTHUR
               ... Tobias? Your real name is
               Tobias? Toby... Tobias... I like
               it -- it's very elegant.

                             ARTHUR (CONT'D)
               My real parents would probably have
               given me an elegant name, too.
               I say 'real parents' because I
               suspect I'm a foundling. Somebody
               royal -- or at least very, very
               beautiful had me and gave me to
               my poor but honest mother.
                      (a beat)
               Tell me more about you.
                             TOBY
                      (shrugs)
               Every day of my life feels like
               a mile on the Bataan Death March.

                             ARTHUR
                      (laughs)
               I knew I'd like you.
                             TOBY
               Why'd you point at me that day?
                             ARTHUR
               Because you're an alien. You don't
               belong in Concrete any more than I
               do. This place would like to kill
               us because we're different.
                             TOBY
               Oh, come on, Arthur.   That's a
               little dramatic.
                             ARTHUR
               Think so? You know what chickens
               do if one chicken's born with a
               little difference? With a few
               black feathers on its head, say?
               They peck at the black spot 'til
               the chicken's dead -- they can't
               stand the fact that it's
               different. Now we're both
               different. Your difference is
               something other than...
                      (husky-voiced
                       actress)
               ... my difference...
                      (normal tone)
               But we're both aliens here.
                             TOBY
               I don't exactly feel like an
               alien. I've got friends here.

               Yes, and they're fools. And you
               act like a fool when you're around
               them. A prediction: if you stay
               in Concrete, you'll wind up working
               at the A&P -- either that or you'll
               go on a rampage with a hunting rifle.
                             TOBY
               Yeah, and you'll wind up a recluse
               that everybody says likes to dress
               up in his mama's old clothes.

                      (laughs)
               Maybe, maybe, but no matter how
               many times I have to repeat: my
               primary goal's to get out of
               Concrete.
                              TOBY

     Toby and ten other boys are practicing lay-ups. All the
     boys, Toby included, wear basketball uniforms. All the
     other boys wear gym shoes. Toby is barefooted. He is

     Toby tosses his last newspaper into a yard, folds his
     sack, and stands wearily for a few beats.
90   INT. UTILITY PORCH - EARLY EVENING                            90
     A large, ugly DOG next to the box of baseball bats and
     gloves GROWLS and snaps at Toby as he goes past.

     As Toby enters the room, Norma exits, wearing theatrical
     makeup and a gypsy costume. Behind her, drink in hand,
     sits Dwight, wearing a suit and tie, watching the
     TELEVISION NEWS with the SOUND VERY LOW.

               Well, you're purely out of luck,

               on its way to Seattle.

                             TOBY
               But, Dwight, that Winchester was
               mine.
                               DWIGHT
               And Champ's   your dog.     Jesus, I
               trade some   old piece of    crap for
               a valuable   hunting dog,    and all
               you can do   is piss and    moan.

                             TOBY
               I'm not pissing and moaning.

               The hell you aren't. You can just
               make your own deals from now on.

     Toby sits on the front stoop. Caroline approaches
     carrying groceries. She notices Toby's expression.

               Dwight traded my rifle for a dog.
               He says the dog's for me, but it's
               some stupid dog he wanted.

     For a moment Caroline doesn't respond.       Then she nods her
     head.
                               CAROLINE
               All right.    Okay, Dwight. You
               stay here.    Don't come inside.
     Toby nods.   Caroline heads inside, loaded for bear.

     Norma, dressed up    for her play, and Pearl are setting the
     table. Dwight is     fixing himself another drink. Caroline
     enters, puts down    the groceries, and goes to the dish
     cabinet. Calmly,     in total control, she takes a PLATE and
     SMASHES it against    the countertop.

                      (calm)
               Get his rifle back.
                             DWIGHT
               But that dog's a champion!
     Caroline calmly SMASHES another PLATE on the countertop.
                             CAROLINE
               Get his rifle back.
                             DWIGHT
               Am I supposed to go clear to
               Seattle just to get...

     Before he finishes the sentence, Caroline SMASHES a GLASS
     on the countertop.
                             CAROLINE
               Get his rifle back.
                             DWIGHT
               Jesus Christ, woman, I don't even
               know the guy's last name.
     Caroline picks up a bowl.
                             DWIGHT
               All right, all right. The guy's
               supposed to send the A.K.C. papers.
               When he sends 'em, I'll know his
               name and address, and I'll go get
               the god-damn rifle back. Jesus.
     Caroline exits leaving Dwight, Norma, and Pearl with
     their mouths open.

96   EXT. HOUSE - EVENING                                          96
     Caroline walks to Toby, sits next to him on the stoop.
                             CAROLINE
               Well, I did it -- and the bride
               didn't even raise her voice: he
               says he'll get the rifle back as
               soon as the guy who sold him the
               dog sends the papers.
     Toby nods.   Caroline looks up at the evening sky and then
     shrugs.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

96   CONTINUED:                                              96
                             CAROLINE
               'Course, having seen that dog, I
               wouldn't suggest you hang by your
               thumbs 'til those papers come. I
               mean, that dog is ugly.
     Toby gives her a dirty look, but Caroline's smile makes
     Toby grin.
                             CAROLINE
               That's nice -- I haven't seen a
               real smile out of you in a month.
                             TOBY
               Oh, Mom, can't we leave here? I
               hate it so much. You don't like
               it either -- all you do is stick
               your head in a sewing machine
               night and day. Let's just leave
               and start over someplace else.
                             CAROLINE
               'Start over.' Do you know how
               many times I've started over,
               sweetheart? I don't want to do
               it anymore. This is as far as I
               want to go. This place. I have
               to make this work somehow. We do.
               You're fourteen now -- you have
               to help me.
                             TOBY
               But if...
                             CAROLINE
               But me no buts, honey. I told
               you: I've hit a wall. And
               besides, it's not so bad here,
               if you just try to --
                             TOBY
               If you say 'look for the good
               stuff,' I'm gonna get Dwight's
               30/30 and shoot myself!
                             CAROLINE
               Seriously, though: give the place
               a chance. Give him a chance.
                             TOBY
               Great. Just great. What a life:
               I gotta live with Dwight... I got
               a sissy for a new best friend...

                             TOBY (CONT'D)
               I got no rifle... I got no gym
               shoes...
                              CAROLINE
               Well, look on the bright side...
               You got a dog.
     In spite of his disappointment over the rifle, in spite
     of all that Caroline had said about staying with Dwight,
     Toby is happy to see Caroline completely back to her old
     self again, joking with him. He grins and, with the palm
     of his hand, he gives her shoulder a gentle shove. She
     returns the gesture. And the two of them sit on the
     steps, staring into the twilight.


97   INT. ARTHUR GAYLE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY                      97
     Arthur is playing the piano. He and Toby sing an old song
     called "I Wandered Today To the Hill, Maggie." Both of
     them are enjoying it. As they finish the song, Arthur
     says a dry "Will you be able to use your musical
     abilities at the A&P?" Toby laughs and gives him a hard
     elbow in the ribs.

98   INT. TOBY'S ROOM - NIGHT                            98
     Toby is using a nail clipper over a wastebasket when he
     hears:
                                DWIGHT (O.S.)
               Heh Hotshot!
     He looks up just in time to see a flashlight fly through
     the air toward him. He catches it. Dwight stands in
     the doorway.
                             DWIGHT
               If you can tear yourself away from
               your pedicure, I want you to fetch
               me some of that paint from the
               attic.
     Dwight switches the room light off.
                                TOBY
               Yeah.
                             DWIGHT
               Is now too soon.
                                TOBY
               God!

                                                             88.
99    INT. DWIGHT'S ATTIC                                           99
      Dwight and Toby are looking for something. They both
      shine flashlights around the dark attic, illuminating
      old magazines, dolls, etc. Dwight says, "I know I put
      'em up here somewhere." Then Toby's flashlight lands
      on the unusual tub with the four blue stars which had
      held the beaver. Forgotten all this time, the beaver
      has transmogrified into a weird, two-foot high pile of
      what looks like cotton candy. And, hideously enough,
      the cloud-like stuff is still in the shape of the beaver.
      Then Dwight says, "Shit -- the roof must've leaked on
      'em." Toby turns to where Dwight shines his flashlight
      on the ten boxes of chestnuts.
      Also forgotten, the chestnuts are    covered with mold,
      too -- but a different kind: this     is wet, slick-looking
      stuff that rises off the chestnuts    like dough in a
      breadpan. A spasm of rage crosses     Toby's face, and he
      turns and bangs out of the attic.

100   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (LATER)        100
      A drink in one hand, idly fondling Champ's ears with the
      other, Dwight is watching the NEWS.
      On the TELEVISION we see a distraught Lana Turner   and
      her daughter, Cheryl Crane, as the teenaged girl   is
      led into a tall building.  While we see this, and   then
      a photograph of a stockily handsome Italian man,   we hear:
                              NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                ... Cheryl Crane, daughter of Lana
                Turner, was held for questioning
                today in the stabbing death of
                Johnny Stompanato, Miss Turner's
                companion. A spokesman for Miss
                Turner said today that the
                stabbing was an accident, and that
                Miss Turner's daughter will not
                spend even one night in jail for
                what the spokesman called a
                'tragic accident.'
      Suddenly aware of another presence in   the room, Dwight
      turns and sees Toby, who is standing   in the doorway,
      also listening to the NEWSCAST. Toby    is not watching
      the television, though, he is staring   fixedly at
      Dwight.
      Dwight reacts then glances back at the set, where the
      Stompanato murder story continues. He turns slowly back
      to Toby, whose eyes are still locked onto his face. The
      SOUND on the TV FADES.

                                                           89.
101   INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT                                     101
      A WHISTLE FADES UP.
      Toby's basketball game against the Van Horn team is
      starting. Alone among all the other players, Toby wears
      his street shoes. Heavy squarish brogans, they CLOMP,
      and THUD as Toby runs up and down the court.
      The leather soles slip like skates on the highly-polished
      floor, and Toby falls repeatedly. At first the crowd is
      silent, collectively embarrassed at the boy wearing these
      strange shoes. Then Toby takes a particularly hard fall,
      and somebody laughs. The crowd in general takes it up,
      and soon there is GENERAL LAUGHTER whenever Toby's shoes
      SQUEAL particularly loudly, or whenever the shoes trip
      him up or cause another boy to stumble.

      Soon one WOMAN'S HIGH-PITCHED LAUGH DOMINATES the
      gymnasium. The laugh is hideous, shrill and mindless,
      like some ringer planted in the audience of a situation
      comedy.
      Toby sees Norma necking with some guy and is horrified.
      Toby slips and slides, falls and rises. All the while
      his expression is hard as stone: he will get through
      this or die. And, like a mantra, he mutters one phrase
      over and over: "gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get
      out, gotta get out." Finally he makes a basket. One
      VOICE from the audience YELLS out "Okay, kid -- way
      to go!" and then two or three people APPLAUD. Instants
      later, Toby catches a rebound and makes another basket.
      The fickle crowd decides to love an underdog and APPLAUDS
      heartily for the boy in the funny shoes. But Toby's
      expression never changes.


102   INT. DWIGHT'S GARAGE - SAME NIGHT (VERY LATE)              102
      The Buick, rolls silently down the driveway pushed by a
      straining but cautious Toby. Champ runs into the street,
      Toby tries to shoo him away. The DOG BARKS ONCE, and
      Toby quickly opens the car door and lets him in, STARTING
      the ENGINE.

103   INT. BUICK - LATE NIGHT                              103
      Toby drives fast leaving Concrete behind. He turns the
      RADIO ON, and a VOICE bawls out "Oh, Maybelline," Toby
      turns the VOLUME UP, turns it UP AGAIN, so that the MUSIC
      is DISTORTED. Toby begins to accelerate. The needle
      creeps past ninety, and hovers close to one hundred.

103    CONTINUED:                                            103
       Trees flash past in the headlights, occasional cars are
       overtaken and passed in an instant. Toby starts laughing
       hysterically and sings loudly along with the THROBBING
       MUSIC.
       The Buick begins to shudder and wobble -- Toby hits the
       brakes but the Buick spins and goes sideways into the
       ditch. SILENCE.

104    EXT. BUICK - LATE NIGHT                                     104
       The car is caught so that two of the wheels are off the
       ground, and can get no purchase. Toby starts walking
       back toward Concrete.


105    EXT. ROAD - LATE NIGHT                                      105
       Toby and Champ have been walking a long time.   A truck
       comes from behind Toby, pulls over.
                               DRIVER
                 That your car in the ditch back
                 there?
                        (as Toby nods)
                 How'd you do that, anyway?
                               TOBY
                 It's hard to explain.
                                 DRIVER
                 Get in.

106    EXT. BUICK - VERY LATE NIGHT                                106

       The man is winching the Buick out of the ditch.

107    EXT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S HOUSE - DAWN                     107
       Toby silently closes the garage door, the Buick
       inside and heads for the house.

107A   SKIPPER AND TOBY'S ROOM - NOON                              107A
       The clock shows noon. Toby is in bed reading Boy's Life,
       holding a sandwich and trying to stay awake. Suddenly
       Dwight appears. Dwight puts his hands into his pockets,
       leans against the doorway.

                  Your mother said you were sick.
                  Feeling better?
                                  TOBY
                  Yeah, I am.
                                  DWIGHT
                  Good, good.    Get some sleep, did
                  you?
                                TOBY
                  Yeah, I slept about four hours.
                                DWIGHT
                  Must've needed it.
       A pause:
                                DWIGHT
                  Oh, by the way, you didn't happen
                  to hear a funny pinging noise in
                  the engine, did you?
                                  TOBY
                  What engine?
                                DWIGHT
                  I was downtown with Champ a few
                  minutes ago, and I met a guy who
                  recognized him. Said he'd seen
                  my dog this very morning. Told me
                  an interesting story of how he and
                  the dog happened to meet. What
                  d'you think about that?

                                TOBY
                  I don't know what you --
       Suddenly Dwight is across the floor and onto the bed.
       He straddles Toby and slaps him across the face with the
       left hand then the right, again and again.
       Toby holds a forearm protectively across his face.
       Dwight holds both Toby's hands with one of his and, slaps
       the boy's face again and again.
       Finally Toby manages to get his right hand loose.      He
       slams his forearm across Dwight's throat.
       Dwight rears back, choking and gagging. Toby throws off
       the covers and tries to run. Still choking, Dwight
       grabs the back of Toby's hair and forces the boy's face
       down against the mattress.
                                                       (CONTINUED)

       Then he doubles up his fist and slams it into the back
       of Toby's neck. Toby goes rigid with pain. Dwight
       stumbles up gasping for breath.
                               DWIGHT
                 Only me. On this whole earth, to
                 straighten you out. And I will do
                 it kill or cure. Now get your ass
                 up -- you're going to school.

108    EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - NOON                                        108
       A BELL RINGS as Dwight's BUICK SCREECHES to a stop and
       Toby gets out. As he heads toward the doors. Toby then
       turns to stare at Dwight's car. They lock eyes, then
       Dwight smirks and pulls away. Toby watches the car
       disappear, then spins around and walks into the school.
                                                    FADE OUT.
       FADE UP TO:
108A   SAME SCENE - AFTERNOON                                         108A
       The CAMERA is in the EXACT SAME SPOT.
       The school seems a bit seedier, and two newly-planted
       saplings established in the previous scene are both eight
       feet taller, with wide spreading branches.
       Students pour out    the door. Among them Toby, taller and
       a bit heavier, he    now wears black leather boots, and a
       pack of cigarettes    rolled into the sleeve of his T-shirt.
       His hair is still    pure Elvis.

       Toby comes back out the door with four very different
       friends. CHUCK BOLGER, the most reasonable-looking of
       Toby's companions, is the son of a minister. A second
       boy, known as PSYCHO, is a hulking boy with a tendency
       toward sadism. JERRY HUFF is handsome in a pouty, heavy-
       lidded way. His Elvis pompadour is even higher than
       Toby's. ARCH COOK is an amiable simpleton who sometimes
       talks to himself or laughs for no reason.
       Toby and his four friends pile into Chuck Bolger's '53
       CHEVY, and they PEEL OUT.

109    INT. CHUCK BOLGER'S CAR - NOON                                 109
       As the car barrels through downtown Concrete, we see a
       movie marquee reading...

      ... The Apartment, and a five foot poster that says,
      "ELECT JOHN KENNEDY, 1960."
      In the back seat, Psycho pours vodka into a half empty
      can of Hawaiian punch, then takes a huge swig.
                              PSYCHO
                       (screams it)
                Ag-Hhh! Gorilla blood.
                              JERRY
                Oh, Psycho, shut up.
                              CHUCK

                Oh, look -- there goes Carol
                Baumgarten. Ain't she sweet?
                She's hot for Wolff.
                                TOBY
                I wish.
                              CHUCK
                Won't do her any good, though --
                Jack's saving himself for Rhea
                Clark.
                                TOBY
                Knock it off.
                              JERRY
                You know what he said about Rhea?
                Said even the inside of her arm
                turned him on. You slay me,
                Wolff. She is pretty though.

                              ARCH
                       (after a pause;
                        wistful)
                I'd sure like to eat Rhea Clark's
                pussy.
      There is general laughter, mixed with groans.
           JERRY         PSYCHO CHUCK
        God, here we        Eatin' pussy        Jesus, give it
        go again.           is all that         a rest, Arch.
                            man knows.
                                ARCH
                No, I   mean it. I'd like to get
                down   and really grovel on it.
                Spend   about a week with my face
                right   in it.

      There is a pause while all the boys dwell on this thought.
      It sounds good to them.
                                PSYCHO
                Aghhh, pussy!

110   EXT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON             110
      Chuck Bolger's CAR SCREECHES to a halt, and Toby exits,
      followed by an empty Hawaiian Punch can which someone
      tosses after him. Toby gives a wave, starts toward the
      house, and the CAR LAYS RUBBER, while OVER that we hear
      Psycho SCREAMING, "AGH-H-H!"


111   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON           111
      Pearl is setting the table and singing the Everly
      Brothers hit, "Bye, Bye, Love." The passage of two years
      has improved Pearl. Her bald spot has grown back in, and
      she has learned to fix her hair and use makeup. She smiles
      and nods to Toby, never stopping her singing for a moment.
      Toby stands next to her and sings harmony for a few notes.
      It is clear that their relationship has improved. Toby
      stops singing.
                                TOBY
                Where's Mom?
      Still singing, Pearl points to the living room.

112   INT. LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING                              112
      Caroline is watching a newscast of John Kennedy and Harry
      Truman at a press conference outside Truman's Missouri
      office. She hears Toby, turns to him.
      We see that the last two years have marked her. She's
      changed. Her expression is fixed, almost as if she were
      wearing a mask. Even the words are cheerful, but some of
      the old optimism is gone.
                              CAROLINE
                Oh, honey, good news -- Truman's
                going to campaign for him.
                       (lowers her voice)
                I gave twenty-five dollars to his
                campaign office today. I've been
                thinking I'd like to work...
      She is interrupted by Dwight's voice O.S.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                              DWIGHT (O.S.)
                Here I am, you lucky people!
      Toby and Caroline exchange a glance.     It speaks volumes.
113   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                          113
      Dwight, Caroline, Toby and Pearl sit at the table, eat-
      ing. Champ sits by Dwight's chair -- obviously his dog.
      Dwight seems unchanged by the two years.
      Just now, Dwight is in the middle of telling another of
      his "Dwight Is The Best" stories. From the bored faces
      around the table, this is another in a long series.

                              DWIGHT
                ... So the S.O.B. had been on my
                back for a week at work, okay?
                Sayin' I stole his wrench, an'
                poured oil all over his tools, as
                if! Anyway, he went just one step
                too far with old Dwight, okay?
                Spat on the floor as I walked by.
                I turned around and walked back
                to him, acting so dainty and
                humble and scared, you know, all
                innocent -- and the minute he took
                his eyes off me, BLAM, I dry
                gulched him! I shut his water off
                good! Never gave me another
                second's grief to this very day.
      There is a pause.   One more story.   Nobody has much of a
      reaction.

                               CAROLINE
                I heard Kennedy on the news again
                tonight -- I don't know: I hate
                the Democrats and the Republicans,
                but then once in a while somebody
                comes along who doesn't seem
                like...
                        (she searches)
                ... a liar.
                              DWIGHT
                Kennedy -- the senator from Rome.
                              CAROLINE
                He gives me hope.
                              DWIGHT
                I know what he gives you, and it
                sure as hell isn't hope.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            96.
113   CONTINUED:                                            113
                              CAROLINE
                       (laughs)
                It's true he is attractive! And
                it may just be those white teeth
                that I respond to. But I don't
                think so.
                       (a beat)
                I'm going to work for his campaign.
                              DWIGHT
                No. Too many Republicans   in this
                town. They hear my wife's   working
                for the Democrats, they'll  take
                their cars someplace else  to be
                fixed. Bad idea. No.

      There is a brief silence. Suddenly Caroline leans across
      the table and speaks to Dwight in a loud, exaggerated
      disappointed whine:
                              CAROLINE
                Oh, Rickyyy!
                       (louder; same whine)
                Oh, Ricky-y-y! Please let me
                come down and work at the club!
                              DWIGHT
                What the hell are you doing?
                              CAROLINE
                Well, you treat me like Lucy,
                I'll act like her. I'll be
                working for Kennedy's campaign.

114   INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME NIGHT (LATER)                       114

      The four of them are watching "The Untouchables." We
      watch as a frightened man speaks to Al Capone, who sits
      behind a large desk.
                              FRIGHTENED MAN (V.O.)
                       (on T.V.)
                ... please, Mr. Capone, it'll never
                happen again, I swear it. It was
                an accident. I can promise you
                faithfully it won't be repeated.
      Finally Al Capone speaks.   He leans across his desk, bugs
      out his eyes, and hisses:
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                               97.

                       (on T.V.)
                Why don't you take a little ride
                with Frank?
      The man's eyes bulge with fear, and he cries, "No!    No!"
      as two men escort him out the door.
      In the next shot we see a long black car parked on a
      country road, and we hear a SHOT.

115   INT. BATHROOM - SAME NIGHT (LATER)                             115
      Toby is brushing his teeth when Dwight enters.

                              TOBY
                I'll be through in a minute.
      Dwight looks around.
                              DWIGHT
                You left the lid off the damn
                toothpaste again.
                              TOBY
                       (not looking at him)
                Oh, Dwight, is that the best you
                can come up with?
      Angered, but keeping his voice low.   He pushes Toby's
      shoulder.
                              DWIGHT
                This is my bathroom, and I say
                about the toothpaste, got it?
                       (pushes again)
                Huh? Have you? Huh? Now if you
                lived with your daddy Duke and
                his rich wife, maybe things'd be
                different, but he's not here now,
                is he?
                       (high, flutey voice)
                Oh, Duke? Duke, are you here?
                Dukie? Oh, how sad -- Duke's not
                here. Oh, boo hoo!
                       (normal voice)
                My bathroom. I get to say. Got
                that?
      Still Toby doesn't respond -- Dwight reaches out and
      pinches the skin on Toby's waist, hard. Toby still
      doesn't respond, when Dwight begins to twist it. Toby
      spins around, eyes blazing.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

115   CONTINUED:                                              115
                             DWIGHT
                Come on. Oh, come on.     Give me
                an excuse.
      Toby hesitates, then leaves the bathroom, humiliated.

116   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                          116
      Toby exits the bathroom, then sees Caroline in a doorway.
      She's heard it all. They look intently at each other.
      Toby nods and walks on down the hall.

117   INT. TOBY'S ROOM - INSTANTS LATER                             117

      Furious, Toby throws himself onto the bed, and snaps on
      a reading light.
      (Behind him, the wall is now completely papered with
      the front pages of the Scout magazine, so that we see
      the words BOY'S LIFE BOY'S LIFE BOY'S LIFE BOY'S LIFE
      repeated one hundred and twenty times.) Then Toby takes
      a slick brochure from under his pillow -- it's a bro-
      chure of Princeton. Photographs of beautifully tended
      lawns, and students on their way to class. Toby stares
      at the photographs, smoothing the pages carefully, long-
      ing in his face.

118   INT. SCHOOL BUS - NEXT MORNING                                118
      Toby bangs onto the bus, throws himself into a seat
      beside Arthur. He hands a grade card to Toby.
                              ARTHUR
                You didn't pick this up yesterday
                -- congratulations, you got
                nothing higher than a C.
                              TOBY
                Shut up.
      He signs the grade card, saying, "Presto."
                              ARTHUR
                You're gonna get caught some day.
                       (as Toby laughs a
                        moronic laugh)
                You act more like those morons you
                hang around with every day. Aghhh!
                I'm psycho! I'm retarded!

      It's a good imitation of Psycho, and Toby laughs.
                              TOBY
                He hears you do that, you're
                dead. Hey, lemme copy your math
                homework.
                              ARTHUR
                No, but I'll show you how to work
                the problems.
                              TOBY
                I tell you I'm thirsty, you offer
                me a sandwich thank you and fuck
                you.

                               ARTHUR
                Oh, Jack.
                               TOBY
                Oh, Jaaack!
                              ARTHUR
                I take it back you don't act like
                Psycho, you act like Dwight.
                              TOBY
                       (new tone)
                I know it. He's winning. I do
                act like him. I feel like him
                sometimes. I've gotta get out of
                this place or I'm a dead one.
                              ARTHUR
                I know, but you've said that for
                two years.

                              TOBY
                I mean it. I may go live with my
                brother Gregory in Princeton.
                              ARTHUR
                You mean the brother Gregory in
                Princeton who never calls you?
                That brother Gregory?
                               TOBY
                He wrote me.
                              ARTHUR
                And he asked you to live with him?

                              TOBY
                No. But I'm going. Or maybe I
                could go to a prep school like
                Gregory did. Like my dad did.
                              ARTHUR
                What about your grades? And what
                would you use for money?
                              TOBY
                I don't know. Dwight owes me
                over twelve hundred bucks! If I
                hadn't let him keep my paper
                route money, I'd be okay.

                              ARTHUR
                If the dog hadn't stopped to pee,
                he'd have caught the rabbit.
      Suddenly Toby is angry.   He stands up, moves to another
      seat.
                              TOBY
                I think Dwight was right about
                you I think you fight for the pink
                team.
      Toby falls into another seat, then, pulls his head back
      and bangs it against the window. Then does it again,
      harder.

119   EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - AFTERNOON                   119
      His mood even fouler, Toby toils at his paper route. He
      throws the papers against the houses with all his might.
      Suddenly Chuck Bolger's CAR SCREECHES to a stop next to
      Toby. We hear Psycho's "Arghhh!" and Toby climbs into
      the car.

120   EXT. DERELICT CRUSHER PLANT - NIGHT                         120
      We see the Concrete silo dimly-lit in the distance. We
      can read "Welcome To Concrete" on it. Toby is leaning
      against a wall in a large derelict Concrete plant staring
      at the silo. Behind him is a small campfire where the
      other guys are slumped around talking. Toby takes a
      long, angry pull on a bottle of whiskey, then turns
      around and heads toward them.

                enough to drive a 'Vette then,

      The others all laugh at Chuck. Toby has reached the
      group and stands on the lip of the large wooden platform
      that they are on and listens while leaning on a large
      hook.

                Welcome to Concreeee...
      Toby topples over and falls down a bank of rubble. The
      other burst out laughing and hooting. The CAMERA MOVES
      off them and CRANES DOWN to a spread-eagled Toby's face.
      The LAUGHTER ECHOES around the building. Toby begins to
      laugh, but it soon turns to bitter tears.

      Toby enters the small office where Caroline is running
      hundreds of flyers on a duplicating machine. Surprised
      she sees Toby's expression.

                I called Gregory at Princeton.
                       (as Caroline reacts)
                He's sending me applications for
                prep schools. I need you to
                take me to Seattle to take some
                entrance exams.

                              CAROLINE

                with, uh, your school record?

      Twenty-three boys and Toby stand waiting restlessly for
      the tests to begin. Toby looks very different from the
      other intelligent looking, well-bred boys in his Elvis
      hairdo.

      Dwight sits at the table, a drink in his hand. Caroline
      hurriedly prepares dinner. She tosses a milk carton into
      a brimming waste basket, then speaks to Toby, who enters
      the room.
                              CAROLINE
                Take that trash out for me,
                honey.
      Toby grabs the trash and exits.

127   EXT. REAR OF DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S HOUSE - EVENING          127
      Toby opens a metal trash can, dumps the trash, puts the
      lid back on, and then hesitates. He lifts the lid again
      and peers into the trash can, almost hidden, are the tips
      of four white envelopes made of heavy, expensive paper.
      He pulls them up and, though covered with tomato seeds,
      are undamaged.

128   INT. KITCHEN - EVENING                                      128
      Toby walks in, fans out the four envelopes, speaks to
      Caroline.

                Hey, I thought I was helping
                him -- thought I'd save him some
                trouble 'cause he's got no chance
                of getting into some fancy prep
                school.
                              CAROLINE
                You've always got your nose
                pressed up against the bake shop
                window, don't you, Dwight?
                               DWIGHT
                What?
                              CAROLINE
                You feel like everybody else is
                inside, and you're stuck on the
                outside. It turns you mean. It
                turns you ugly. And one day do
                you hear me, Dwight? One day all
                that ugliness is going to snap
                back and hit you in the face.

      Toby has the applications open in front of him. We
      see the words "Official Transcript Required" on one
      application. On another we see spaces for the ap-
      plicant to list "Community Services" and "Athletic
      Achievements" and "Foreign Travel" and "Languages." Toby
      looks despairingly at the forms.

                I got word yesterday that I did
                really well on those tests -- but
                that's not enough. I've got to
                cheat and lie -- but I don't care:
                this is my one chance to get out
                of here!
                             ARTHUR
                No. Why should you get to be the
                one? Why not me?

131   INT. SCHOOL WORKSHOP - DAY                                   131
      Toby is working with a table saw. Suddenly a two-inch-
      thick manilla envelope plops down beside him. He looks
      up to see Arthur standing beside him. Glancing around to
      see that he's unobserved, he checks the contents of the
      envelope: we see school stationery, blank transcript
      forms, and a stack of official envelopes. Toby closes
      his eyes. He's saved.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                                  106.
131   CONTINUED:                                                  131
                              TOBY
                You could leave too, you know.
                               ARTHUR
                No, I've grown progressively fond
                of Concrete. I think I'll stay
                here all alone and dress up in my
                mama's old clothes sometimes --
                like you said.
      Arthur turns and    swishes away. Toby pats   the manilla
      envelope, turns    back to the saw. Suddenly   he jerks,
      looks down, and    sees that the ring finger  of his left
      hand is spurting    blood. Toby says a mild,   astonished
      "Hey," and sinks    to his knees.


132   INT. TYPING LAB - SAME DAY (AFTERNOON)                            132
      With his hand bandaged Toby sits at a typewriter with
      a blank transcript. He carefully types "TOBIAS WOLFF."
      Then, he begins to type the letter "A" in every slot for
      grades.

133   EXT. STREET - EVENING                                             133
      Toby mails five letters.

134   INT. TOBY'S BEDROOM - DAY                                         134
      Toby lies in bed reading the paper. He still holds his
      hand in the air (the white bandage is now dingy).

      Caroline appears in the doorway.
                              CAROLINE
                Come help me stuff envelopes.
                              TOBY
                I'll do some this afternoon.
                              CAROLINE
                No, I need to take them with me.
                              TOBY
                I'll be in in a minute.    Let me
                finish this article.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

134   CONTINUED:                                              134
                               CAROLINE
                Boy, you irritate me.
                        (new tone)
                I think maybe you ought to...
                Yeah -- I think maybe you should
                just...
                         (hisses)
                ... TAKE A LITTLE RIDE WITH
                DWIGHT.
      Toby laughs, and gets up to help her.

135   EXT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING              135

      Toby starts up the sideway, Pearl exits the house with
      several letters in her hand.
                              PEARL
                'You got letters from those
                schools!'
      Toby grabs them as if they were the very stuff of life.
      Pearl stands expectantly. Toby notices her, then walks
      off holding the letters to his chest.

136   EXT. FIELD - EARLY EVENING                                    136
      Three letters lie crumpled on the ground. Toby sits with
      his back against a tree trunk. Slowly Toby opens the
      fourth letter. Another refusal. Toby tosses it onto
      the ground with the others, leans his head back against
      the tree trunk, and closes his eyes.


137   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                137
      Dwight, Caroline and Toby read the papers.   Caroline
      notices Toby's sad face.
                              CAROLINE
                Maybe that last school will
                come through.
                              DWIGHT
                Yeah, or maybe he'll get a
                contract in the mail asking him
                to be a singing star on T.V.
                       (on Caroline's look)
                Well, he's got about as much
                chance of one as of the other.
      Toby gets up and leaves.

                                                               108.
138    EXT. CONCRETE - SAME NIGHT                                  138
       A beauty shop with a tired sign... "ARLENE'S GOLDEN COMB
       BEAUTY SALON," a beer joint, a pool hall, a woman's
       clothing store with headless mannequins.
       Toby surveys the scene, with an expression of despair.
       Toby catches his reflection in a store window.     He
       stares at himself.
                               TOBY
                 A Concrete boy.

139    INT. A&P GROCERY STORE - EVENING                            139

       Toby, wearing khakis, a shirt and a tie stands before
       the store manager.
                               MANAGER
                 We only take boys who really want
                 to work hard. Is that you?
                        (as Toby nods)
                 I'd want you to start evenings
                 now, and I'd want you all summer
                 -- no vacations.
                        (as Toby nods)
                 Food service work isn't easy.
                 It's not something that comes to
                 you in a year or two. So. You
                 think you have what it takes to
                 be an A&P management trainee?
                               TOBY
                        (straight)
                 That's exactly what I've got.


139A   SAME SCENE - LATER                                          139A
       Toby now wears a regulation black bow tie and an apron.
       An employee is showing him how to price, stamp, and stack
       canned goods. Toby's face is expressionless.

140    INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON     140
       Dwight is listening to a PERRY COMO ALBUM.     Caroline and
       Pearl work on a jigsaw puzzle. Toby enters     the kitchen,
       coming from his paper route. He puts down     his paper sack
       and immediately puts on his black bow tie,    preparing to
       go to the A&P.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                             109.
140   CONTINUED:                                             140
                              PEARL
                I can't find where this green piece
                goes -- it's gotta be grass.
      Dwight sighs with irritation at the interruption of his
      listening pleasure, and turns UP the VOLUME on the record.

                              CAROLINE
                       (to Toby)
                Don't go off without eating.
                              TOBY
                I'll get a sandwich after work.

      Exasperated that conversation is continuing when he's
      trying to listen, Dwight reaches over, presses his hand
      down on the arm of the record player, then SCRAPES it
      back and forth on the record. It's a violent action, and
      it makes a GROTESQUE SOUND. The NEEDLE BOUNCES around
      on the scarred record. As the three of them stare at
      him, Dwight speaks calmly:
                              DWIGHT
                I was trying to listen to a
                record.
      Dwight rises, walks outside into the back yard. Then
      the TELEPHONE RINGS. Pearl answers it, listens, then
      says,
                              PEARL
                "Yeah, he's here,"
      She holds the receiver out to Toby, whispering, "Are
      you Tobias?"

                             TOBY
                Hello? All right.     Tomorrow, then.
                Goodbye.
      Toby hangs up, turns to Caroline, quietly:
                              TOBY
                It's Hill School -- the last one
                I applied to. They haven't
                accepted me, but they're sending
                somebody up to interview me.
      Caroline upsets the puzzle getting up to hug Toby.

                                                              110.
141   INT. DRUGSTORE - AFTERNOON                                  141
      Toby is sitting in a booth with MR. HOWARD, a man in his
      late thirties.
      Toby has made a real attempt to look good.    His hair is
      modified, and he wears a tie and a suit.
                              TOBY
                ... Yeah, I enjoy my classes,
                especially the ones that are
                advanced, but I've been feeling
                a little restless lately. It's
                hard to explain.
                              MR. HOWARD
                Well, you're probably bored. Not
                being challenged. Your application
                was very good, Toby, but we have
                many boys who want to go to Hill.
                Not everybody is comfortable at a
                prep school.
                              TOBY
                I think I would be. My father
                and brother went to prep schools.
                                 MR. HOWARD
                Is that right?     Where?
                              TOBY
                Deerfield and Choate.
      Mr. Howard is impressed.
                              MR. HOWARD
                I see. Well, maybe you'd like it.
                Hill was difficult for me, though
                -- classes were hard, and the boys
                seemed cold -- interested in money
                and social position.
                       (laughs)
                And I hated those snowy
                Pennsylvania winters! But then
                in my last year, something changed.
                The guys in my class grew close,
                so close that I still think of
                them as a second family.
                              TOBY
                       (honest)
                I want that. I do, and --
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                              111.
141   CONTINUED:                                              141
      He stops    talking as we hear, O.S., "AG-H-H-H!" Psycho and
      Arch have    entered the drugstore. Toby's back is to the
      door, and    he slouches deeper into the booth, praying that
      he won't    be seen.
      Arch and Psycho buy cigarettes.
                                ARCH
                  ... so she said, 'No, I don't want
                  you to do that,' and I said 'Oh,
                  baby, let me get down and grovel
                  on it.' I mean, I ate her pussy
                  'til my tongue was calloused, and
                  then...

      Arch moves toward the    back of the store toward the area
      where Toby sits. Toby     inches down a bit farther into the
      booth. Arch stops at     a sunglass rack five feet from Toby
      and tries on a couple    of pairs.
                                ARCH
                  ... so anyway, she went off like a
                  Roman candle -- I mean that woman
                  can scream. I said, 'You liked
                  that, didn't you, baby?' I said,
                  'You liked the old Arch Cook
                  special, didn't you?'
      Arch decides to let the sunglasses go. He and Psycho
      move toward the front of the store, he talks about pussy.
      Toby exhales.
                                MR. HOWARD
                  Toby, boys at Hill talk roughly
                  sometimes too -- you'd have to
                  be ready for that. I can see
                  you've had sort of a sheltered
                  life.
      Toby nods his head.

142   EXT. DRUGSTORE - AFTERNOON                                    142
      Mr. Howard shakes Toby's hand.
                                MR. HOWARD
                  You seem like a fine boy, and
                  I'll give you a good report
                  tomorrow. But there are lots of
                  boys applying, and we'll just
                  have to wait and see whether --
      From O.S., we hear Dwight's voice, and Toby goes rigid.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

142   CONTINUED:                                              142
                              DWIGHT (O.S.)
                Ohh, it's the Hotshot Boy.
      Both Mr. Howard and Toby turn to see Dwight, wearing
      his coveralls, ten feet away.
                              DWIGHT
                Yeah, it's the guy who thinks he
                knows everything. Thinks he's so
                smart, but fella, what you don't
                know would fill a book.
                       (glances at Mr.
                        Howard's new
                        Chevrolet; offhand)
                General Motors makes shit cars.

      Dwight turns and enters the drugstore.
                              TOBY
                       (weakly)
                That's, uh, that's this guy...
                he's a mechanic... did some bad
                work on our car...
      It's not much of an explanation, but Mr. Howard seems to
      buy it. He says goodbye to Toby, gets into his car,
      drives away. Toby stares after him.
                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

143   INT. A & P GROCERY STORE - NIGHT                              143
      A few weeks have passed. Toby (his Elvis hairdo further
      modified) again prices and stacks food. His face is
      serious, his manner industrious.


144   INT. DWIGHT AND CAROLINE'S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON                144
      Toby walks in; his Elvis hair disappearing.    Pearl, who
      is boiling hot dogs, turns:
                              PEARL
                I know something'll make you feel
                good: that man called -- you got
                the scholarship.
      Toby grits his teeth and clenches both fists victoriously.
      He's won.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                              PEARL
                He said they're gonna give you two
                thousand three hundred dollars a
                year and it costs two thousand
                five hundred dollars... so you
                gotta come up with the other two
                hundred. Great, huh?
                       (sympathetic)
                I'm making hot dogs -- I'll make
                one for you. Can you put mustard
                on some bread for us?
      Toby gets a jar of mustard from a cupboard, but it's
      empty, so he tosses it on top of the trash can, gets a
      new jar and starts to open it.

      Dwight enters.
                              PEARL
                What're you doing home so earl...
                Oh! Toby he got that scholarship
                -- two thousand and three hundred
                dollars!
      Dwight makes himself a drink, takes two large swallows,
      then turns to Toby.
                               DWIGHT
                Hey, leopard. I say, 'Hey,
                leopard.' I know you, leopard --
                I can see those spots you can't
                change.
                        (laughs)
                Thinks he can go to some fancy
                prep school and fool everybody.
                Not a chance. I know a thing or
                two about a thing or two.
      Toby won't rise to the bait, and Dwight falls silent, he,
      looks around and sees the jar of mustard on top of the
      trash.
                              DWIGHT
                Who threw that away?
                              TOBY
                I did.
                              DWIGHT
                Why?
                              TOBY
                Because it was empty.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             114.

      Dwight retrieves the bottle. There are a few streaks
      of mustard under the neck of the bottle. He holds it
      close to Toby's face.
                               DWIGHT
                Empty?   That look empty to you?
                              PEARL
                It looks empty to me.
                              TOBY
                It looks empty to me, too.
      Dwight pushes the jar against Toby's eye, leaving mustard
      stains on the boy's face.

                              DWIGHT
                Look again, hotshot.    Is it empty?
      Toby jerks his head away, not answering. Dwight slams
      down the jar of mustard, grabs Toby by the back of the
      hair and forces his face down against the mustard jar.
                               PEARL
                Dad!
                              DWIGHT
                       (to Toby)
                Now. Now, Mr. Big-Time Prep-
                School fucker, is it empty?
      Toby struggles, but Dwight has the strength of anger:
      trying always to protect his throbbing finger, Toby
      pulls free and jumps up from the table. Dwight is too
      quick for Toby, though: he grabs an even bigger handful
      of hair and forces Toby's face down onto the mustard
      jar again and again. And again. Each time he asks if
      the jar is empty. Finally, Toby gives up.
                              TOBY
                       (muffled)
                No, it wasn't empty.
                              DWIGHT
                       (lets him go)
                All right -- clean it out.
      His face smeared with mustard, Toby's expression is
      murderous. He picks up a knife and scrapes at the mus-
      tard, trying to get up under the neck. He manages to
      get a few brown and yellow smudges on the knife, which
      he transfers to the edge of a plate. Dwight watches.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             115.

                                 DWIGHT
                Now.     Was it empty?
      Slowly he stands up and faces Dwight.
                                 TOBY
                Yes!
      Dwight slaps Toby across the mouth and the battle is on.
      As Pearl stands frozen, Toby lunges at Dwight, they
      grapple and stagger around the room. GLASS SHATTERS, the
      kitchen table CRASHES over, and their feet STAMP and
      SHUFFLE but Toby is a wild man. Even though he has
      only one good hand. He lands a blow between Dwight's
      eyes that bangs the man back against the wall.

      Dwight grabs the pan with the hot water from the hotdogs,
      flings it at Toby. Most of it misses. Again they
      grapple. Toby manages to throw Dwight down, then grabs a
      broom that has fallen to the floor, presses it against
      Dwight's throat, using his good hand and one knee.
      Dwight's mouth gapes wide, his eyes bulge, and he jerks
      himself frantically trying to dislodge Toby, but Toby
      hangs on like grim death. Desperate, Dwight grabs Toby's
      bandaged hand, bringing it close to his own face, and
      bites the stump of Toby's injured finger as hard as he
      can.
      Toby and Pearl scream simultaneously. Pearl in horror,
      Toby in pain. Pearl runs into her bedroom. Toby reels
      back in pain, holding his freshly-bleeding hand. Dwight
      takes his chance, grabs Toby by the throat, forces him
      down onto the floor and begins to choke the boy. Toby's
      eyelids begin to flutter. He's losing consciousness.
      WHAM!

      From out of nowhere a baseball bat hits Dwight flat
      across the shoulder blades, knocking the breath out  of
      him, stunning him momentarily. As he looks up, we   see
      Caroline, one of the baseball bats from the utility  porch
      drawn back, aimed at Dwight's head, ready to strike  again.
                               CAROLINE
                       (level)
                Get away from him or I will kill
                you.
      Toby manages to stand up, Caroline speaks to both of them.
                                 CAROLINE
                What is this?

                I got the scholarship and he went
                nuts. He's crazy, and I'm leaving.
                       (screams it)
                I'm leaving!
                                 DWIGHT
                Great.   Go!
                              TOBY
                Give me my paper route money, and
                you'll never have to see my face
                again.
                              DWIGHT
                       (manages a smile)
                That money is gone with the wind.
                       (as Toby stares)
                That's right. I spent it as you
                made it. It's gone. Poof.
      Toby starts for Dwight again. Caroline grabs him, saying,
      "No. No. No," over and over, literally dragging Toby
      away from Dwight.
      Caroline looks at Dwight.
                              CAROLINE
                It's not so much that you're
                disappointing -- it's that you're
                consistently disappointing.
                              DWIGHT
                Oh, fancy, fancy talk -- fancy
                talk for a whore.    I know a thing
                or two about a thing or two. I
                got friends in this town that tell
                me things, and I found out some man
                down at that campaign headquarters
                found you a job in Washington, D.C.
                Gonna run off with him, aren't
                you, Miss Whore?

                too. You don't have to stay here.

      Caroline takes three full beats and then her face
      changes. She speaks wonderingly:

                I don't, do I?

                I could leave with you, couldn't
                I?
                              TOBY
                Yes, you could!

                                 DWIGHT

                              CAROLINE

      Caroline takes a deep breath, a weight has been lifted.

      Dwight makes a terrible noise of frustration and rage,
      doubles his fists, and starts toward Caroline.
      Immediately Toby grabs the baseball bat and holds it
      out, ready to strike, as the two begin to back toward
      the door.
                              DWIGHT
                ... you two've always sided in
                against me, always thought you
                were better than me. I tried. I
                did the best I could. What about
                me? Am I supposed to just crawl
                off in a ditch someplace and die?
                I've always been the nigger.
                Everybody's nigger. Ever since I
                was little.
      Caroline and Toby are at the door, run across the yard
      and down the street. Dwight stands in the doorway,
      yelling:
                              DWIGHT
                What about me? When is it ever
                Dwight's turn for some
                consideration? What about me?
                I'll tell you one thing --

                Maybe I'll crash and burn, but
                it's a chance, so I'm gone! I'm

      Caroline's smile becomes fixed during Toby's speech and
      she begins to regard him oddly.

                              CAROLINE

                So now you can go! Oh. Oh! I am
                so damn glad to get out of this
                place! I'll be in 'fourth form.'
                Doesn't that sound great? And if
                you get a two-bedroom place in
                D.C., I can come for vacations and
                summers. I'm out. I'm out!

      Caroline's eyes well up, and she lights a cigarette.
                              TOBY
                       (notices she's upset)
                What? Oh, don't cry -- he's not
                worth it.
      As sad as she is, Caroline smiles...

      TOBY
      She holds Toby at arm's length and studies him.
                              CAROLINE
                My you've grown, haven't you.
      Then clutches him to her fiercely.   Smiling, the two
      walk on through the sunny afternoon, singing softly to
      each other.

                                                                120.
146   EXT. BUS STATION - DAY                                        146
      Caroline and Toby stand next to a bus as the driver
      STARTS the ENGINE. She is close to tears.
                              CAROLINE
                Are you sure you'll be all right?
                              TOBY
                       (nice)
                Get on the bus.
                              CAROLINE
                       (stuffing bills into
                        his pocket)
                I borrowed money from everybody I
                know -- it's the two hundred you
                need for the tuition, and an extra
                fifty. Buy yourself a blazer.
                Oh, God. I'll miss you. I'll
                write you. You sure your hand's
                okay?
                              TOBY
                Get on the bus, Mom.
      Caroline puts her arms around Toby, kisses his cheek
      hard, then whispers something into his ear. When Toby
      speaks, his words are full of love:
                              TOBY
                I know that, Mom. I've always
                known that.
      Caroline gets onto the bus, the DOORS CLOSE, WHOOSH and
      the bus pulls away. We see Caroline's face at a window.
      As the bus recedes, Toby turns and walks in another
      direction. His face is shining, incandescent with
      happiness. He breaks into a wide grin.

                                                    FADE OUT.


                               THE END
