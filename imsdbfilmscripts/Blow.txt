								 ON BLACK:

	"A MAN MUST LOOK AT HIS LIFE AND THINK LUXURY."

	FADE IN:

	EXT. GUARJIRA, COLOMBIA - 1989 - DAY

	A majestic panorama of the lush green slopes that are the
	Columbian highlands.  A faint chopping sound IS HEARD and
	then another.  WHOOSH.  WHOOSH.  The view changes and tiny
	dots appear on the hillside vegetation.  WHOOSH.

	CLOSER

	We realize the dots are people.  Workers swinging long steel
	machetes in slow methodical rhythm.  WHOOSH.  WHOOSH.  WE SEE
	the South American Indian MEN clearly now.  Their tar stained
	teeth.  Their gaunt faces riddled with crow's feet.  Their
	jaws chewing away on huge wads of coca leaves as they collect
	the harvest.

	EXT. DIRT ROAD - COLOMBIA - DAY

	Old rickety trucks carrying the huge green tractor-sized
	bales speed along the narrow road.

	EXT. CLEARING - COLOMBIA - DAY

	The bundles are undone and Columbian women separate out the
	leaves.  Tribes of underweight workers carry armload after
	armload of the harvest and ritualistically dump them into a
	gigantic cannibal pot which sits on top of a raging bonfire.
	The leaves are being boiled down and a huge plume of smoke
	streaks the sky.  Wizened Indios brave the heat and shovel
	ashes into the pot to cool the solution.

	INT. JUNGLE - COLOMBIA - DAY

	A primitive but enormous makeshift lab contains all the
	equipment.  The machinery.  The solutions.  The over-sized
	vats.  Dark-skinned bandoleros smoke cigarettes and sport
	automatic weapons at all the points of entry.  The coca is
	now a "basuco" paste and is being sent in for a wash.

	INT. LABORATORY - COLOMBIA - 1989 - DAY

	A conveyor belt pours out brick after brick of pure cocaine
	hydrochloride.  The bricks are wrapped, tied up, weighed, and
	stamped with a "P" before being thrown into duffel bags.

	EXT. JUNGLE AIRSTRIP - COLOMBIA - DAY

	A small twin-engine Cessna is loaded with dozens of duffel
	bags and the plane takes off.

	EXT. VERO BEACH AIRFIELD - NIGHT

	The Cessna touches down.

	EXT. WORKSITE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY

	The worksite is busy.  George is amongst other workers,
	working a summer job.  As George is taking five, he looks
	across the sight to Fred, who is sweeping up debris.  A long
	way from being the boss.

	INT. COLLEGE ADMISSIONS OFFICE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY

	George stands in line to register for college, wearing his
	Brooks Brothers suit, bowtie, and freshly Bryllcreamed hair.
	The room is crowded and the line is long.  Bob Dylan's
	"Subterranean Homesick Blues" blares out of one of the kid's
	transistor radios.  George looks around the room.  He is
	uncomfortable.  He catches his reflection in the shiny glass
	partition and stops.  He doesn't like what he sees.
	Something is not right.  He looks like everyone else.  Same
	cookie-cutter hair, same cookie-cutter clothes, same cookie
	cutter faces.  He's a carbon copy.

				REGISTRATION WOMAN
		Next.

	It's George's turn but he doesn't hear it.  "Twenty years of
	schooling and they put you on a day shift."  The words hit
	him like a tone of bricks as he continues to stare at his own
	reflection.

				GEORGE (V.O.)
		I was standing there, and it was like
		the outside of me and the inside of me
		didn't match, you know?  And then I
		looked around the room and it hit me.  I
		saw my whole life.  Where I was gonna
		live, what type of car I'd drive, who my
		neighbors would be.  I saw it all and I
		didn't want it.  Not that life.

	EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - WEYMOUTH - 1966 - DAY

	George sits with Fred.  It's breaktime and Fred eats from a
	lunch box.

				GEORGE
		There's something out there for me, Dad.
		Something different.  Something free
		form, you know?  Something for me, and
		college just isn't it.

				FRED
		That's too bad.  You would have been the
		first one in the family.

				GEORGE
		I know.

				FRED
		Alright.  You want me to get your old
		job back?  Because I could, you know, I
		could put in that word.

				GEORGE
		No, Dad.  I don't want to...I mean, I
		just don't want...

	It's obvious to Fred that his son doesn't want to be like
	him.

				FRED
		What are you going to do?

				GEORGE
		I'm going to California.

	EXT. BELMONT SHORES APARTMENT - 1968 - DAY

	SUPERIMPOSE: MANHATTAN BEACH, CALIFORNIA 1968

	George and Tuna, now 21-years old, struggle with their bags.
	Their new place is a tackily furnished, two-story apartment
	with small balconies and a view of the ocean.  As George and
	Tuna struggle with the bags, two California beauties appear
	on the balcony next door: BARBARA BUCKLEY, 20, and MARIA
	GONZALES, 21.

				GIRLS
		You guys need some help?

	George and Tuna share a look.

				TUNA
		I don't know about you, but I think
		we're gonna like it here.

	EXT. MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY

	SERIES OF SHOTS

	Barbara and Maria introduce George and Tuna around to the
	Manhattan Beach regulars.  They are immediately accepted
	despite their ill fitting shorts and Tuna's unhip black
	socks.  The beach scene is one big party.  Lots of beer,
	music, bikinis, and good times.  By the end of the day,
	George and Tuna have a hundred new friends.

				GEORGE (V.O.)
		California was like nothing I'd ever
		experienced.  The people were liberated
		and independent and full of new ideas.

				GEORGE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
		They used words like "right on,"
		"groovy," and "solid."  The women are
		all beautiful and seemed to share the
		same occupation.

				WOMAN #1
		I'm a flight attendant.

				WOMAN #2
		I'm a flight attendant.

				WOMAN #3
		I'm a flight attendant.

	The weed comes out and is passed around.  Pipes.  Joints.
	Bongs.  In SLOW MOTION, Barbara takes a huge hit of grass,
	grabs George's face, french kissing him, and giving him a
	huge shotgun.

	INT. BELMONT SHORES APARTMENT - 1968 - DAY

	George and Barbara are sleeping late.  Their bodies
	intertwined beneath the sheets.  A slam of the front door
	wakes them up.  It's Tuna.

				TUNA
		Hey, wake up.  Come on, you two
		lovebirds.  Hurry, I want to show you
		something.

	George and Barbara shake cobwebs out and stumble into the
	kitchen to find Tuna holding a brown paper shopping bag.

				TUNA (CONT'D)
		Figured it out.

				GEORGE
		Figured what out?

				TUNA
		You know how we were wondering what we
		were going to do for money?  Being how
		we don't want to get jobs and whatnot?
		Well, check this out.

	Tuna takes the paper bag and empties its contents on the
	kitchen table.  It's a grey mound of stocky, seedy marijuana.

	Barbara examines the reefer.

				BARBARA
		Tuna, this is crap.

				TUNA
		I know it's not the greatest.  It's
		commercial.

				BARBARA
		It's garbage.

				GEORGE
		It's oregano.  You got ripped off, pal.
		What are you gonna do with all this?

				TUNA
		We sell it.  I got it all figured out.
		We make three finger lids and sell them
		on the beach.  We move all of it.  We've
		made ourselves a hundred bucks.  Or a
		lot of weed for our head.  What do you
		think?  Not bad, huh?  I got the baggies
		and everything.

				BARBARA
		You can't sell this to your friends.

				TUNA
		Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great
		idea and you guys have to be all
		skeptical.

				BARBARA
		Look, if you really wanna score some
		dope, I got the guy.

	EXT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - DAY

	George, Barbara and Tuna stop outside the front door.

				GEORGE
		Are you sure this guy is cool?

				BARBARA
		You'll see for yourself.

				TUNA
		A beauty parlor for men?  Sounds pretty
		queer.

	They walk in.

	INT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1968 - CONTINUOUS

	George, Tuna and Barbara enter.  The Whipping Post is
	California's first male hair salon.  George looks around at
	the customer's being pampered.  Haircuts, pedicures,
	manicures.

				GEORGE
		Nothing like this back home.

				BARBARA
		Derek!

	DEREK FOREAL is a curious man.  Daringly effeminate,
	especially for the sixties, he is always surrounded by
	beautiful women.  As he sees Barbara, he stops his haircut
	and runs to embrace her.

				DEREK
		Barbie!

	Derek's female entourage rush over as well.  Kisses all
	around.

				DEREK (CONT'D)
		So, this is the new man, huh?  He's
		cute!

	George and Tuna stick out there hands.

				GEORGE
		George.

				TUNA
		Tuna.

				DEREK
		Tuna, oh my.  Enchante, George.  Barbie,
		he's yummy.  He looks like a Ken doll.
		Oooh, Ken and Barbie.  It's perfect.
		Alright, girls, give me five minutes.

	Derek makes dismissing gestures and the girls scatter.

				DEREK (CONT'D)
		Everyone, shoo!  You, too, Barbie.  I
		want to talk to the boys alone.

	After the girls leave, Derek closes the partition and his
	playful demeanor changes.  He's all business now.

				DEREK (CONT'D)
		What can I do for you guys?

				GEORGE
		We want some grass.

				DEREK
		I know what you want.  But, first of
		all, are you cops?

				GEORGE
		No.

				DEREK
		Because if you are, you have to tell me.
		If not, it's entrapment.

				GEORGE
		We're not cops.  We're from
		Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look
		like a cop?

				DEREK
		I guess not.  Okay.  You know, you're
		very lucky you're friends of Barbie's.
		If you weren't, I'd never talk to you.

	Derek pulls a television-sized brick of quality marijuana out
	from under a sink and sets it down in front of George.

				GEORGE
		What the fuck is that?

				DEREK
		It's your grass.

				TUNA
		Wow.  That's more than we had in mind.

				DEREK
		I don't nickel and dime.  You want it or
		not?

	George and Tuna look at each other.

				GEORGE
		We'll take it.

	George and Barbara sit by the water, watching the waves crash
	into the sand.  The sky is streaked with purple and red.

				GEORGE
		This is it for me.

				BARBARA
		What is?

				GEORGE
		Just everything.  You.  California.  The
		beach.  This spot right here.  I feel

				DEREK
		You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred
		pounds a week.

				GEORGE
		Yeah, I know, it's a lot of weight.

				BARBARA
		We're gonna call it California
		sinsemilla.  Sounds exotic.

				GEORGE
		I'm telling you, Derek, it will sell.

		I don't know...

				GEORGE
		Here's the best part.  We can charge
		five-hundred a pound.

				DEREK
		Come on, George, no one is going to pay
		that.

				GEORGE
		It's already been negotiated.  It's
		done.  The money is there waiting.

	Derek looks at Barbara.  She nods.

				DEREK
		Goodness.

				GEORGE
		Goodness is right.  If you do the math,
		that's over thirty grand a week profit.
		I want you to be my partner on this,
		Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen
		thousand a week for you, my friend.  In
		your pocket, free and clear.

		And I only deal with you?

		Barbara and me.  No one else.

	INT. LOGAN AIRPORT - GATE - BOSTON - 1968

	The same scene repeated, same things changed again; now Kevin
	is definitely dressed a little better.

				KEVIN
		I need more.

				BARBARA
		What do you want me to do?  I can only
		take two bags, and I can't fly back here
		everyday.

				KEVIN
		I know, but I've got a feeding frenzy on
		my hands.  Tell George this is small
		potatoes.  We're missing out on some
		serious cash.  You tell George.  He'll
		think of something.

	EXT. WINNEBAGO - 1968 - DAY

	MUSIC CUE:

	EXT. WHITE OAK LODGE - AMHERST - 1968 - NIGHT

	Kevin and his girl, RADA, are the welcoming committee as the

	the Winnebago, and greet the prodigal sons with hugs and
	handshakes.

	INT. WHITE OAK LODGE - AMHERST - 1968 - LATER

	George's room is rustic and plush.  A log fire burns and
	empty champagne bottles adorn the surroundings.  The girls
	have taken to each other.  The music is loud, and they dance
	while the boys do business.  Kevin counts out the money.
	It's stacked in piles all over the table.

				KEVIN
		Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, nine.
		Twenty, forty, sixty, eighty, a
		thousand.  It's all there.  Wow.  A
		hundred and twenty-eight thousand
		dollars.

				TUNA
		Jesus Christ, I'm getting a boner just
		looking at it.

	But George isn't paying attention.  His wheels are turning.

				KEVIN
		What's the matter, George?  Something
		wrong?  You look like you just fucked
		your mother.

				TUNA
		Cheer up, man.  Half this money is ours.
		We're fucking rich.

				GEORGE
		It's not enough.

				KEVIN
		What?

				TUNA
		What the fuck are you talking about,
		man?

				GEORGE
		The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all
		the legwork, and at the end of the day,
		we're still paying retail.  We're
		getting middled.

				KEVIN
		So?

				GEORGE
		So, we need to get to the source.

				TUNA
		Source?  What about Derek?

				GEORGE
		He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's
		our partner.  What's good for us is good
		for him.

				KEVIN
		Okay.  So we need a source.  Where do we
		start?

		Who speaks Spanish?

				KEVIN
		You know, he's got a point.  We're
		fucking Americans.  We stick out like
		sore thumbs.

				DEREK
		I don't think so.

				GEORGE
		You guys are such babies.  You want to
		go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop
		until I find the fucking motherlode.

				RADA
		Georgie, we're gonna get busted if we
		keep this up.

				GEORGE
		We're not gonna get busted.

				KEVIN
		George, we'll wind up in a Mexican

				MARIA
		Hey, fuck you, Dulli.  I'm not Mexican.
		I'm Italian.

				BARBARA
		You're Italian?

				KEVIN
		Yeah, right.  Gonzales.  What is that,

				TUNA
		As far as I'm concerned, we're on

	Fields and Farms.  The V.W. bug pulls up to an old ranch.
	They get out of the bug and are greeted by SANTIAGO and his
	THREE SONS.

				SANTIAGO
		Ramon tells me you are looking for some
		mota.

				GEORGE
		Yes, I am.

	Santiago moves to a tarp and pulls it back to reveal many
	bales of green, seedless sinsemilla.

				SANTIAGO
		For instance, something like this?

				GEORGE
		Very nice.  I'll take it.

				SANTIAGO
		Ha ha ha.  You are funny.   Really, how
		much will you be needing?

				GEORGE
		All of it.  As much as you've got.  A
		couples thousand pounds.  I'll be back
		in a week with a plane.

				SANTIAGO
		Listen, Americano, it is very nice to
		meet you, but maybe we are going too
		fast.  You take a little and then come
		back.

				GEORGE
		I don't need a little.  I need a lot.

				SANTIAGO
		Marijuana is illegal in my country, and
		I believe in yours, as well.  We must be
		careful.

				GEORGE
		What if I brought you, let's say, fifty
		thousand dollars?  Would that eliminate
		some of your concerns?

				SANTIAGO
		Amigo, you bring me fifty-thousand
		dollars, and I have no more concerns.

	EXT. SANTA MONICA AIRPORT - 1968 - DAY

	A pair of boltcutters snaps the chain off a single-engine

		I can't believe we're stealing a plane.

				KEVIN
		Don't be such a pussy.

				GEORGE
		It's fine.  We're not stealing it.
		We're borrowing it.  And try to look
		natural.  We've got company.

	A MECHANIC working on the adjacent plane is giving them the
	hairy eyeball.

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		Be cool.

	The three boys nod their heads in acknowledgement and give a
	small wave.  The mechanic smiles and waves back.

	INT. CESSNA - 1968 - DAY

	The engine is on and the propeller is spinning.  Kevin is at
	the controls.  Tuna is not making the trip.  He pokes his
	head in before shutting the cockpit.

				TUNA
		You guys are fucking insane.

	George reads from a flight manual.

				GEORGE
		Alright, pull back the throttle...

	The engine screams.

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		Not that far, only halfway.  You sure
		you know what you're doing?

				KEVIN
		Relax.  I've flown with my old man a
		million times.  And he always told me,
		the taking off part is easy, it's the
		landing you've got to worry about.

	EXT. SANTIAGO FARM - MEXICO - 1968 - DAY

	The plane tries to land.  It's a clumsy one.  The Cessna is
	tipping and touching, first one wheel, then another, almost
	sideways before straightening out and stopping.  George and
	Kevin hop out of the plane.  They are greeted by Santiago and
	the Mexican contingency.

				AMIGOS
		Hola, George!  Bienvenido!

	George hands out presents to everyone.  He's like Santa
	Claus, giving gifts to every man, woman and child.  They love
	him.  Santiago pumps George's hand.

				SANTIAGO
		Good to see you, Jorge.  You are a man
		of your word.

				GEORGE
		Actually, I've got some news.  That
		fifty thousand I promised you, I
		couldn't get it.

	George throws Santiago a duffel bag.

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		So I brought you sixty.

	sip champagne, and a thousand pounds of cannabis lays on the
	living room floor.

				GEORGE
		Are you sure you want to do this in

		Don't be ridiculous, these are my

	INT. THE BUGGY WHIP - WEYMOUTH - 1972 - NIGHT

	George is taking Barbara and his parents out to dinner.  The
	Buggy Whip is Ermine's favorite.

				ERMINE
		I just can't get over the size of that
		ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at
		it.  Tell me you don't love that ring.

				FRED
		I'm just happy that George has found
		someone he cares for.

				ERMINE
		Yes.  Of course.  But, I'm talking about
		that ring.  It's something else.  Let me
		tell you.

				BARBARA
		George has exquisite taste.

				ERMINE
		What is that, two carats?  That's got to
		be two carats.

				BARBARA
		I don't know.

				ERMINE
		Yes.  It's at least two carats, darling.
		Treasure it.

				FRED
		Hard to imagine being able to afford a
		ring like that on a construction salary.

	All eyes turn to George, who fumbles.

				GEORGE
		Well, you know.  It's um...

				ERMINE
		Oh, shut up, Fred.  Shut your big fat
		mouth.  You don't buy it all at once.
		It's called layaway.

				FRED
		Layaway shmayaway.

				ERMINE
		That's right.  Layaway.  Something you
		wouldn't know anything about, you
		cheapskate.

				FRED
		Who's the cheapskate?

				ERMINE
		You, you big old tightwad.  He still has
		his communion money.  Tell him, George.
		Tell your father about layaway.

				GEORGE
		Yeah, layaway.

				ERMINE
		The boy is happy, Fred.  Don't be such a
		killjoy.

				FRED
		Killjoy?

	George looks to Barbara, whose nose is bleeding.

				GEORGE
		Honey, your nose!

				BARBARA
		Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.

				ERMINE
		Barbara, here, take my napkin.

				BARBARA
		Thanks.  I'll be okay.

		I feel like shit.  Me and my frigging
		nosebleeds.

				GEORGE
		I'm taking you to the doctor when we get
		home, and I don't want to hear any

				BARBARA
		Would you be bummed out if I didn't go
		to Chicago with you?

				GEORGE
		No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right.
		You fly home and get some rest.

				BARBARA
		Nice first impression.  A nose bleed in
		front of your parents.

				GEORGE
		Oh my G-d, how embarrassing were they?
		I wanted to shoot myself.

				BARBARA
		Oh, they weren't that bad.  I mean, they
		were kind of cute.

		Promise me that we'll never be like

	SUPERIMPOSE

	MUG SHOTS of George.  Left, right, center.  George sits
	handcuffed to a chair.  Piles of marijuana bricks roll past
	him.

				GEORGE (V.O.)
		I had a little problem in Chicago.
		Something about trying to sell a
		truckload of dope to an undercover
		officer.  So I applied the three rules
		of the game under if and when arrested.

	INT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - CHICAGO - 1972 - DAY

	George and his COURT APPOINTED ATTORNEY stand before the
	JUDGE at the arraignment.

				GEORGE (V.O.)
		Rule one: don't fight.  A trial will
		cost you a fortune in lawyer's fees and
		the jury will chop off your balls and
		hand them to you on a platter.

				JUDGE
		George Jung, you have been accused of
		possession of six-hundred and sixty
		pounds of marijuana with intent to
		distribute.  How do you plead?

				GEORGE (V.O.)
		Rule two: plead not guilty and get
		bailed out of jail.

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		Your honor, I'd like to say a few words
		to the court.

	The court appointed attorney puts his head in his hands.

				JUDGE
		By all means.

				GEORGE
		In all honesty, I don't feel like what
		I've done is a crime and I think it's
		illogical and irresponsible for you to
		sentence me to prison.  None of the real
		criminals of the world ever end up
		behind bars.  I mean, when you think
		about it, what did I really do?  Cross
		an imaginary line with a bunch of
		plants?  You say that I'm an outlaw, you
		say that I'm a thief, but where's the
		Christmas dinner for the people on
		relief?

	George stops when his attorney stamps on his foot.  The court
	officers roll their eyes and the judge smiles.

				JUDGE
		Those are very interesting concepts you
		have, Mr. Jung.
		Unfortunately for you, the imaginary
		line you crossed is real, the plants you
		brought with you are illegal, and what
		you did constitutes a crime.

	The judge slams his gavel.

				JUDGE (CONT'D)
		Bail is set at twenty-thousand dollars.

	EXT. COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE - CHICAGO - 1972 - NIGHT

	George walks out, free on bond, to find Barbara waiting for
	him.  She doesn't look so good.

				BARBARA
		Surprise.

				GEORGE
		Baby, you didn't have to come.

				BARBARA
		What, and miss all the fun?  C'mon, not
		a chance.  So, what's the verdict?

				GEORGE
		Lawyer says he can plead it down to five
		years.  I'll serve two.

				BARBARA
		Two years.  George, I can't wait that
		long.

				GEORGE
		What?  You're not going to wait for me?

				BARBARA
		George, I went to the doctor.  I don't
		have two years.

				GEORGE (V.O.)
		Which brings me to rule number three:
		which says, fuck rules one and two, skip
		bail and take off.

	EXT. RENT-A-CAR - 1972 - DAY

	George hits the gas and the car screams down the road.

	EXT. VILLA - PUERTO VALLARTA - 1973 - GOLDEN HOUR

	George and Barbara sit on the veranda drinking champagne and
	watching the sun go down over the Pacific.  Barbara is
	completely bald.  Rail thin, eyes sunken.
	But it doesn't matter.  They're having a great time.  They
	laugh and hold hands and laugh some more.

	EXT. CEMETERY - PUERTO VALLARTA - 1973 - DAY

	Everyone is there.  All in black.  Barbara's casket is
	lowered into the ground and George climbs to his knees to
	push the first dirt on the grave.

				GEORGE (V.O.)
		Time is such a funny thing.  I look at
		where I am now, and in here, time inches
		along.  So slow, it hardly seems like it
		moves.  But back then, time went fast.

	EXT. OTISVILLE F.C.I. - NEW YORK - 1999 - DAY

	George pushes dirt along the edge of a flower root.  Still
	planting those sunflowers, he presses down firmly, standing
	before him is Barbara, still beautiful and young with flowing
	locks.  George raises his hand and makes a small wave.
	Barbara opens and closes her hand.  Bye bye.

				GEORGE
		It went too fast.

	George looks down and Barbara is gone.  No Barbara.

				GEORGE
		Barbara.

				ERMINE
		Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.

				GEORGE
		Thank you.  Have you been getting the
		money I sent you?

				ERMINE
		You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.

	Ermine's hands are trembling.  She is emotional.  She hugs
	George ferociously, not letting go.

				ERMINE (CONT'D)
		G-d, son.

				GEORGE
		Okay, Mom.  It's okay.  Where's Dad?

	George turns around to see Fred's beaming face.

	INT. JUNG HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

	George and Fred sit at the table, a bottle of Scotch sits

		May the wind always be at your back and

		...and the winds of destiny carry you
		aloft...

				BOTH
		...to dance with the stars.

	The glasses clink and the drinks are sucked down.

	INT. JUNG HOUSE - LATER

	The bottle is dwindling.  George and Fred are feeling it.

				FRED
		You alright?

	George nods.

				GEORGE
		Just low.

				FRED
		You loved her, didn't you?  You really
		loved her.

				GEORGE
		Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I

				FRED
		Tough spot.

	The glasses are refilled.

				GEORGE
		You mad at me?

				FRED
		Not mad.

				GEORGE
		Yeah, you are.  I can tell by the way
		you look at me.

				FRED
		I just don't know what you're thinking.
		I don't understand your choices.  You
		know, the police are looking for you.

				GEORGE
		I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I
		mean, I'm really great.

				FRED
		Let me tell you something, son.  You
		would have been great at anything.

	Something outside catches George's eye.  A light.  A
	reflection.  A movement.  George is up and on the move.

		Where are you going?

	EXT. JUNG HOUSE - NIGHT

	The front door opens and FEDERAL AGENTS pour into the house.

	INT. GEORGE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

	George slams the door behind him, moves over to the window,
	and opens it.  Cops everywhere.  He's trapped.  Out of
	options, he folds.  He moves to the corner and sits down,
	turns on the train set.  A KNOCK on the door is heard.  FBI
	Agent, JAMES T. TROUT.

				TROUT
		George Jung, you are under arrest.

				FRED
		Open the door, son.

	EXT. JUNG HOUSE - LATER

	They lead George outside in handcuffs.  Ermine and Fred
	watch.

				ERMINE
		I had no choice.

	George stops and looks at his mother, for the first time
	realizing her betrayal.

				ERMINE (CONT'D)
		Don't look at me like that.  What was I
		supposed to do?  You're in our house.
		What, was I supposed to be an
		accomplice?

	As George is led to the police car, Ermine follows.

				ERMINE (CONT'D)
		You don't think people know you're a
		drug dealer?  Everyone knows.  It's no
		secret.  How do you think that reflects
		on me?  Every time I go out, I'm
		humiliated.  I see the stares.  I hear
		the whispers.  How do you think that
		makes me feel?  Did you ever once stop
		and think of me?

	George's head is pushed down as he is put in the squad car.
	He looks up at his mother.

				ERMINE (CONT'D)
		So you go to jail.  It's for your own

		Prisoner in.

	The cell door opens and George steps inside.  There are books

	Apparently, the papers are private.  George puts his things

	INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - MESS HALL - 1974 - DAY

		If you don't mind me asking, what is the

				GEORGE
		What?

				DIEGO
		Your offense?  Why are you here?

				GEORGE
		I don't want to talk about it.

				DIEGO
		Intriguing.  I see.  Would you like to
		know my crime?

				GEORGE
		Not really, no.

				DIEGO
		No?

				GEORGE
		I don't like a lot of conversation,
		Diego.

				DIEGO
		Me, too.  Too much blah, blah, blah,
		blah is no good.  But we are roommates,
		okay?  And we must talk to each other.
		I am arrested for stealing cars.  For
		the grand theft auto.  Okay?  So, now it
		is your turn.  Now you will tell me,
		okay?  You will tell me why you are

	George says nothing.  He keeps eating his food.

		Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be
		friends, we must trust each other.

				GEORGE
		Murder.

				DIEGO
		Ah, yes.  The murder.

	INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - GEORGE'S CELL - NIGHT

	George lays on his bunk, smoking.  Diego is on the bottom

	see what Diego is doing.

				GEORGE
		What do you got there, Diego?

				DIEGO
		Nothing.  Just a little project.

				GEORGE
		What kind of project?

				DIEGO
		Never mind.  Not for you to worry.

				GEORGE
		I thought you said we were roommates.
		That we should talk about everything.

				DIEGO
		You have your intrigues.  I have mine.
		This is a happy day for me, George.
		Nine months from today, I will be in
		Medellin sipping champagne.  In nine

		have?

				GEORGE
		Twenty-six months.

				DIEGO
		Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must
		be your lawyer.

				GEORGE
		I've got to get out of here, Diego.

		What's the other one?

	INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - CLASSROOM - DAY

	George is trying to teach basic education to the inmates.

		We ain't opening shit.

				INMATE #1

	Diego watches as the room reacts with laughter.  This ain't
	going to be easy.

				GEORGE
		Alright.  You're right.  I want to get
		out of this shithole as fast as I can.
		And I don't want to do this any more
		than you do.  But for me to walk early,
		some of you have to graduate.  You,
		forget about it.  You're hopeless, go to

	The room laughs again.

				INMATE #3
		Damn, homeboy, you got ruined.

		But the rest of you could get diplomas
		and get jobs when you're on the outside.

	The room looks at him.  They ain't buying it.

		half the time, we learn about George
		Washington, and the other half, I'll
		teach you how to smuggle drugs?

				INMATE #2
		Man, you don't know dick about smuggling
		no drugs.

				GEORGE
		I was arrested in Chicago with six
		hundred and sixty pounds of grass.  I
		think that qualifies me.

	Diego looks up from his desk, suddenly very interested.

				INMATE #1
		How did you get a hold of six-hundred
		and sixty pounds of dope?

				GEORGE
		Flew it in from Mexico on a single
		engine Cessna.  Now, do we have a deal
		or not?

	They react.  They're in.

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		Alright, the first thing you need to
		know about smuggling drugs is that it's
		easy.  The DEA are a bunch of losers.
		They couldn't find their dicks in a
		whorehouse.  They don't know what the
		fuck they're doing...

	Diego watches George winning over the room.  He listens
	intently to George's every word.  His wheels are turning.

	INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - GEORGE'S CELL - NIGHT

	Lights out.  Diego and George lay in their cots.  George is
	tired.  Diego is not.

				DIEGO
		George?  Hey, George?  I listen to what
		you say to the class today about the
		smuggling.  You are a magico, ah?

	George doesn't respond.

				DIEGO (CONT'D)
		I never believed you were a murderer.  I
		knew.  I knew you are a magico.  I have
		seen it in you.  It's in your spirit.

				GEORGE
		I'm tired, Diego.  Go to bed.

				DIEGO
		You like to make the boundaries
		disappear.  It's not only the money, is
		it, George?  The adventure is part of
		the victory.  It's the thrill, ah?

				GEORGE
		Good night.

				DIEGO
		In my country, I am a magico.  A man
		with a dream.  A man on the rise.  To
		take nothing and make it something,
		okay?  I have failed my dream, but I
		will accomplish.  That is why I am in
		your country.  Yes, I lose my freedom.
		But they do not take my dream.  Do you
		have a dream, George?

				GEORGE
		I would if I could get some sleep.

				DIEGO
		Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you
		accomplish your dream.  But yet you
		failed.  Why?

				GEORGE
		Because I got caught.

				DIEGO
		No, my brother.

				GEORGE
		Because they caught me?

				DIEGO
		You failed because you had the wrong
		dream.

	Diego climbs off his bunk and looks George square in the eye.

				DIEGO (CONT'D)
		George?  What do you know about cocaine?

	INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - MESS HALL - DAY

				GEORGE
		I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good
		thing going already.  Everybody smokes
		pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich
		man's drug.  It's too expensive.

				DIEGO
		No, no.  That is where you are wrong.
		For us, it is cheap.  In Medellin, we
		buy for six-thousand dollars a kilo.  IN
		Miami, we sell for sixty.

	George's interest is piqued.

				GEORGE
		That's over fifty-thousand dollars
		profit per kilo.

				DIEGO
		And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few
		times and retail, you're looking at two,
		three-hundred thousand.

				GEORGE
		Oh my G-d.

				DIEGO
		Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than
		a kilo of your precious marijuana.
		Everything is the same, George, except
		instead of thousands, you are making
		millions.

				GEORGE
		Jesus Christ.  Jesus fucking Christ.

				DIEGO
		Now do you see what I am saying?

				GEORGE
		Getting it here is no problem.  Trust
		me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to.
		What about supply?  How much can we get?

				DIEGO
		Don't worry.  We will talk of
		everything.  We have the time.  You
		arrive here with a Bachelor of
		Marijuana, but you will leave with a
		Doctorate of Cocaine.

	INT. DANBURY F.C.I. - GEORGE'S CELL - NIGHT

	Diego and George pouring over Diego's plans.  Discussing,
	planning, plotting.

				DIEGO
		What type of planes do you have?

				GEORGE
		Four passenger, single engine Cessna.

				DIEGO
		How many kilos can we fit in these
		planes?

				GEORGE
		I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and
		fifty.  How many miles is it from
		Colombia to Miami?

				DIEGO
		Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop
		somewhere to refuel.

				GEORGE
		We'll refuel in the Bahamas.  I know
		someone there.

				DIEGO
		Great.  I love the Bahamas.

	EXT. LIQUOR STORE - WEYMOUTH - 1976

	SUPERIMPOSE: JULY, 1976.

	George is at a payphone.  He drops in about a million
	quarters until he is finally connected.

				GEORGE
		Diego Delgado, please?

				DIEGO
		Allo?

				GEORGE
		Diego?  It's George.

				DIEGO
		George, hallo!  Today is the day, ah?
		Are you out?

				GEORGE
		Yeah, I'm out.

				DIEGO
		Congratulations, brother.  I've been
		waiting for you.

				GEORGE
		How are we doing?

				DIEGO
		Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything
		is fine down here.  Everything is all
		set up.

				GEORGE
		Do we need a plane?  How does this work?
		When do I see you?

				DIEGO
		Slow down, George.  Slow down.

	Fred exits the liquor store carrying two bottles of Dom
	Perignon.  As he catches George's eye, he lifts the bottles
	showing them off.  George holds up his finger, indicating
	he'll be just a second.

				DIEGO (CONT'D)
		You need to come down here, everybody
		meets everybody.  Ho ho ho.  Ha ha ha.
		We do one for good faith and then we
		talk about airplanes.

				GEORGE
		I can't go anywhere, Diego.  I'm on
		parole.  I can't leave the state.

				DIEGO
		But you must.  It's the only way.

				GEORGE
		I just got released five minutes ago.

				DIEGO
		George, are we gonna do this or not?

	EXT. BASSETERRE HOTEL - ANTIGUA - POOLSIDE - 1976 - DAY

	George steps outside and spots Diego.  Their eyes meet.
	Diego looks different, relaxed.  He wears a straw hat,
	shorts, and sports a healthy tan.  The two men embrace.

				GEORGE
		Good to see you, Diego.

				DIEGO
		Yes.  Look around you.  The sun.  The
		water.  The women.  It's better than
		Danbury, no?  Come on.  I have some
		friends I would like you to meet.

	EXT. BASSETERRE HOTEL - ANTIGUA - POOLSIDE - 1976 - DAY

	Diego and George sit with five other Colombians, most
	notably, a man named CESAR ROZA.  The mood is not friendly.

				DIEGO
		Fifteen kilos.  Seven and a half in each
		suitcase.  You receive a hundred
		thousand dollars upon delivery.

				GEORGE
		Okay.

				CESAR
		Not so fast.  I would like to go over
		the details.

				GEORGE
		What details?  I put the coke in the
		false bottoms and take it through
		customs.

				CESAR
		Tell me about the suitcases.  What is
		the make and the color?

				DIEGO
		Samsonites.  Red.  No tags.

	Cesar thinks about it.

				CESAR
		Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in
		the suitcase?

				GEORGE
		What?  Yeah, sure.

				CESAR
		Whose cloths?  Your clothes?

				GEORGE
		My clothes, your clothes.  What does it
		matter?

				CESAR
		I would like to know the contents.
		Every detail is important.

				GEORGE
		What are we doing here, Diego?  This
		guy's a clown.  He's talking about
		clothes.

				CESAR
		I demand to know everything.  I do not
		trust six-hundred thousand dollars of
		coca to someone I don't know.

				GEORGE
		It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss
		fifteen kilos.

				CESAR
		The coca is my responsibility!

				GEORGE
		You're a fucking amateur!

				DIEGO
		Gentlemen, please.  There is no need to
		be impolite.  Cesar, this will be fine.
		You have my word.  George, Cesar is just
		being thorough.  That's all.

				CESAR
		Very well.  But just remember, Mr. Jung.
		I will be with you the whole way.  And I
		will be watching.

	INT. LOGAN AIRPORT - CUSTOMS - 1976 - DAY

	George carries the two Samsonites over to customs
	inspections.  It's a long walk.  George's heart beats hard.
	The sound is audible and grows with every beat.  BA-BUMP.  BA
	BUMP.  Cesar lurks at the baggage carousel.

				GEORGE (V.O.)
		When you're carrying drugs across the
		border, the idea is to remain calm.  The
		way I do it is to think of something
		pleasant, a fun party, a moment of
		triumph.  A sexual encounter.  I
		actually project myself to that place.
		Anything to keep your mind off the fact
		that you're going to jail for a very
		long time if they find the fifteen kilos
		of cocaine in your suitcases.

	George stands in front of the customs agent.  He tries his
	best to look relaxed as the agent reviews his documents.

				CUSTOMS AGENT
		On vacation?

				GEORGE
		Yes.

				CUSTOMS AGENT
		On vacation for only one day?

	BA-BUMP.  BA-BUMP.  The heartbeats are very loud.

				GEORGE
		    (weak smile)
		My brother's wedding.  Imagine that,
		huh?

	George's breathing is labored and his swallowing reflex
	doesn't seem to be working.  Cesar passes through, eyeballing
	George the whole time.

				CUSTOMS AGENT
		Open your bags, please.

	George opens the Samsonites.  Super dry mouth.  BA-BUMP.  BA
	BUMP.  The beats are deafening now.  Cesar nervously monitors
	the situation from the payphones.

				CUSTOMS AGENT (CONT'D)
		Whose clothes are these?

				GEORGE
		Mine.

	The customs agent holds up a woman's undergarment.  Cesar
	throws up his hands in frustration.

				CUSTOMS AGENT
		And this?

				GEORGE
		What can I tell you?  Different strokes.

	George winks at the customs agent, who shakes his head before
	finishing the inspection.

				CUSTOMS AGENT
		Alright, go ahead.

	EXT. LOGAN AIRPORT - PAYPHONES - CONTINUOUS

	George moves to the payphones, sets down the two suitcases,
	and pretends to make a call.  Not inconspicuously, Cesar
	grabs the bags and walks quickly out of the terminal.

	INT. BASSETERRE HOTEL - ANTIGUA - 1976 - DAY

	Diego, Cesar, George and JACK STEVENS, a silver haired
	executive type, lounge around the mini-suite.  Cesar still
	has that crazy look in his eye.

				DIEGO
		Three-hundred kilos it is, then.

	A beautiful Latin woman enters and kisses both Diego and
	Cesar.  Her name is INEZ, and friendly she is not.

				DIEGO (CONT'D)
		Has everyone met Inez?  This is George.
		I've told you about him.  And this is
		friend, Jack Stevens.

	The men proffer their hands, but she just looks at them like
	ants before sitting down next to Diego.

				DIEGO (CONT'D)
		Try to be more respectful, darling.  My
		apologies.  But she is mistrustful of
		Americans.  Shall we proceed?  Let's
		hear it again, Mr. Stevens.

				STEVENS
		I'll fly down on a Friday, refuel in the
		Bahamas, and then to Medellin.

				INEZ
		Friday?

	Inez addresses Diego and Cesar only.  She speaks in Spanish.
	The conversation is about "Why Friday?"  Inez has some
	problem with it.  Diego explains.  And Inez is reassured.

				DIEGO
		Please, continue.

				GEORGE
		We make the pick-up, refuel once more in
		the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with
		the mom and pop traffic.

				CESAR
		Why are you speaking?

				GEORGE
		Excuse me?

				CESAR
		You.  Your responsibility is over.  You
		do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You
		are not a distributor.  You introduced
		us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his
		airplane.  That is all.  You make a
		percentage.  A generous one.  And you're
		lucky to get that.

				GEORGE
		I see.  How much?

				CESAR
		Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo.
		For everyone.  For you, and you, and
		you.

	He indicates George, Diego and Jack Stevens.

				CESAR (CONT'D)
		There is no negotiation.  Three-million
		dollars.  That is all.

				STEVENS
		I want two.

				GEORGE
		Gee, Jack, a million each had such a
		nice ring to it.

				STEVENS
		No way.  I'm doing all the work.  Taking
		all the risk, and it's my plane.

	Diego and George look at each other.

				STEVENS (CONT'D)
		Hey, you guys don't have to do shit.
		Just sit back and collect your money.

				GEORGE
		You good with this?

	Diego nods.

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		Alright.

	This is too much for Inez to handle.  She starts screaming
	machine gun Spanish.  Something about a "lousy two-hundred
	and fifty-thousand dollars," and how Diego is "such a coward"
	to give away all his money.  Diego is embarrassed but tries
	to remain calm.

				DIEGO
		You will watch what you say.  Especially
		around George.  He is my brother and he
		speaks as good Spanish as you.

	But Inez is wild.  She starts in again, a log of "Putos
	(SOB's)", and "Cojones" and "Maricones (gay/sissys)."  Even
	Cesar is uncomfortable.  Diego stands.

				DIEGO (CONT'D)
		Okay.  That's enough.

				INEZ
		Get your hands off me.

	Inez takes a swing at Diego and catches him full across the
	face.  Time stops in the room.  Question.  What will Diego
	do?  Answer: SMACK!  Diego swings back and a full scale is
	on.  Cesar continues the conversation.  It's surreal.  As if
	Diego and Inez weren't beating the shit out of each other
	right in front of them.

				CESAR
		Do you have pictures of your kids?

				STEVENS
		What?

				CESAR
		I'll need to see them.  Also need their
		names and the names of their schools.
		We are trusting you with ninety million
		dollars worth of coca, Mr. Stevens.
		Without your children, there is no deal.

	Stevens thinks about it.  Kids as collateral.  Inez and Diego
	are still duking it out.  But Diego finally gets the upper
	hand and drags her into the bedroom.

				STEVENS
		Fine.  So if that's all, I'll be leaving
		now.

	Cesar walks him to the door.

				CESAR
		Don't forget the pictures.

	Diego calls from the other room.

				DIEGO (O.S.)
		George.  George, come in here.


	INT. LA BELLE MER - BEDROOM - LATER

	Diego has put Inez in the bathroom and is holding the door
	closed.  She pounds and kicks and screams in frustration, but
	he pays no attention.

				DIEGO
		What's the matter, George?

				GEORGE
		What's the matter?  We're moving three
		hundred fucking kilos and we're making
		dogshit.

				DIEGO
		A million dollars for our first run is
		not bad, George.

				GEORGE
		It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might
		as well be hauling suitcases across the
		border.  We're getting screwed.

				DIEGO
		I know.

				GEORGE
		And what happens when these guys stop
		paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are
		going to cut us out.  Then where are we?

				DIEGO
		That's my George, always thinking.

	The door is yanked open to reveal Inez.  She is in a rage.
	Diego slams it in her face.

				DIEGO (CONT'D)
		This is only part of the business,
		George.  A very small part.  Don't
		worry, there is so much more to do.
		Which reminds me, I need a favor from
		you.  I must go to Colombia.

				GEORGE
		What is it, George?  Because I have to
		get home.  I've got a parole officer
		waiting for me.

				DIEGO
		I need you to go to Miami.

	EXT. VENETIAN KING APTS. - MIAMI - 1977 - DAY

	George gets out of a taxi to find SEVERAL COLOMBIAN MEN
	hanging around outside an apartment.  He checks the address
	and moves over to the men.

				GEORGE
		I'm George.  Friend of Diego's?

	The Colombian men are not impressed.  They grab George and
	pull him inside.

	INT. VENETIAN KING APTS. - CONTINUOUS

	George is pinned against the wall and the Colombian men all
	start screaming at him in Spanish.  There seems to be a
	problem.  A man, ALESSANDRO, steps forward.  He is the one
	who speaks English.

				ALESSANDRO
		QUIET!  Callate!  Where's Diego?

				GEORGE
		I don't know.  He sent me.  I'm George.

				ALESSANDRO
		Oh, I see.  George.  Well, that explains
		everything.  Open your mouth, George.

	George's puzzled look is replaced by a gun barrel in his
	face.  Alessandro presses it against George's front teeth.

				ALESSANDRO (CONT'D)
		Now, you listen to me.  Are you hearing
		me?

	George nods.

				ALESSANDRO (CONT'D)
		You see this?

	He indicates two duffel bags stuffed with fifty kilos of
	cocaine.

				ALESSANDRO (CONT'D)
		I've been holding this shit for him for
		three weeks.  You tell Diego I don't
		appreciate it.  You tell him I want my
		money by Friday.  Can you do that?

				GEORGE
		Um-hmm.

	INT. JUNG HOUSE - GEORGE'S ROOM - DAY

	George sits on his bed, reading.  Two duffel bags are tucked
	away in the closet.  Ermine pokes her head in.

				ERMINE
		You have a phone call.

	George picks up the phone.

				DIEGO (O.S.)
		George.

				GEORGE
		Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you?
		It's been eleven days and these guys
		want their fucking money.

				DIEGO (O.S.)
		Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.

				GEORGE
		Well, you better get here fast.  I'm

	George notices Ermine is loitering in the hallway,
	eavesdropping.

		Hi, Mom.

	George acknowledges her before shutting the door in her face.

		I'm sitting on fifty fucking keys.  Get
		your ass up here.

	INT. CARCEL DE VARONES - MEDELLIN, COLOMBIA - CONTINUOUS

	It's a South American prison.  Diego is on the pay phone.

	INT. FOREAL'S HOUSE - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1977 - NIGHT

	George and Derek sit in the living room with MR. T, a hippie
	ish looking professor.  On the table sits various
	paraphernalia.  Scales, beakers, test tubes, and a hot box.
	George and Derek watch as Mr. T scoops some of George's
	cocaine and sets it onto the two-inch metal plate.

				MR. T
		What we're doing is measuring the
		purity.  Pure coke melts out a hundred
		and eighty-five, a hundred and ninety
		degrees.  Cutting agents melt much
		lower.  About a hundred degrees.
		Quality product starts melting at a
		hundred and forty degrees.  That's what
		I'm hoping for.

	Mr. T turns the dial.  120.  130.  140.

				MR. T (CONT'D)
		Good.

	150.  160.

				MR. T (CONT'D)
		Jesus Christ.

	170.  180.

				MR. T (CONT'D)
		Holy fucking Mary!  Jesus, fuck me
		running!  Where did you get this shit!

	At one-hundred and eighty-seven degrees, the white powder
	dribbles off the hotplate and melts away.

				MR. T (CONT'D)
		Damn!  Can I do a fucking line?!

	Mr. T puts his nose in the powder.  George pulls Foreal
	aside.

				GEORGE
		What did I tell you?

				DEREK
		It's great and everything, but what am I
		going to do with all this?

				GEORGE
		Sell it?

				DIEGO
		Jesus Christ, George, I don't see you in
		two years, and you show up at my door
		with a hundred and ten pounds of
		cocaine?

				GEORGE
		Just sell it, Derek.

				DEREK
		Alright, but it's gonna take me a year.

	INT. THE WHIPPING POST - MANHATTAN BEACH - 1977 - NIGHT

	Money everywhere.  All over the floor, the counters, the
	chairs, and even in the sinks.  George and Derek count the
	money patiently, writing the dollar amount in yellow high
	lighter on the top of each stack, before wrapping it with a
	rubber band.

				DIEGO
		Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it.
		Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.

				GEORGE
		I think it's fair to say you
		underestimated the market there, Derek.

				DIEGO
		Touche.

				GEORGE
		But to the victor belong the spoils.

	George divides the money.  There's a hell of a lot.

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		Half a million for you.  Half a million
		for me.  One-point-three five for the
		Colombians.

				DEREK
		Nice doing business with you, George.

		Not bad for a weekend's work, huh?

	INT. AIRPORT - MIAMI - DAY

	Immaculate in his white turtleneck and sunglasses, George

		Greetings, Mr. George.

		Where do you guys want to count?

				ALESSANDRO
		On the plane.

		What plane?  We going someplace?  Where

	They usher him away.

	EXT. DESERTED SUGAR FACTORY - LOS RIOS, COLOMBIA - DAY

	The blazer pulls into a long driveway.  They approach a gate
	where SHIRTLESS TEENAGERS with MAC-10's stand guard.  The
	gate opens.  YOUNG SOLDIERS open the door for George and
	roughly usher him over to a Jeep within the confine.  They
	frisk him top to bottom.  Diego is leaning against another
	Jeep and waits for George to be released.

				DIEGO
		George, good to see you, my brother.

				GEORGE
		What the fuck is going on?  When did you
		get out of jail?

				DIEGO
		Pablo used his influence.  Now, George,
		watch what you say.  Everybody hears
		everything.  A lot of things get said
		and done that, well, let's just say this
		isn't America.  Life is cheap here, you
		know?  No offense, but you know what I'm
		saying?

				GEORGE
		Yeah.  Keep my mouth shut and let you do
		the talking.

				DIEGO
		Right.  Now who is the person in
		California?  The connection?

				GEORGE
		Just a friend.

				DIEGO
		Who?  I need to know.  Ah, never mind.
		We'll talk about it later.

				GEORGE
		Yeah.  You do the talking.

	The sound of a young man, a MALETON, struggling can be heard
	in the distance.  From another area, PABLO ESCOBAR emerges.
	He is singular in purpose.  He is handed a pistol and moves
	quickly over to the man and quietly speaks a few words.  And
	then, without emotion, he shoots the maleton in the head.
	George and Diego, who is visibly shaken, watch.  Escobar is
	handed a towel, and he wipes the splattered blood off his
	hands, as he moves back.

				LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN
		He will see you now.
		    (to Diego)
		Not you.

				DIEGO
		There must be some kind of mistake.

				LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN
		No mistake.  Mr. Escobar will see Mr.
		Jung alone.  You are to wait here.

	George hesitates.

				DIEGO
		It's alright, George.  You go.

				LARGE COLOMBIAN MAN
		This way, please.

	The large Colombian man escorts George towards the area where
	the maleton was just shot.  George looks back at Diego as he
	is led away.

				ESCOBAR
		So, this is the man who takes fifty
		kilos and makes them disappear in one
		day?

				GEORGE
		Actually, it was three.

				ESCOBAR
		The man who gives us the airplanes.  The
		man from America.  The mafia.  Chicago.
		Boom boom.  Hollywood.  You are going to
		open for us the gates of Hollywood,
		George?

				GEORGE
		It would be my pleasure.

				ESCOBAR
		Good.  Very good.  Welcome, my friend.
		Welcome to my country.

	Escobar moves over to embrace George.  George returns it, and
	their hands come together.  George can't help it.  He
	reflexively looks at his hands.  Escobar understands.

				ESCOBAR (CONT'D)
		The man in the garden.  He was full of
		courage.

				GEORGE
		Un sapo?

				ESCOBAR
		Un rata - no good.  But he could have
		run, fled the country.  Gone to the
		policia.  But then his wife, his
		children, his parents, his friends, many
		people would die.

				GEORGE
		Yes.

				ESCOBAR
		But, never mind.  I am thinking we can
		do much together.  This problem with
		Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very
		silly business.  To release him from the
		carcel, it causes me much inconvenience.
		The fifty kilos could have been a big
		problem.  And I don't like problems.

				GEORGE
		With all respect, Padrino.  Diego is my
		partner.  I do not do business without
		him.

	Escobar looks at him with a cold stare.  But George doesn't
	flinch.  His face reveals nothing.  Finally, a smile breaks
	across Pablo's lips.

				ESCOBAR
		I like you, George.  You are loyal.
		That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe
		crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You
		are like me.  I look at you and I see
		myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?

				GEORGE
		Yes, it is.

				ESCOBAR
		So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine
		for me in your country, George?

				GEORGE
		Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.

				ESCOBAR
		As much as I can give you?  Ha ha.  Very
		good.  I like that.  Come, George.  Let
		us drive.  We have much to talk about.

	Diego watches the two men walk outside.  Escobar throws an
	arm around George's shoulder.  Pablo hops into a Jeep and
	motions for George.  The bodyguards come running.  But Pablo
	waves them away.

	EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - COLOMBIA - DAY

	Escobar pulls the Jeep off the road and parks it.  Before
	them is a stunning panorama.

				ESCOBAR
		I like to come up here.  To make the
		decisions.  To be one with nature.

				GEORGE
		It's beautiful.

				ESCOBAR
		People tell me that I am crazy.  That my
		business will never work in your
		country.  What do you think, George?

	Escobar looks out over the vista, allowing George the time to
	respond in full.

				GEORGE
		What do I think?  I don't want my answer
		to be influenced by what I want, so I'm
		going to have to say I don't know.

				ESCOBAR
		Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do
		you want, George?

				GEORGE
		I want money.

				ESCOBAR
		Yes.  Money.  Which is what, George?

				GEORGE
		Freedom.

				ESCOBAR
		Power?

				GEORGE
		Yeah, maybe.

				ESCOBAR
		Family.

				GEORGE
		Sure.

				ESCOBAR
		Beautiful girls?

				GEORGE
		Keep them coming.

				ESCOBAR
		Keep them coming?  Ah, yes.  Ha ha.  You
		are right.  But money.

				GEORGE
		Money.

				ESCOBAR
		And Diego?

				GEORGE
		Diego is my brother.

	Escobar looks at George a long time.  He's inscrutable.

				ESCOBAR
		Good.  Take care of him, George.  I'm
		fond of him, but he is sometimes like a
		baby.  Keep an eye on him, okay?

	EXT. DESERTED SUGAR FACTORY - ENTRANCE - DAY

	Diego is a little pissed off for being left for so long.  He
	taps his foot and picks at his fingernails.  Escobar and
	George pull up in the Jeep.  Diego leaps to his feet.

				DIEGO
		Padrino.

	Escobar wraps his arms around Diego in an embrace.

				ESCOBAR
		Diego, mijo.  I've made a decision.  We
		are going into business and I would like
		to start right away.

	MONTAGE - GEORGE AND DIEGO TAKING OVER THE WORLD

	The following images are overlaid with snow falling and money
	dropping through frame.  CLOSE SHOTS of George and Diego on
	the phone, wheeling and dealing, hands counting cash, and
	lines being drawn off mirrors.  The effect is surreal and
	dreamy.

	INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

	A duffel bag is unzipped, revealing bricks and bricks of
	cocaine.  Each marked with a "P."  A knife punctures one of
	the bricks.  A mound of white powder is brought up to a man's
	nose.  It's George who samples, and then it is sampled by the
	man he is doing business with.  The shot widens TO REVEAL all
	the participants and dozens and dozens of duffel bags.  A
	handshake seals the deal.

	Handshake after handshake after handshake.

	INT. MIAMI HOUSE - NIGHT

	George and Diego counting cash.  It's everywhere.  All over
	the floor, in two-foot stacks.

	Various transactions completed.

	INT. MIAMI HOUSE - NIGHT

	George and Diego count.  It's ridiculous how much money there
	is.  The stacks are now waist high and spill into other
	rooms.  Inez is there, pacing the floor and rapid-fire
	talking on the phone.

	MORE STILL PHOTOS

	George and Diego, the Banditos.  Cigars.  Champagne.  Arms
	around each other in camaraderie.  In Diego's yellow Ferrari.
	With Inez, sunning on a yacht.  More coke and more
	transactions.  When the deals are with Derek Foreal, Diego is
	always notably absent.

	INT. MIAMI HOUSE - NIGHT

	The money is so high, it almost reaches the ceiling.  There
	is nowhere to put it.  George and Diego sit at the coffee
	table, dwarfed by the stacks of bills.  There is a
	discrepancy in the count.

				GEORGE
		Three million.  I counted it twice.

				DIEGO
		It's two-point-five, George.  I am sure.

	George starts to pick up the money.

				GEORGE
		I'm calling it three.

				DIEGO
		We're half a million off.

				GEORGE
		Fuck it.  I'm not counting it again.

				DIEGO
		Weight it.  If it's sixty pounds, it's
		three.  If it's fifty, it's two-point
		five.

				GEORGE
		I don't give a shit.  Close enough.

	George moves down the hall looking for a place to stack the
	money, but there is no more room.

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		Where do I put this!?

				DIEGO
		Try the back bedroom.

	George opens the back bedroom door to find wall-to-wall
	money.  It's packed.

				GEORGE
		There's no room.

				DIEGO
		Try the closet.

	No luck there, either.  George drops the money on the floor
	and moves back into the living room.

				GEORGE
		We've got to do something about this.

	INT. BANCO DE FEDERALE - PANAMA CITY - DAY

	SUPERIMPOSE: PANAMA CITY, PANAMA

	George and Diego watch as their money is hauled into a huge
	wall safe.  Armed Panamanian soldiers stand guard.  The
	Panamanian officials and the BANK PRESIDENT oversee the
	proceedings.

				GEORGE
		Are you comfortable with this?

				DIEGO
		George, we've got sixty-one million
		dollars.  It's either here or someplace
		else.  We've got to put it somewhere.
		Unless you want to launder it.

				GEORGE
		And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.

				DIEGO
		Then relax.  It's a federal bank.
		Guaranteed by the government.  And Senor
		Noriega has very lenient banking
		principles.  No questions.  No problems.
		All the pesados keep their money here.
		Even El Padrino.  What do you worry?
		Everyone knows we are with Escobar.  Who
		is going to fuck with us?

	INT. BANCO DE FEDERALE - PRESIDENT'S OFFICE - DAY

	George and Diego sign papers.  The bank president
	congratulates them and hands them documentation.

				GEORGE
		I love it.

				BANK PRESIDENT
		I'm sorry.

				GEORGE
		I give you thirty-million dollars and
		you give me this little book.

	best man, and the only American.

	INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - BALLROOM - NIGHT

	A huge reception.  All the pomp and circumstance Colombian
	money can buy.  Politicians.  Policemen.  And every smuggler
	north of Colombia.  George sits with Diego and Inez at the
	table of honor.  Inez is opening presents.  Diego's tipsiness
	is a little out of character, but hey, it's his wedding day
	and a little champagne never hurt anyone.  He drunkenly
	throws his arm around George's shoulder.

				DIEGO
		I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't
		believe it.  Can you believe I'm
		married, George?

				GEORGE
		You're a lucky man, Diego.

				DIEGO
		I love you, my brother, do you know
		that?

				GEORGE
		I love you too, man.

	George notices MIRTHA showing teeth across the room.

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		I'll be right back, Diego.

				INEZ
		Look, honey, a power boat.

				DIEGO
		Great, baby, great!

	They kiss.  George walks across the dance floor directly
	towards Mirtha.

				GEORGE
		Hello.

				MIRTHA
		Hello.

				GEORGE
		Do I know you?

				MIRTHA
		I don't think so.

				GEORGE
		Why are you smiling?

				MIRTHA
		Why are you smiling?

				GEORGE
		I don't know.  My name is George.

				MIRTHA
		I know who you are, El Americano.
		Mister George.

				GEORGE
		What is your name?

	Cesar arrives.

				CESAR
		Mr. Jung, I see you've met my fiancee,
		Mirtha.

	He kisses her.

				GEORGE
		Mirtha.

				CESAR
		Diego needs to see you right away,
		please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.

	They leave.  George looks back, Mirtha is giving him more
	teeth.  George arrives at the table.  Various greetings.

				AUGUSTO
		Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I
		am Augusto Oliveras.

				GEORGE
		My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me
		much about you.

				RAMON OCHOA
		Congratulations on your conquest of the
		West Coast.   How much bigger can we
		get?

				GEORGE
		Sky's the limit.  We're just beginning
		to tap the market.  If it's accepted by
		actors and musicians, the rest will
		follow.

	They all agree.  Mirtha still gives George the teeth from
	across the room.  Diego returns to the table.

				AUGUSTO
		We are talking about George's West Coast
		operation.

				DIEGO
		Ah, George's mystery man.

				RAFAEL OJEDA
		Yes, where is this man?  When do we meet
		him?

				DIEGO
		You don't meet him.  George keeps this a
		secret.  He's here meeting everyone,
		goes to Colombia and meets Pablo, but
		still keeps his secrets.  Even from his
		brother.

				JUAN CARLOS "THE GUAPO"
		Come on, George, we're all in this
		together.

		Yes, George, there's enough for

		I think Padroni is happy with the

	George exits after Mirtha.

	INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS

	George steps into the empty lobby looking for Mirtha.  He
	can't find her.  She appears from the shadows and startles

	it off.  She squeals with delight.
	A table gets knocked over as they cause a commotion.  A hotel

		I need a fucking drink.

	George moves to the bedroom.  Mirtha is pregnant and she's

				GEORGE
		Jesus Christ.

		Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite.
		I quit smoking, didn't I?

		Put that shit away, they're here.

	INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - LATER

	Mirtha and George lead Fred and Ermine from room to room,

		It's all so beautiful.

				MIRTHA
		What do you think, Dad?

				FRED
		Yeah.  Nice.

				ERMINE
		Look at this credenza.  If you don't
		mind me asking, how much is something
		like that?  It's got to cost a fortune.

				GEORGE
		    (quickly)
		It's a family heirloom.

				ERMINE
		I've seen those in magazines.  They're

				GEORGE
		Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.

				FRED
		Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see
		you very much, I don't want to waste the
		time.

	They move along the rear of the house.  Classic cars line the
	driveway.

				FRED (CONT'D)
		You come from my body, remember?  You're
		my baby boy.  The same kid who would
		jump off a mountain if someone told him
		he couldn't do it.  You haven't changed
		much.  I know the things you do.  Not
		everything.  But I get the picture and I
		don't care.  I don't like it.  It's not
		what I would have chosen for you, but
		it's your life.  It doesn't have
		anything to do with me.

	He turns and looks at his boy.

				FRED (CONT'D)
		You're like your mother.  You love

				GEORGE
		Dad.

				FRED
		No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's

		Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.

	INT. HOLIDAY MOTEL - LITTLE HAVANA - 1978 - DAY

	Diego puts a straw in his nose and snorts a big gakker.  His
	eyes are wide, his pupils dilated, and a weapon sticks out of
	the back of his pants.  He knocks the dust off his nose
	before moving outside.  George is on the porch, smoking a
	cigarette.

				DIEGO
		Three years.  How long have we been in
		business?  Three years.  Does she get to
		meet your connection?  Was she good
		enough?

				GEORGE
		Shut up, Diego.  They're going to be
		here any minute.  I'm trying to
		concentrate.

				DIEGO
		I'm very angry with you, George.  Very
		angry.  You don't take me to California,
		but you take your bitch wife?  A woman?
		I understand you love her, but it was
		you and me who started this.  You and
		me.

				GEORGE
		What do you need my connection for,
		Diego?  What are you going to do with
		it?

				DIEGO
		What do I do with it?  Nothing.  It's
		for peace of mind.  It's for the
		principle.

	George doesn't have time for this.  He checks the cylinders
	on his weapon and runs over possible scenarios in his mind.
	But Diego won't get off the soap box.

				GEORGE
		Jesus fucking Christ, Diego.  I ain't
		telling you.  It's just business.  Now,
		shut up.  You're driving me crazy.

				DIEGO
		I'm driving you crazy?  No.  You're
		driving me crazy.  We had a dream.  What
		happened to our dream?

	A black sedan pulls up and FIVE PUERTO RICAN MEN approach the
	room.  George and Diego greet them and lead them inside.
	It's game time.  The atmosphere is charged with danger and
	everyone is acutely aware of everything.  The guys sit down,
	their guns bulging through the inside of their suits.  The
	suitcases are opened.  The rules are the same.  No English.
	No raising voices.  No sudden movements.  George offers their
	leader, TONY, beers for his men, and is politely declined.
	The count starts.  George and Diego riff through ten thousand
	dollar bundles.  Diego is still acting pissy.  He's mumbling
	to himself, making faces, slamming the money all around.  The
	guys keep a close eye on him.  Diego finishes a stack, throws
	one of the bags on the ground.  The conversation is in
	Spanish unless otherwise indicated.

				TONY
		Algun problema?

				GEORGE
		No no no... no problema, amigo.  El
		dinero esta todo aqui.
		Lleves las "llaves" y mas tarde lo
		contaremos.  Okay?  No problem.

				TONY
		Que problema?  Nosotros esperamos.

	The pressure is getting to one of the hoods.  His name is
	BENNY.  He's got a crazy eye and he seems ready to snap.
	George resumes the count, but Diego won't get off it.

				DIEGO
		    (English)
		You embarrassed me, George.  You make me
		look very bad.

				BENNY
		Que esta diciendo?

				GEORGE
		Nothing.  Todo esta bien.

				DIEGO
		    (English)
		Everything is not alright.  I bring you
		in, and you slap my fucking face!

				GEORGE
		This is not the time, Diego.

	The men all reach for their pieces and all hell starts to
	break loose.

				TONY
		Hay algun problema?  Hablame!

				DIEGO
		    (English)
		You fucked me in front of my whole
		family!

				GEORGE
		Fuck you...I didn't fuck you.

				BENNY
		Maldita sea, que diablos esta diciendo?

				GEORGE
		Esta todo aqui, amigo...take the keys.
		Take 'em and go.

				TONY
		Que esta pasando aqui, jefe?

				DIEGO
		Sientese ye no se meta en lo que no le

	The guns are out and pointed.  It's out of control now.

				GEORGE
		Take it easy!  Everything's okay!

				DIEGO
		Que es lo que quieren de me, hijueputas
		campesinos?

	George steps forward with the keys.

				GEORGE
		Take the fucking keys!

	BLAM!  Courtesy of Benny, George is hit.  The shoulder, the
	collarbone.  It's hard to tell.

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is
		alright.  There's no problem.  Okay?
		This never happened.  No one has to know
		anything about this.  Diego, I want you
		to calmly tell them where the fucking
		coke is.  Do it now.

				DIEGO
		Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.

	Tony very carefully takes the car keys.

				GEORGE
		No problem, gentlemen.  Goodbye.

	The men slowly back out the door.  George looks at Diego.

				GEORGE (CONT'D)

				AUGUSTO
		I'm so glad you two could make it.
		Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You
		look like you're about to burst.

				MIRTHA
		Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?

				AUGUSTO
		I don't know.  Drunk somewhere.  Try the
		bar.  And if you find her, tell her to
		come, it's almost midnight.

	As Mirtha leaves, Augusto throws his arm around George's
	shoulder.

				AUGUSTO (CONT'D)
		It's good you came down, George.  We
		need to discuss a few things.

				DIEGO
		Where's Diego?

				AUGUSTO
		He's not here, George.

				GEORGE
		Yeah, well where is he?  And who is this
		Norman K. guy?  That's all anyone is
		talking about.  Norman K.  Norman K.  Do
		I know him?

	Augusto lets out a big laugh.

				AUGUSTO
		Norman Cay is not a person.  He is an
		island, George.  In the Bahamas.  From
		what they say, it is free and it's
		Diego's new home.

				GEORGE
		What?

	Augusto throws an arm around George's shoulder.

				AUGUSTO
		Let us walk.  From what I understand,
		Diego has bought a hundred and sixty
		acres, a marina, a hotel, and an
		airstrip.

				GEORGE
		Motherfucker works fast.

				AUGUSTO
		The word is that soon he is to be king
		of the middle empire.  He is doing
		multiple runs right now and using the
		island as a jump-off point.

				GEORGE
		He what?

				AUGUSTO
		Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very
		busy man.  Along with many others.  You
		shouldn't stay away so long.

				GEORGE
		That's impossible.  We can't be up and
		running.  Who's distributing?

	Augusto says nothing.  But the ball is dropping in Times
	Square.  10, 9, 8, 7...

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		Oh, no.

	Happy New Year.  Streamers, confetti, and champagne.  George
	marches through the kissing guests and over to a phone.  He's
	steaming.  The music is up, so he has to scream.

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		Hello, Derek?  This is George.  Am I
		wearing lipstick?
		I said, am I wearing lipstick?  Because
		when I'm getting fucked, I want to make
		sure my face is pretty.  You're buying

		It's nothing personal, George.  Just

				GEORGE
		Yeah.  I understand.  Just business.
		Right.  Fuck you.

	INT. THE YACHT CLUB - SUNSET

	The Yacht Club is a tavern style bar that juts out over the

	like Che Guavera.  His hair is long, and a graying beard
	sticks through his gaunt face.  The bar has been taken over
	by Diego's BANDITOS.  Automatic weapons and PROSTITUTES
	accent this drunken setting.  George is escorted through the
	door by Cesar, and the room quiets.  All eyes on Diego and
	George.  Diego rises.

				DIEGO
		George, I am happy to see you.  How are
		you, my brother?

				GEORGE
		No more brothers, Diego.

				DIEGO
		Of course we are brothers.  Why do you
		say that?   You hurt me, George.

				GEORGE
		You fucked me, Diego.

				DIEGO
		I did not.

				GEORGE
		You went behind my back and you cut me
		out.

				DIEGO
		No, I never.  I would not do that,
		George.  Never.

				GEORGE
		I talked to Foreal, Diego.

	There is a pause.  Diego's goons ready their weapons as Diego
	scoops up a cringer with his pinky and sniffs.

				DIEGO
		Maybe you are right.  I did betray you a
		little bit.

	One of the men says something in Spanish and everyone laughs.
	George is furious.  He starts to tremble and his face turns
	red.

				DIEGO (CONT'D)
		Oh, boo hoo, boo hoo.  So sad, George.
		I stole your California connection.  So
		what?  Who introduced you to Pablo
		Escobar?  Me.  Who introduced you to
		your fucking Colombian wife?  Me.  Who
		protected you when my friend Cesar Roza
		wanted to slice your fucking throat,
		huh?  Who mad you millions and millions
		of dollars?  Me.  And what do I get in
		return?  This?  Accusations?  I have
		always given you everything, George, but
		that is over now.  This is my operation.
		My dream.  So go home, George.  Go back
		to your stupid little life.  You can
		sell half grams to your fucking
		relatives for all I care.  Because you
		are out!

	George lunges at Diego and is immediately grabbed.

				GEORGE
		You'd better kill me now, Diego, because
		you're a dead man.

				DIEGO
		George, don't be so emotional.  This is
		business.  Besides, I can't kill you,
		you are my brother.

	They lead him away.

	EXT. YACHT CLUB - CONTINUOUS

	George is getting the shit kicked out of him.  His teeth
	broken, kicked in the head, the body, the groin.  His arm
	stomped.  Blood and broken bones.  It's a king size beating.
	The men prop him up and Cesar reaches back and hits him with
	a haymaker.  CRACK.  George's nose is broken.  Blood spurts
	everywhere.  George is dropped to the ground, spit on, and
	left for dead.

				CESAR
		Say "hi" to your pretty wife for me.

	EXT. HACIENDA LOS NAPOLES - COLOMBIA - POOL - DAY

	A beautiful, sprawling estate.  A family barbecue, Colombian
	style, is in full swing.  Kids play soccer.  Zoo animals run
	wild together.

	George is led outside by TWO OVER-ARMED BODYGUARDS.  Pablo
	sees him and gives George a big hug.

				ESCOBAR
		George, you look terrible.

				GEORGE
		Yeah, well...

				ESCOBAR
		Diego?

				GEORGE
		Yeah.

				ESCOBAR
		Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some
		scotch.

				GEORGE
		I didn't come here to drink scotch.

				ESCOBAR
		I see.  I'm sorry about this, George.
		I'm not happy about this situation.
		It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus
		is.

				GEORGE
		You know why I'm here.  You know what I
		have to do.  I came here for permission.
		Out of respect, Pablo.  This is
		bullshit, he's making me look like a
		punk.

				ESCOBAR
		It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a
		lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the
		money.  You were an excellent teacher,
		George.  When the student has learned
		well, the teacher is no longer
		necessary.  We must remember we have
		wives, friends, familia.  Even familia
		that has not been born.  But sometimes,
		we must forget as well.  I am like you.
		I must teach the lesson.  We want to
		teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We
		must remember that life is the teacher.

				GEORGE
		You're saying life will take care of
		Diego?

				ESCOBAR
		Life will take care of everybody.
		Diego, me, you.  It is the teacher.

				GEORGE
		I get it.   I'm really pissed, Pablo.
		You know the DEA knows about Norman's
		Cay.  For Chrissakes, Diego worships
		Adolf Hitler and John Lennon, that's
		fucked up!

				ESCOBAR
		I'm sorry, George.

				GEORGE
		Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You
		and me, Pablo?  Are we good?

				ESCOBAR
		Of course, George.  We are beautiful.
		We are brothers.  Real brothers.  Not
		like Diego.  We started this, George.

	Escobar embraces George for a moment, and then George starts
	to move away.

				ESCOBAR (CONT'D)
		And, George?  The vengance?  It is best
		served cold.

	INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Mirtha is sleeping.  She's so big, she looks like she's gonna
	explode.  George sits on the bed and rests his hand on
	Mirtha's face.  He looks like the Elephant Man.

				MIRTHA
		George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look
		at you.

				GEORGE
		Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright.
		It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm
		out.

				MIRTHA
		Pablo said no?

				GEORGE
		Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm
		never going back.  I have you.  We have
		the baby.  And there's nothing else.
		It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep
		now.

	EXT. EASTHAM HOUSE - DAY

	Fred, Ermine and Mirth are waiting for George in the car.
	Mirtha's water has broken.  Ermine honks the horn from the
	back seat and screams out the window.

				ERMINE
		George, it's time!  George!  George!

	INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

	George is high and in a panic.  He races around, trying to
	get a suitcase packed and find his keys.

				GEORGE
		Coming!

	He finally gets it together, but before he runs out the door,
	he does one last blast.

	INT. CAPE COD HOSPITAL - HYANNIS - MATERNITY - DAY

	Mirtha is on the birthing table and screaming in pain.  She's
	crowning.  George wears hospital scrubs and a surgical mask.
	He and his saucer pupils hold Mirtha's hand in comfort.  The
	baby comes, and DOCTOR MICK BAY slaps it's behind and cuts
	the cord.  Tough ass Mirtha breaks down and sobs
	hysterically.  But something is wrong with George.  The color
	drains from his face.  He grabs his chest and falls over onto
	the floor.  The MEDICAL STAFF attends to him.

				GEORGE (V.O.)
		Watching my baby girl born did something
		to me.
		They talk about religious experiences, I
		didn't believe in religion.  But when
		Kristina Sunshine Jung came into this
		world, something in me changed.  I
		looked at her and I knew right then that
		I could never love anything but my
		daughter ever again.  It sounds sappy,
		but it was like, click, I knew what I
		was put on this planet for.  It was the
		greatest feeling I ever had followed by
		the worst feeling I ever had.

				NURSE
		He fainted.

				MIRTHA
		George!

	The doctor grabs George's wrist.

				DR. BAY
		He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart
		is racing.  Have you been using drugs?

				GEORGE
		Coke.

				DR. BAY
		Cocaine?  How much?

				GEORGE
		I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.

				DR. BAY
		In how long?  A week?

				GEORGE
		Today.

				DR. BAY
		Oh, Jesus, Get me a 12-lead e.k.g. and
		start an i.v. stat!  This man is having
		a heart attack.

	INT. CAPE COD HOSPITAL - HYANNIS - LATER

	George lies in the recovery room, sedated, tubes everywhere.
	He's hooked up to IV's, monitors, and machines.  Dr. Bay
	enters.

				DR. BAY
		I've reviewed your toxicology report
		three times, George.  I've never seen
		anything like it.  Eighteen grams.
		The lethal dose is a gram and a half.
		You should be in the Guiness Book.

	George cracks a faint smile.

				DR. BAY (CONT'D)
		It's not funny, George.  You should be
		dead right now.  Absolutely.  I cannot
		come up with one logical explanation for
		why you're still breathing.  I'm not
		here to give you lectures, I've got no
		moral interest in what you do.  But,
		take it easy, George.  Stay with us a
		while.  You've got a daughter now.

	INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - DAY

	Kristina is crying.  Daddy George to the rescue.  He picks
	her up, cuddles her.  Gives her a bottle and she quiets.

	EXT. EASTHAM HOUSE - FRONT YARD - 1980 - DAY

	A one-year-old Kristina is being coaxed by George to take her
	first steps.

				GEORGE
		Come on.  Come on, honey.  You can do
		it.  Come to Daddy.

	Kristina tries, stumbles.  Gets up again.  She looks like a
	drunk, but she's doing it.

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		Good girl!

	Mirtha enters.  She's all pinned out, dressed in Ungaro,
	Cartier, and dark sunglasses.

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.

				MIRTHA
		She did that before.

				GEORGE
		No.  These are her first steps.  Watch
		her.

				MIRTHA
		Yeah.  I know.  She did that before.

				GEORGE
		But this is...

				MIRTHA
		I said, I've seen it before.

				GEORGE
		Alright.

				MIRTHA
		Can you lift the furnace.  I need money.

				GEORGE
		Where are you going?

				MIRTHA
		Out.

	MONTAGE - SERIES OF SHOTS - 1980-85

	HOME MOVIE STYLE & PHOTOGRAPHS

	The years go by and they are SUPERIMPOSED as they pass.
	George, clean and sober, enjoying family life.  Healthy and
	happy.  Mr. Mom.  Mirtha looks worse and worse as her habit
	becomes bigger and bigger.  As George and Kristina grow
	closer and closer, Mirtha is stepping out on the town.
	Blowing money right and left.  Shopping with Mirtha, buying
	clothes, furs, and diamonds.  As Kristina gets older, WE SEE
	her birthday parties.  George and Kristina wearing paper hats
	and eating ice cream.  She's two years old, she's three,
	four, five, six...

	INT. EASTHAM HOUSE - 1985 - NIGHT

	The Eastham house is all done up for a party deluxe.  Fully
	catered, with bartenders, waiters, music, the works.  And of
	course the three c's, champagne, caviar and Colombians.
	George is laughing with Augusto and Martha Oliveros, but when
	Derek Foreal appears in the doorway, George excuses himself
	and walks over.

				DEREK
		Happy Birthday, George.  Mirtha invited
		me.

				GEORGE
		Yeah.  She told me.

				DEREK
		Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I
		feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I
		did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me.
		Cut me out, too.

				GEORGE
		I heard.

				DEREK
		I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who
		my friends were.

				GEORGE
		It's in the past.  I'm out of the
		business now, so forget about it.  No
		hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And
		besides, I'm sorry, too.

				DEREK
		You?

				GEORGE
		For calling you a homo.

				DEREK
		That was out of line.

	George throws his arm around Derek's shoulder.

				GEORGE
		Good to see you, Derek.

	Mirtha runs in with a giant crystal punch bowl filled with
	mother of pearl.  She holds it over her head triumphantly.

				MIRTHA
		Now let's fucking party, motherfuckers!
		Let's have some fucking fun.

				DEREK
		Jesus, is that Mirtha!?

	A very underweight Mirtha nervously runs around the party,
	shoving coke up everyone's noses.  She is gakked to the gills
	and out of control.  Her pupils a mile wide.

				DEREK (CONT'D)
		Christ almighty, George.  Feed her a
		cheeseburger or something.  What does
		she weight, eighty pounds?

				GEORGE
		I know.  She needs to slow down.  She's
		going to blow an O-ring.

	Singing.  The birthday cake is brought in, the candles are
	blown out and everyone cheers.
	Mirtha runs over to her husband, still holding the cocaine.
	She's sweaty, her hair matted down on one side.

				MIRTHA
		Happy birthday, baby.  Do a line.

	She tries to push a line up his nose.

				GEORGE
		No, that's alright.

				MIRTHA
		Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down
		for once.  It's your fucking birthday,
		for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking
		pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this
		big time drug dealer and wound up with
		the maid.

	Mirtha's loud now and making a scene.  He thinks about it.

				GEORGE
		No honey, I'm alright.

				AUGUSTO
		A toast!  To Mister George Jung.  Mr. I
		95, north and south.  My brother-in-law.
		Happy birthday!

	Everyone raises their glasses.

				EVERYONE
		To George!

	A party guest comes running inside.

				PARTY GUEST
		Cops!  They're all over the place.

	The WAITERS, in their white jackets, exchange knowing looks.
	The BARTENDER comes out from behind the bar.

				BARTENDER
		Freeze!

	In an instant, all of the waiters' guns are out.

				WAITER
		Massachusetts State Police Department!
		Everybody on the floor!

	EXT. EASTHAM HOUSE - LATER

	Police cars everywhere.  All the party guests are filed out
	the door, and are being led away.  Mirtha is dragged out,
	spitting and screaming.  George, in handcuffs, is pushed to a
	squad car.  He looks through the window to see a FEMALE
	POLICE OFFICER escorting Kristina out of the house.

	INT. M.P.D. - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

	George, still dressed in his party clothes, sits at a desk.
	TWO DETECTIVES set a confession in front of him.

				GEORGE
		What's this?

				DETECTIVE #2
		It's your statement.  How it was all
		yours, the pound of coke was for
		personal use and none of the guests had
		any idea it was there, yeah, right.

	George looks through the papers.

				GEORGE
		I want my kid out of protective custody.
		Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my
		kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when
		they call me safe and sound.

				DETECTIVE #1
		No fucking way.

				GEORGE
		Fuck you, then.  I sign nothing.

	The detectives ponder.

				DETECTIVE #2
		Do it.

	Detective #1 walks to the door.

				DETECTIVE #1
		George?  You better get yourself a good
		lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your
		ass to the wall on this one.

				GEORGE
		Oh hey, one more thing?

				DETECTIVE #1
		What's that?

				GEORGE
		Get me a six pack.

	EXT. EASTHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT

	It's the middle of the night.  George walks through a dark
	and lonely house.  He goes to the furnace, opens it up and
	sees that there are only five stacks left.

				GEORGE
		Fuck.

	EXT. JUNG HOUSE - WEYMOUTH - PORCH - MORNING

	George pulls up to the front.

				GEORGE
		Hi.

				FRED
		I heard.  Ermine, your son is here.

				ERMINE (O.S.)
		Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell
		him he's not welcome here.

				GEORGE
		Mom.

	Ermine's back is to George.  She won't look at him.

				ERMINE
		Don't you dare step one foot in this
		house.  You're not my son, you hear me?
		I don't have a son anymore.

	She disappears into the house.  The sound of a door slamming.

				FRED
		She's angry.  It's all over the news.

				GEORGE
		Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going
		away for awhile.

				FRED
		You're not going to trial?

				GEORGE
		No.

				FRED
		Good.

	They stand there and look at each other for a while.  There's
	a lot to say but nothing's coming out.  George hands Fred a
	gym bag.

				GEORGE
		Give this to Mom, will you?

				FRED
		Money.  You and your mother.  All the
		time chasing it.  I never understood it.

				GEORGE
		Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her
		happy.

				FRED
		Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?

	The two men throw their arms around each other and hold on to
	one another in the doorway of the old house.

				GEORGE
		Tell Mom, you know...

				FRED
		I'll tell her.

	George breaks away and moves to the T-bird.

				FRED (CONT'D)
		Take care of yourself.

	INT. BANCO DE FEDERALE - PANAMA CITY - 1985 - DAY

	George walks through the bank.

	INT. BANCO DE FEDERALE - PANAMA CITY - CONTINUOUS

	George sits at a desk in front of a Panamanian BANK EMPLOYEE.
	He slides his bank book across the table.

				GEORGE
		I'd like to make a withdrawal.

	The employee opens the book and gets a funny look on his
	face.  Nervous.

				BANK EMPLOYEE
		Excuse me, please.

	He gets up and moves to the BANK MANAGER.  They move to
	another MANAGER TYPE.  And another.
	And then everyone disappears behind closed doors.  Finally,
	the BANK PRESIDENT emerges and moves over to George.

				BANK PRESIDENT
		I'm afraid there is a problem, Mr. Jung.
		The banks have gone through a change, a
		nationalization.  I'm afraid your funds
		have been appropriated by the Panamanian
		Government...

	George starts to shake.  The bank president tries to explain,
	but whatever he says is unimportant.  George is paralyzed.

	INT. APARTMENT - LIBERTY CITY, FLORIDA - NIGHT

	An inexpensive one-bedroom furnished apartment.  It ain't
	much, but it's home.  Mirtha has just received the news and
	is losing her mind.  Clara Blanca is cooking dinner.

				MIRTHA
		What are we going to do?!  What are we
		going to use for money?!

				GEORGE
		Please, Mirtha.  I'll start working for
		Augusto.  I'll talk to him tonight.
		I'll do something.

				MIRTHA
		Don't touch me.  Tell me.  Just answer
		the question.  What do I spend?  What?
		How will we live?

	Kristina sits there.  She hears everything, so does Clara
	Blanca.

				GEORGE
		Not in front of the kid.

				MIRTHA
		Don't give me that shit.  You just
		better do something.

	She storms into the bedroom and slams the door.  George
	stands there.  Awkward silence.  George goes to Kristina.

				GEORGE
		Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
		Don't be upset.

				KRISTINA
		What's happening to us?

	Tough question to answer.

				GEORGE
		I don't know.

				KRISTINA
		Are we gonna split up?

				GEORGE
		No, never.  Don't even think about that,
		it's impossible.  I love your mother.
		And you are my heart.  Could I live
		without my heart?  Could I?

	Kristina nods "no."  They embrace.

	INT. GEORGE'S THUNDERBIRD - MIAMI - NIGHT

	The car moves along I-95.  George is driving while a jacked
	up Mirtha does a speed bump.  A cop is following in the
	distance.  It is not okay.

				GEORGE
		There's a fucking cop behind us, Mirtha.
		Be cool, will ya.

				MIRTHA
		Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.

				GEORGE
		Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing
		cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your
		fucking problem?

				MIRTHA
		My problem?  We're broke, that's my
		fucking problem.  And you're a fucking
		spy.

				GEORGE
		What?

				MIRTHA
		That's right.  Always spying, always
		judging.  Everyone's laughing at you,
		you fucking pussy.  You let Diego fuck
		you in the ass.  Maybe you are a fucking
		faggot.  You must be fucking Diego
		because you're not fucking me.

	Mirtha grabs nuts.

				GEORGE
		Those are my nuts!

	George tries to fend her off.  The car swerves all over the
	road.  It's turned into a full scale fist fight.  The red
	lights of Florida's finest come up behind them and George is
	pulled over.

	EXT. I-95 - CONTINUOUS

	Mirtha leaps out of the car, teary eyed, crazed and bloodied.
	The policemen step from their car.

				MIRTHA
		He's a fugitive and a fucking cocaine
		dealer!  There's a kilo in his trunk
		right now!  Take this sorry motherfucker
		to jail!

	George sits behind the wheel.  He knows it's over.

	INT. M.C.I. WALPOLE - VISITING AREA - 1989 - DAY

	SUPERIMPOSE: FOUR YEARS LATER

	Visiting day.  Inmates sit across from their families.
	Mirtha is sitting at the glass.  George walks to his seat.

				MIRTHA
		I'm divorcing you, George.  I'm getting
		custody of Kristina.  And when you get
		out next week, you're going to pay
		support and that's the end of it.
		Alright?  There's someone else.  I'm
		sorry.

	George just looks at her.  His face is stone.  But he is
	moved.

				MIRTHA (CONT'D)
		You should have taken better care of me,
		you know?  You've been away a long time.
		Four years.  Say something.

				GEORGE
		What do you want me to say?  I'm in
		prison.  You should know.  You put me
		here.

				MIRTHA
		Fuck you, George.  I knew you'd say
		something like that.  Always thinking
		about yourself.

	She moves away and drags nine-year old Kristina into the
	room.
	Kristina yanks her arm away and they get into a heated
	argument.  Through the glass, George can't hear the words but
	it's clear that Kristina doesn't want to be here.

				GEORGE
		My baby.  She's so big.

	Mirtha forces Kristina over to the glass and keeps showing
	her, prompting her to talk.  Kristina stares at George
	through the glass.  Cool.  Defiant.  Angry.  She picks up the
	phone and speaks, every word an accusation.

				KRISTINA
		I thought you couldn't live without your
		heart.

	She drops the phone, walks away, and doesn't look back.

	INT. PHONE BOOTH - MIAMI STREETS - DAY

	George puts in the quarters.

				GEORGE
		Hello, Derek?  It's George.  Yeah.
		Yeah, I am.  I'm in Miami.  I'm looking
		to do something.  I want to put together
		a crew.  Do you know anybody?  Leon?  I
		don't know him.  What's his last name?
		Alright.  Give me the number.

	EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - MIAMI - DAY

	Nine-year old Kristina Jung leaves school.  George, fresh out
	of prison, moves across the street to meet her.

				KRISTINA
		What are you doing here?

				GEORGE
		Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I
		was out.  I just wanted to see you.

				KRISTINA
		Well, here I am.  See?

				GEORGE
		How are you doing?

				KRISTINA
		George, you just can't show up, tell me
		you love me, and have everything be
		okay.

				GEORGE
		Dad.

				KRISTINA
		What?

				GEORGE
		You can call me Dad if you want.

				KRISTINA
		I don't want, alright?  It's not funny.
		I'm really pissed off, George.  You blew
		it, now leave me alone.

				GEORGE
		Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going
		to make this right.  I've got a few
		things going on...

				KRISTINA
		What do you want from me?

				GEORGE
		Just to walk with you.  I want to be
		your dad again.

				KRISTINA
		Do what you want, it's a free country.

	She walks away.  He follows.

	INT. THE PALM LOUNGE - MIAMI - DAY

	George sits at the bar with a man named LEON MINGHELLA.

				LEON
		It's a four-man operation.  Two on the
		ground.  Two in the air.

				GEORGE
		Who's the co-pilot?

				LEON
		You're looking at him.  We provide the
		plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing
		spot, and take it to wherever you want
		it to go.  You provide the pick up point
		in South America, and are responsible
		for payment.  You assume all the bust
		risks.  We take sixty-five percent of
		all transportation fees, ten percent of
		the gross, plus our expenses.
		This is not a negotiation, so if this is
		okay with you, we can talk further.  If
		not, we can forget we had this
		conversation.

				GEORGE
		Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet
		everybody.

				LEON
		They're over at the booth.

	Leon leads George over.

				LEON (CONT'D)
		Gentlemen, this is George.  George, this
		is Ben, G.G. and...

	George's eyes widen as he looks at the last man.  It's Kevin
	Dulli.

				GEORGE
		Holy shit, Dulli!

				KEVIN
		Georgie, oh man, hold the mayo!

				GEORGE (V.O.)
		That was it.  Seeing Dulli after
		fourteen years sealed the deal for me.
		The rest was just details.  My end was
		roughly five-hundred thousand.  Kristina
		and I could have a good life for five
		hundred grand.  Start over somewhere.
		One final score.  That's all I needed.

	INT. OLIVEROS MANSION - MIAMI - DAY

				AUGUSTO
		Three-hundred kilos is a very big load,
		Georgie.  Why don't we start small?

				GEORGE
		No.  I have the space.  I figured it
		out.  This is what I want to do.

				AUGUSTO
		Alright.  I'll ask Pablo, tell him it's
		for you.  I don't think there will be a
		problem.

				GEORGE
		Five-thousand per kilo.

				AUGUSTO
		Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those
		days are over.  The rate is one-thousand
		dollars.  Inflation, you know?

				GEORGE
		This is a one time thing, Gusto.  One
		and I'm out.  Give me a good price for
		old time's sake.  What do you think?

	EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - MIAMI - DAY

	George and Kristina walk through the neighborhood.  He
	carries her books.

				GEORGE
		Let me ask you something.  If you could
		go anywhere in the world, anywhere,
		where would you want to go?

				KRISTINA
		You mean, like a trip?

				GEORGE
		Yeah, sure, whatever.

	Kristina thinks about it.

				KRISTINA
		I don't know.  Maybe California.

	George is amused by her answer.

				GEORGE
		California?  You can go anywhere in the
		world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia.
		Paris.  And you choose California?

				KRISTINA
		Yeah.

				GEORGE
		What is it?  A Disneyland thing?

				KRISTINA
		No.  I just kind of like the sound of
		it.

				GEORGE
		California, huh?

				KRISTINA
		California.

	They turn a corner and arrive at Kristina's house.  Mirtha is
	standing in the doorway.

				GEORGE
		Go on inside now.  I want to talk to
		your mom alone.

	He kisses his daughter goodbye.

				KRISTINA
		Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?

		What do you want?

				GEORGE
		You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?

				MIRTHA
		Yeah.  She told me.  You walk her to

				GEORGE
		Yeah, so I've been thinking.  I love
		her, y'know?  I kind of want to have
		her.  I've been away for so long.  Make
		up for the missed time, you know?

				MIRTHA
		I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You
		haven't paid me one cent in child
		support, alimony.

				GEORGE
		Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've
		got something going.

				MIRTHA
		Yeah?  I better see some money out of

				GEORGE
		Yeah, you will.  Of course.

	Mirtha looks at her ex-husband.  It's not all bad.

				MIRTHA
		Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows
		what will happen.  You're a good father,

		you've got to talk to her.

				GEORGE
		Yeah.

		She's getting big.  Getting her own

		I know.  Well, that's all I really
		wanted to say.  So, okay, then.

	They look bummed.  Leon looks at G.G.

				LEON
		What?

				G.G.
		I feel bad.

		Me too.  He's not such a bad guy.

		Fuck you guys.  All of you.  I've known

	The CAMERA PANS BACK SLOWLY to the bathroom door, George
	comes back into the room, dancing.  He goes and sits down

		Dulli, I was just thinking about that

		a lot better since then, huh pal?
		Remember that fucking landing strip?
		Huh?

	George is the only one smiling.  No one is looking at him.

		Hey, what's wrong fellas?  Why the long

	George takes it in.  Blinks.  The years have not been kind.

				GEORGE
		How's he doing?

				ZIGMOND
		Well, he's out of the hospital, but
		there's not much anyone can do for him.
		It's just a matter of time.  Listen, I
		brought a tape recorder in case you
		wanted to say something to him.  That

				GEORGE
		Right.

		You hear about your old friend, Diego?

		What about him?

	Garcia tosses a newspaper onto the table.  The Miami Herald.
	Inside is a full page letter addressed from Diego Delgado to

	make a deal.  In exchange for immunity, Diego will rat out
	the entire cocaine business.  Americans, Colombians, Noriega,
	Escobar, everybody.  Just let him free.

		What the fuck?  Is he going to walk?

		He's going down, George.  It's election

		So, how would you like to help us put
		him away?

		We've done our homework.  We know you
		hate this motherfucker.

				GEORGE
		I don't think so.

				GARCIA
		Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him.
		We've got him dead to rights.  But like
		I said, this is top priority so we're
		handing out free passes on this one.
		And the first one's got your name on it.
		Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.

		Did you hear about Diego?

				GEORGE
		Yeah.

				MIRTHA
		Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said
		this thing with Diego is a disaster.
		He's giving up lab locations, names,

	Packed.  Nuts.  Standing room only.  The courtroom buzzes as
	George is led down the center aisle and is handed off to the
	bailiff.  Over this we hear...

				CLERK
		Sir, please state your name.

				GEORGE
		I'm George Jung.  Spelled J-U-N-G.

				CLERK
		Thank you.

				PROSECUTOR
		Mr. Jung, do you know Diego Delgado?

				GEORGE
		Yes, I do.

				PROSECUTOR
		Do you see him here in the courtroom?

				GEORGE
		Yes, he's sitting right there at the end
		of the table.

				PROSECUTOR
		Let the record state the witness has
		identified, Diego Delgado.

	The following sound bytes are dissolved together in montage
	style...

				PROSECUTOR (CONT'D)
		Mr. Jung, can you describe the
		circumstances of how you began talking
		about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?

				GEORGE
		Shortly after I arrived at Danbury
		Federal Correctional Institute I related
		to Diego that the crime I was in for was
		smuggling marijuana.
		Diego told me he had high level
		connections in Colombia and they needed
		to find someone to help them transport
		cocaine into America...

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		The first run was fifteen kilos, which
		we smuggled into Logan Airport in hard
		shelled suitcases.

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		We wrapped the cocaine in kitchen
		cabinet paper, and duct tape, that way
		if there were any dogs in customs...

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		I introduced Diego to a pilot named Jack
		Stevens, who helped us fly 300 kilos of
		cocaine per week into the United States
		via twin-engine Cessnas.  Jack would fly
		into North Carolina, we'd meet him there
		and drive it down to different
		distribution points...

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		I never met Pablo Escobar.  Diego
		Delgado was my only connection to
		cocaine from Colombia...

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		Diego convinced me to keep most of my
		money in a Panamanian bank.  Diego had a
		close relationship with Manuel Noriega.
		In exchange for allowing us to keep our
		money there, we paid him a percentage.

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		There was an 85% chance that if you
		snorted cocaine between 1977-1984, it
		was ours. Initially with my LA
		connections, we invented the
		marketplace.  In 1977, there was no
		other real competition.

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		The first year we made about 100 million
		dollars between us.  It was an expensive
		operation.  Eventually we built up to
		three different pilots doing multiple
		runs per week, connections on both
		coasts, everything was running smooth.
		We were like a corporation...

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		he was very anti-government.  He talked
		about revolution, forming his own
		country or island, he was looking for
		power as well as money.  I was just
		looking for money.

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		He disliked the United States, thought
		it was a police state.  He hoped that by
		flooding the country with cocaine, it
		would disrupt the political system and
		tear down the morality of the country.

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		Well, yes, Derek Foreal was my
		connection, I met him back in 1968 when
		I first moved to Manhattan Beach.  It
		was Foreal's marijuana connections that
		kicked off our cocaine market.

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		Yes, it was my idea to bring the kilos
		to Los Angeles.  When Diego finally got
		Derek Foreal's name from me, it was only
		a matter of months before he'd cut me
		out.

				GEORGE (CONT'D)
		I'm not sure how my relationship with my
		daughter and ex-wife have anything to do
		with this trial.  I mean we're here to
		talk about Diego Delgado, aren't we?

				CALIBANOS
		Yes, we are Mr. Jung.

	We come out of the montage, the defense attorney Diego
	Delgado, Joe Calibanos, a sleazy-Greek-like-ex-basketball
	weight lifter guy is now doing the questioning.

				CALIBANOS (CONT'D)
		Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon,
		correct?

				GEORGE
		Yes, I am.

				CALIBANOS
		Do you have any agreement or
		understanding whatsoever with the United
		States government in regards to your
		testimony?

				GEORGE
		No, I cam here out of my own volition.

				CALIBANOS
		Excuse me?

				GEORGE
		Something about vengance being best
		served cold.

				CALIBANOS
		Really.  Are you getting paid, Mr. Jung?

				GEORGE
		Excuse me?

				CALIBANOS
		Mr. Jung, don't you have an agreement or
		understanding with the United States
		Government in connection with your
		testimony in this case?

				GEORGE
		I'm doing sixty years at Otisville, no
		chance of parole.  Even if they cut my
		sentence in half I'll be seventy-three
		years old.  That's some fucking deal.  I
		don't know if the parole board, the
		judge, the pope or Jesus Christ himself
		can get me out of here.  I have a really
		bad record, I'm not sure what's going to
		happen.

				CALIBANOS
		So you do have an agreement with the
		United States Government, Mr. Jung,
		correct?

	George can't respond.  Looks to Diego.  Looks from the jury,
	the judge, George is on the spotlight and it's uncomfortable.
	He feels suddenly sleazy.

				CALIBANOS (CONT'D)
		I thought so.  No more questions.

	Silence.  The judge tells George he can step down.  Calibanos
	laughs quietly with associates.  George is bummed.  He walks
	by Diego.  They look at each other.

				GEORGE
		You shouldn't have taken the 30 million,
		Diego, I was out.

	George is lead away.

	Jack Stevens is lead to the stand.  WE SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO:

	Kristina looks at her father, smiles, and disappears.  There
