AMERICAN HISTORY X 
screenplay by 
David McKenna 
February 6, 1997 


INT. HOUSE - CLOSED EYES                                                                                

A young man's blue eyes slowly open.  A girl moans from the next room.

EXT. STREET CORNER - A LARGE TIRE

turns the corner and splashes through a puddle from an
earlier rain. TUPAC SHAKUR blares from inside.

INT. HOUSE - TIGHT ON THE EYES

They snap wide as the young woman in the next room MOANS
even louder.

EXT. VENICE BEACH HOUSE - A WET NIGHT

A slight buzz emanates from the power lines and street
lights above the humble VINYARD household. A black FORD
BRONCO rests in the driveway.

EXT. WET STREET - A GRAY TRANS AM

TUPAC'S rapping builds. The window-tinted drive-by
slowly heads down the residential street, cruises past
the Bronco in the driveway, and slows to a stop. The
music stops and TWO BLACK MEN spring from the car.

They move with purpose. The larger figure, crowbar in
hand, moves to the truck. The GUN wielding passenger
hurries to the front door and stands guard. Inside the
car, another man methodically waits.

INT. BEDROOM - DANNY VINYARD'S EYES

The sex happening in the next room makes it difficult for
Danny to sleep. Next to a digital clock that reads
3:07AM, the clean cut 14-year-old flips to his side.

A poster of Lee Ving of FEAR onstage, taped to the wall.
Pre-Calculus and Biology books on the floor. Cassettes
scattered on his tiny desk. A stereo in the corner.

The off-screen sound of breaking glass grabs Danny's
attention. He sits up and looks through the blinds.

EXT. HOUSE - SAME

Danny SEES a man reach through the broken window and
unlock the door. He quickly. pans to the idling Trans Am.

INT. DANNY'S BEDROOM - TIGHT ON DANNY

His fearful expression says it all.

          DANNY
Holy shit.

Danny quickly bolts out of his room and into the adjacent
bedroom down the hall. He barges through the door.

INT. DEREK'S BEDROOM - A NAZI IRON EAGLE BATTLE FLAG

It hangs above a serious computer and next to a giant,
tome-filled bookshelf. The moans, meanwhile, approach
orgasm.

TIGHT ON DEREK VINYARD. The young man has a shaved head,
a thick goatee, and a well-crafted SWASTIKA on his left
tit. On top of Derek in the bed is his barely-of-age
girlfriend, STACEY. The covers are completely off and a
BLACK ROSE is tattooed across her right shoulder blade.
Danny watches her fuck, only for a second.

         DANNY
(softly)

Der !

Danny walks over and shakes him. Startled, Derek
forcefully grabs his little brother's arm.

        DEREK
(controlled)

What?

Stacey stops and looks over.  Frustated, she rolls off
Derek and onto her side.

                 STACEY
Fucking pervert, Dan!

          DANNY
There's a black guy outside Der...
breaking into your car.

Derek, muscled and tattooed, jumps out of the bed and
quickly puts on his skivvies. He reaches under his
mattress, pulls out a SIG .45 semi-automatic pistol, and
shoves in a clip.

              DEREK
How long has he been out there?

          DANNY
Not long.

STACEY

Who?


                 DEREK
Nobody. Relax.

Stacey sits up quickly from the bed as Derek pulls on his
black combat boots.

          STACEY
Who's out there, Derek?

          DEREK
Not right now, honey.
     (to Danny)
How many?

                 DANNY
One...I think.

                 DEREK
Is he strapped?

                 DANNY
Hunh?

              DEREK
Does he have a fucking gun, Dan?

                 DANNY
I'm not sure.

              DEREK
Is there a driver?

Danny nods his head yes.

       DEREK
Okay.  Stay the luck here.

                 STACEY
Derek? Be careful.

He looks at his girlfriend and walks off.

INT. HALLWAY - SAME

TIGHT ON DEREK. He walks down the hall. The intensity
on his face is alarming. He stops at the front door and
grabs the doorknob. Before he turns the knob, he peeks
through the eye hole on the door.

EXT. HOUSE - DEREK'S EYE POV

THE BLACK GUARD carelessly turns toward the driveway to
see what's taking his partner so long with the wires.

INT. HOUSE - DEREK AT THE DOOR

The guard has his back to him. Derek goes.

EXT. HOUSE - THE DUEL

Derek throws open the door and the black man standing
guard wheels and fires a shot into the front door. Derek
buries two bullets in his chest.

          DEREK
Fuck you!

The force propels the man six feet backwards.

INT./EXT. BRONCO - THE OTHER MAN

Stunned by the gunfire, he charges back to the getaway
Tranny. Derek buries a bullet into his shoulder. The
car splits and Derek fires a shot through the side
window. He then walks towards the car and fires shot
after shot at it until it disappears.

INT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD - DARKNESS

Davina and Doris Vinyard yell in the background like they
were in Vietnam. They meet in the hallway, still not
able to place the direction of the gunfire.

DAVINA

MOM!!!!

                 DORIS
STAY DOWN, HONEY!  DANNY?!

They stay down on the carpet together.

EXT. BEDROOM - DANNY'S POV

From the rain-soaked window he watches Derek face his
wounded prey - crawling on the ground. Sirens sound from
a distance.

                 STACEY (O.S.)
Get down, Danny! Jesus!

TIGHT ON DANNY. His gaze is locked on his brother from
his bedroom window. Derek cocks his piece, points it and
walks toward the man.

TIGHT ON DEREK'S FACE. Eyes blistering.

FADE TO BLACK:

THREE YEARS LATER

EXT. POLICE STATION - EARLY MORNING

A black man in a suit and tie, ROBERT SWEENEY, goes
through the automatic doors and into the station. He
approaches a DESK SERGEANT. A daily calendar on her desk
reads MONDAY. MARCH 3. 1997.

                 SWEENEY
Captain Rasmussen?

          DESK SERGEANT
Briefing room. Down that hall...third
door on the left.

INT. BRIEFING ROOM - A MEETING

Cops and detectives sit attentively and a few sip coffee.
The clock on the wall above reads 7:38 AM. Middle-aged
with slicked-back hair, CAPTAIN JOHN RASMUSSEN finishes a
thought. He spots Sweeney as he enters and aimlessly
reaches for a file.

RASMUSSEN
All right. Moving on--
(acknowledging)
Good Morning, Doctor.

The group looks over and meets Sweeney's hard glare.

                 SWEENEY
Good morning.

          RASMUSSEN
Gentlemen, this is Dr. Bob Sweeney.
He's Principal over at Venice High and
for some time now he's done a load of
outreach work with gangs...in and out
of the can.

Sweeney nods as Rasmussen cough.  He sips water and
continues.

          RASMUSSEN
Three years ago a local kid named
Derek Vinyard gets sent up for
murdering a couple of Crips who were
trying to jack his car. Bob taught
Vinyard back in high school and has
followed the case closely.

              YOUNG COP
He was a skinhead, right?

          SWEENEY
Derek was more like...the skinhead.
He and Cameron Alexander.

COP #2

Who?

Rasmussen opens a FILE in front of him. There rests
Derek's mug shot. He flips it over and reveals
CAMMERON'S MUG SHOT. Front and side view.

          RASMUSSEN
Cammeron Alexander is probably the
biggest writer and distributor of
white power literature in LA County.
He promotes white power bands, writes
reviews, columns, all at the ripe age
of forty.

             YOUNG COP
     (smiling)
He's forty? Jesus.

          RASMUSSEN
Pretty clean record...runs everything
out of his house down by the beach.

          SWEENEY
There weren't any organized white
gangs around Venice before those two
hooked up. Very few, if any. It was
mostly just black and Mexican. But it
was tiny. They hit it off though...
and Alexander hit the jackpot with
Derek.

Rasmussen reaches over and pushes play on a VCR.

          RASMUSSEN
We got some uncut footage here.
Courtesy of NBC.

ON THE TELEVISION--

          REPORTER
Earlier this evening...LA County
Firefighter Dennis Vinyard was shot
and killed while putting out a fire in
a suspected Compton drug den.

          RASMUSSEN
       (to the group)
This being February of '90.

EXT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD - A LIVE BROADCAST - VIDEOTAPE

A YOUNGER DEREK, short haired with no tattoos, stands
next to the reporter. Derek wears a Venice High
Basketball jersey drenched in sweat. Towel around neck,
he thinks to himself as the man speaks into the camera.

          REPORTER
To my right I have Lieutenant
Vinyard's oldest son Derek.
     (to Derek)
How do you feel about all this, son?

          DEREK
How do I feel? How do you think I
feel? It's typical.

                 REPORTER
Typical how, Derek?

          DEREK
Well...look at our country. It's a
haven for criminals. Black...brown...
yellow...whatever.

          REPORTER
So you're saying the murder of your
father is "race" related?

          DEREK
Every problem in this country is
"race" related. Every problem, not
just crime. These problems are rooted
in the black community, the Hispanic
community, the Asian...every non-
Protestant group in our society.
     (then)
Look at the shit. Immigration...
welfare...AIDS...they're all the
problems of the non-white. Look at
the statistics.

          REPORTER
Most of these issues you're referring
to though son are related to--

          DEREK
     (interrupting)
No no no! Don't say poverty right now
cause that's not it. They're not a
product of our fucking environment
either! Minorities don't give two
shits about this country! They're
here to exploit...not embrace.

          RASMUSSEN (O.S)
     (over reporter's question)
When Alexander got his hands on this
segment...he copied it, sent it out
and it became the Gettysberg Address
for hate groups across the country.

BACK TO THE TELEVISION.

          DEREK
Millions of white Europeans came to
this country and flourished within a
generation! A generation! So what
the fuck is wrong with these people?!

          REPORTER
What does any of this have to do with
your father?

          DEREK
Because my father was doing his
fucking job! Saving a nigger
neighborhood he didn't give two shits
about! And he got killed by some drug
dealer who still collects a fucking
welfare check.

Derek looks at the man and walks over to HIS MOTHER
DORIS, who smokes a cigarette. The camera follows him as
he puts his arm around her and escorts her back inside
their Venice Beach residence. The camera pans back to
the reporter who just stands there, speechless.

INT. BRIEFING ROOM - SAME

Rasmussen ejects the tape, the screen turns to fuzz, and
he turns it off.

          RASMUSSEN
Vinyard was quietly released from
Chino on Saturday after three and some
odd years. And I think it's something
we might want to keep an eye on for a
few days.

          SWEENEY
I don't wanna be an alarmist. But
payback is out there. I know it is.
And in this particular case...if
Vinyard gets popped...more people will
get popped.

          RASMUSSEN
It's not exactly LAPD policy but I
want 24-hour surveillance on Vinyard
for a few days.

          COP #2
(smiling in disbelief)
Twenty-four hour surveillance, sir?

                 RASMUSSEN
Just for a few days.

          ANOTHER COP
He doesn't sound like Mr. Lovely here,
Captain. You want us to bust him or
protect him?

Rasmussen offers Sweeney a look that it's his question.

          SWEENEY
I don't think Vinyard's gonna be the
one to start anything. It's his
following.

              RASMUSSEN
Either way...let's keep it low.

CUT TO:

EXT. VENICE BEACH BOARDWALK - MORNING

PEACEFUL DAY by PENNYWISE blasts from Danny's walkman
headphones. The day is cloudy and overcast but that
doesn't bother the local SURFERS. A twosome paddles
north to get a better break on the next set. Danny
watches as he skateboards down the strand.

His appearance is changed, now resembling a younger,
softer Derek.

Head shaved to a quarter of an inch, he wears a PLAIN
WHITE BACKPACK with punk/white power bands scribbled all
over it. Your standard Sex Pistols, DK, Germs, G.B.M.,
and Adolescents in black. Cro-Magnons and Skrewdriver
off to the left. In red is the largest name, DICK NIXON.

CUT TO:

 EXT. VENICE HIGH SCHOOL - THE BIKE CORRAL

 Kids from all walks of life park their cars, lock their
 bikes and head off to class.

 EXT. HALLWAY - TIGHT ON A THRASHED LOCKER

 Danny throws his SKATEBOARD in, slams the door, and turns
 to face LIZZY, a pretty, redheaded freshman.

                                   LIZZY
                  Hi Danny.

                                   DANNY
                  Hey Lizzy.

The two smile at one another as the FIRST BELL RINGS.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - A URINAL

Danny takes a piss. Outside, a voice pleads "It wasn't
me!" DARYL DAWSON, pale and thin, is shoved into the
bathroom and he trips into the sink. LITTLE HENRY, a
young black kid, enters with two of his buddies. Danny
zips up and faces them.

                                   LITTLE HENRY
               (to a terrified Daryl)
                 Tellin' Baker I'm fuckin' cheatin'?
                 I've never cheated in my life.

                                  BUDDY #1
                 Beat his ass, Henry!

                                  LITTLE HENRY
                 Why you trippin' on me?

                                  DARYL
                 I didn't say anything, Henry. I
                 swear.

                                  BUDDY #2
                 He's lying, man! I was right there!

Little Henry cracks Daryl in the face and practically
knocks him down with one shot. A bleeding Daryl
struggles to his hands and knees behind Danny.

                                  LITTLE HENRY
                 Next time, man.

Danny stares into Henry's eyes and the trio exits. Dannv
helps Daryl back up to the sink. THE SECOND BELL RINGS.

CUT TO:

INT. CLASS - SAME

Kids have just settled into their seats.  Danny walks in 
and tries to be discrete.

          OFFSCREEN VOICE
Vinyard!?

An OLDER TEACHER writes an Algebra problem on the board
for the students to solve.

                 OLDER TEACHER
You're late.

The man grabs a pink slip off his desk and hands it to
Danny.

          OLD TEACHER
But it looks like you got bigger
problems.

          DANNY
     (reading the slip)
Oh, man! Come on. Get a job.

The teacher stares at him.

CUT TO:

INT. PRINCIPAL LOBBY - DANNY

He sits in a chair next to an office door marked DR.
ROBERT SWEENEY - PRINCIPAL. Danny glances at the
secretary as she types and talks on the phone.

TIGHT ON DANNY. He listens to the conversation through
the the crack in the door as his eyes swell.

          MURRAY (O.S.)
I do not have a problem with him as an
individual, alright!?

          SWEENEY (O.S.)
Oh shit Murray sure you do.  You hate
this kid.

INT. OFFICE - THE CONVERSATION

The bespectacled, short-haired MURRAY ROSENBERG, 48,
looks over and spots Danny listening outside. Murray
walks over and shuts the door. He looks at DR. SWEENEY,
who now has his jacket off.

He points to a typewritten report on the desk and smiles
in horror. It is titled BOOK REPORT--MEIN KAMPF.
"Daniel Vinvard - American History" is in the upper left
hand corner.

          MURRAY
This paper is a travesty, Bob!
Arguing for Hitler as a civil rights
hero?! You've gotta draw a line.

          SWEENEY
Murray...it says in your syllabus that
they could do their report on any book
related to the struggle for Civil
Rights.

                 MURRAY
Oh come on, Bob!

          SWEENEY
Let me finish! He needs help...I'm
not disputing that. But I read it and
I'm not going to throw him out.

              MURRAY
His brother probably put him up to it.

          SWEENEY
I can guarantee you his brother didn't
have anything to do with it, Murray.

Murray sighs and takes off his glasses.

          MURRAY
Don't let him walk scot-free here.
For his sake...not mine. You might be
all he has left.

Sweeney stares at the younger teacher and nods.

CUT TO:

EXT. OFFICE - THE DOOR OPENS

Murray walks out and turns back to Sweeney.

                       MURRAY
          Thanks, Bob.
                       
                       SWEENEY (O.S.)
          Okay. Get in here, Dan!

Danny and Murray make hostile eye contact.

                       DANNY
          I knew it was you.

                   SWEENEY (O.S.)
          Shut up and get your ass in here!

INT. OFFICE - DANNY ENTERS

Before he even gets through the door he's chastised.

                       SWEENEY
          What's it gonna be, Dan?

                   DANNY
          What's what going to be?

                       SWEENEY
          This petty shit you're pullin'.

                       DANNY
          Well...I don't know.

                       SWEENEY
          You said it, all right. Sit down.

Danny does what he's told. Sweeney stares at the
teenager and leans back in his chair.

                       SWEENEY
         Are you okay?

                   DANNY
         Yeah.

                       SWEENEY
         Any time you wanna talk, Dan--

                   DANNY
         Okay.

                       SWEENEY
         How's Derek?

                   DANNY
         Fine.

                 SWEENEY
Adjusting okay?

                 DANNY
Yeah.

          SWEENEY
He was a student of mine. Honors
English. He was a great student...
like you...but he hung out with
scumbags. Also like you. That's why
he ended up in the pen, hunh?

No answer. Sweeney holds up Danny's paper.

          SWEENEY
Great writing. I can't correct it
though. It wreaks too much of shit.

          DANNY
Come on, man! I followed directions
and wrote an "A" paper. It's got
nothing to do with Derek.

          SWEENEY
Everything you do now has something to
do with Derek. Who told you to do
this?

              DANNY
Let us get on with our lives, man!

              SWEENEY
Hey, I'm not worried about Derek--he
can take care of himself.  I'm worried
about his little brother.
(softly)
Mein Kampf, Dan? I should expel you!

                 DANNY
Do it. What?  You don't think I could
handle it?

          SWEENEY
     (smiling in disbelief)
The street would kill you, Danny.
You're not tough. The second a
brother pulls a gun on your ass you'll
be holierin' for Doris.
     (pondering to himself)
So here's the drill. Take it or leave
it cause I'm sick of babysitting. I'm
your history teacher from here on out.
We're gonna deal with shit happening
right now. Call it American
History...X. I see your ass once a
day. Any more, any less, and you're a
memory at Venice High. Clear?

          DANNY
It took me a week to read Mein Kampf.
Come on, Sweeney.

          SWEENEY
My name is Dr. Sweeney. And I want a
another paper on my desk tomorrow.

              DANNY
What am I doing it on then?

          SWEENEY
It'S not a "what", it's a "who."
         (after a beat)
Derek.

SMASH TO:

EXT. VENICE SHORELINE - LATE AFTERNOON

A series of intercuts shows activity in and around the
pier. A HOMELESS LATINO MAN searches a trash dumpster.
OPEN VENDORS sell tie-dye and water bong paraphernalia.
A FAT WOMAN walks past eating a hot dog. BLACK GANG
MEMBERS play basketball in their low-rider shorts and
boxers.

TIGHT ON DANNY. He skateboards down the boardwalk,
performing tricks and spinning the board. He eats shit,
recovers, and looks off into the distance.

          DANNY (V/O)
People look at me...and they see my
brother. That's how things have gone
since the murder of our father.

EXT. BOARDWALK - NEAR THE BASKETBALL COURT

From afar, he spots a group of black gang members shoot
hoops. He and Little Henry from earlier exchange a cold
glance.

          DANNY (V/O)
Little Henry Hastings and his older
brother Jerome. Jerome's a Shoreline
Crip...Henry's on his way.

Little Henry and older brother JEROME catch their breath
and stare down Dan. Danny doesn't flinch. Jerome sips
from a 40 oz. beer and resumes playing.

          DANNY (V/O)
Venice Beach, man. It didn't always
look like this. I mean...our Dad used
to take us down here to run...and it
was cool. Derek fucking owned this
place.        Since then though...the gangs,
man--

TIGHT ON DANNy. He watches the basketball action as he
takes a drag off his Marlboro Red.

          DANNY (V/O)
--they've moved west from Inglewood
and South Central and have really
just...taken over. Especially at my
high school. The Venice Locos are big
too but they hang out in bumluck Mar
Vista. It's scary.
     (then)
And then there's The Disciples of
Christ. The D.O.C.

Jerome and Little Henry joke and argue with eight extra
players and spectators.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - A GAME - FLASHBACK

DANNY'S POV. The teams are a mixed assemblage of 3
blacks and 2 Latinos and 3 whites and 1 black and 1
Latino. SKINHEAD FAT SETH RYAN, early twenties, and his
two skinhead buddies, can't compete against the better,
predominantly black team. One of the skins, CURTIS, has
a shaved head, a light beard and an M-16 RIFLE tattooed
on his head.

JEROME and LITTLE HENRY sit together to the right of the
court and monitor closely. Danny looks over his left
shoulder and sees Derek and Stacey sit with CAMMERON.
Cowboy hat and BRONCO JERSEY, they sit and converse on
the bleachers.

                 LAWRENCE
Seven-six. Let's go!  Set some picks!

                 SETH
Bring it on, boy.

Derek quickly moves his eyes to the court.

LAWRENCE
Boy?

Lawrence quickly pivots past Seth, dunks it, and yells as
he hangs on the rim. The crowd cheers.

          SETH
Lucky piece of shit! I'm through
"monkeying" around with your ass!

Lawrence spins around and challenges Seth.

           LAWRENCE
Fat, pasty, pale, pastrami eating,
cracker, motherfucker. A hundred
bucks says I make you my bitch.

          SETH
     (to the crowd)
Here we go! Trying to make ends meet
for that cut in welfare.

He makes a scene and passes Danny on the sideline.
Lawrence waits for Seth to take it further. Danny looks
at him, concerned.

              DANNY
It's eight-six, Seth.

          SETH
When I want your fucking opinion I'll
ask for it, fuckhead.
     (to Derek and Cam)
Help me cover here, guys.

Derek and Cameron stare at Seth, knowing Seth will lose
and embarrass them.

              CAMMERON
You got a big fucking mouth, fat kid.

              SETH
I'll take this negro down.

              DEREK
You can't take a shit, Seth.  Shut up.

Derek shoots a look to Cameron, comes to a decision, and
stands. He shouts for all to hear.

                 DEREK
I got a bet.

Lawrence stares at him, sensing something harder.

          DEREK
I come in, same score now, first one
to eleven. Black boys against the
white boys.

Lawrence looks back to his boys in disbelief.

              LAWRENCE
Name your price, Cracker.

          DEREK
No money...for the court. We win, you
grab your shit and find a different
place to run. Not just today...
forever. You win, and we don't come
back. No hitching, no fighting, here
in front of everyone. Six-eight, our
ball.

The action around the court gets very still.  Finally,
Lawrence nods.


          LAWRENCE
You got a lot of fucking balls, man.
Bring it. Right now.

Derek pulls off his sweatshirt and gives it to Stacey.
Lawrence gets his team together.

CUT TO:

EXT. COURT - BLACK VERSUS WHITE

No more mixed assemblage of players.  One team is white, 
one team is black.

A SERIES OF SMOTS

Derek blows by Lawrence for a left handed layup. Derek
hits a thirty looter. Curtis grabs a rebound and uses
his elbows to get defenders off him. Big Lawrence fouls
Derek hard and Derek stares at him. Big Lawrence makes a
twenty foot turnaround. Lawrence advances on a three on
two and dunks it. Derek pump fakes three times and uses
the glass for a deuce. Finally, Derek drives the lane
and dishes to Seth at the last minute for a bucket.

                       SETH
          Yes! Ten a piece! Nice fucking dish.
                                     
SETH and CURTIS slap Derek's hand as they get back on
transition. Derek stares at Lawrence. CAMMERON watches
intently.

                 CAMMERON
It's all you, Der!

                 LAWRENCE
Fuckin' BYU, man!  All right!  All we
need is one now!

Lawrence and Derek lock eyes, a look exceeding
competitive boundary. A look filled with rage.

          CAMMERON
Use that fat ass and keep him out,
Seth!

Seth and the opposing player bang to get position
underneath.

          LAWRENCE
I ain't losin' in my house!  Clear it 
out!

The POWER FORWARD dribbles beautifully up the court --
his teammates clearing out the key. Defensively, Derek
is solid. He tries to pass Derek but Derek's defense is
stifling. Again. With another tricky move, Lawrence
inadvertently puts his LEFT ELBOW into Derek's face,
sending him quickly to the pavement. EVERYBODY STOPS.

              CURTIS
That's fuckin' offense!

          LAWRENCE
Get the fuck outta here!  He was
movin' his feet!

Derek, teeth bloodied, rises. The two have a stare down.

          DEREK
(threateningly)
I'll go if you want to.

          LAWRENCE
You wanna piece! Bring it!

Players quickly rush to restrain the two even though the
teams hate each other.

          DEREK
If you wanna go...I'm ready.  Don't be
throwin' fuckin' elbows.

          LAWRENCE
Fuck you!

Derek walks over to Cammeron, Danny and Stacey standing
courtside. She has a water bottle and a towel waiting
for him. He wipes his BLOODY LIP and takes a sip.
Cameron stares at Derek.

        CAMMERON
Hey.  Are you copacetic?

Derek nods and looks at Danny and Stacey.

              CAMMERON
He's gonna do that 180 spin move.

          DEREK
I know what he's gonna do.

              DANNY
You gotta call offense on that shit.

              DEREK
Not on point game you don't.

          STACEY
Fuck that, D. That chucker can't pull
that shit. It's fucking-

              DEREK
Not on point, honey.

He turns back to the court and walks over to Lawrence.
He stands in front of him and checks the ball in.

DEREK

Tens!

Lawrence takes the ball, passes it to the wing, and
quickly gets it back. Lawrence dribbles up top, makes a
marvelous 180 spin with the ball, and pulls up for a ten
foot jumper. Derek reads it perfectly and REJECTS IT.
Lawrence trips to the ground, Derek grabs the ball off
the fast break and DUNKS IT.

          DANNY
         (amazed by the dunk)
Holy shit!

Everybody courtside goes nuts. Derek walks to the
sideline, ignoring all the hand slaps being offered.
Everyone is riveted on Derek.

          SETH
         (to the other team)
Get off my  fucking court!  This is my
house!

                 DANNY
Yeah! Fuck...yeah!

A sweaty Derek pulls his little brother close. He takes
a drink of water, spits out more blood, looks at his
bitter opponent, and says nothing.

CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - BY THE COURT

Derek, Danny, Seth, Cammeron, Curtis and Stacey stand
outside the Bronco. The doors are all open and the
stereo softly plays music in the b.g. Derek dries off.

DANNY'S POV. Derek throws a shirt and tie over his
sweaty, tattooed body. Danny watches the tats disappear,
and it's almost like his brother is normal. A name tag
reads LA COPY CENTER - DEREK - ASSISTANT MANAGER.

Derek looks at JEROME and LAWRENCE from afar. Danny
notices the two men stare at his brother, ready to kill.
Derek meets their gaze.

CUT TO:

EXT. VENICE BOARDWALK - PRESENT - DANNY'S POV

Danny awakens from his daydream. The black players now
stare at him. Danny puts his board down and skates down
the boardwalk.

          DANNY (V/O)
It was only the beginning.
     (then)
Derek once told me that minorities
would take America over one day. That
white people are too afraid. Maybe he
was right.

CUT TO:

EXT. SMALL BEACH HOUSE - A PATIO

Danny skates up to the gate and kicks his board up to his
hand.  He passes two SURFBOARDS on his way towards the
back.

EXT. SIDE ENTRANCE - TWO 14-YEAR-OLDS

LIZZY, the redhaired beauty from earlier, and her blond
friend KAMMI, sturable out and laugh. They're stoned.

                 KAMMI
Hey! Danny!

        DANNY
(smiling)
Hey.
              LIZZY
You're going tonight, right?

DANNY
Where?

              LIZZY
That party. Go there.

The two young girls giggle and take off.

INT. TINY, MESSY BEDROOM - SAME

JASON and CHRIS, two 17-year-old skinheads with shaved
heads, prepare to hit the surf. Chris sings to
INSTITUTIONALIZED BY SUICIDAL TENDENCIES on the stereo
while Jason throws on a ZOG T-SHIRT, the tops of their
fullsuits hang down.

                 DANNY (O.S)
There's dick for waves.

              CHRIS
I don't care. I just wanna get wet.

TIGHT ON DANNY. He flips through a book titled TURNER
DIARIES. On the nightstand to his left is a digital
clock that reads 4:47 p.m.

          DANNY
I've been trying to buy this.  You 
can't find it anywhere.

The two look at Dan.

          JASON
Cammeron dropped us off a copy. Dope
fucking shit, man. It's all about
reclaiming the country. I'll let you
read it when I'm done.

              DANNY
Fuck that. I just read Mein Kampf.

                 JASON
There you go.

          CHRIS
Hey? What was this Daryl shit you
were talking about?

          DANNY
Henry Hastings almost kicked Daryl
Dawson's ass. He would're too if--

          CHRIS
Little Henry the negroid?

Danny nods.

          DANNY
Everyday there's something over there,
man.

              CHRIS
Why do you think we fuckin' quit?

                 DANNY
I hear you.

              JASON
Daryl Dawson's a pussy faggot.

CUT TO:

EXT. BOARDWALK - DANNY, JASON AND CMRIS - LATER

The three skateboard down the strand, Jason and Chris
with their surfboardS and suits. Chris looks at Jason's
shirt.

                 CHRIS
What's ZOG again?

                 JASON
Zionist somethin'.

                 DANNY
Zionist-Occupational-Government.

Ahead an OLD ASIAN WOMAN tows a succession of SHOPPING
CARTS. As Jason passes, he smacks her with his surfboard
and knocks her to the ground. They all laugh and Danny
breaks off and heads east on Rose.

CUT TO:

INT. DUMPY APARTMENT - TIGHT ON TEARY EYES

DAVINA VINYARD, in a UCLA T-SHIRT and panties, cries on
the couch as she hugs a LONG HAIRED Derek. DORIS sobs as
she lays under a pink blanket, burdened by the flu.
Shirtless Derek grabs Doris' hand and leans over to kiss
her.

                 DEREK
It's gonna be fine.

EXT. DUMPY APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Danny skates up to his residence and looks at a car
across the street. Two plainclothes cops from the
earlier meeting sit in their car and stare from afar.
Danny goes through the gate.

iNT. HOUSE- SAME

Danny walks in on the tearful family conclave.  He stands 
there, wishing the day would just end.

          DANNY
Oh man--! Come on!  What are you
crying about now?

THE PHONE RINGS and Derek rushes down the hall to get it.

          DEREK
I got it.

Danny looks to his mother.

              DANNY
Are you feeling better at all?

                 DORIS
I need a kiss.

Danny wipes away her tears, kisses her, and moves away
quickly so he won't get sick.

INT. BEDROOM - DEREK ON THE PHONE

He listens to the man on the other line.

                       DEREK
          Unhuh. Unhuh. Did you expel him?

INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

There's a knock on the front door and Davina answers.
She opens the door and tries to shut it immediately.
SKINHEAD FAT SETH, from the game earlier, wears a GOOD
GUYS STEREO UNIFORM. He pushes the door back open.

                       DAVINA
          What do you want!?

                       SETH
          Open up, bitch!

Davina relents and Seth enters.

                   DAVINA
               (examining him)
          Jesus! Are you sure you can fit
          through the door?

                   SETH
          Fuck off.
               (excited)
          Where is he?

                       DAVINA
          Back in his bedroom.

Seth pushes Danny to the side, passes Doris and yells.

                   SETH
               (smiling)
         Where are you, you free motherfucker?

Seth moves down the hall and bangs on Derek's door.

                   SETH
         Vinyard!

                   DAVINA
         He's on the phone, asshole!

                   SETH
          Fuck off.

              DEREK (O.S.)
I'll be out in a minute!

Without pushing it, Seth undoes his pants and moves into
the bathroom. Danny walks down the hall.

INT. BATHROOM - THE CAN

Seth sits on the toilet. Danny pushes the door slightly
and stares at Seth's GUN on the bathroom counter. Danny
looks at him. After a few seconds--

          SETH
What are you lookin' at?

              DANNY
I'm still trying to figure it out.

          SETH
Come in here and I'll show you,
maggot.

              DANNY
Fuck off. When'd you start carryin'?

          SETH
I'm dropping the kids off at the pool,
junior. Shut the fuckin' door!

Danny grabs his nose and turns to the door behind him.

      DANNY
Jesus!  Chew your food, dude!

INT. BEDROOM - DEREK

He continues into the phone receiver.

                 DEREK
All right. Thanks.  I'll take care of
it. Yeah.

DANNY'S POV. He opens the door and sees Derek on the
phone with his back to him. Above Derek is Danny's
surfboard, hanging on ropes hooked to the ceiling.

Blue jeans, black boots and slicked back hair, Derek
holds his hand up and motions for Dan to be quiet. The
sleeves of tats covering his arms, shoulders and back
(D.O.C.) define the hatred that has engulfed his past.


    DEREK
(into the receiver)
Okay.  Okay. I'm what?  What channel?

He covers the receiver, turns on a ten inch TV, and flips
to the correct channel.

          DEREK
         (without turning)
What is it, Danny?

              DANNY
You got pigs outside.

DEREK

I know.

Derek leans over the computer to check it out.

INT./EXT. BEDROOM - DEREM'S POV

He looks through the blinds and stares at the UNMARKED
CAR. Danny throws his backpack on the bed and exits.

TIGHT ON DEREK. He listens to the television.

          TV ANCROR (O.S.)
Saturday's prison release of a former
skinhead gang leader has many
community leaders up in arms tonight.

INT. BATHROOM - TIGHT ON SETH

He points his Glock 9mm at the mirror.

          SETH
Drop the t.v., nigger.

He laughs to himself and exits.

INT. HALLWAY - SETH CONTINUED

He bangs on Derek's door once more, pissed that Derek
didn't open it earlier. He heads for the living room.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUE TV ACTION

Danny, Davina, and Doris are glued to the news story on
the same station. Doris, once beautiful, is now aged and
graying. NYQUIL, PEPTO BISMOL, two PRESCRIPTION
CONTAINERS, and a spoon rest on the coffee table.

TIGHT ON THE TELEVISION. A WELL-DRESSED BLACK WOMAN
speaks angrily to the reporter covering the story.
Random black protestors nod and comment in the
background.

          BLACK WOMAN
Maybe now whites will understand the
motives behind people like Malcolm X
and the Black Panthers.  Just put the
shoe on the other foot.

FLASH TO:

EXT. CHINO PRISON - THE VINYARDS ON NEWS FOOTAGE

Danny walks' towards Derek and they smile and hug.  Davina
and Doris soon join in.

Davina

          BLACK WOMAN (V/O)
Derek Vinyard deserved the death
penalty for what he did to that young
man! And now he walks the street as
free as you and I.

          DANNY
     {to the tv)
What about OJ, bitch!?

INT. VINYARD HOUSE - TIGHT ON THE TV

The news segment winds down.

          BLACK WOMAN
         (fed up, to the camera)
They've done it to us again.

A hand reaches over to turn the channel. IT'S SETH.
Doris, in an awful state, lays back down.

TIGHT ON SETH. Tattoos cover his forearms. A BLOODY
SNAKE is halfway tucked under his rolled-up sleeves.

          SETH
Nigger lovin' Jew media calling the
shots. Watch cartoons. It's the only
t.v. that's safe nowadays.

              DORIS
No one's safe--until we all are.

Seth looks at the woman like she's from another planet.
He laughs and goes into the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - SETH'S POV

He looks through the fridge but finds nothing. He closes
the door and looks at the family pictures on the door.

A FAMILY SHOT of Doris, Derek, Danny, Davina, and DENNIS
VINYARD in front of church. Seth appreciates Dennis in a
coat and tie. Below that, a picture of a dirty and
rugged Dennis and a young Davina, wearing her father's
FIRE HELMET. Danny with Doris.

                       SETH
          Come in here, Dan.

INT. SMALL KITCHEN - SAME

He sits and comes upon Davina's revealing CROTCH. She
studies and so does he. Danny walks in the kitchen and
looks through the fridge. He pulls out a leftover piece
of steak and gnaws on it. Seth looks over at Dan

                       SETH
          Where the fuck you find that?

                       DANNY
          Goin' to Cam's party tonight?

                       SETH
          Is Davina's ass water tight?

Danny laughs.

                   DAVINA
          Hurry up and leave, Goodyear.  You've 
          taken your dump now go.

                   SETH
         Listen to you. You callin' me a
         blimp, you fuckin' Democrat?!

                       DAVINA
          Yes! I am!

Danny takes a bite and laughs at Seth.

                       DANNY
         I'm there tonight.

                   SETH
         Oh yeah? You ask Derek?

                       DANNY
         Noo...but he's got two kegs.

          SETH
Well...you can think of me drinkin'
'em then when you're studying with
fuckin'... White Trash in there.

Davina scoffs and Seth looks up her shirt.

          SETH
Where is the fucker, by the way!?
He's hiding from us.

Davina looks up from her homework and catches the pervert
looking at her.

                 DAVINA
You're not even human.

Seth erupts with laughter.

              DANNY
Is Cam playing sticks?

                 SETH
Of course, man.

Seth drums on the table as Danny shoves the last bite
into his mouth.

          SETH
Sit down. I wanna ask you some
questions.

              DANNY
I got homework, Seth.

          SETH
Two fucking seconds, dude!

Danny sits and looks at Seth.

          SETH
Tell me your convictions.

          DANNY
Fuck off.

          SETH
Tell me some of the shit you've
learned luckbrain or I'll pistol-whip
you.

                 DANNY
About Adolf?

                 SETH
About anything.  What do you believe
in?

Danny thinks to himself and smiles.

          DANNY
I believe in filth and destruction and
chaos and death and greed.

                 SETH
What else?

          DANNY
I believe in my family.

          SETH
Why?
          DANNY
"Respect your father and your mother.
Whoever curses your mother and
father... is to be put to death."
Matthew 15-4.

                 SETH
Good. What else?  Tell me what I want 
to hear, asshole.

              DANNY
You mean that stuff about your mother?

Davina CACKLES in the background.

          SETH
You wanna get beaten?

           DANNY
No.

              SETH
Then tell me about Adolf and Mein.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAVINA

She puts down her homework and looks over at Seth.

          DAVINA
Hey Seth? Cut the shit.

          SETH
I'm not fuckin' talkin' to you,
Davina, shut up! Do you believe in
Adolf?

              DANNY
Yeah, man. I believe in Adolf.

Seth smiles at the youth and speaks intimately.

          SETH
What do you hate, Danny?

          DANNY
I hate everyone that isn't white
Protestant.

          SETH
Why? And say it with some fucking
conviction!

          DANNY
Because they're a burden to the
advancement of the white race.  Some
of them are all right--

          SETH
None of them are all right, Danny.
They're all a bunch of fucking
freeloaders.
     (after a beat)
Remermber Canuneron. "We don't know
them, we don't want to know them,
they're the fucking enemy." What
don't you like about them?

                 DANNY
I don't know.  I feel threatened by
them.

          DAVINA
They feel threatened by you!

          SETH
     (ignoring her)
What else, Danny? And speak
intelligently you little queer faggot.

Davina's attention is rapt on her little brother.

          DANNY
I hate the fact that it's cool to be
black these days.

SETH
Good.
          DANNY
I hate this hip hop influence on white
fuckin' suburbia.

SETH

Good!

          DANNY
I hate Hilary Clinton and all of her
Zionist MTV pigs telling us we should
get along. Save the rhetorical
bullshit honey, it ain't gonna happen.

Seth looks at the young man.  He smiles at him with
distinct revelation.

          SETH
That's the best shit I've ever heard
come out of that mouth.

TIGHT ON DAVINA. She stares at the two hate mongers.

              DAVINA
I feel.sorry for you, Danny.

                 SETH
Shut up, Davina.

          DAVINA
You shut up, you poison to fuckin'
society! Get out of our house!

          SETH
     (laughing)
Is this any way to treat a guest?

              DAVINA
Derek hates you, Seth.

              DEREK (O.S.)
How do you know who I hate, Davina?

TIGHT ON DEREM VINYARD - SILENCE.

He's a striking presence with his scruff, tight t-shirt
and tats hanging down his arm. A black jacket wraps
around his waist.

                 DAVINA (O.S)
What do you mean?

Seth stands and smiles.

          SETH
Hey! How are you, man? Fuckin' A.
Long time no see. Look at that hair.

Seth moves to hug his old friend but Derek offers a
reluctant hand instead.

              DEREK
Gimme just one second, okay?

Seth nods as Derek stares at Danny.

              DEREK
Did you do a book report on Mein Kampf?

                 DANNY
What's it to you?

          DEREK
         (ready to kill)
What's it to me?

          DANNY
     (seeing this)
I mean...how'd you find out?

          DEREK
None of your fucking business how I
found out.

              SETH
I thought it was a great idea.

                 DEREK
That figures.  You're more stupid than
he is.

              SETH
It's nice to see you too, man.

                 DEREK
Why'd you do it, Dan?  Because of
Seth.

                DANNY
No.

          DEREK
Cammeron?

              DANNY
I did it cause I felt like it.

          DEREK
Oh, you do everything you feel like?
I feel like smacking you in the
fucking head. Would you mind if I did
a report on that?

                 DANNY
Uhhh...yeah.

          DEREK
Get a clue, you dumbshit. Hey! Look
at me! Don't be a dickhead. Sweeney
cares about you.

              SETH
         (smiling)
Sweeney does?  Since when?

          DANNY
Was that him on the phone?

                 DEREK
Yep. So wise up.  You hear me?

          SETH
Sweeney's a fuckin' nigger on a power
trip, Vinyard. That's what he was
like when we were there and that's how
he is now. It'll never change either.
A nigger is a nigger.

Derek stares at Seth, ready to beat the fuck out of him.
Suddenly, Doris starts in with a COUGHING ATTACK. Derek                                      
quickly fills a glass of water and goes in there.

INT. LIVING ROOM - THE PINK BLANKET

She coughs incessantly. Derek sits down beside her,
hands her the water, and caresses her head. The others
stare at her in the background.

              DORIS
Just put me out of my mercy.

          DEREK
You'll be okay. You want me to pick
you up any more medicine?

Together they look at all the bottles and laugh.  Derek
checks out the couch.


          DEREK
Jesus. I can't believe I ever let it
get this bad.

              DORIS
It's not that uncomfortable.

              DANNY
Are you gonna to live or what, Mom?

              DORIS
I need a cigarette.

                   DEREK
         My ass. You smoke two packs a day.
         That's why you're spittin' phlegm.

Doris coughs once again and spits green into her napkin.

SETH
(astonished)
Jesus, Mrs. Vinyard.  I think a lung
just came up.

Everybody laughs -- including Doris.  Derek tenderly puts 
his hand on his mother's cheek.

              DORIS
I'm high as a kite.

                 DANNY
You got any more?

 DORIS
Daniel?  I know you got homework.

              DANNY
I'm goin' in a second.  Relax.

          SETH
     (interjecting to Derek)
Hey. I'm gonna re-wipe and we're out
of here.

Seth laughs as he walks down the hall.

                 DAVINA
You're a pig.

              DORIS
I don't like him in this house.

         DEREK
I knew.

              DAVINA
He ' s a fuckin ' loser, Nazi scumbag.

              DANNY
No he's not.

                   DEREK
          Yes he is. Open your eyes.

Danny looks at Derek and smiles.

                   DANNY
          Whatever, dude. I'm gonna go power
          that shit and I'll see you later.

He pats his brother on the shoulder and walks off.

              DEREK
Not at Cammeron's you won't see me.

          DANNY
     (turning back)
Come on, Der! It's gonna be fuckin'--

                   DEREK
          Forget it, Danny! It ain't gonna
          happen for you tonight.

Danny walks off, frustrated. He crosses Seth's path,
gets shoved into the wall, and reacts like it's an
everyday occurrence. Seth moves out the side window and
climbs out.

                   SETH
          Hurry up. I'm starving.

                       DAVINA
         What else is new?

Derek nods, looks at his mother and kisses her on the
forehead.

                 DEREK
I'll see ya.

                 DORIS
Okay. Be careful.

DEREK

I will.

Derek follows Seth out the SIDE WINDOW and goes down the
alley.

INT. APARTMENT - TIGHT ON DORIS

She thinks to herself and closes her eyes.

EXT. SIDE STREET - SETH'S TRUCK

Derek looks at the oblivious cops and drops into the
passenger's seat. Seth starts the engine and drives
away. As the truck disappears, we pick up on a WHITE
SOUPED UP JEEP CHEROKEE turning the corner. Tinted
windows, it cruises past the apartment complex.

INT. DANNY'S BEDROOM - A DESK

CUT TO:

Danny's attention is everywhere except on his homework.

                       DANNY
         This sucks.

He walks back out of his bedroom.

INT. HALLWAY/LIVING ROOM - DANNY'S POV

He watches Davina complete her homework on the couch.
Doris, on the sofa opposite, tries to sleep.

                   DANNY
         Hey.

          DAVINA
Hey what?

          DANNY
Come here.

DAVINA

What!?

          DANNY
Come here for a second!

The scholar sets her homework aside and impatiently
follows him down the hall.

INT. BEDROOM - TWO SINGLE BEDS

She sits on the edge of DANNY'S bed.  Danny hands her his
assignment instructions.

              DAVINA
I got shit to do, Dan.

                 DANNY
Just read it.

She sighs and begins to read it out loud.

          DAVINA
"American History X? Take home paper
as assigned by Principal Robert
Sweeney?"
     (to Danny)
Why is he giving you homework? What
happened to Murray?

                 DANNY
Asshole turned me in.

DAVINA
Why?

          DANNY
Just read.

          DAVINA
"Describe in detail your opinion of
-the historical event that took place
in the early morning of October 4th,
1993." What's that?

              DANNY
The night Derek wasted those guys.

Davina takes a moment.

                 DAVINA
Sweeney gave you this?

DANNY

Yep.

          DAVINA
     (continuing her reading)
"Before and after...how has this event
helped or hurt your present
perspective concerning life in
contemporary America. Use the
standard five paragraph format, blab
blab blah--this'll be good for you..

              DANNY
Nooo...it'll be good for you.

She stares at him for a good three seconds.

                 DAVINA
Eat me, Dan.

          DANNY
Come on! Dick Nixon's playin' at
Cammeron's tonight. You owe me.

          DAVINA
I'm not doing your homework for you!
I gotta spreadsheet due!

          DANNY
Goddammit!

Davina walks to the door and looks back to her brother.

          DAVINA
What's the matter with you? You wanna
be a fuckin' loser your whole life?

Not receiving a response, she walks out the door.

                 DANNY
Asshole Sweeney.

He slowly begins to strike the computer keys. The screen
reads "People look at me and they see my brother. That's
the way things have gone since the murder of our father,"

TIGHT ON DANNY.  The frustated kid sits and thinks to himself.
himself.

QUICK CUT TO:

EXT. ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK


THE BROAD EXPANSE OF AN EMPTY, DIMLY LIT PARKING LOT. In
the distant corner we see a few parked cars and a group
of skins gathering.

          DANNY (V/O)
It was lunacy after he left us. All
the time. Derek believed in
Cammeron...he was angry...that
combination gave them bodies. White
punks...sick of gettin' their asses
kicked by black and mexican gangs at
school.

TIGHT ON DANNY LEANING AGAINST AN ADJACENT CAR.

Seven skins, including Seth and Curtis, smoke and wait.

DANNY'S POV. Danny looks to his left and sees Derek with
Cammeron, who sits in the driver's seat of the BRONCO.
Stacey leans in from the backseat.

              STACEY
I hope you kill that fucker.

Derek looks back at her and straight to Cameron.

                 CAMMERON
He might have a gun.

          DEREK
Are you going in or not?

          CAMMERON
You know I got the cops on me. If I
come up on one of those cameras I'm a
dead man.

Derek stares at the older man, who appears nervous.

              CAMMERON
Somebody needs to drive, Derek.

          DEREK
     (referring to his mouth)
All right. You can turn it off now.
     (back to Stacey)
You're right on his tail, right?

          STACEY
     (nodding)
I hate that fucking Korean.  I hope
you smash his face in.

              DEREK
Just be ready, okay?

She nods and Derek gets out. The group is silent.

          DEREK
Come on. Let's pull it together.
Hey! We're not playing fuckin' games
here. Let's go.

The group snaps to attention behind him as Seth toys with
the camera. CURTIS from earlier takes a hit off a joint
and makes Derek wait for him. Derek walks over to the
crazy man, takes the joint, and throws it onto the
ground.

          DEREK
What the fuck, Curtis? You a fuckin'
nigger now? Want some crack?

CURTIS
No.

          DEREK
     (grabbing his neck)
Pull your fucking stupid head out of
your ass then.

                 CURTIS
Okay. Jesus.

          DEREK
     (to the group)
We're here tonight cause we got
immigration problems spiralling out of
control. We got Asians up the ass...
taking over our land with their
fucking Yen. Mexicans...flocking into
this place like some giant fucking
Pinata was shattered.

The group busts up. Cammeron watches Derek and smiles.

          DEREK
Don't laugh. It's tragic. On the
Statue of Liberty it says "Give me
your tired, your hungry, your poor,
your huddled masses...yearning to be
free." It does not say give me your
shiftless, your greedy, your indolent,
your criminals, looking for a free
ticket.

The group agrees.

          DEREK
We're here tonight to show the
government how we feel about
minorities taking over our country.
The treat us like criminals while they
reward them with jobs and fucking
welfare checks. And it's only getting
worse.

              ET AL
(nodding)
Fuck yeah it is.

          DEREK
Are you ready to do something about
it?                                   

ET AL
Yeah.

          DEREK
Okay then.

AND THEY'RE MOVING.  In formation.  Fast.  Directly at
us.    Angry.

As the camera swings into line, TRACKING WITH THEM, Derek
reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a STOCKING
MASK. He pulls it down over his face.

The foot soldiers follow him in unison.

          DEREK
         (back to his troops)
Remember. No names. Danny?  Stay
right on my fucking ass, man.

And now they're getting ahead of us. As the CAMERA
SWINGS behind them, we see their destination.

EXT. LIGHTED GROCERY STORE - SAME

They storm the front entrance. The few people who are in
there scream and scramble for cover. Derek grabs a
Mexican boxboy and throws him to the ground. Seth
catches up to another and gets him on the ground.

          SETH
Wheto's your fucking green card,
asshole?

Seth kicks the young man in the face with a blatant shot
and continues. DEREK leaves a terrified white woman
alone like she's not even there and pushes over an
adjacent shelf, knocking over another worker with CANS OF
BEANS.

          DEREK
(referring to the border)
Can't hide from me, motherfucker!

He kicks the man and looks around the market for more.
Danny watches in awe. Curtis breaks a giant jelly jar
over a head. Another skin throws a BLACK CHECKER into a
shelf of POTATO CHIPS.

DEREK'S POV. He looks up at one of the aisle mirrors.

INT. BACK STOCK AREA - THE 55-YEAR-OLD KOREAN OWNER

He rushes out with a pistol. He takes aim on Curtis and--
FROM OUT OF NOWHERE, DEREK TAKES A MOP TO THE OWNER'S
HEAD AND PROCEEDS TO KICK HIM. Danny looks at Derek like
he's Superman.

Derek looks to his watch and straightens up.

              DEREK
Let's go! We're outta here!  Move !

From just inside the door we see skins get in their last
blows and pour out the aisles and pass us through the
doors. TIRES SCREECH. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON THE WRECKAGE
OF THE MARKET AND THE MOTIONLESS BODIES ON THE FLOOR;

INT. BRONCO - TIGHT ON DANNY

He takes off his stocking mask and stares at his stone-
faced brother.

          DANNY (V/O)
And before Derek could even blink...he
had a crazed army behind him.

CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - PRESENT - THE COMPUTER

Danny sparks up a cigarette and types on the screen.

          DANNY (V/O)
Willing to follow his word like it was
the word of God.

CUT TO:

EXT. VENICE BEACH HOUSE - A RAINY NIGHT - FLASHBACK

As the rain falls, we see the Vinyards sitting at the
table. Stacey and Murray Rosenberg, Doris' then
boyfriend who we met earlier, round out the clan. Stacey
sits close to Derek.

          DANNY (V/O)
And then came October 4th, 1993.

INT. BEACH HOUSE - THE DINING ROOM

Doris looks wonderful while Murray, mustache and beard,
shakes his head at Derek as he chatters away.

          DANNY (V/O)
Things were fine on the homefront. My
Mom had a good job but a below average
boyfriend. We had a four-bedroom
house that Dad left us with. Everyone
was happy.

TIGHT ON DEREK. Shaved head, rolled-up sleeves, tattoos,
loosened tie, LA COPY CENTER name tag from earlier. His
charisma draws their attention as he rambles over the
crackling rainfall.

                 DANNY (V/O)
Everyone but Derek.

          DEREK
Fuck you, Murray. White men don't
cruise the streets of LA killing each
other.

         MURRAY
No.  You guys make bombs.

Derek stares at the man, eyes filled with homicide.

          DEREK
You're so fucking lame. A couple of
cranks in cabins in Montana is not
statistically significant.
     (then)
White Americans don't take PCP and
drink and drive a hundred and twenty
fuckin' miles an hour! We pull over
and trust the law.

                 MURRAY
You're kidding, right?

          DAVINA
     (sarcastically)
Don't you know, Murray? White people
never break the law. We're perfect
little angels.

          DEREK
That's not what I said, Davina.
     (to the group)
Three different times Rodney King
comes at those officers with the
intent to hurt them. To hurt them!
Three times! But since we see it on
some fucking tampered videotape...the
bleeding heart media makes you believe
that he only comes at them once. All
we see is Powell, Koon and Wind
hittin' him and--
     (busting up laughing)
Briseno kickin' him in the back of the
fuckin' skull with his boot. Still,
the dumbfuck's tryin' to get up and
kick their asses! That's how stupid
that motherfucker is. Those cops used
textbook-solid tactics and if Dad were
still here he'd say the same damn
thing.

          DORIS
That doesn't make it right.

          DEREK
Yes it does. Yes it does. They're
cops! They are taught to use that
stick and they did.

                 MURRAY
Excessively.

          DEREK
No. Appropriately. Appropriately!
Cops have been granted a certain
amount of authority by society and
white people, unfortunately, are the
only ones who acknowledge it. I
acknowledge a cop's authority.

Davina starts to laugh.

          DAVINA
Look who's talking about respecting
the law? Mr. K.K.K. here.

          DEREK
That's two errors in one sentence,
Davina, so take a fucking course in
semantics. First error--I didn't say
I respect the law. I said I respect a
cop's authority. Second error...I'm
not a member of the fuckin' low rent,
disorganized, redneck Ku Klux Klan..
Pull your head outta your ass and look
at who you're dealing with.

             MURRAY
Don't speak to her that way, Derek.

          DEREK
Murray, stay out of it. You're not a
member of this family and you never
will be.

          MURRAY
What the hell does that have to do
with anything?

          DORIS
     (to Derek)
You know...sometimes it's hard to
believe I gave birth to you.

          DEREK
Give thanks to the food on the table
and then believe it, Doris.

              DORIS
We both put food on this table, fella.

          DEREK
True enough. The point is...if Dan
was walking across the street that
night and Rodney King plowed into him--

          DORIS
Can we forget about Rodney King for
chrissake?!

          DEREK
     (fiercely continuing)
--while hopped up on Chivas and
P.C.P...you'd consider the force those
cops used to be justified!

              DORIS
He didn't hit anybody!

          DEREK
If he did though! If that shithead
killed Dan...you would have believed
the beating to be justified and so
would everybody else. But since he
didn't hit anyone...it's "Hands Across
America" for the son of a bitch.

Derek takes a bite of food.

          DEREK
We are still so hung up in this notion
that we have an obligation to help the
struggling black man and all you
contribute to it! Lincoln freed the
slaves a hundred and thirty years ago!
Get off your fucking asses!

          STACEY
I'm with you, honey. All the way.
It's one...giant...ploy.

                 DAVINA
Here we go.

          STACEY
I mean...nobody likes Chief whatever
his name is, right?

DAVINA
Gates.

          STACEY
Yeah. So here comes this filthy piece
of garbage in his Hyundai. He pulls
over in front of a perfectly lighted
area where a video camera is sitting
there...fucking waiting for him, man.
What happens next? Chief Gates is
dust. It's total--

Davina drops her silverware on the plate with a clatter
and looks at her mother. Everyone stares at Davina.

          DAVINA
     (to Doris)
May I be excused please?

          DEREK
Don't interrupt, Davina.

          DAVINA
I didn't interrupt shit.

          DEREK
The hell you didn't. I was listening
to Stacey and then I heard you.
That's called interrupting. Wait 'til
she's finished and you can be excused.

              DAVINA
Who the hell do you think you are?

Derek jumps up from the table and grabs her by the back
of the hair.  The table JOLTS and plates tumble to zhe
floor.                                                           

              DEREK
You don't know when to shut up.

                 DORIS
Dammit Derek!

              MURRAY
What are you trying to prove, man?!

Derek turns and laughs at Murray.

          DEREK
I'm trying to teach my sister some
respect, Murray.

          DAVI NA
Let go of my fucking hair!

          DEREK
     (to Murray)
See! See the way she speaks! Tell me
you're gonna shut up and I'll let go.

          DORIS
Derek!  Let go of her hair and sit
down!

          DEREK
I will when I hear an answer, Doris.
Are you going to shut up, Davina?

TIGHT ON DANNY. He gets up quickly and tries to pull
Derek off. Derek turns and cracks Danny in the face with
a BACKHAND, dropping him back into a cabinet. A crystal
vase with flowers crashes to the floor, just missing
Danny's head.

MURRAY

Jesus!

          DEREK
     (to Danny)
What are  you thinkin'?

 DORIS
 Danny?!  Are you okay?!

Danny nods his head as everyone looks at Derek.

          DEREK
It's a real easy question, Davina. A
simple yes or no will suffice. Tell
me what I want to hear and I'll let
go.

                 DAVINA
Fuck...you.

Derek takes a piece of roast beef off her plate and
shoves it in her mouth. Me holds the whole piece inside
so she can't spit it out. Davina cries as she chokes on
the meat.

          MURRAY
She can't breathe, Derek!

                 DEREK
Stay back, both of you!  It's her bed,
she's gotta lie in it.
         (grabbing harder)
You can cry all you want, Davina. I'm
not gonna let go until you tell me
what I wanna hear! Are you going to
shut that fat fucking mouth of your's
and let my girlfriend tell her
opinion? Are you?!

DORIS grabs him from behind and he aggressively turns on
her. Derek curls his tongue behind his teeth and raises
his arm like he's actually going to smack his mother.
She grabs his arm though, forcefully.

              DORIS
Let go of her hair and get out.

Derek releases his grip on his sister and she spits the
roast beef onto the floor. She runs into the back
bedroom crying, choking and coughing.

          DAVINA (O.S)
I hate you, you fucking asshole!

The door slams shut in the background.  Doris, Murray,
Danny, and Stacey all stare at Derek.  Derek calmly faces
his brother.

          DEREK
You okay?

Danny nods.

             MURRAY
         (softly)
Psycho.

IN SLO MO--Time FREEZES as Derek slowly turns his head
back to Murray. ON THE TRACK we hear a few keys being
typed and then silence. A cigarette sizzles.

CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - DANNY THINKING - PRESENT

He takes a long drag off his cigarette and exhales. He
slowly runs his hands over his stubbly head, marveling at
the past.

BACK QUICKLY TO:

INT. DINING ROOM - TIGHT ON DEREK - FLASHBACK CONT.

Derek smiles at Murray in wonder and disbelief.

          DEREK
Would you care to repeat that, Murray?
I'm not sure I got all of it.

          STACEY
     (smiling)
He called you a "psycho", honey.

          DEREK
     (smiling back)
Was that it?    Thanks Murray.

          MURRAY
See. Here we go again with this,
Derek. Making me out to be the bad
guy again.

              STACEY
You callin' me a liar, RosenKike?

                 MURRAY
(to Stacey)
Hey goddammit! You talk to me with
respect or--!



          DEREK
Or what, Murray!? What're you gonna
do? Give her fucking detention?

                 DORIS          
Both of you get out right now.

Murray stares at Derek with pity.  Doris becomes
emotional.

         DORIS
     (to Derek)
Do you think you're the only one who's
affected around here?

Derek focuses on his mother for a moment. A captivated
Danny watches and waits as Derek turns to Murray.

          DEREK
Out of respect for my mother...I'm
gonna let that comment go, Murray. I
won't bash your face in. But let me
tell you somethin'...man to fuckin'
mouse here. Normally in a situation
like this I'd take my steel-tips to
your fucking Jewish temple. That goes
for anyone making comments about me,
my family, Stacey, whomever. You know
and I know that I could crush that
puny fuckin' skull of yours in a
second. So it's beyond me why you
would say something like that without
being able to back it up? What's
worse, you sack of shit, is you
calling the woman I love a liar.

              MURRAY
I never said she was a liar.

          DEREK
Weasel like that again Murray...you
fuckin' ponytail, pussy, bagel eating,
teacher, faggot...and I'll cut your
shylock nose off. Make no mistake.

Murray silently walks out of the house. Derek claps and
sings the Jewish celebration song "Hava Naghila." Stacey
joins in and the two laugh. Doris goes after Murray.

              STACEY
Murray Rosenberg...International Jew.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Murray goes to his car and Doris follows.  Danny watches
from the door.

          DORIS
He's a stupid kid, Murray!  I'm sorry!

          MURRAY
He's not a kid, Doris. We were kids.
We didn't call people kikes.

          DORIS
It's just gonna take some time with
him. What can I do?

          MURRAY
You don't know your children, Doris!
You have no clue about the world they
live in. Your son is a terrorist.

              DORIS
He's not a terrorist, Murray.  Jesus!

          MURRAY
He's a member of the Disciples of
Christ. You remember that grocery
store incident?!

DORIS

Murray?

          MURRAY
My sister and her two kids got
evacuated from her Temple in Woodland
Hills!

          DORIS
Murray! Please! Derek would never
have anything to do with bombs, okay?!
You don't know him like I do.

                       MURRAY
          And I wouldn't want to. Goodbye.

Murray gets inside and goes down the street.

INT. HOUSE - SAME

DANNY'S POV -- He watches Doris stand alone, her face in
her hands, crying.

BEHIND Dan a humiliated Davina storms towards Derek, now
wielding a BASEBALL BAT.

DANNY

Davina?

Derek hears Dan and looks out of the corner of his eye.
He spots her at the last moment.

         DAVINA
Take this, you fucking dick!

Derek pops up quickly, disarms her, and pulls her close.

          DEREK 
Davina!  It's okay!  Calm down.  
Please.

                 DAVINA
Fuck you! Let go!

          DEREK
         (whispering in her ear)
I'm sorry, Davina. Come on.

                 DAVINA
Let go of me!

                 DEREK
Come on, Davina.  I'm sorry. I lost
control. Please.  I screwed up.

Derek holds tight until the crying girl settles down.
He's gripped as desperately by remorse as he was moments
before by rage. He kisses and repeats his apology over
and over. Finally, she succumbs and puts her arms around
him. Derek looks to Danny.

          DEREK
     (hugging Davina)
You guys are my life and I'd do
anything for you. You do know that?

          DAVINA
     (wiping her tears)
I don't believe you anymore.

          DEREK
I swear to God I would, Davina.
Please.

              DANNY
I believe you, Der.

Derek smiles at his little brother, lovingly.

          DEREK
Davina? Please forgive me.  Please.
I'm sorry.

          DAVINA
     (nodding, after a beat)
That fuckin' sucked, Derek.

          DEREK
I know it did. And I'm sorry.
I just really hate that guy.

                 DAVINA
You couldn't tell.

A RAINSOAKED DORIS walks through the front door.

          DORIS
Find an apartment because I want you
out of here.

              DEREK
Morn, I'm sorry but that guy's--

          DORIS
I don't wanna hear it anymore!  I want
you out!

              STACEY
He can move in with me.

               DORIS
When?

          STACEY
Tomorrow.

           DORIS
Good.

She walks past Derek and into the back bedroom.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BEDROOM - TIGHT ON DANNY'S EYES - PRESENT

He rises from the computer and PEEKS out the blinds. The
two cops supposedly watching Derek are now eating in the
car. One of them looks up. Danny flips the blinds down.
From the other room, he hears Doris break into another
coughing fit.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DANNY

He sits beside her and hands her a glass of water.

DANNY
Here.

                 DORIS
Thank you, honey.

She coughs, recovers, and sips. Danny walks away.

                 DORIS
Hey. Come here.  Sit with me.

          DANNY
I've got this thing to do.

              DORIS
You can sit down for two seconds.

He looks at her and sits beside her.

                 DANNY
Don't breathe on me.

DORIS
I won't.

They share a smile.

          DANNY
It's cold in here, no wonder your
sick.

She stares and smiles at him for a few moments.

DANNY
What?

          DORIS
What? I'm not allowed to look at you
anymore?

He smothers her face with his hand, jokingly.

                 DANNY
No. You're not.

          DORIS
     (laughing)
Daniel Patrick! Stop it! Are you
ever gonna let that beautiful hair
grow back?

                 DANNY
Nope. Never.

                 DORIS
I bet you will.

He smiles and locks eyes with his mother for several
moments. He finally rises and walks back to his room.

                 DANNY
Get some sleep.

          DORIS
If you need me to proof anything for
you I will.

                 DANNY
I'll be all right.

              DORIS
Wake up early if you get tired.

Doris watches him disappear down the hall, distant
thoughts creeping back slowly.

INT. BEDROOM CLOSET - DANNY

He grabs a flannel and throws it on. He sees a cigar box
that rests on the right shelf. He grabs it and looks
inside. The rolled-up LA TIMES clipping reads "Prominent
Skinhead Charged with Murder." The accompanying picture
of Derek is near evil.

TIGHT ON HIS EYES.  Danny stares at the clipping.  ON THE
TRACK--GUNSHOTS.

MATCH CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM WINDOW - THE EYES - FLASHBACK

He watches Derek fire his gun at the TRANS AM as it
blazes down the street. He walks over to the wounded man
on the lawn and points his weapon.

                 STACEY (O.S.)
Get on the floor, Danny!  Jesus!

Danny looks down at her and hurries out of his room.

EXT. HOUSE - TIGHT ON DEREK

He hovers over big Lawrence. Gun pointed steadily, he
kicks him in the stomach over and over -- tongue pressed
against teeth.  Hot air flows from Derek's breath and
into the cold.

                       DEREK
          You fucked with the wrong bull.

                       LAWRENCE
          Goddamn, man!

Danny watches his brother from the front porch.

                       DANNY
         Let the cops handle it, Der!

          DEREK
Fuck that. The cops will let him
walk.

Derek grabs Lawrence and drags him to the CURB.

          DEREK
Ever shoot at firemen, you fuck?
     (then)
Open your mouth and put it on the
corner of the curb. I'm gonna teach
you a little lesson.

                 DANNY
Derek!?

              DEREK
Get in the fucking house, Dan!

Danny doesn't move.

              LAWRENCE
Come on, man. Call an ambulance.

          DEREK
My dad gave me that truck,
motherfucker. Couldn't leave well
enough alone. Put your mouth on the
corner of the fucking curb!

Derek cocks his piece and Lawrence complies--his teeth
now scraping concrete. SIRENS sound from afar. Danny
walks out into the middle of the street to check it out.

DANNY
The cops are comin' Der'
                            

Lawrence mumbles something unintelligible from his
outstretched mouth.

          DEREK
What the fuck did you say?  You just
threaten me? Hunh? Hunh? Hunh?

        DANNY
(anticipating)

No!

Derek STOMPS his foot on the back of LAWRENCE'S head -
completely tearing his jaw in half on the curb's corner.

             DANNY
     (crying)
Holy fucking shit!  Derek!    What the
hell was that for?!  Jesus!

The two lock eyes. Derek does not flinch. Helicopter
lights shine on the house. COP CARS SCREECH TO A HALT.

DANNY'S POV. Two cops take cover behind their door, draw
their guns, and shout instructions. Derek puts the gun
down, puts his arms behind his head, and drops to his
knees. His eyes are remorseless.

          DANNY (V/O)
Joseph Conrad once wrote that "murder
is always with us. It's almost an
institution." That couldn't rang more
true than with me.

CUT TO:

EXT. WET STREET - THE CRIME SCENE - LATER

FIVE PATROL CARS, a FIRE TRUCK, TWO AMBULANCES, and a
throng of terrified NEIGHBORS strangle the front of the
house. Clothed and handcuffed, Derek is escorted from
the house by two uniformed cops and RASMUSSEN.

          DANNY (V/O)
Bobby Lawrence died of massive head
trauma early that morning.

Derek marches past the bodies -- which are being tended
to thoroughly.

          DANNY (V/O)
Six months after that...Derek was
convicted and sentenced to seven years
for voluntary manslaughter...to be
served at the California State
Penitentiary in Chino.

Rasmussen forces Derek's head down and he gets in the
car. He stares at his brother and sister as police
lights flash on him. Then to Stacey. Finally, to a
lifeless Doris. They lock eyes as the patrol car takes
off down the street.

          DANNY (V/O)
Prosecutors wanted murder one for my
brother's torture method...but there
wasn't enough "premeditated" evidence.

CUT TO:

OMIT

INT. BEDROOM - DANNY'S EYES

They clearly focus on the computer. HIGHLIGHTED is the
sentence "There might have been if I testified." Only
when he hits the DELETE KEY does it disappear. He
continues typing.

                   DANNY (V/O)
               (continuing)
          Over the next year we'd lose our house
          and the rest of our father's pension
          to attorney fees. My mother...much to
          all of our surprise...stood by Derek.

Danny's interrupted by a LOUD KNOCK on the front door.

INT. FRONT HALL - DANNY'S POV

He looks through the PEEPHOLE and sees it's CHRIS AND
JASON. He sighs in relief and opens the door.

                 JASON
We're here, dude.

              CHRIS
Drop your dick and grab your stick.

          DANNY
I told you I can't tonight.

              DORIS (O.S.)
         (from the couch)
Danny?

                 DANNY
It's okay, Mom.

The two punks laugh as Danny pushes them and their boards 
back to his bedroom.  He shuts his bedroom door.

INT. BEDROOM - THE THREESOME

Danny looks at the two.

              DANNY
If I don't finish this thing I'm dead.

              CHRIS
Just tell 'em you'll do it tomorrow.
You can't miss the party.

              JASON
Fire pie Lizzy called and told us to 
grab your ass.

              DANNY
She did?

                CHRIS
             (nodding)
You gotta hit that shit.  It's the 
only fun thing that's legal anymore.

The PHONE RINGS and Danny grabs it.

                DANNY
Hello?

INT.  DARK OFFICE - TIGHT ON SWEENEY

The only illumination shines through the window from the 
street.  Holding his briefcase, he stands over his desk
phone, all packed up and almost out the door.

              SWEENEY
Dan?

                DANNY (O.S.)
Yeah?

                SWEENEY
Dr.  Sweeney.

INTERCUT THE CONVERSATION

                DANNY
             (worried)
What's going on?


          SWEENEY
Nothing here. Is everything all right
over there?

                 DANNY
Everything's fine.

                 SWEENEY
How's it comin'?

          DANNY
I'm doing it right now.

                 CMRIS
Who is it, dude?

          DANNY
         (covering the receiver)
It's Sweeney.

          CHRIS
Who?! Why is he calling here!?  Fuck
you, Sweeney! Asshole!

          JASON
(grabbing the receiver)
Get a fucking job, you reggie!

Danny grabs the receiver back and yells at his friends.

          DANNY
You fuckers are going to get me
booted!
     (into the receiver)
Dr. Sweeney? I'm sorry, man.

          SWEENEY
Just make sure it's on my desk
tomorrow, Danny.

          DANNY
It'll be there, alright!?

                 SWEENEY
It better be.

Sweeney hangs up abruptly. Danny slams the phone on the
hook, gives it TME FINGER, and looks at his friends.

          DANNY
Let's go.

CUT TO:

EXT. CAMMERON'S HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

A TRUCK sits across the street.

INT. TRUCK - DEREK AND SETH

They sit in the car as a band JAMS from Cam's house.
Shiftless Seth throws on a black CRO-MAG t-shirt and
tosses his work shirt in the back. He wolfs down a
burger as Derek rolls his foot on a basketball on the
floor.

              SETH
You're an idiot if you ask me.

              DEREK
I'm not asking you.

          SETH
What if he writes something stupid and
that nigger turns you in? Jesus. He
didn't testify, Der. They can use
that shit and re-try you.

Derek takes a long stare at Seth, who devourshis burger.

          DEREK
Sweeney's not gonna do anything, Seth.
He helped get me released.

Seth is a pathetic vision to Derek.  Derek stares at him
for several moments.

                 DEREK
I'm out, Seth.

Seth wipes his mouth and casually meets eyes with Derek.

          DEREK
I'm only going to tell you this once
so pay attention. I'm done, Seth. I
don't want you to come near me...near
Dan...I want you to leave my family
alone.

Seth stares and laughs at Derek.

                 SETH
You're serious.

          DEREK
I'm dead fucking serious. No more
phone calls, no more visits, no more
nothing.

Seth doesn't know what to say.

          DEREK
We don't exist as far as you're
concerned, Seth.

          SETH
I can't believe I'm hearing this shit
come out of your mouth.

          DEREK
Believe it, Seth. Believe it. I
spent over three years away from my
family. My family, Seth. For what?

          SETH
For your country, fuckhole, that's
what. I'd do a hundred years before I
felt like that.

Seth gets out, slams the door, and walks to the party.

                       SETH
          You're a motherfucking traitor!

Derek stares out the window and sighs.

EXT. STREET - DEREK'S POV

He watches the house. Suddenly, Danny, Chris and Jason
skate up to the residence and follow Seth inside.

                 DEREK
What the--? Shit.

INT. CAMMERON'S HOUSE - THE FRONT DOOR

CUT TO:

DICK NIXON plays a punk version of WHITE CHRISTMAS as
skins slam dance.

EXT. CAMMERON'S BACK PATIO - A SKINHEAD

His face is tattooed with crow's feet and prison ink.
CASSANDRA, a frail, older, English woman with green hair
and multiple piercings, approaches JASON at the keg.

                 CASSANDRA
You're full of shit!

              JASON
If he ain't here, he's comin'.

INT. HOUSE - MORE SLAMMING

Chris, Danny and Jason pound beer and huck DARTS at a
picture of O.J. SIMPSON. Seth violently slams past the
kids. Derek walks in.

         CHRIS
Yo!  What's up, Fat Seth!?

Seth throws Chris against the wall.

          SETH
I'm not fat, cockwart!  I'm husky!

              CMRIS
Okay! I'm sorry, bro!

                 DANNY
Take it easy, dude!

Seth then grabs Danny hard by the shirt.  Chris and Jason
stare at him like he's gonna hurt him.

                 DANNY
What're you doin'?!

              DEREK
Your brother's a piece of shit!

Seth sees Derek enter and he releases Danny. Seth mixes
into the party and SLAM DANCES into ten other skins.
Danny follows Seth towards the keg.

DEREK'S POV. He analyzes the crowd.  Quickly, Chris
recognizes him.

              CHRIS
Holy shit.  Father Vinyard!?

                 JASON
Son of a bitch.

Derek looks at the two kids.

          JASON
I'm Jason and that's Chris! We're
friends with your brother!

They stick out their hands but Derek prefers to check the
scene.

          CHRIS
You're a fuckin' god, man!

JASON

No shit!

                 DEREK
Do me a favor.  Grab Danny and get
outta here!

The two boys look at each other and LAUGH.

              CHRIS
We just got here, man!

                 DEREK
You what!?

Chris looks at Derek like he's dead.

              DEREK
You don't have any homework?!

              JASON
School doesn't exist anymore, Father.

Derek stares at him, not really knowing what to do.

          CHRIS
I wrote you. Two letters while you
were in there! Did you get them?!

Derek ignores them and weaves his way through the crowd,
causing many an individual to double-take. Chris and
Jason look on in wonderment.

EXT. LARGE, OPEN SHED AREA - A CROWD

TIGHT ON CAMMERON ALEXANDEr. The older, white trash skin
furiously bangs his sticks on the drums to the song.
Cam's hair is still long but now he's got a swastika
between his eyebrows like CHARLES MANSON. He wears TROY
AIKMAN'S DALLAS JERSEY and a BLACK COWBOY HAT.

DEREK'S POV. He pans right to check out the crowd. A
man pisses out the window. Then to a distinct woman.

IT'S STACEY. Her head is now completely SHAVED but she's
still gorgeous as ever. Derek indulges her for a few
moments until he turns and walks away.  He bumps into a
girl and knocks her drink.

                 CASSANDRA
Excuse fuckin' me!

DEREK

Sorry.

She smiles at Derek as the SONG comes to a close.

CASSANDRA

Derek?

          DEREK
Cassandra.

          CASSANDRA
Oh my God! They said you might be
here but I didn't fucking believe 'em!

CURTIS, the M-16 on the side of his head perfectly
intact, walks by Derek. He walks past Derek with his
young son on his shoulders.

          CURTIS
I hope what I heard ain't true, man.
You better hightail it the fuck outta
here if it is.

After a moment, Derek looks away and Curtis heads off.

          CASSANDRA
You gotta chop that mop, Der!

Cassandra lights a brown menthol cigarette.

          CASSANDRA
     (exhaling)
Stacey's meandering around here
somewhere! Have you seen the bitch?!

Derek shakes his head.

              DEREK
The only person I've seen is Seth.

CASSANDRA
Oh God.  I'm sorry.

DEREK'S POV. He sees Cameron puts his arm around her
and kiss her. Cameron sticks his hand down the back of
her pants, smiles, pulls it out, and licks his finger.

Derek watches as Danny delivers a beer to Cammeron.  Ca
puts his arm around Dan and they go into the bedroom.
Stacey looks at Derek and follows them.

                 LIZZY (0. S. )
Are you going in there?

Derek looks down to see Lizzy and Kammi.

          LIZZY
Can you tell Danny that Lizzy's
looking for him?

Derek can only stare at the girl's youth.

INT. LARGE BEDROOM/OFFICE - A SHRINE TO HITLER

DEREM'S PoV. He stands in the doorwell and listens.
White Power paraphernalia cover the walls. Articles,
posters, everything. The room has a bed, a couch, a
glass coffee table and a desk with a computer on it.
Organized stacks of papers, pamphlets and magazines are
strewn throughout the floor. Cameron sips a beer and
talks with Dan. Stacey listens in the background.

              CAMMERON
He won't do anything'drastic I hope.

              DANNY
I gotta do that paper though.

          CAMMERON
I thought you already turned that
fucker in?

          DANNY
My teacher cried to Sweeney, man.
have to do another one.

Cammeron laughs.

 CAMMERON
Oh man.  Fucking Sweeney.

          STACEY
     (chiming in)
Meanwhile, niggers and spics do their
reports on Malcolm X and fucking Fidel
Castro.

Cameron laughs again but then becomes quickly serious.

          CAMMERON
Sweeney's got an agenda, Danny. And
it's all a load of crap. You hear me?
He's all about brainwashing. Don't
get fucking fooled by it.

              DEREK (O.S.)
What the hell are you doing here, Dan?

They all look over.

          CAMMERON
     (smiling)
Hey. I was wondering when he was
going to show his face.

Derek doesn't lift his eyes from Danny.

          DEREK
What did I tell you, Dan?

              DANNY
I had to check it out, Der.  Come on.

                   CAMMERON
          He'll be all right, Derek.

Derek shoots Cameron a look and tries another way.

                   DEREK
          There's a redhead out there looking
          for you. Go talk to her.

Danny gets up and walks out. Cam looks to Stacey.

                       CAMMERON
         You go with.

Derek seizes his brother with the eyes as he exits.  Then
Stacey.

                 STACEY
Welcome back.

He just closes the door on her.  Cammeron looks for his
cigarettes.

          CAMMERON
You made it, man. When I heard they
threw you in General Population I
thought it was curtains.

              DEREK
It wasn't too bad.

          CAMMERON
So what's all this self-righteous,
born-again shit I'm hearing then?

Derek doesn't blink.  Cameron smiles and points to a
chair.

                 CAMMERON
Have a seat, Derek.  Relax.

TIGHT ON CAMMERON. He sparks up a cigi to break Derek's
uncomfortable stare.

              CAMMERON
How was it in there with all those
fuckin' monkeys, man?  You're lucky
they didn't kill you.

          DEREK
I agree.

                 CAMMERON
Who runs the place?  The monkeys or
the wetbacks?

                 DEREK
The Mexicans.
          CAMMERON
It's a fuckin' vacation for them in
there, hunh?

          DEREK
They were really organized. I'll tell
ya...it was impressive. They--

CUT TO:

The two make out. She sits on the sink and wraps her
legs around him. They stop and smile at each other.

                 LIZZY
I like you.

                 DANNY
I like you, too.

INT. CAMMERON BEDROOM - SAME

Derek and Cam converse over the coffee table.

                 CAMMERON
They're fuckin' peasants, Derek.  All
of them.
         (then)
So what's up, man? I'm hearing a lot
of shit about you.

          DEREK
Be careful with me, Cam. You don't
know what's going on with me.

              CAMMERON
Fuckin' talk to me then. We're family
here. Let's work it out whatever it
is.
                                  
          DEREK
I'm family, Cam? Is that why you came
to see me all the time up there?

Cameron smiles but doesn't know what to say.

          CAMMERON
I had to distance myself from you
after that.

          DEREK
Fuck you, Cameron. You're a fucking
chicken hawk...praying on kids.

              CAMMERON
I don't pray on fucking anyone.

          DEREK
No. You fucking use them.  To filter
your insanity.

Cameron smiles in disbelief.

          CAMMERON
You and Danny are like brothers to me,
Derek. Come on, man.

          DEREK
He's not your brother, Cameron.  All
right? He's my brother.
     (after a beat)
You hear me, Cam?

          CAMMERON
     (exploding)
Fuck you, Derek! Fuck you! Don't
think you can threaten me with this
shit for a fuckin' second! I'm more
important to him now then you ever
were.

Derek EXPLODES. With his feet, he pushes the GLASS
COFFEE TABLE hard into Cammeron's knees. Cam screams in
agony. Derek SLUGS him in the face and Cam RETALIATES
with two of his own. They wrestle around the room and
push their way into the BATHROOM.

INT. TINY BATHROOM - DEREK AND CAM

Derek takes Cam by his long hair and SMASHES his face
into the mirror. IT SHATTERS. Derek follows with a
solid punch to the kidney.

                 DEREK
You gonna listen?!

          CAMMERON
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.

Derek bangs Cam's face against the mirror ONCE MORE.

          DEREK
Shut the fuck up! You're gonna stay
away! That's what you're gonna do!

Derek rinses Cam's bloody face off by PLUNGING it into
the toilet. He pulls him back up and they face the
mirror.

          DEREK
It's over.

Derek stares at him in silence. CAMMERON RETALIATES. He
forcefully backs Derek into the wall behind him. He
throws two punches at Derek -- one in the stomach and one
to the face that opens his lip. He misses on his third
and Derek gets the upper hand.

BACK TO THE MIRROR. Derek prepares to crash Cam's face
into the shards of glass one last time. The final blow.
As Cam screams, Derek launches him forward then pulls
back at the very last moment. Derek, noticing Cam's
condition, throws him into the tub.

Derek throws him a towel, grabs one for his lip, and
exits.

EXT. SHED AREA - A GROUP OF 20 NAZI'S

They SALUTE the band and chant as they tune up for
another set. The singer inquires about his DRUMMER.
Derek pushes his way through and spills a few beers cn
the way. Cassandra smokes a cigarette with a few random
skins as Derek passes by.

                 RANDOM SKIN
Hey Derek!?

DEREK
What?!

CASSANDRA
(exhaling)
Jesus, Der.  What happened?

CURTIS
(psychotically)
Where's Cammeron, man?!

              DEREK
I haven't seen him.

Cassandra looks at him curiously and then focuses her
attention to the bedroom.

STACEY (O/S)

Hey!

Derek turns around and faces her.

          DEREK
         (pointing his finger)
Stay away from me.

              STACEY
Don't point your fucking finger at me.

              DEREK
I'm serious, Stacey!  Stay away!

She grabs and pulls on his shirt.

          STACEY
What are you gonna do?! Hunh?! Hit
me?! Kick me as I roll on the fuckin'
ground screaming?!
     (then)
That bullshit with Cammeron is
nothing, Derek!

                DEREK
I don't care.

Stacey looks deep into his eyes and can feel it.

          STACEY
Goddamn you, Derek! Those two niggers
deserved what they got. They deserved
to die! And just like Cameron and
Seth and a million others out
there...I'll believe that 'til the day
I fucking die. I will. Nothing will
ever change that either.

Derek breaks from her grasp and walks away.

EXT. PATIO - DEREM'E POV

He looks over to the kegs. Through the sliding glass
window, he sees Seth taking a "tap hit" off the keg. All
the guys in the b.g., INCLUDING DANNY, count and cheer.
Seth sucks the tap while skins count in the background.
Derek walks out and watches Dan pump the keg.

                 ET AL
Forty-five! Forty-six!  Forty-
seven...!

Seth removes his mouth from the tap and belches like a
pig. All the guys laugh.

          SETH
     (grabbing Danny)
Why the fuck did you pump it?! I
coulda gone for a minute at least!

Danny looks over and meets eyes with a bloody Derek.  He
FREEZES while everyone turns to look Derek over.

                 DEREK
Let him go, Seth.

Seth sees blood on Derek's face and shirt and takes a
moment to identify the source. He draws his 9mm Baretta
and points it at Derek's head from four feet away.

                 SETH
Where's Cameron?

Derek stares directly into the BARREL.

          DANNY
(frightened)
Seth, man!? Come on!

Seth puts the gun directly to Derek's cool head.

          SETH
I'd be doing America a great fucking
favor, let me tell you.

                 STACEY
Do it, Seth.

Seth glances at her and Derek quickly GRABS the pistol.
A shot goes off and people hit the deck. Derek wrestles
the pistol away and punches Seth in the STOMACH. Falling
to the ground in pain, Derek cracks him in the face once
more and it's over.

INT. CAM'S BATHROOM - CASSANDRA AND CURTIS

They walk in and look at Cammeron, bleeding in the tub.
Curtis pulls the METAL TOWEL HOLDER off the wall and
storms after Derek. Cassandra laughs.

              CASSANDRA
You got fuckin' guests out there, Cam.

EXT. PATIO - SAME

Derek tosses the gun over the fence and looks to Danny.

          DEREK
Come with me right now.

He looks at his brother. He then sees Curtis and three
other skins come through the house. Derek stares at Dan
and hauls ass down the back alley.

DANNY'S POV. Curtis arrives and tends to Seth rather
than go after Derek. Confused and mildly embarrassed,
Danny bolts back into the house to get his board.

CUT TO:

EXT. VENICE BLVD. - SLEEPING HOMELESS

Danny passes them on his board as he conguers the cracks
in the street at an incredible rate. He turns the tight
corner and cuts off a turning car. The man yells.

Danny spots his brother walking twenty yards up on the
left-hand side of the street and crosses. Approaching
quickly, he skates faster and faster as Derek nears a BUS
STOP BENCH. Hearing the board, Derek turns to face the
clickity clack behind him.

DANNY LUNGES FROM HIS BOARD AND TACKLES DEREE. The two
crash into the street as a car henks from the inside
lane, barely missing the duo. Danny punches his brozher
in the face.

                 DANNY
Fucking asshole!

Derek gets on top of his brother, spots a speeding car
heading right for him, and pulls his brother to the
sidewalk. Just in time.

              DEREK
What the luck are you thinking!?

          DANNY
What are you thinking!? Friends don't
fight friends, Der! They stick
together!

          DEREK
They're not friends, Dan!

              DANNY
What the hell are they then?!

Derek picks his brother up and sits him on a BUS STOP
BENCH.

              DEREK
Just sit there and relax for a second.

          DANNY
I don't wanna relax!  You looked like
an idiot back there!

Derek stares and sits next to him. Cars and homeless
randomly pass in the b.g. Danny looks at his brother,
transfixed in thought.

              DANNY
What's happened to you, Derek?

TIGHT ON DEREK. He looks into his brother's eyes.

DISSOLVE TO BLACKNESS:

INT./EXT. CHINO PRISON - ESTABLISHING SHOTS

FILING OUT OF THE CELL.

The morning drill. His roommate, an old Latino guy,
right behind. Derek's eyes cast among the inmates,
noting everyone and looking for a friendly face. He
notes a familiar tattoo, catches the guy's eye and nods.

WALKING THROUGH THE CAFETERIA.

Derek with his tray. A sea of tables divided by race. He
spots a tiny island of white guys at a distant table. He
looks at STEVIE THE LEADER, but gets a nod from the HUGE
ARYAN next to him. Derek moves to sit with them.

A WIDE SHOT OF THE YARD.

From a distance, he approaches the Aryan corner. They
casually greet each other. Derek then looks over to the
HUGE ARYAN from the cafeteria and to STEVIE MCCORMICK,
the crazy looking leader. Derek walks over and shakes
their hands.

CUT TO:

INT. PRISON LAUNDRY ROOM - MORNING

Derek quietly folds towels with a young, chattering black
man.

          YOUNG MAN
You got lucky, man. I was in the
kitchen for a year before making it in
here. Pots and motherfucking pans...
disgusting beef stroganoff shit...
boiling hot water...fuck that!
     (looking over)
My name's Lamont, man.

Derek doesn't even look at LAMONT.  Stone cold, he
continues folding.

          LAMONT
I got your back. Righteous white
Cracker with attitude. Just like the
Judge who sentenced me, man.

Lamont laughs but then becomes serious.

         LAMONT
If your smart though you'll remember
one thing. You're the nigger in here.
Not me.

CUT TO:

EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

DEREK'S POV. He sees Stevie McCormick conferring with a
Mexican gang leader.  The Mexican hands Stevie a joint
through a handshake.

Derek turns and talks to two white guys who seem
impressed. Stevie walks up and takes a hit off his
joint.

          STEVIE
I was just talking about you.  You're
Cammeron's boy?

Derek turns and stares at him.

          DEREK
His boy? No, I don't think so, man.
I'm not anybody's boy.

          STEVIE
Well...you know what I mean.

              DEREK
Nooo, I don't know what you mean.

Derek and Stevie lock eyes.  Stevie sneaks a hit and
offers Derek.

              STEVIE
Here, man. Relax and have a hit.

Derek stares at him.

          DEREK
Nooo...how about you getting that
fucking shit awax from me?

Stevie looks at him, ready to kill. The other two can't
believe Derek's gall. Stevie shrugs.

          STEVIE
You got a problem, man?

          DEREK
Excuse me? Do I have a problem? No,
I don't have a problem. Do you have a
problem?

                 STEVIE
No. I don't.

Stevie stares at Derek and walks off. He turns back
again and he and Derek lock eyes. He walks back to his
group.

              DEREK
Who the fuck are you?

Derek turns back to the other two and they are already
walking away. Derek looks at the two and back to Stevie.
Stevie sits with HUGE ARYAN and says something to him.

CUT TO:

INT. PRISON LAUNDRY ROOM - EARLY MORNING
Lamont in mid-conversation.

              LAMONT
But I won't go down on that shit.  No
way, no how.   You ever been with a
soul sister?

Derek looks over and meets his eyes.
Lamont sees this and laughs.

Just for a second.

                   LAMONT
                 Oh shit! Sorry, man! Forgot who the
                 luck I was talking to there for a
                 second.
               (after a beat)
                 Let me ask you this one though cause I
                 don't know the white man's take. You
                 like eating pussy?

Derek can't help but smile.

          LAMONT
Oh man! You sick fucking bastard!
You sick pig!

                 DEREK
And you don't!?  Shut up.

         LAMONT
Man...you don't know shit about the
brothers. We won't go down on that
shit if the bitch was holding a gun to
our fucking head.

Derek laughs and the two continue to converse.

CUT TO:

EXT. PRISON QUAD - DAY

A group of White Aryans are gathered in the yard. Derek
plays basketball with a mixed assemblage, including
Lamont. Derek continues to look over every now and then
at Stevie and his group. Stevie suddenly smiles towards
Derek.

Not understanding what it's all about, Derek turns
'around. Standing there is HUGE ARYAN and his STOCKY
 FRIEND.. They proceed to beat the shit out of Derek right
 in the middle of the court. The players circle as Derek
 rolls on the ground. He gets bombarded with kicks and
 punches, a few even coming from randoms on the court.

CUT TO:

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - MORNING

A beat-up Derek quietly folds. Lamont stays quiet.  He
glances over but knows Derek isn't in the mood.

CUT TO:

EXT. CAFETERIA - AFTERNOON LUNCH

Derek looks over to the white table and they something
amongst themselves. They break into laughter. Derek
thinks about eating somewhere else, but there's nowhere
to go. He walks BACK over to the white table and looks
at STEVIE.

                 STEVIE
How's your face, man?

Everyone laughs. Derek sits and eats, his tail between
his legs.

                 STEVIE
That'll teach you.  Don't be a prick
to your superiors.

CUT TO:

EXT. NARROW PRISON CORRIDOR - LATE AFTERNOON

Stevie walks by himself and smokes a cigarette. He turns
a corner and standing there waiting for him is DEREK.
Derek stares him down.

                 STEVIE
What do you want?

          DEREK
I'm right here, man. You wanna have
it out with me, let's go. Just me and
you though.

          STEVIE
Man...you are a stupid motherfucker.
You know that? When are you--?

Derek cracks him in the face and Stevie falls to the
ground.

          DEREK
Stupid?! You have anything else to
say, you little pussy! Hunh?!

         STEVIE
Fuck you!

Derek kicks the man a few more times and takes off. A
few black prisoners laugh at Stevie from the PING PONG
TABLE.

CUT TO:

INT. PRISON SHOWER - MORNING

Derek puts his head down under the warm water and closes
his eyes. From out of nowhere, he is slammed out of
frame to the floor. HUGE ARYAN'and his STOCKY BUDDY from
earlier proceed to beat him. Bathers leave and after a
few moments, Stevie's boys drop their TOWELS.

              HUGE ARYAN
Well well well. A virgin.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SHOWER - LATER

Derek lies on the tile floor, bloody and beaten.

              HUGE ARYAN
You ain't so tough now, are you?

The two men smile at each other, kick him and exit.
After a few seconds, LAMONT enters with the cart and
picks up dirty towels. He spots Derek laying on the
tile.

                 LAMONT
Motherfucker. What now, man?

He tends to Derek. He picks him up, throws him over his
shoulder, and carries him off.

                   LAMONT
         Shit, holmes.
               (carrying him)
         Hang on to me, man. You're heavy.

INT. PRISON INFIRMARY - EVENING

Derek lies on a table, silent.  A Mexican DOCTOR examines
his ass.

          DOCTOR
Well, you do have some tearing down
here. Christ. Okay. I'm gonna have
to stitch you up so I'll be back.    

The doctor passes Dr. Sweeney on his way out. Derek hears
Sweeney talk to the doctor and turns his head. The two
look at each other for a long moment. Sweeney sits down
next to him and puts his hand on Derek's shoulder. Derek
finally breaks down and sobs.

CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL - LATE NIGHT

Sweeney and Derek in mid-conversation.  A small lamp
shines off their faces.

          SWEENEY
Honor and loyalty run thick, Derek.
Not skin color. Skin is thin. I
don't get you, man.  I don't.
         (after a beat)
I got my Doctorate in Education...not
in medicine. But if you think babies
come into this world evil...you're
fucked up, Derek. You're way to smart
to believe that shit.
     (then)
There's nothin' more beautiful Derek,
nothin' more pure, nothin' more
innocent...than a baby.

             DEREK
They killed my father, Sweeney.

          SWEENEY
Jesus Derek. Use that brain God gave
you for chrissake. What are you gonna
do? Seek revenge your whole life and
become a lifer in here. That's what
these guys are like, you wanna be like
them? Fucking little boys in prison?
Think, man. None of your guys back
home give a shit about you.
     (after a beat)
They only care about your brother.
The new blood. And he sure as hell
can't take care of himself like you
could.

Derek looks at the man with regret.

          DEREK
Get me outta here, Sweeney.

Sweeney looks at the young man, heavily weighing his
options. The two lock eyes.

CUT TO:

EXT. PRISON QUAD - DAY

Derek reads by himself on the cement stairs by himself.
A shadow approaches from behind.

              VOICE
How you doin', man?

Derek turns his head and sees LAMONT standing there.

          DEREK
All right.
         (after a beat)
How are you?

          LAMONT
I'm fucking incarcerated, man. With a
bunch of faggots. How you think I'm
doin'?

Derek looks at the young man and can't help but laugh.
Derek slowly gets up and limps past Lamont.

          LAMONT
What are you gonna do, man?

Derek looks at him for a few moments, still shaken.

              DEREK
I'm not going to do anything.

CUT TO:

INT. PRISON VISITING ROOM

He looks through the window at his mother. Together they
pick up the phone.

TIGHT ON DEREK. He can feel her pain more than he can
feel his own. He forces a smile.

DEREK

Hey Mom.

DORIS

Hello.

The two sit there and stare at each other for a few
moments.

          DORIS
Dr. Sweeney called me. He spoke with
a guy on the parole board here.
     (then)
He thinks you might be getting out
soon.

Derek nods and stares at his mother, broken.

              DEREK
How are the others?

          DORIS
Davina's good. UCLA Math major.
     (frustrated)
All three of you have always been so
great in school. I wonder why all
this--

              DEREK
What about Dan, Mom?  How's he?

          DORIS
He's doing the same stuff you were
doing, Derek. Hanging out with
Cammeron, getting into trouble. It
brings back a lot of sad memories.
And I can't do anything...he won't
listen to me. He needs you.

Derek stares at his mother like it's the last thing he
wanted to hear.

You're my best friend, Danny. You're
my only friend. And I just want
what's best for you.

The two rub heads as DEREK puts his arm around him.
Danny squeezes back and Derek kisses him on the top of
the head.

Derek slaps the roof on the passenger side and scares the
hell out of the officers.

                 COP #2
Son of a bitch.

              DEREK
Pretty shitty assignment you got.

              COP #1
Out of respect for your father.

          DEREK
Oh yeah? What the hell do you know-

The two men sit there speechless as Derek walks over to

INT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD - A SLEEPING DORIS

She snores on the couch. The clock on the wall reads

Derek heads for the girls in the living room. He genzly

CUT TO:

INT. BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT

Derek stares at himself in the mirror. A million
thoughts race through his head as computer keys echo in
the b.g. He looks at all of his tattoos and SCARS.

TIGHT ON HIS UPPER BODY. He stares at the SWASTIKA on
his tit. He puts his hand over the tattoo to see what
he looks like without it. He turns on the shower and
gets inside.

129 INT. SHOWER - TIGHT ON DEREE

As he soaps himself down, the soap slips out of his hand
and sits on.the bottom of the tub. He looks at it a long
time before he bends over to pick it up. He immerses his
face into the shower faucet and thinks to himself.

INT. BEDROOM - TIGHT ON DANNY

He sits back down at the computer and looks back at his
brother as he dries off. Danny thinks to himself and
types a sentence.

          DANNY (V/O)
There was only one person who loved
Derek more than me.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. VINYARD HOUSEHOLD - MORNING - FLASHBACK

The place is immaculate. DENNIS VINYARD, the father of
the household, eats his breakfast in his LA COUNTY
FIREFIGHTER UNIFORM. Vintage fireman material:
muscular, receding hairline, zero facial hair. Handsome.
A pretty and well-dressed Doris SINGS while she scrambles
eight eggs with mushrooms and peppers.

          DANNY (V/O)
That was Dad. They were best friendS.
Fathers and sons are never best
friends...but they were..

YOUNGER DANNY stares at his larger-than-life father with
a cap turned backwards. Doris breaks from song and yells
to the back.

          DORIS
Breakfast!

              DENNIS
Okay! Let's go, Davina! Derek!

              DORIS
So what's this all about, Dennis?

Dennis doesn't hear because his attention is on Danny.
YOUNGER DEREK, donning a flat-top haircut and no tattoos,
walks into the kitchen. The smiling athlete has his
backpack and blue VENICE HIGH gym bag. He drops it all
onto the ground and sits at the table.

                 DENNIS
Good morning.

                 DEREK
Good morning.

Doris sets food in front of her two sons and they both go
to work. Young Danny eats quietly.

              DORIS
What about this gang stuff?

          DENNIS
Jesus Doris...it's not that big of a
deal. All departments have to take a
precaution class on gang patrol today.

          DEREK
What for?

          DENNIS
A guy was shot yesterday in
Inglewood...changin' a valve on a
hydrant. LAPD is worried that more
firefighters will become targets.
That's what this bullshit is about.
     (sipping his coffee)
A good father this guy was though and
now he's in intensive care because of
some goddamn--! They've pretty much
declared war on LAPD and us.

          DORIS
Why you guys though? I can see them
but the fire department?

          DENNIS
They think we would rather let a
building burn down over there than
fight it. So now we got two fights
goin' on at one goddamn time.

Dennis takes a bite of his eggs and explodes.

          DENNIS
         (to the bedroom)
Dayins! Get in here!

              DAVINA (O.S.)
I'm coming right now! Jesus!

          DENNIS
I'll tell you one more thing. This
"affirmative blaction" shit is driving
me up the fucking wall. Firefighters
gettin' 99's on their tests while
rappers who score a goddamn 62 walk
away with the job.

         DANNY
Don't we have to have "affirmative
action?"

              DENNIS
Not when a job requires ability.  No.

          DORIS
A lot of people say otherwise, Danny.
Including me.

          DENNIS
A lot of people don't know shit,
either.

Doris just stares at the back of her husband's head like
she wants to smack it. He turns back and disarms her
with a look.

          DENNIS
If I'm fightin' a brush fire...
surrounded by thousand degree
flames...who would I want watchin' my
back? A guy who scores a 99 or a guy
who scores a sixty?
     (then)
You don't see half the NBA with
whites, gooks and spics.

          DORIS
Nooo...what you don't see are
minorities on the boards of Fortune
500 companies cause whites won't stand
for it.

          DENNIS
Doris! I'm tired of your damn
argument! You sound like an idiot!

          DEREK
Sweeney actually had a pretty good
take on affirmative action the other
day.

          DENNIS
     (smiling)
Really? I didn't know you spoke
"African", Derek? Where'd you learn
that shit? Johannesberg?

Dennis laughs and Derek eventually smiles. Danny looks
at them, not really understanding. Doris stares down
Dennis.

          DORIS
Honey? Please don't speak that way.
They don't--

          DENNIS
How am I speaking, Doris!? Hunh?!
I'm speakin' fineP
     (quickly to Derek)
Hey. Don't let that him confuse you
over there, Derek. Look at me. This
shit he's pulling is a load of crap.
Hey. Look at me, Derek. I mean it.
If we keep givin' niggers everything,
there'll be nothing left for us.

Derek and Danny stare at their father, not knowing how to
react.

          DORIS
You can be a stupid son of a bitch
sometimes.

              DENNIS
And then we have naive fools like her.

          DORIS
I really hate you with a passion some
times.

An upset Doris exits the room past YOUNG DAVINA.  Dennis
looks to Derek.

              DENNIS
You know what I mean though, right?

        DEREK
(nodding)

Yeah.

          DAVINA
         (to the family)
Good morning.

She sits.

Her lips glare excessively this morning.

          DENNIS
Well...good morning, Miss Monroe!
     (smiling)
Look at you. You look like a star.

          DEREK
I like that color, Davina.

DAVINA
Thanks
                 DENNIS
You did like it.

Dennis reaches over and wipes it off with his napkin.

                   DAVINA
              (whining)
         Come on, Dad.

          DENNIS
Yeah. Well you're lucky I'm letting
you wear that crap on your eyes. I
love you but you're too young.

                 DAVINA
That sucks, man.

          DENNIS
It totally sucks. And we all
sympathize with you, too.

Everyone laughs but Dan, still shaken over his mother.

          DENNIS
         (Shifting to Danny)
You got practice today?

Danny shakes his head no.

                 DANNY
Coach's sick.

              DENNIS
You wanna go to Der's game with me?

DANNY

Sure.

          DENNIS
     (quickly to Derek}
Santa Monica High tonight, right?

DEREK

Yep.

          DENNIS
Perfect.
     (to Danny)
Ben'll whip us up a couple of double
deckers and we'll head over.

        DANNY
(smiling)

Okay.

Dennis smiles, reaches over with a fatherly hand, and
messes up his hair.

BACK QUICKLY TO:

INT. BEDROOM - DANNY - PRESENT

He stops typing and almost cries. He leans back in his
chair and and stares himself in the side mirror. He
feels his bald head, almost exploring.

CUT TO:

EXT. BEN'S BURGER SHOP - LATE NIGHT

A white homeless man in an ARMY JACKET sits outside
begging for change. Seth and Cameron, both beat-up,
drunk and bloody, stare at the man.

          HOMELESS MAN
Spare change for a cheeseburger?

              SETH
Get a job and buy one why don't you.

                 HOMELESS MAN
God bless you.

          SETH
Fuck you.

Seth stumbles into the shop.  Cam stares at the homeless
man, psychotically.

                 HOMELESS MAN
Fifty cents is all I ask.
Vietnam, man.

I was in

          CAMMERON
Really? So you've had what? Thirty
years to get your shit together?

          HOMELESS MAN
All I want is something to eat.

          CAMMERON
There are plenty of fuckin'
dishwashing jobs out there, Vietnam
boy. Go get yourself one.

In the background, BEN THE OWNER and Seth shake hands.

                 HOMELESS MAN
Did I do something?

          CAMMERON
You're a disgrace to the white race.
If Adolf Hitler was alive...God bless
his soul...he would have you shot.

          HOMELESS MAN
Fuck you then. Now and forever.  Fuck
you.

Cameron knees the weaker man square in the face. The
man slopes down to his side, unconscious. As an
afterthought, Cameron kicks him several more times.

                 CAMMERON
Noooo. Fuck you.

QUICKLY TO ACROSS THE STREET. Little Henry and two of
his friends watch Cammeron's brutality from their bikes.
They turn in the opposite direction and hurry off.

INT. BURGER SHOP - CAMHERON AND SETH

CUT TO:

Seth eats a burger and chili fries at the same time.
Cameron smokes across from him and watches Seth eat like
a pig. He takes a look at the homeless man outside who
still lays motionless. Cam feels his BANDAGED FACE.

              CAMMERON
I think I need to go to the hospital.

                 SETH
Seriously?

          CAMMERON
I don't know. I think so.

                 SETH
Where's Stacey?

                 CAMMERON
Who gives a fuck?

Seth takes a bite and chews.

               SETH
Derek's a fuckin' traitor pussy.

         CAMMERON
Well...we might be pussies too if we
got treated the way he did.

                 SETH
What do you mean?

          CAMMERON
Stevie McCormick called...old school
Venice bro. He's at Chino...doin'
life. He hated Derek.
     (exhaling)
Said he was a fucking blow-up doll in
there.

          SETH
         (overwhelmed)
Fucking A.

Seth continues to eat.  Cammeron looks out the window and
hates what he sees.

              CAMMERON
Oh Christ. You gotta be kidding me?

SETH

What?

CAMMERON'S POV. A large, mature and sharp-looking BLACK
MAN helps A BEAUTIFUL BLOND out of a RED BMW. THEY KISS.
Cammeron is at a loss for words. Cam puts out his
cigarette as the couple ENTERS.

          CAMMERON
     (looking at the two)
Is there anything sacred in this
country anymore? Jesus Christ. Hey.
Stop feeding your face for a second
and look behind you.

Seth turns his head and stares at the interracial couple.
He turns back to Cam and sings a verse from the famous
atevie Wonder song, EBONY AND IVORY. Cameron laughs.
The black man turns and looks at the two.

          CAMMERON
Can we help you with something? Do
you have any questions about the menu?

                 BLACK MAN
No questions.

          CAMMERON
I recommend either the "Big Ben
Burger" or the "Chicken Taco Special."
Ben'll replace the dark meat with the
white meat if you ask nicely.

          BLACK MAN
     (fed up)
What's your problem, pal?

          CAMMERON
I ain't your fucking pal first of all.
Secondly...I don't have problems.
People who luck with me have problems.

              WHITE GIRL
Come on. Let's get out of here.

          CAMMERON
Hey! What a great idea! You got a
clever little whatever it is there.
I'd listen to it if I were you.

                 BLACK MAN
You're not me.

          CAMHERON
     (smiling)
And I thank God Almighty every day for
that, believe me.

                 SETH
Excuse me? Tyrone?

          BLACK MAN
My name's not Tyrone either.

SETH
Whatever.  Why can't you stick to your
own race?

          WHITE GIRL
     (disgusted)
Jesus Christ! Where do you assholes
come from?!

          CAMMERON
What the luck difference does it make
where we come from, bitch? I'm from a
place called America. A place that
used to be a nice place to live before
it became fuckin' Africa-America.

               BLACK MAN
You ignorant mother--

Seth quickly gets out of his chair and makes his gun
totally visible to the couple.

          SETH
You got a fuckin' death wish, asshole?
Do you? Make your move now if you do.
If you don't...get the luck out of my
sight. Cause I'm real close to
shoving my piece up your girlfriend's
stinky pussy.

The black man stares at the gun sticking out of Seth's
belly. He grabs his girlfriend and walks out of the
joint. Seth sits back down and the two laugh. Cameron
looks over at Ben and raises his hands in the air.

          CAMMERON
     (smiling)
Everything's hunky dory, Ben!  No
problemo. Only us white folk.

CUT TO:

INT. BEDROOM - A DIGITAL CLOCK

It reads 2:36 a.m. Shiftless Derek lifts a sleeping
Danny off the computer keyboard. He helps him into the
bottom bunk, tucks him in, and watches him snooze.

             DEREK
     (softly)
Did you "save" it?

An asleep Danny nods. Derek slowly walks back into the
bathroom to grab his towel off the floor. He looks at
his SWASTIKA TAT in the mirror and sighs to himself. He
turns off the light and exits.

CUT TO:

INT. BURGER JOINT - SETH AND CAMMERON

Seth finishes his display of gluttony.

          CAMMERON
It wouldn't irritate me so much if the
ratio was a little more even.

                 SETH
What's that?

         CAMMERON
       (going mad)
Ebony and Ivory back there! Almost
all of those orange kid relationships
are black man and white women and I'm
fucking sick of seein' it! I wouldn't
mind so much if it were more even.

                 SETH
Huge dicks, Cam.  That's all it is.

          CAMMERON
I used to think that too but...it's
gotta be more, man. It has to be more
than the fact they they carry a big
load. Chicks aren't that shallow, are
they? It's politically correct...
that's what it is. White
women...bein' seen with the
coloreds...it's great for their image.
Bitches today want to be known as
bein' fuckin' color blind.

              SETH
They get off on it.

              CAMMERON
And you can't really blame Tyrone.

                 SETH
Why the fuck not?

          CAMMERON
Well...how'd you like to drag around
some fat fly girl? I wouldn't.

          SETH
No shit.
     (imitating)
Oh go girlfriend! Don't be puttin' up
wid dat, girl! Oh stop girl!

Seth and Cammeron laugh and head outside--leaving a mess
on the table.

EXT. ACROSS THE STREET - THE CHEROKEE FROM EARLIER

The white vehicle gets passed by cars left and right.

INT. CHEROKEE - HENRY'S POV

Henry sits up front with JEROME, nervous and scared.  The
three thugs in back lock and load.

                       LITTLE HENRY
          You gonna waste 'em?

                       JEROME
          Only if we have to.

Jerome grabs a baseball bat and they quietly get out.

INT. VAN - TIGHT ON LITTLE HENRY

Me bites his nails and watches the foursome sneak up on
an oblivious Seth and Cammeron.

EXT. GRAVEL PARKING LOT - HENRY'S POV

The men close in. Seth and Cam are blind to it.  Jerome
raises the bat as they close in and we--

FADE TO:

INT. BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING - BIRDS CHIRPING

Danny stares at himself in the mirror and tries to find
some stubble on his chin.

INT. BEDROOM - A SLICK DEREK

He stares into the mirror in a coat and pants.  Danny
rushes to get his things together.

          DANNY
I'm printing it up and we're out of
here.

          DEREK
Hurry up.

Derek walks out into the living room.

INT. MESSY LIVING ROOM - DORIS

She's on the couch watching cartoons. She takes a jar of
Vick's Vapor Rub and puts some on her chest. Derek walks
in the room, bends over and kisses her on the forehead.
Davina sits on the couch and writes. Derek just smiles.

              DORIS
Wow. What happened?

              DEREK
I gotta see my parole officer.

              DAVINA
Hey Der? Do you have Excel on disk?

             DEREK
I've got everything on disk.

Davina smiles and walks into the back bedroom.  Doris
looks at Derek.

                 DORIS
You look good.

Derek smiles and caresses his mother's cheek.

          DEREK
We're getting out of here soon.  Is
that okay with you?

          DORIS
I'd love it.
     (after a beat)
Do you think I should color my hair?

DEREK

Yes.

He sits beside his mother and enjoys the moment.  He
thinks to himself.

          DORIS
I'm glad you made it back. I wasn't
too sure I was going to see you again.
You know how I get.

Filled with regret, he nods.

          DEREK
You think you'll be able to forgive
me? Someday maybe?

              DORIS
You're my son. Of course I will.

Derek smiles and can't believe his tearful reaction.

              DEREK
Look at me. I'm such a pussy.

                 DORIS
No you're not.

CUT TO:

EXT. VENICE BLVD. - A NEWSPAPER MACHINE

Derek plunks a quarter down the slot and removes a copy
of the LA TIMES. Danny continues to skate ahead of him.
Sensing danger, Derek looks back behind him. With no one
in sight, he walks into a doughnut shop.

INT. DOUGHNUT SHOP - DEREK'S POV

He takes a guarded look outside. Everything seems
normal. A bus drives by. A group of Mexican laborers,
dressed for work and smiling, walk past in the other
direction.

Inside, a black woman orders a dozen doughnuts from a
short Korean.man behind the counter. Her young daughter
grabs her leg. Danny sits down and reads Derek's paper.

                 DEREK
What do you want?

              DANNY
Maple bar and a...large milk.

Derek smiles at the little girl while he waits. She
wanders from her mother's leg and over towards Derek.

          DEREK
         (to the girl)
You look pretty.

She laughs.

          TISHA
Thank you.

                 DEREK
How do I look?

       BLACK GIRL
(bashfully)
Fine.

DANNY'S POV. He looks up from the paper.  He watches the
girl together with his brother.

                 DEREK
What's your name?

BLACK GIRL

Tisha.

         DEREK
How old are you, Tisha?

She holds up four fingers. Derek smiles.

         BLACK MOTHER
         (staring at Derek)
Come here, Tisha.

Tisha returns to her mother and they quickly exit. Derek
watches the girl as she continues to stare at him as they
make their way down the street.

Outside, a BLUE FORD screeches out front. Rasmussen and
the Young Mark Fuhrman type from earlier get out and
wait. Dr. Sweeney meets the duo and together they walk
inside.

                 DEREK
What's goin' on?

              SWEENEY
We need to talk, Derek.

              DEREK
How'd you find out I was here?

              SWEENEY
We were just at your apartment.

          RASMUSSEN
Cammeron and Seth are in the ICU at
St. Johns, Derek. They were jumped in
front of Ben's Burgets early this
morning.

Derek thinks to himself for a few more seconds.

          DEREK
How bad?

          RASMUSSEN
They'll live.
     (then)
They must have been looking for
somebody else.

Derek stares at Rasmussen and walks away.
Sweeney, who knows to walk over to him.

He eyes

TIGHT ON SWEENEY AND DEREK. The two lock eyes.

         SWEENEY
Are they coming after you?

          DEREK
Fuckin' A.

Sweeney sighs.

          SWEENEY
I don't know.
     (after a long beat)
You might have to talk to your old
crew though.

Derek looks over and analyzes the innocence of his
brother.

              DEREK
I can't, Sweeney.

                 SWEENEY
Try, Derek. Okay?

Derek senses the danger in his voice.

       SWEENEY
Okay?  Before it explodes.

Sweeney walks away and then turns back to Derek.

                 SWEENEY
And watch your back.

Derek nods.

          SWEENEY
(back to Danny)
You showing up today?

Danny looks at Sweeney and nods his head yes.

SWEENEY

Good.

CUT TO:

EXT. VENICE HIGH - DEREK AND DANNY

They are outside the fence surrounding the field.
Students head off to morning class.

        DEREK
Hey. Keep your head up, alright?  I'm 
going to take care of this.

DANNY
How?

          DEREK
I don't know. I'll figure it out
though. You gonna be okay?

DANNY
Yeah.

The two stare at each other as THE BELL RINGS.

              DANNY
I gotta turn that paper in.

Danny hops the fence with his backpack on. He looks back
at Derek. Cops #1 and #2 sit in their car in the b.g.

DEREK
Hey.

DANNY
What?

          DEREK
Come here.

Derek puts his hand over the fence. Danny walks up and
clasps it -- FINGERS INTERTWINED. Derek wants to say one
thing but something else comes out.

              DEREK
I'll see you at home.

Danny smiles at his brother and nods. Danny puts his ear
phones on and heads to class. Derek watches his brother
through the chain-link fence. Danny meets up with Lizzy
and they soon disappear from Derek's sight. Derek turns
and walks down the street.

          COP #1
You need a lift anywhere?

DEREK
Nope.

Derek stops in his tracks, walks back over to the fence,
and stares at the school.

INT. MESSY HALLWAY - DANNY AND LIZZY

Students rush past them. Danny kisses Lizzy and she
hurries off to class. He pushes on the men's room door.

INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - SAME

Danny enters, sets his "AMERICAN HISTORY X" PAPER on top
of the sink, and takes an unearthly long piss at the
urinal. He finishes, flushes and turns.

Standing there is LITTLE HENRY. A GUN IN HIS HAND.

                 DANNY
Jesus Christ.  What are you doing,
Henry?

          LITTLE HENRY
     (afraid)
What does it look like I'm doin'?

                 DANNY
Come on, man, no.  You don't want to
do this. Come on.  Henry?

THE DOOR SMACKS OPEN and Danny moves to grab the pistol.
It discharges and a bullet rockets into Danny's chest.
He SLAMS back into the URINAL and gasps for air. The
force of the pistol knocks Henry to the ground. The two
kids who just entered bolt for help.

Danny slides to the tile, leaving a bloody trail. The
two stare at each other - EYE TO EYE. THE BLOODSTAINED
PAPER falls into the DAMP SINK. Danny inhales like glass
is raking his lungs.

              LITTLE HENRY
         (terrified)
Danny?

Danny's breathing slows to a choked whisper.  He blinks,
coughs, twitches. And dies.

                       LITTLE HENRY
         Vinyard? Danny?

Henry watches teary-eyed with the same altered look Derek
had after killing Lawrence. Together they FREEZE on the
cold tile floor.

CUT TO:

INT. HALL AT VENICE HIGH BATHROOM - YELLOW POLICE TAPE

Officers and detectives monitor the area. Young
students, including Lizzy and her friends, stand around
and cry. Rasmussen brings THE BLOODY PAPER over to
Sweeney. Sweeney looks at it for a moment but is
interrupted.

          RASMUSSEN
He won't let go. Will you talk to
him?

INT. BATHROOM - TIGHT ON DEREK AND DANNY

Derek cradles his bloody brother. Sweeney walks over,
crouches, and talks to Derek's back.

         SWEENEY
Derek? You gotta let him go, man.
They gotta get him outta here.

DEREK

I can't.

Derek begins to cry outright. He can't control himself.
He lets go of Danny's corpse and charges out into the
hall.

INT. HALLWAY - DORIS AND DAVINA

Derek embraces them. Doris grabs his face -- torn
between love and hate. Guilt-ridden, Derek tears from
them and storms down the hall with Sweeney soon in tow.

          SWEENEY
Derek! I know what you're thinkin'
right now and I want you to forget
about it!

          DEREK
How the luck do you know what I'm
thinkin', Sweeney!?

          SWEENEY
Cause I'm thinkin' the same damn
thing!

Drowning in rage, Derek turns back to a misty eyed
Sweeney.

              DEREK
They shot him in a fucking...pisshole!

          SWEENEY
And goin' after them won't bring him
back. Don't do it, Derek. Please,
man. You've come too far. The war is
over.

Derek contemplates the situation and presses his tongue
against his teeth, crackbrained. Sweeney slowly
approaches and cautiously wraps his arms around the young
man. Derek buries his tearing face in Sweeney's
shoulder.

              DEREK
It stops now, Sweeney.

Sweeney nods and the two lock eyes. Derek makes his way
back to Doris and Davina and together, they grieve.

              DANNY (V/O)
We've heard it a million times, a
Bible quote become cliche: "Vengeance
is mine, sayeth the Lord."

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - DANNY AND HENRY

A still of the two immediately after the murder. We move
in tighter and tighter until we get close on Danny.

          DANNY (V/O)
Vengeance brought about by hate...and
fear. When it points its head in our
direction, we take notice and
everything changes. The way we choose
our friends, the way we protect our
families, the way we create enemies
out of strangers.
     (then)
Welcome to America.

TIGHT ON DANNY'S EYES. They are gently pushed shut by
Henry's two small BLACK FINGERS.
