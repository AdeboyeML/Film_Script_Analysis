                                      Callie Khouri

                                  Final shooting script

                                       JUNE 5, 1990

                

               FADE IN:

               INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING (PRESENT DAY)

               LOUISE is a waitress in a coffee shop.  She is in her early-
               thirties, but too old to be doing this.  She is very pretty 
               and meticulously groomed, even at the end of her shift.  She 
               is slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus 
               tray underneath the counter.  It is making a lot of RACKET, 
               which she is oblivious to.  There is COUNTRY MUZAK in the 
               b.g., which she hums along with.

               INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING

               THELMA is a housewife.  It's morning and she is slamming 
               coffee cups from the breakfast table into the kitchen sink, 
               which is full of dirty breakfast dishes and some stuff left 
               from last night's dinner which had to "soak".  She is still 
               in her nightgown.  The TV is ON in the b.g.

               From the kitchen, we can see an incomplete wallpapering 
               project going on in the dining room, an obvious "do-it-
               yourself" attempt by Thelma.

               INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING

               Louise goes to the pay phone and dials a number.

               INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING

               Phone RINGS.  Thelma goes over to answer it.

                                     THELMA
                              (hollering)
                         I got it!   Hello.

               INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING

                                     LOUISE
                              (at pay phone)
                         I hope you're packed, little 
                         housewife, 'cause we are outta her 
                         tonight.

               INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING

                                     THELMA
                         Well, wait now.  I still have to ask 
                         Darryl if I can go.

                                     LOUISE (V.O.)
                         You mean you haven't asked him yet?  
                         For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your 
                         husband or your father?  It's just 
                         two days.  For God's sake, Thelma.  
                         Don't be a child.  Just tell him 
                         you're goin' with me, for cryin' out 
                         loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous 
                         breakdown.

               Thelma has the phone tucked under her chin, as she cuts out 
               coupons from the newspaper and pins them on a bulletin board 
               already covered with them.  We see various recipes torn out 
               from women's magazines along the lines of "101 Ways to Cook 
               Pork."

                                     THELMA
                         He already thinks you're out of your 
                         mind, Louise, that don't carry much 
                         weight with Darryl.  Are you at work?

                                     LOUISE (V.O.)
                         No, I'm callin' from the Playboy 
                         Mansion.

                                     THELMA
                         I'll call you right back.

               Thelma goes through the living room to the bottom of the 
               stairs and leans on the banister.

                                     THELMA
                         Darryl!  Honey, you'd better hurry 
                         up.

               DARRYL comes trotting down the stairs.  Polyester was made 
               for this man, and he's dripping in "men's" jewelry.  He 
               manages a Carpeteria.

                                     DARRYL
                         Damnit, Thelma, don't holler like 
                         that!  Haven't I told you I can't 
                         stand it when you holler in the 
                         morning.

                                     THELMA
                         I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want 
                         you to be late.

               Darryl is checking himself out in the hall mirror, and

               it's obvious he likes what he sees.  He exudes over-confidence 
               for reasons that never become apparent.  He likes to think 
               of himself as a real lady killer.

               He is making imperceptible adjustments to his over-moussed 
               hair.  Thelma watches approvingly.

                                     THELMA
                         Hon.

                                     DARRYL
                         What.

                                     THELMA
                              (she decides not to 
                              tell him)
                         Have a good day at work today.

                                     DARRYL
                         Uh-huh.

                                     THELMA
                         Hon?

                                     DARRYL
                         What?!

                                     THELMA
                         You want anything special for dinner?

                                     DARRYL
                         No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what 
                         we have for dinner.  I may not even 
                         make it home for dinner.  You know 
                         how Fridays are.

                                     THELMA
                         Funny how so many people wanna buy 
                         carpet on a Friday night.  You'd 
                         almost think they's want to forget 
                         about it for the weekend.

                                     DARRYL
                         Well then, it's a good thing you're 
                         not regional manager and I am.

               He's finally ready.  He walks to the door and gives Thelma 
               the most perfunctory kiss on the cheek.

                                     THELMA
                         'Bye, honey.  I won't wait up.

                                     DARRYL
                         See ya.

               Darryl leaves.  We see his Corvette parked out front.  As he 
               closes the front door, Thelma leans against it.

                                     THELMA
                         He's gonna shit.

               Thelma laughs to herself.  She goes back into the kitchen 
               and picks up the phone and dials it.

               INT.  RESTAURANT - MORNING

               The pay phone on the wall RINGS.  ALBERT, a busboy in his 
               50's, answers.

                                     ALBERT
                         Good morning.  Why, yes, she is.  Is 
                         this Thelma?  Oh, Thelma, when you 
                         gonna run away with me?

               Louise comes over and takes the phone out of his hand.

                                     LOUISE
                              (to Albert)
                         Not this weekend, sweetie, she's 
                         runnin' away with me.
                              (into phone)
                         Hi.  What'd he say?

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                         What time are you gonna pick me up?

                                     LOUISE
                         You're kiddin'!  Alright!  I'll be 
                         there around two or three.

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                         What kind of stuff do I bring?

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess.  
                         It's the mountains.  I guess it gets 
                         cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring 
                         everything.

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                         Okay.  I will, too.

                                     LOUISE
                         And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                         I don't know how to fish, Louise.

                                     LOUISE
                         Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl 
                         does it, how hard can it be?  I'll 
                         see you later.  Be ready.

               They both hang up.

               EXT.  RESTAURANT - DAY

               Louise pulls out in a green '66 T-Bird in mint condition.

               INT.  THELMA'S BEDROOM - CLOSEUP - SUITCASE ON BED - DAY

               Going into the suitcase is bathing suits, wool socks, flannel 
               pajamas, jeans, sweaters, T-shirts, a couple of dresses, way 
               too much stuff for a two-day trip.  REVEAL Thelma, standing 
               in front of a closet, trying to decide what else to bring, 
               as if she's forgotten something.  The room looks like it was 
               decorated entirely from a Sears catalog.  It's really frilly.

               INT.  LOUISE'S BEDROOM - CLOSEUP - SUITCASE ON BED - DAY

               A perfectly ordered suitcase, everything neatly folded and 
               orderly.  Three pairs of underwear, one pair of long 
               underwear, two pairs of pants, two sweaters, one furry robe, 
               one nightgown.  She could be packing for camp.

               REVEAL Louise.  Her room is as orderly as the suitcase.

               Everything matches.  It's not quite as frilly as Thelma's, 
               but it is of the same ilk.  She is debating whether to take 
               an extra pair of socks.  She decides not to and closes the 
               suitcase.  She goes to the phone, picks it up and dials.  We 
               hear:

                                     ANSWERING MACHINE (V.O.)
                         Hi.  This is Jimmy.  I'm not here 
                         right now, but I'll probably be back 
                         'cause... all my stuff's here.  Leave 
                         a message.

               Louise slams down the phone.  A framed picture of Louise and 
               Jimmy sits on the table next to the phone.  She matter-of-
               factly slams that face down, too.

               INT.  THELMA'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Thelma is still throwing stuff in, randomly now.  She talks 
               to herself quietly the whole time.

               She is taking stuff off of her nightstand, a small clock, 
               fingernail scissors, etc.

               She opens the drawer of her nightstand.  Her attitude is 
               purposeful; she looks as if she knows exactly what she's 
               doing; although, frankly, she has no idea, and each decision 
               is completely arbitrary.  As she rifles through it, plucking 
               various items from among the jumbled contents, we see there 
               is a gun in there, one Darryl bought her for protection.  It 
               is unloaded, but there is a box of bullets.  She picks up 
               the gun like it's a rat by the tail and puts it in her purse.

                                     THELMA
                              (muttering to herself)
                         Psycho killers...

               She grabs the box of bullets and throws them in, too.  She 
               tries to close her suitcase, but there is stuff hanging out 
               all over the place.  She stuffs things back in the sides and 
               heaves all her weight against the top.

               EXT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Louise's green '66 T-Bird convertible pulls into the driveway 
               of Thelma's house.  The garage door goes up and Thelma is 
               standing in the garage with all her gear.  A suitcase that 
               looks like it might explode, fishing gear, a cooler, a 
               lantern.  Thelma's car, a beat-up gray Honda, is parked in 
               there, too.  Louise gets out of the driver's seat.

                                     LOUISE
                         We don't need the lantern.  The place 
                         has electricity.

                                     THELMA
                         I wanna take it anyway.  Just in 
                         case.

                                     LOUISE
                         In case of what?

                                     THELMA
                         In case there's some escaped psycho 
                         killer on the loose, who cuts the 
                         electricity off and tries to come in 
                         and kill us.

                                     LOUISE
                              (going along with her)
                         Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern 
                         will come in real handy.  Maybe we 
                         could tow your car behind, in case 
                         he steals the spark plugs.

                                     THELMA
                         We'd have to.  That thing barely 
                         makes it down the driveway.

               They load everything into the car.  The trunk barely closes.  
               Thelma heaves all her weight against it.  They get into the 
               car and pull out of the driveway.  As they drive down the 
               street, we hear Thelma let out a long howl.

               She is laughing and she sticks her arms straight up in the 
               air.

               EXT.  CAR - DAY

               They are driving down the interstate.  Thelma reaches for 
               her purse and finds the gun.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise, will you take care of the 
                         gun?

               Louise shrieks at the sight of it.

                                     LOUISE
                         Why in hell did you bring that?

               Thelma wonders if Louise is really that naive.

                                     THELMA
                         Oh, come on, Louise... psycho killers, 
                         bears... snakes!  I just don't know 
                         how to use it.  So will you take 
                         care of it?

               Louise reaches over and takes the gun out of Thelma's purse 
               and holds it in her hand.  She tests the weight of it, and 
               then puts it under the seat.  Thelma puts the bullets under 
               the seat.

               They are speeding off down the highway with the RADIO blaring.  
               Louise puts in a TAPE of wild R&B MUSIC.

                                     THELMA
                         Whose place is this again?

                                     LOUISE
                         It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's 
                         gettin' a divorce, so his wife's 
                         gettin' this place, so he's just 
                         lettin' all his friends use it till 
                         he has to turn over the keys.

                                     THELMA
                         I've never had the chance to go out 
                         of town without Darryl.

                                     LOUISE
                         How come he let you go?

                                     THELMA
                         'Cause I didn't ask him.

                                     LOUISE
                         Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill 
                         you.

                                     THELMA
                         Well, he has never let me go.  He 
                         never lets me do one goddamn thing 
                         that's any fun.  All he wants me to 
                         do is hang around the house the whole 
                         time while he's out doing God only 
                         knows what.

               They are both silent for a minute.

                                     THELMA
                              (looking straight 
                              ahead)
                         I left him a note.  I left him stuff 
                         to microwave.

               After a pause.

                                     THELMA
                         I guess you haven't heard anything 
                         from Jimmy... yet?

               Louise's jaw tightens.  The car speeds up.

                                     THELMA
                         ...never mind.

               A huge semi-tanker carrying gas passes them on the highway 
               and HONKS.  The mud flaps are the shiny silhouettes of naked 
               women.  There is a bumper sticker on the back that says:  
               "Lick you all over -- ten cents."

                                     LOUISE
                         One of your friends?

               Thelma is watching herself in the side mirror, pretending to 
               smoke a cigarette.

               THELMA'S POV OF A SIGN alongside the road that reads "See 
               you in church on Sunday!"

               Thelma pushes in the lighter and waits for it to pop out.  
               Louise gives her a sidelong glance, but does not say anything.

               INT.  CAR - COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

                                     THELMA
                         How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm 
                         hungry.

                                     LOUISE
                         Another hour of so.  We've got enough 
                         food for a month.

                                     THELMA
                         I'll never make it... Can't we stop 
                         just for a few minutes...

                                     LOUISE
                         We've not gonna get to the cabin 
                         till after dark as it is, Thelma.

                                     THELMA
                         Then what difference does it make if 
                         we stop?  Come on.  I never get to 
                         do stuff like this.

               Louise realizes that Thelma is going to revert to a teenager 
               and continue whining unless she gives in.

                                     LOUISE
                         Alright, but it's gonna be a quick 
                         stop.

               EXT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT

               They pull off at a place down on the right all lit up with 
               neon.  It's called the SILVER BULLET.  The sign flashes 
               COCKTAILS -- BEER -- DANCING -- FOOD.  There is a huge gravel 
               parking lot with lots of pickup trucks and older cars.  Even 
               though it's early, you can tell this place is a real night 
               spot.  It's already pretty crowded.

               INT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT

               This place is jumpin'.  There are ten pool tables with crowds 
               all around.  The long bar is filled with customers.

               There are tables and booths.  The room is dense with smoke.  
               There is a dance floor, but no one is dancing yet because 
               the band is still setting up.  There are a lot of single 
               men.  Many heads turn and follow Thelma and Louise to an 
               empty table.

                                     LOUISE
                         I haven't seen a place like this 
                         since I left Texas.

                                     THELMA
                         Isn't this fun?

               A WAITRESS comes over and drops two menus on the table.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Y'all wanna drink?

                                     LOUISE
                         No thanks.

                                     THELMA
                         I'll have Wild Turkey straight up 
                         and a Coke back, please.

               As the Waitress leaves:

                                     LOUISE
                         Thelma!

                                     THELMA
                         Tell me somethin'.  Is this my 
                         vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, 
                         you're as bad as Darryl.

                                     LOUISE
                         I just haven't seen you like this in 
                         a while.  I'm used to seeing you 
                         more sedate.

                                     THELMA
                         Well, I've had it up to my ass with 
                         sedate!  You said you and me was 
                         gonna get outta town and, for once, 
                         just really let our hair down.  Well, 
                         darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is 
                         comin' down!

               As the Waitress returns:

                                     LOUISE
                              (laughing)
                         Alright...
                              (to Waitress)
                         I changed my mind.  I'll have a 
                         margarita with and a shot of Cuervo 
                         on the side, please.

                                     THELMA
                         Yeah!

               As the Waitress leaves, a MAN comes over with a chair which 
               he pulls up to the table and straddles backwards.

               He is in his late-40's, heavyset, his face is shiny in the 
               neon light.

                                     MAN
                         Now what are a couple of Kewpie dolls 
                         like you doin' in a place like this?

                         LOUISE
                 Mindin' our own 
                 business, why don't 
                 you try it.

                                                       THELMA
                                               Well, we left town for the 
                                               weekend 'cause we wanted 
                                               to try and have a good 
                                               time.  And because Louise 
                                               here is mad because her 
                                               boyfriend won't call her 
                                               while he's out on the 
                                               road... 

               Louise kicks Thelma under the table.

                                     THELMA
                              (quieter)
                         We just wanted to get somethin' to 
                         eat.

                                     MAN
                         Well, you come to the right place.  
                         You like chili?  They got good chili.

               The Waitress returns with Louise's drink.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Harlan, are you botherin' these poor 
                         girls?

                                     HARLAN (MAN)
                         Hell, no.  I was just bein' friendly.

                                     WAITRESS
                              (making eye contact 
                              with Louise)
                         It's a good thing they're not all as 
                         friendly as you.

               Louise understands.

                                     THELMA
                         Your name's Harlan?  I got an uncle 
                         named Harlan!

                                     HARLAN
                         You do?  Is he a funny uncle? 'Cause 
                         if he is, then he and I got somethin' 
                         in common.

               Harlan laughs.  Thelma laughs, too, but doesn't really get 
               the joke.  Louise does not laugh.

                                     LOUISE
                              (to Harlan)
                         I don't mean to be rude, but I've 
                         got something I need to talk to my 
                         friend about.  In private.

                                     HARLAN
                         Aw, I understand.  I didn't mean to 
                         bother ya.  It's just hard not to 
                         notice two such pretty ladies as 
                         yourselves.
                              (standing, to Thelma)
                         You better dance with me before you 
                         leave, or I'll never forgive you.

                                     THELMA
                         Oh, sure.  That'd be fun.

               Harlan leaves, then:

                                     THELMA
                         Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.

                                     LOUISE
                         Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' 
                         on you?

                                     THELMA
                         So what if he was?  It's all your 
                         years of waitin' tables has made you 
                         jaded, that's all.

                                     LOUISE
                         Maybe.

                                     THELMA
                         Well, just relax, will ya.  You're 
                         makin' me nervous.

               Thelma knocks back her shot of Wild Turkey and holds up her 
               glass to the Waitress to bring her another one.  The Waitress 
               sees her and nods.  She turns back to face her friend.

                                     THELMA
                         So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?

                                     LOUISE
                         Givin' him a taste of his own 
                         medicine.  Asshole.

                                     THELMA
                         I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're 
                         all upset.  It's just I'm so excited 
                         to be out of the house, I guess.
                              (pause)
                         I wonder if Darryl's home yet.

                                     LOUISE
                         I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.

                                     THELMA
                         Why don't you tell him to just to 
                         get lost once and for all?

                                     LOUISE
                         Why don't you ditch that loser husband 
                         of yours?

               They both drift off momentarily, contemplating their domestic 
               problems, until the Waitress comes over:

                                     WAITRESS
                              (rolling her eyes)
                         This one's on Harlan.

               Thelma looks over at the bar where Harlan is grinning at 
               her, making dancing motions.  She smiles and waves at him.

               Her face becomes serious again as she turns back to Louise.

                                     THELMA
                         Jimmy'll come in off the road, you 
                         won't be there, he'll freak out and 
                         call you a hundred thousand times, 
                         and Sunday night you'll call him 
                         back and, by Monday.  He'll be kissin' 
                         the ground you walk on.

               Thelma's mind goes too fast for her mouth, and the speed at 
               which she speaks can be staggering.  Louise is used to it.  
               Louise smiles wistfully at Thelma's assessment of the 
               situation.

                                     LOUISE
                         Exactly.

                                     THELMA
                         In the meantime, you said we were 
                         gonna have some fun.  So let's have 
                         some!

               She again drinks her whole shot of Wild Turkey and holds up 
               her glass, as the BAND strikes up a lively tune.

               Practically the whole place "whoops" and heads for the dance 
               floor.  Louise drinks her shot of tequila and holds up her 
               glass, too.

               LATER

               Thelma is dancing with Harlan and has been for quite a while.  
               Louise has been dancing with a quiet guy named DAN.  Thelma 
               is breathless, drunk and giggly.  She holds a beer bottle in 
               one hand.  She is laughing a lot about nothing, and Harlan 
               is studying her closely.  Louise notices this.

                                     LOUISE
                              (over the noise)
                         Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little 
                         girls' room, and then we gotta hit 
                         the road.

                                     THELMA
                              (eyes closed, swaying 
                              with the music)
                         Ready when you are.

               Louise heads off to the bathroom.

                                     THELMA
                              (eyes still closed)
                         Louise, I'm gonna come with you.
                              (she gets a funny 
                              look on her face)
                         I don't feel so good.

               She stumbles a step and drops her beer bottle.

               Louise is heading towards the bathroom, where there is a 
               line of at least fifteen women in front of her.

                                     HARLAN
                              (catching Thelma, 
                              copping feels)
                         Oopsy-doopsy.  We need to get you 
                         some fresh air, little lady.

               He steers her towards the door.

               Louise leans against the wall, waiting in line.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT.  SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Harlan is hauling Thelma out the door into the parking lot.  
               She is pretty limp.

                                     THELMA
                         Oh shit.

                                     HARLAN
                         What's wrong?

                                     THELMA
                         Stop.

                                     HARLAN
                         What for?

                                     THELMA
                         I'm spinning.

               INT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT

               The Waitress is going over to their table.  She picks up 
               Thelma's purse off the floor and puts it on her chair.

               She sets the check on the table, looks around to see if she 
               can see them and walks away.

               INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Louise goes into the bathroom.  She stands in front of the 
               sink and looks at herself in the mirror.

               EXT.  PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Thelma has been sick.  She has Harlan's handkerchief and is 
               wiping her mouth.  Harlan has backed off for this part, but 
               he's right back in there.

                                     HARLAN
                         How you feelin' now, darlin'?

               Harlan is leaning close to Thelma's head, and she pulls her 
               head away.

                                     THELMA
                         I guess I'm startin' to feel a little 
                         better.

                                     HARLAN
                         Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty 
                         good to me, too.

               He pulls her to him and tries to put his arms around her.  
               Thelma pulls away.

                                     THELMA
                              (uncomfortable)
                         I think I need to keep walking.

               INT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT

               Louise comes out of the bathroom as the next woman goes in.  
               She scans the room looking for Thelma.  She doesn't see her.  
               She goes over to the table and sees Thelma's stuff there.  
               She picks up the check and looks at it.

               EXT.  SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Harlan has led Thelma off to the far end of the parking lot.  
               He is trying to kiss her now.  He is pushing her arms down 
               and turning her head away.

                                     THELMA
                         Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel 
                         good.  I've been sick.

                                     HARLAN
                         It's okay.  I'm married, too.

               Harlan is pushing himself on her now, and she is beginning 
               to push him away harder.

               INT.  SILVER BULLET - NIGHT

               Louise is paying the Waitress.  The Waitress is shaking her 
               head, indicating she hasn't seen Thelma either.

               Louise picks up Thelma's stuff and heads towards the door.

               EXT.  SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Harlan has now pinned Thelma against the back of a car and 
               is kissing her neck.  He has her ass in his hands.  He is 
               beginning to hump her.  She is pushing him away as hard as 
               she can, but he is relentless.

                                     HARLAN
                              (breathing heavily)
                         You're beautiful.  It's okay.  I 
                         won't hurt you.  It's okay.

                                     THELMA
                              (struggling)
                         Stop it!  Goddamnit, I mean it!  
                         Louise is gonna wonder where I am.  
                         Let go!

                                     HARLAN
                         Louise is alright.

               LOUISE

               is now standing outside the door of the Silver Bullet.  She 
               is looking around.

               HARLAN

               is pulling at Thelma's clothes.  Thelma gets one of her arms 
               free and hits him hard in the face.  He hits her back and 
               grabs her face, squeezing it hard.

                                     HARLAN
                         Don't you hit me!  Don't you fucking 
                         hit me!

               There is no trace of friendliness in his face now.  He looks 
               mean and dangerous.  He lets go of her face and pins her 
               arms behind her.  He holds both of her arms with one hand.

                                     HARLAN
                         You just shut up.

               With his free hand, he reaches down and starts to pull her 
               dress up.  Thelma is still struggling and there are tears 
               running down her face.

                                     THELMA
                         Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.

                                     HARLAN
                         Shut up.

               He turns her around, pushing her face down onto the back of 
               the car.  He holds both her arms in one hand and continues 
               pulling her dress up over her hips.  He starts to undo his 
               pants as we hear the CRUNCH of gravel.

                                     LOUISE (O.S.)
                         Let her go.

                                     HARLAN
                         Get lost.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise!

               TIGHT SHOT of the barrel of Thelma's gun being pressed into 
               the nape of Harlan's neck.  Louise's thumb pulls back the 
               hammer.

                                     LOUISE
                         You let her go, you fat fucking 
                         asshole, or I'm gonna splatter your 
                         ugly face all over this nice car.

               Harlan slowly raises his hands in the air, and Thelma darts 
               out, pulling her dress down.

                                     HARLAN
                         Now, calm down.  We were just havin' 
                         a little fun.

               Louise glances at Thelma.  Thelma shakes her head no.

                                     LOUISE
                         Looks like you've got a real fucked 
                         up idea of fun.  Now turn around.

               Louise starts to back away, but the gun is still close to 
               his face.  His pants are undone in the front.  She is still 
               backing away with the gun raised.  Thelma is inching away as 
               well.

                                     LOUISE
                         Just for the future, when a woman's 
                         crying like that, she's not having 
                         any fun!

               Louise lowers the gun and stares at him for a second.  Then 
               she turns and walks away.  Thelma does, too.

                                     HARLAN
                              (pulling up his pants)
                         Bitch.  I should have gone ahead and 
                         fucked her.

               Louise stops in her tracks.

                                     LOUISE
                         What did you say?

                                     HARLAN
                         I said suck my cock.

               Louise takes two long strides back towards him, raises the 
               gun and FIRES a bullet into his face.  We hear his body HIT 
               the gravel parking lot.  LOUISE'S POV.  The car behind him 
               is splattered with blood.  Thelma and Louise are both silent.  
               We hear the SOUND of the nightclub in the distance.  Louise 
               lowers the gun.

                                     THELMA
                         Oh my God.

                                     LOUISE
                         Get the car.

                                     THELMA
                         Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.

                                     LOUISE
                         Get the car!

               Thelma runs to get the car.

                                     LOUISE
                              (quietly, to herself)
                         You watch your mouth, buddy.

               Thelma comes careening up in reverse.  Louise hops in and 
               Thelma PEELS OUT, spraying gravel.  As they speed out of the 
               parking lot back to the road, we hear MUSIC blaring from the 
               nightclub.  They hit the main road with tires SQUEALING.

                         Get back to the interstate.

               Louise lifts her hand and notices she is still holding the 
               gun.

                                     THELMA
                         Shit!  I... I, which way?

                                     LOUISE
                         West.  Left.

               EXT.  CAR - DISTANCING SHOT - NIGHT

               They get onto the interstate going west.

               TRAVELING SHOT FROM BEHIND -- VARIOUS DRIVING SHOTS

               INT.  CAR - NIGHT

               Louise picks up the handkerchief from the car seat and wipes 
               the gun off.  Her movements are as if in slow motion.  She 
               puts the gun under the seat.  Thelma is watching her.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise.

               Louise does not answer.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise.  Where are we going?

                                     LOUISE
                              (shaking)
                         I don't know, Thelma!  I don't know!  
                         Just shut up a minute so I can think.

               Thelma starts to cry quietly.

                                     THELMA
                         Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, 
                         I think we should tell the police.

                                     LOUISE
                         Tell them what?!  What, Thelma?  
                         What do you think we should tell 
                         them?

                                     THELMA
                         I don't know.  Just tell 'em what 
                         happened.

                                     LOUISE
                         Which part?

                                     THELMA
                         All of it.  That he tried to rape 
                         me.

                                     LOUISE
                         Only about a hundred people saw you 
                         cheek to goddamn cheek with him all 
                         night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe 
                         that?!  We just don't live in that 
                         kind of world.  Pull over!

               EXT.  INTERSTATE - NIGHT

               Thelma pulls off to the side of the road.  Louise gets out 
               and starts to walk around the car.  She stops when she gets 
               to the back of the car, and she is sick.  Thelma waits in 
               the car and moves over to the passenger side.  Louise gets 
               in the driver's side.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise... Are you alright?

               Louise rests her head on the steering wheel.

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh Christ.
                              (to Thelma)
                         Thelma.

               Thelma doesn't hear.

                                     LOUISE
                         Thelma.

               Thelma looks at her blankly, without answering.

                                     LOUISE
                         I've gotta stop for a minute.  I've 
                         got to get it together.  I'm gonna 
                         find a place to get a cup of coffee 
                         and I'm gonna sit down for a second.  
                         Do you want to come?

               Thelma's head moves almost imperceptibly.  Louise studies 
               Thelma's face.

                                     LOUISE
                         Is that yes?  Are you up to this?

               Again, Thelma slightly moves her head in a nod.  Louise puts 
               the car in gear and pulls OUT OF SHOT.

               EXT.  TRUCK STOP - RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               The green '66 T-Bird pulls into a modern truck stop and parks.  
               Louise turns to Thelma.

                                     LOUISE
                         We gotta be inconspicuous.  Do you 
                         know what that means?

                                     THELMA
                         Yes.

                                     LOUISE
                         It means you don't talk to anybody.  
                         You don't draw attention to yourself 
                         in any way.  Do you understand that?

               Again, she twitches more than nods.

                                     LOUISE
                         Tell me you understand that.

               Thelma nods more firmly now.  She understands.

               VARIOUS POV SHOTS of truck drivers seeing Thelma and Louise 
               wind their way towards the restaurant portion of the coffee 
               shop.  They look small and incongruous with the surroundings.

               INT.  TRUCK STOP - TIGHT SHOT - WAITRESS' HANDS - 4 A.M.

               slamming dirty coffee cups from the counter into a bus tray 
               underneath the counter.  REVEAL Louise and Thelma sitting at 
               the counter.  Louise is looking at a map.  The car is parked 
               outside, near the door.

                                     LOUISE
                              (halfway to herself)
                         We have to think this through.  We 
                         have to be smart.  Now is not the 
                         time to panic.  If we panic now, 
                         we're done for.  Nobody saw it.  
                         Nobody knows it was us.  We're still 
                         okay.  Now all we have to do is just 
                         figure out our next move.

                                     THELMA
                         Our next move?  I'll say one thing, 
                         Louise.  This is some vacation.  I 
                         sure am having a good time.  This is 
                         real fun.

                                     LOUISE
                         If you weren't so concerned with 
                         having a good time, we wouldn't be 
                         here right now.

                                     THELMA
                         Just what is that supposed to mean?

                                     LOUISE
                         It means shut up, Thelma.

                                     THELMA
                         So this is all my fault, is it.

               Louise looks at Thelma for a long time.

                                     LOUISE
                         Just shut up.

               The Waitress comes and fills their coffee cups.

               Thelma stands up to go to the bathroom.  She grabs her purse 
               from the counter, and the strap catches on her coffee cup 
               and it falls to the floor with a CRASH.  All heads turn and 
               look at her.

                                     THELMA
                         I have to go to the bathroom.  I...  
                         Sorry.

               HOLD on Louise.

               EXT.  SILVER BULLET PARKING LOT - 4:00 A.M.

               Police cars are parked around.  The activity has died down.  
               Doors on the coroner's van SLAM shut.  In the back of a police 
               car sits the Waitress with the door open.  A DETECTIVE in a 
               suit leans over the car door with his note pad.

                                     HAL
                         Could you identify 'em, if ya saw

                                     LENA (WAITRESS)
                         Hal, I've told you about twenty times, 
                         yes, I could identify 'em, but neither 
                         one of them was the type to pull 
                         something like this.

                                     HAL
                         Well, you're not exactly an expert 
                         witness, but what makes you so sure?

                         make you an expert on human nature, 
                         then nothin' will, and I could've 
                         told you that Harlan Puckett would 
                         end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot.  
                         I'm just surprised it didn't happen 
                         before now.

                         was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's 
                         husband.  But it wasn't either one 
                         of those two.  The tall one, the 
                         redhead, she left me a huge tip.

                         Hal.  I don't follow the customers 
                         to the parking lot.

                         have to call you in for some more 
                         questioning.

               Lena gets out of the back of the car.

               INT.  PAY PHONE - NIGHT

               Outside the bathroom there is a pay phone.  Thelma picks it 
               up and dials.

                                     THELMA
                              (into phone)
                         Collect from Thelma.

               There is no answer.

               VARIOUS SHOTS of the interior of the empty Dickinson house:

               THE BEDROOM

               exactly as Thelma left it.  The drawer of the nightstand 
               still open.

               THE NOTE TO DARRYL

               taped to the refrigerator.  The interior of the microwave 
               with a now completely thawed microwave dinner still in the 
               package in a little puddle.

                         Thanks.  I'll try later.

               She hangs up and goes into the bathroom.  As the door closes 
               behind her, Louise comes up with a handful of change and 
               starts putting it into the phone.  She dials a number.  It 
               RINGS for a long time.  She hangs up and goes into the 
               bathroom.  She looks at herself in the mirror.

               She notices a tiny speck on her cheek.  She takes a paper 
               towel and wets it and rubs the spot.  She looks at the towel 
               and there is a bright red streak.

                         Thelma... Come on, Thelma!

               The door of the stall flies open and Thelma comes charging 
               out and heads straight for the door, without even looking at 
               Louise.  Louise charges out after her.  They head out of the 
               restaurant and, THROUGH THE WINDOW, we see them get into the 
               car and drive away.

               EXT.  CAR - DRIVING SHOT - DAWN

               The T-Bird barrels down a fairly empty four-lane highway.

               A truck passes going the other way.

               INT.  CAR - DAWN

               The top is down on the car, and Thelma is slouched on the 
               seat, her hair blowing wildly.

                                     LOUISE
                         We're gonna go to the next town and 
                         stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I 
                         can rest for a while and then figure 
                         out how to get some money.  We're 
                         gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much 
                         money do you have with you?

                                     THELMA
                         What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me 
                         look.

               Thelma is rummaging through her purse.  She finds her wallet 
               and takes it out.  Thelma finds some bills stuffed in the 
               change compartment and takes them out.  She straightens the 
               money out.

                         Sixty-four dollars.

               As she is counting it, one of the bills flies out of her 
               hands.  Thelma's not that good at handling money.

                                     THELMA
                         Umm.  Shit.  Forty-four dollars.

               Louise has not noticed any of this.  She is so intent on her 
               driving.

                                     THELMA
                         I'm cash poor.

                         Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.

               EXT.  MOTEL - ESTABLISHING SHOT - DAY

               The motel is near farms and agricultural areas with crops.

               INT.  MOTEL ROOM - DAY (6 A.M.)

               The curtains are open and we can see the car parked right 
               outside the room.  Thelma is lying on the bed staring up at 
               the ceiling.  Louise is bustling around the room, putting 
               things in drawers.

                                     THELMA
                         Why are you unpacking?  You said we 
                         were just gonna take a nap.

               Louise did not realize she was doing it.

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous.  
                         I gotta figure out what to do.

                                     THELMA
                         Well, when you figure it out, wake 
                         me up.

                                     LOUISE
                         Just what the hell is wrong with 
                         you?

               Louise slams the closet door.  Thelma jumps.

                                     THELMA
                         What do you mean?

                                     LOUISE
                         Why are you actin' like this?

                                     THELMA
                         Actin' like what?!  How am I supposed 
                         to act?  'Scuse me for not knowing 
                         what to do after you blow somebody's 
                         head off!

               They are silent for a moment.

                                     LOUISE
                         You could help me try and figure it 
                         out!  I gotta figure out what to do, 
                         and you could try and help me.

                                     THELMA
                         I suggested we go to the police, but 
                         you didn't like that; so, frankly, 
                         Louise, I'm all out of ideas.

                                     LOUISE
                         Well, what's the big rush, Thelma?  
                         If we just give 'em some time, they'll 
                         come to us...!  Oh Christ.  I'm just 
                         not ready to go to jail yet.  Why 
                         don't you go out to the pool or 
                         something and I'll figure it out...

                                     THELMA
                         Give me the keys.

                                     LOUISE
                         You're not touchin' that car.

                                     THELMA
                         My stuff's in the trunk!  God!  You 
                         care more about that car than you do 
                         about most people.

                                     LOUISE
                         Most people just cause me trouble, 
                         but that car always gets me out of 
                         it.

               INT.  POLICE GARAGE - DAY

               Hal is at the police station where they're dusting the car 
               with Harlan all over it for prints.  Hal looks closely at 
               the back of the car.  He holds his hands over two sets of 
               hand prints.  He moves his hands to the outside of the prints 
               so as not to smear them, and puts his hands on the car.  His 
               face is one inch away from the trunk.  He sees a very clear 
               drop of blood.  It's different than any of the other blood 
               splatters on the car.  He calls the identification technician 
               over and points it out.

                                     HAL
                              (pointing)
                         What's that?

               The I.D. TECH comes over and looks and shrugs his shoulders.

                                     I.D. TECH
                         Blood?

                                     HAL
                         Whose?

                                     I.D. TECH
                         His, I guess...

               Hal makes a face like he suddenly felt a slight toothache.

               He stares at the guy.

                                     HAL
                         You guess?

               Hal takes out a black sharpie and draws a circle around the 
               area of the black smudge and the drop of blood.  He shakes 
               his head slightly.

               EXT.  MOTEL - DAY

               Thelma comes out of the room and walks towards the pool.

               She stops, then decides to go on to the pool.  She lies down 
               in a lounge chair facing the road.

               INT.  MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Louise in the motel room.  She's looking at the phone.  She 
               picks it up and dials it and watches herself in the mirror.  
               She stares as if she's trying to see into herself, see through 
               herself.

               EXT.  MOTEL POOL - DAY

               Thelma arranges herself in a lounge chair, trying desperately 
               to feel like she's on vacation.

                         right now...

               A VOICE interrupts the message:

                                     JIMMY (V.O.)
                         Hello!  I'm here.  Hang on a minute!

               The machine switches OFF.

               INT.  JIMMY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               JIMMY, mid-30's, musician, is standing in the kitchen on the 
               phone.  He's not the type you'd expect Louise to like, not 
               quite straight-looking enough.

                                     LOUISE (V.O.)

               Louise is looking at herself on the phone in the mirror.

               She is very choked up.

                                     JIMMY (V.O.)

                         time no see.

                                     JIMMY (V.O.)
                         Louise, honey... Where are you?  You 
                         sound funny.

               Louise is still looking at herself in the mirror, as if she's 
               never seen herself before.

                                     LOUISE
                         I am funny.  I'm real funny.

                                     JIMMY (V.O.)
                         Are you in town?  This sounds long 
                         distance.

                                     LOUISE
                         No, I'm out of town.  I'm in... I'm 
                         in real deep shit, Jimmy.  Deep shit 
                         Arkansas.

                                     JIMMY (V.O.)
                         Louise, just tell me what the hell 
                         is going on here!  I come back, nobody 
                         knows where you are.  Is Thelma with 
                         you?  Darryl's been callin' here 
                         every half-hour sayin' he's gonna 
                         kill you both when you get back, 
                         he's goin' nuts.  I don't envy her 
                         if she is.

               INT.  JIMMY'S APARTMENT - DAY

               Jimmy is shocked by the gravity of her tone of voice.  He 
               realizes this is very serious.

                                     JIMMY

                         Of course.  Of course!  Where?  Can't 
                         I bring it to you?  For God's sake, 
                         baby, please, just tell me what's 
                         happened, what could possibly be so 
                         bad?

               Thelma by the pool.  A car SCREECHES, a loud horn HONKS.

               Thelma bolts upright and grabs her sundress and dashes to 
               the car.  She jumps in over the door.  She's in a mild state 
               of shock.

               Hal is in the office talking to his superior.  He stands in 
               front of the desk with his hands in his pockets while his 
               MAJOR sits behind the desk looking troubled.

                         All we know is there were two women 
                         in a green T-Bird convertible that 
                         turned left out of the parking lot, 
                         going real fast.  We're trying to

                         Even if they didn't do it, it times 
                         out that they most likely witnessed 
                         it.  I want somebody to at least 
                         talk to 'em.  Put out an APB with a 
                         description and see what we get back.

                         When you talk to him, you cannot say

                         I'm... I'm with Louise.  We're in 
                         the mountains, we're...

                              (interrupting)
                         What in the hell do you think you're 
                         doing?  Have you lost your goddamn 
                         mind?!  Is that it?  I leave for 
                         work and you take complete leave of 
                         your senses?

                         Darryl... baby... Darryl, calm down 
                         now, honey.  Please don't get so 
                         mad.  I can explain...

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Darryl is mad, but he's still watching the game.

                                     DARRYL
                         Hold on.  Hold on a minute, damnit.

               He covers the mouthpiece and watches a play where "his team" 
               fumbles the ball.  This only makes him madder.  He puts the 
               phone back to his ear in time to hear Thelma say:

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                         ...only for one day and we'll be 
                         back tomorrow night.

                                     DARRYL
                         No you won't.  You'll be back today.  
                         Now!  You get your ass back here, 
                         Thelma, now, Goddamnit.  Thelma, do 
                         you understand me?

               Thelma is trying not to cry.  She's trying to be strong.

                                     THELMA
                         Darryl, please... You're my husband, 
                         not my father, Darryl.

                         That does it!  That Louise is nothin' 
                         but a bad influence.  If you're not 
                         back here tonight, Goddamnit, 
                         Thelma... well, I just don't wanna 
                         say...

               Neither one of them say anything for a moment.

                                     DARRYL
                         Thelma?

                         Darryl.

                                     DARRYL (V.O.)
                         What?

                                     THELMA
                         Go fuck yourself.

               She hangs up on him.

               EXT.  COUNTRY STORE - DAY

               Thelma has tears running down her face and she is watching 
               the ground as she storms back to the car.  So she makes a 
               loud grunt as she slams into someone that she did not see.

               Both people are knocked back a few steps from the force of 
               the collision.

                                     HITCHHIKER
                         Whoa!  Excuse me!  Miss, are you 
                         alright?

               Thelma nods her head "yes," but tears continue.  Her crying 
               is silent.

                                     HITCHHIKER
                         Is there anything I can do?

               Thelma shakes her head "no." She tries to control her tears.  
               She notices how blue his eyes are.

                                     THELMA
                         No.  Thanks.  Sorry.

               THELMA

               collects herself as she walks back to the car.  She gets in 
               and is drying her eyes, looking in the side mirror.  In the 
               mirror she sees the Hitchhiker come back around from the 
               side of the building.  He is several feet behind the car, 
               and she watches him as he removes his long-sleeved shirt and 
               stuffs it into his duffel bag.  Now he is just in T-shirt 
               and jeans.  He looks good.  Really good.  She watches in the 
               mirror as he picks up his stuff and heads towards the road.  
               She can see him as he's walking.  He stops.  He's thinking.  
               He heads over to the car.

                                     HITCHHIKER
                         Would you mind me asking which 
                         direction you and your friend are 
                         going?  I'm trying to get back to 
                         school and my ride fell through, so 
                         I'm kinda stuck.  Are you going my 
                         way?

               Thelma doesn't know what to do.

                                     THELMA
                         Umm.  I think we're going to Oklahoma 
                         City.  But I'm not sure.

                                     HITCHHIKER
                         Do you think you could... I mean, I 
                         could help pay for gas.

               Thelma knows Louise isn't going to like this.

                                     THELMA
                         Ummm.  Well, see, it's not really up 
                         to me.  It's not my car.  Umm, we'll 
                         have to ask my friend, but she'll 
                         probably say no.  She's a little 
                         uptight.

                                     HITCHHIKER
                         Well.  Maybe we better not ask her.  
                         But thank you anyway.

               Now she wants him to come.  He starts to walk away from the 
               car.

                                     THELMA
                         Well, we can ask her.  That won't 
                         hurt.

               Just then Louise comes out of the store.  She sees Thelma 
               talking to this guy and, for one moment, stops dead in her 
               tracks as she takes this in, then continues toward the car.  
               Although her face is basically expressionless, we see that 
               it's possible she might kill Thelma.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise, this young man is on his way 
                         back to school and needs a ride, and 
                         I thought since...

                                     LOUISE
                         It's probably not a good idea.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise.

               The Hitchhiker just nods and starts walking towards the road.

                                     HITCHHIKER
                         Y'all have a nice day.  Drive safe.

               The guy does seem really nice and Thelma is really frustrated 
               that Louise wouldn't give him a ride, but decides not to 
               confront her.

                                     THELMA
                         See how polite he is?  He was really 
                         nice.

               Louise lowers the top and backs the car out.  They watch him 
               walk away.

               Louise pulls out of the parking lot onto the road.  They 
               pass the Hitchhiker.  Thelma waves.

                                     HITCHHIKER
                              (to Thelma)
                         You cheer up now!

               She turns around in the seat to continue waving.  He smiles 
               and waves.  They drive down the road.  TIGHT SHOT of the 
               Hitchhiker as the smile fades from his face.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Thelma looking sulky.

                         I wish we could've brought him with 
                         us.

                         What did Darryl say?

                                     THELMA
                              (sarcastically)
                         He said "Okay, Thelma.  I just wanted 
                         to know you were alright.  I hope 
                         you're havin' a good time.  You sure 
                         deserve one after puttin' up with me 
                         all the time.  I love you, honey."

               Louise doesn't say anything.

               Names are scrolling by as Hal stares blankly at the screen.  
               We see the name LOUISE ELIZABETH SAWYER scroll past.  It 
               means nothing to Hal.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

               It's twenty minutes later.  They are clear of the town.  
               Thelma is like a dog with a bone.  She just won't let it 
               drop.

                                     THELMA
                         I just don't see what it would hurt 
                         just to give somebody a ride.  Did 
                         you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't 
                         have a cute butt.  You could park a 
                         car in the shadow of his ass.

                                     LOUISE
                         I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood 
                         for company right now.  Here.  Take 
                         this map.  I need you to find all 
                         the secondary roads to Mexico from 
                         Oklahoma City.  I think we should 
                         stay off the interstates.  We're too 
                         conspicuous.

                                     THELMA
                              (taking map)
                         Well, it looks like we can get on 
                         this road 81 that heads down towards 
                         Dallas, then cut over to...

                              (interrupting)
                         I don't want to go that way.  Find a 
                         way that we don't have to go through 
                         Texas.

                              (looking at map)
                         Wait.  What?  You want to go to Mexico 
                         from Oklahoma and you don't want to 
                         go through Texas?

                                     LOUISE
                         You know how I feel about Texas...  
                         We're not going that way.

                                     THELMA
                         I know, Louise, but we're running 
                         for our lives!  Don't you think you 
                         could make an exception just this 
                         once?!  I mean, look at the map.  
                         The only thing between Oklahoma and 
                         Mexico is Texas!

                                     LOUISE
                         Thelma!  I'm not gonna talk about 
                         this!  Now find another way or give 
                         me the goddamn map and I will!  You 
                         understand?

                                     THELMA
                         No, Louise.  How come you never said 
                         what happened?

               Louise is completely unreasonable on this subject and Thelma 
               is totally puzzled by Louise's reaction but is reluctant to 
               press her further.

                                     LOUISE
                         I... I just... I just don't think 
                         it's the place I wanna get caught 
                         for doin' something like... if you 
                         blow a guy's head off with his pants 
                         down, believe me, Texas is the last 
                         place you wanna get caught!  Trust 
                         me!  Now, I said, I don't wanna talk 
                         about it!!

               Louise looks very shaken up.  She keeps her eyes on the road 
               but she's holding the steering wheel so tightly, her knuckles 
               are white.  She does not look at Thelma.  Suddenly she reaches 
               over and locks her door.  Thelma flinches imperceptibly at 
               this gesture.

                         Okay.  We'll go around Texas to get 
                         to Mexico.  This is crazy.

               EXT.  ROAD - FARMLAND - DAY

               Two Harley-Davidson bikes tool past, driven by a couple of 
               ex-hippies from the 60's.  The Hitchhiker is on the back of 
               one, and he waves to them as they go by.  Thelma waves back 
               enthusiastically.

                                     THELMA
                         I'll tell you what.  He is gooood 
                         lookin'.

               Louise pops a TAPE into the cassette player.

               EXT.  LOUISE'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

               Hal walks up the sidewalk past a couple of elderly people 
               sitting outside, to the door of an apartment complex and 
               knocks.

               INT.  LOUISE'S APARTMENT - DAY

               VARIOUS SHOTS of Louise's empty apartment.

               There are pictures of Louise and Thelma in high school.

               The kitchen is spotless and nothing is out on the counters.

               HER BED

               is unwrinkled, perfect, and next to it on her nightstand is 
               a picture of Jimmy and her in a small heart shaped frame.

               Everything is extremely neat and orderly.

               EXT.  LOUISE'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

               Hal is walking back down the sidewalk past the old people.

               He stops, turns around and goes back to them.  We see him 
               stand and talk to them.

               OVER MUSIC:

               INT.  CAR - DAY

               Thelma and Louise are singing along with the MUSIC.

                              (pointing)

               EXT.  CROSSROADS - DAY

               Hitchhiker standing on the side of the road.  Thelma looks 
               at Louise pleadingly.  Louise's car pulls over and he hops 
               in the back seat.  An animated Thelma turns around backwards 
               in the front seat to face him.

               INT./ EXT.  COFFEE SHOP - DAY

               Hal walks into the coffee shop where Louise works.  VARIOUS 
               SHOTS of him talking to other employees.  Albert, waitress, 
               etc.  Some cover their mouths as they recognize police 
               sketches of Louise and Thelma.  The Day Manager comes over, 
               looks at the pictures and talks to Hal.

               INT.  CAR

               Thelma passing out beef jerky and Wild Turkey to Hitchhiker 
               and Louise.

               EXT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Hal's unmarked detective car pulls up in front of Thelma's 
               house.  A Corvette, completely customized with everything, 
               sits in the driveway.

               INT.  CAR

               Hitchhiker leans over resting his chin on the back of the 
               front seat.

                                     THELMA
                         So J.D., what are you studying in 
                         school?

                                     J.D.
                         Human nature.  I'm majoring in 
                         behavioral science.

                                     LOUISE
                         And whaddya wanna be when ya grow 
                         up?

                         A waiter.

               Louise laughs.  He has charmed her too.

               EXT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Hal is walking up the sidewalk as the front door flies open 
               to reveal a drunk Darryl in Hawaiian shorts, necklaces and a 
               beer can in his hand.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Hal and Darryl in den.  The TV DRONES in the b.g.

                         What?!

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         What?!!

               EXT.  RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY

                                     J.D.
                              (to Thelma)
                         So how come you don't have any kids?

                                     THELMA
                         Darryl, that's my husband, he says 
                         he's not ready.  He's still too much 
                         of a kid himself.  He prides himself 
                         on being infantile.

                                     LOUISE
                         He's got a lot to be proud of.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise and Darryl don't get along.

                                     LOUISE
                         That's puttin' it mildly.

                                     THELMA
                         She thinks he's a pig.

                                     LOUISE
                         He's a real piece o' work.  I wish 
                         you could meet him.

                                     J.D.
                         Did you get married real young?

                                     THELMA
                         Twenty-four isn't young.  I'd already 
                         been goin' out with him ten years 
                         when we got married.  I've never 
                         been with anybody but Darryl.

                                     J.D.
                         Well, if you don't mind me sayin' 
                         so, he sounds like a real asshole.

                                     THELMA
                         It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most 
                         of the time I just let it slide.

               J.D. is looking down the road, way off in the distance.

                                     J.D.
                         Better slow down.  That's a cop.

               Louise looks down the road and sees a highway patrol car 
               coming down the road towards them.  She does not look alarmed 
               but veers off the road into a "rest area" drive that has 
               trees and shrubs that obscure the view from the road.

               She glides along as the cop car passes on the other side 
               without seeing them.

               Louise glides right back onto the road as if nothing unusual 
               has happened at all.  They realize they have not been spotted.  
               J.D. and Louise look at each other.

                                     J.D.
                         Maybe you got a few too many parking 
                         tickets?

                                     LOUISE
                         We'll take you on to Oklahoma City, 
                         then you'd best be on your way.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Hal is on the phone to the FBI man.  Darryl is sitting on a 
               chair looking dazed.  Other law enforcement types roam around 
               the house.

                                     HAL
                         The prints on the trunk of the car 
                         match those of Thelma Dickinson.

               INT.  FBI OFFICE - DAY

               MAX STRATTON, an FBI MAN in his early forties, is looking at 
               the ident-a-kit drawings of Louise and Thelma.

                                     MAX
                         Well I'll be damned.  Isn't that 
                         strange.

                                     HAL
                         And the husband says a gun is missing.  
                         She took a lot of stuff.  It looks 
                         like she maybe planned on being gone 
                         a while.  The strange thing is, her 
                         husband said she would never touch 
                         that gun.  He got it for her 'cause 
                         he's out late a lot, but he said 
                         she'd never touch it, wouldn't learn 
                         to shoot it, just left it in a drawer 
                         for years.

                         A .38.

                         way to some guy's cabin and they 
                         never showed up.  We're lookin'.  We 
                         hope you're lookin' too.

               EXT.  FLATLANDS - ROAD - DUSK

               The T-Bird barrels down the road at high speed.

               EXT.  SHAW'S SIESTA MOTEL - DUSK

               Louise, Thelma, and J.D. pull into the motel parking lot.

                                     LOUISE
                         I just gotta run in for a minute.

               Louise looks at J.D. in the back seat and takes the keys out 
               of the ignition.

                                     LOUISE
                         You two better go on and say your 
                         goodbyes.

               Louise gets out of the car and goes inside.

               INT.  MOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT

               An older WOMAN behind the counter is looking at a computer 
               screen.

                                     LOUISE
                         Louise Elizabeth Sawyer.  Are you 
                         sure?

                         all.

               Louise turns and sees Thelma crawl over into the back seat 
               with J.D.

                                     LOUISE
                         Nothing under peaches?  Check again 
                         under peaches.

                         Naw, nothin' under peaches neither.

               A MAN comes up behind Louise and stands close behind her.

                                     MAN (JIMMY)
                         Did you say Peaches?!  Why that's

                         won, Don.

               He drops an envelope in front of her.  Louise is startled 
               and turns around quickly.

                                     JIMMY
                         Hey, peaches.

                                     JIMMY
                              (to Woman)
                         Can we get another room?  Just put 
                         it on my credit card.

               EXT.  MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Louise and Jimmy walk outside and catch Thelma sitting very 
               close to J.D.  Thelma sees Jimmy and is so startled she 
               screams and involuntarily slams herself across the back seat 
               to the other side of the car.  She tries to look nonchalant.

                                     THELMA
                         Jimmy!  Hello, stranger.  What in 
                         the world are you doin' here?

                                     JIMMY
                         Ask me no questions, I'll tell you 
                         no lies.

                                     THELMA
                         Good answer.  Same goes double for 
                         me.

                                     JIMMY
                         Who's your friend?

               J.D. is climbing out of the car, looking very uncomfortable.

                                     THELMA
                         This is J.D.  He's a student.  We're 
                         just givin' him a ride to... to here.  
                         Louise said we could bring him here 
                         and then he'd have to go.  And that's 
                         what he's doin'.  He's goin'.  Aren't 
                         you, J.D.?

                                     J.D.
                         Yup.  Thanks for the ride.  You all 
                         take care.

               He quickly turns and walks away toward the road.

                                     THELMA
                              (watching him)
                         Yup.  That's him goin'.  I love to 
                         watch him go.

                                     LOUISE
                              (to Jimmy)
                         Thelma kinda took to him.

               Jimmy is smiling.

                                     JIMMY
                              (to Thelma)
                         Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.  
                         You can go on in and take a nice 
                         cold shower.

                                     THELMA
                         Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a 
                         wild woman.

                                     JIMMY
                         I always knew that.

                                     THELMA
                         A regular outlaw.

               Louise shoots Thelma a look.  The three of them drive around 
               to the back of the motel.  Thelma turns and looks at the 
               road.  J.D. is standing there.  He blows her a kiss.

               EXT.  MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               They stop in front of the motel rooms and the three of them 
               climb out of the car.

                                     LOUISE
                         Let me just go in and freshen up for 
                         a minute.  I need to wash my face, 
                         you know.

               Thelma is taking their luggage out of the trunk.

                                     JIMMY
                         Okay, honey.  I don't want to rush 
                         you.  I just wanna talk to you and...
                              (whispering)
                         ...be alone with you.  I'll just be 
                         in my room, 115, you just come on 
                         down when you're ready.

               Jimmy helps carry the luggage to Thelma's room.  He stops at 
               the door.

                                     JIMMY
                         I'll be waiting.

               Louise smiles at him quizzically as if she can't believe 
               he's acting this way.  He turns on his heel and slinks away.

                                     THELMA
                         I don't care what you say about him.  
                         The boy has got it bad.

                                     LOUISE
                         He's always got it bad as long as 
                         I'm running in the other direction.  
                         Don't be fooled, he's no different 
                         than any other guy.  He knows how to 
                         chase and that's it.  Once he's caught 
                         you, he don't know what to do.  So 
                         he runs away.

                                     THELMA
                         I heard that.

               INT.  MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               They close the door to their room.  Louise sets the envelope 
               of money on the table.

                                     LOUISE
                              (indicating envelope)
                         Our future.

               Louise gets her purse and starts taking out her makeup.

               She stands very close to the mirror.  She is putting on lip 
               liner.  Thelma is watching.

                                     THELMA
                         So what are you gonna tell him?

                                     LOUISE
                         Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a 
                         thing.  The least I can do is not 
                         make him an accessory any more than 
                         he already is.

                                     THELMA
                         You are so sweet to that guy, you 
                         really are.  Imagine not wanting to 
                         drag him into this.  He is a lucky 
                         man.

               Louise is still putting on her makeup, making sure it's 
               perfect.

                                     LOUISE
                         I didn't ask him to come!  It's like 
                         I said, Thelma, he just loves the 
                         chase.

                                     THELMA
                         Well boy, he's got his work cut out 
                         for him now, don't he?

                                     LOUISE
                         Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard 
                         enough as it is.  Just let me get 
                         this part over with.  Now stay here 
                         and guard the money.  If there's any 
                         problem I'm in room 115.

                                     THELMA
                         I won't wait up.

               Louise turns to face Thelma.

                                     LOUISE
                         How do I look?

                                     THELMA
                         You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn 
                         vision of loveliness, you always 
                         are.

                                     LOUISE
                         Have another drink, Thelma.

               Louise walks out the door.

                                     THELMA
                         Good idea.

               EXT.  MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               It's raining out.  Louise goes to Jimmy's room.

               Louise knocks on the door to room 115.  The door opens 
               slightly and one red rose pops out.

                                     LOUISE
                         Hello...

                                     JIMMY
                              (in a falsetto voice)
                         Who is it?

                                     LOUISE
                         It's me.

               The following eleven roses are held out the door, then Louise 
               is yanked inside and we hear her shriek with LAUGHTER.

               INT.  THELMA'S MOTEL ROOM - EVENING

               Thelma has taken a shower and is dressed in cut-offs and a T-
               shirt.  Her hair is still damp but she looks better than she 
               did when she arrived.  Thelma is fixing a drink of Wild Turkey 
               and Diet 7-Up in one of the motel room glasses.  There is a 
               KNOCK on the door.  She stops what she is doing and is 
               completely still.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise?

               Another KNOCK.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise, is that you?

                                     J.D. (O.S.)
                              (through the door)
                         Thelma?  It's me.

               Thelma opens the door and there stands J.D., soaking wet 
               from the rain pouring down behind him.

                                     J.D.
                         I just thought I... I know I'm 
                         supposed to be gone, but...

               He's kind of looking over towards the road.  He's still 
               slightly shy.

                                     J.D.
                         I'm not havin' much luck gettin' a 
                         ride.

               He notices looking past her into the room that Louise isn't 
               there.  Thelma just stands there looking at him.

                                     J.D.
                         Well, I guess I'd better...

                                     THELMA
                         Wait...!  Um, where ya going?

                                     J.D.
                         I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are 
                         you doin'?

                                     THELMA
                         I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a 
                         shower.

                                     J.D.
                         That sounds nice.

                                     THELMA
                         Well, you wanna use the shower?

               You can tell he does want to but doesn't want to say so.

               So instead he just kind of stands there with a reticent grin 
               on his face.

                                     J.D.
                         Oh.  I... where's Louise?

                                     THELMA
                         She's off with Jimmy, that's her 
                         boyfriend.

                                     J.D.
                         That's lonely for you, I guess.  I 
                         always think of motel rooms as lonely.

               Thelma pretends like she's had a lot of experience with this 
               sort of thing.

                                     THELMA
                              (letting him in the 
                              door)
                         Oh, yes, well, they can be.

               INT.  JIMMY'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Jimmy is pouring champagne into Louise's glass.  There are a 
               dozen roses in a vase on the table.  He pours for himself as 
               he sits as close to Louise as possible.

                                     JIMMY
                         Now, my little coconut, what seems 
                         to be the trouble here?  Tell Daddy 
                         everything.

                                     LOUISE
                              (cringing)
                         Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it 
                         kind of gives me the creeps when you 
                         do that...

                                     JIMMY
                         Okay, okay, just tell me what's the 
                         trouble.

               Louise just looks at him for a minute.

                                     LOUISE
                         Jimmy, I'm not gonna tell ya what 
                         the trouble is.  Someday soon you'll 
                         understand why I can't.  But I won't 
                         tell ya, so don't ask me.

               Jimmy is once again shocked by how serious she is.

                                     JIMMY
                              (almost at a loss for 
                              words)
                         Okay, peaches, okay.  But can I ask 
                         you one thing?

                                     LOUISE
                         Maybe.

                                     JIMMY
                         Does it have something to do with 
                         another guy?  Are you in love with 
                         him?

                                     LOUISE
                         It's nothin' like that.

                                     JIMMY
                              (exploding)
                         Then what?!  What, goddamnit, Louise!  
                         Where the fuck are you going?  Are 
                         you just leaving for fucking ever?  
                         What, did you fuckin' murder somebody 
                         or what?!

               Louise spills her champagne.

                                     LOUISE
                         Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll 
                         leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'!

                                     JIMMY
                              (calming down)
                         Alright, alright.  I'm sorry.

               They both take a second to regain their composure.

                                     JIMMY
                         Can I just ask you one other thing?

                                     LOUISE
                         Maybe.

               Jimmy pulls a little black box out of his pocket.

                                     JIMMY
                         Will you wear this?

               He hands Louise the box.  She opens it and it is a diamond 
               ring.  Louise is flabbergasted.

                                     JIMMY
                         Will you at least see how it fits?

                                     LOUISE
                         Jimmy... it's beautiful!

                                     JIMMY
                         You didn't see that one comin', did 
                         ya?

               INT.  THELMA'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               J.D. is out of the shower standing in front of the mirror 
               wearing only his jeans, the top button of which is still 
               undone and no shirt.  He has an incredible physique.  He 
               also has a tattoo on his shoulder of the homemade variety.  
               Thelma has gone and bought cheese crackers and peanuts from 
               a vending machine and is into her second Wild Turkey and 7-
               Up.  She sits on the bed, watching him in the mirror.  He 
               definitely looks better with his shirt off.

               She suddenly feels awkward and stands up.

                                     THELMA
                         You wanna drink?

               INT.  JIMMY'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Louise has the engagement ring on her finger.  It's really 
               beautiful.

                                     JIMMY
                         So whaddya think.  I mean... I 
                         could... uh... get a job.  Of some 
                         kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me 
                         that for years, right?

                                     LOUISE
                         Why now, Jimmy?

                                     JIMMY
                              (this is hard for him)
                         'Cause, Louise.  I don't want to 
                         lose you.  And for some reason I get 
                         the feelin' you're about to split.  
                         Permanently.

               Louise doesn't know how to respond.  She struggles for a 
               reply.

                                     LOUISE
                         Jimmy, we've gone all these years... 
                         we never made it work.  We're not 
                         gonna be able to just... I'm not...  
                         What kind of job, honey?  Can you 
                         see it.  I can't.

               Jimmy doesn't answer right away.  He's trying to see it.

                                     JIMMY
                         I'm the one... I never made it work.  
                         I just... It's not that I don't love 
                         you.  It's not that.  I just never 
                         thought I'd be thirty-six years old 
                         and I never thought... I don't know 
                         what I thought.  What do you want, 
                         darlin'.  What do you want me to do.

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't know.  It doesn't even matter 
                         anymore.  I just want you to be 
                         happy... It's not that I don't love 
                         you either.  But Jimmy, your timing 
                         couldn't be worse.

               Jimmy does not really understand why this is happening.

                                     JIMMY
                         Are you just doin' this to punish 
                         me?

                                     LOUISE
                         Believe me, the last thing I want is 
                         for you to get punished.

               INT.  THELMA'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Thelma has poured a drink for J.D. who's sitting on the edge 
               of the bed.  She walks over and hands it to him and as she 
               does, he takes the drink with one hand and her hand with the 
               other.  He sets the drink down on the nightstand and holds 
               her hand with both of his.  He closely studies her wedding 
               ring.  He suddenly looks up at her and gazes at her just as 
               intently.  He slowly shakes his head as he removes her ring 
               as if to say, "This is not right for you.  This isn't going 
               to work."  He looks at the ring as he moves it through space 
               finally stopping when the ring is directly over his drink.  
               He drops it in.  He looks back at Thelma and smiles as if to 
               say, "There.  Now don't you feel better?"  He smartly kisses 
               her hand.

               INT.  JIMMY'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Louise and Jimmy are sitting on the edge of the bed.

               Jimmy has put the ring on her finger and they both are looking 
               at it, as Jimmy holds her hand in his.  They both ponder it.

                                     JIMMY
                         It does look good.

               INT.  THELMA'S ROOM - NIGHT

               J.D. is standing on the dresser with a towel tied around his 
               neck like a cape.

                                     J.D.
                         Faster than a speeding green T-Bird, 
                         able to leap tall babes in a single 
                         bound...

               He leaps from the dresser and flies across the room landing 
               on the bed, straddling Thelma.

                                     J.D.
                              (in his deep man's 
                              voice)
                         Hi.  Could I interest you in some 
                         Fuller brushes?

               Thelma has not stopped laughing since he came in the room.

               He is the greatest guy she's ever seen.  He is sniffing her 
               neck like a dog.

                                     THELMA
                              (giggling)
                         Stop, stop, stop!

               Thelma tries to catch her breath.

                                     THELMA
                         Who are you?

               J.D. attacks her again.

                                     J.D.
                         I am the great and powerful Oz...

                                     THELMA
                         J.D.!  Just tell me.  I know you're 
                         not some schoolboy.  Now come on, 
                         nobody ever tells me shit.

                                     J.D.
                         I'm just some guy.  A guy whose parole 
                         officer is probably having a shit 
                         fit right about now.

               Thelma gasps.

                                     THELMA
                         What?!  Parole officer?  You mean 
                         you're a criminal?

                                     J.D.
                         Well, not anymore, Thelma, except 
                         for bustin' parole, I haven't done 
                         one wrong thing.

                                     THELMA
                         What did ya do?

                                     J.D.
                         I'm a robber.

                                     THELMA
                         You're a bank robber?

                                     J.D.
                         Nope.  I've never robbed a bank.

                                     THELMA
                         What?

                                     J.D.
                         Well, I robbed a gas station once, 
                         and I robbed a couple of liquor 
                         stores, and some convenience stores.  
                         And that's it.

                                     THELMA
                         How?

                                     J.D.
                         Well, I was just down on my luck and 
                         it seemed like somethin' I was good 
                         at so I...

                                     THELMA
                              (interrupting)
                         No, I mean how would you do it?  Do 
                         you just sneak in real fast or hide 
                         out till the store closes or what?

                                     J.D.
                         Naw, honey, that would be burglary.  
                         I never got arrested for burglary.  
                         Burglary's for chicken shits.  If 
                         you're gonna rob someone, ya just 
                         have to go right on up to 'em and do 
                         it.  Just take the money.  That's 
                         robbery.  That's a whole 'nother 
                         deal.

                                     THELMA
                         Tell me.

                                     J.D.
                         Well, first you pick your place, 
                         see, then I'd just sit back and watch 
                         it for awhile.  Ya gotta wait for 
                         just the right moment, which is 
                         something you know instinctively, 
                         that can't be taught.  Then I'd waltz 
                         on in...

               J.D. jumps up and picks up a hair dryer and holds it like a 
               gun.  He starts acting it out.

                                     J.D.
                         And I'd say, "Alright, ladies and 
                         gentlemen, let's see who'll win the 
                         prize for keepin' their cool.  Simon 
                         says everybody lie down on the floor.  
                         If nobody loses their head, then 
                         nobody loses their head.  You sir... 
                         You do the honors.  Just empty that 
                         cash into this bag and you'll have 
                         an amazing story to tell all your 
                         friends.  If not, you'll have a tag 
                         on your toe.  You decide." Then I'd 
                         split.  Simple.

                                     THELMA
                         My gosh, you sure gentlemanly about 
                         it.

                                     J.D.
                         I've always believed if done right, 
                         armed robbery doesn't have to be a 
                         totally unpleasant experience.

                                     THELMA
                         God.  You're a real live outlaw!

                                     J.D.
                         I may be the outlaw, but you're the 
                         one stealin' my heart.

                                     THELMA
                         And smooth, boy, you are smooth.

               They kiss passionately.

                                     THELMA
                         You're kinda the best thing that's 
                         happened to me in a long time.

                                     J.D.
                         You're a little angle, you are.

               J.D. turns out the light.

               INT.  JIMMY'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Louise and Jimmy are wrapped in each other's arms, quietly 
               making love.  Through this, Jimmy is ardent.

                                     JIMMY
                         Louise?  I think you are so damn 
                         beautiful.  I mean that.  I always 
                         have.

               She smiles.  Completely.

                                     LOUISE
                              (whispering)
                         I think you're beautiful too.

               EXT.  SIESTA MOTEL - DAWN

               MONTAGE of early morning staff, a truck driver climbing into 
               his cab with a silver thermos, squirrels hopping around on 
               the ground.

               INT.  SIESTA COFFEE SHOP - DAWN

               TIGHT SHOT of coffee beginning to drip into an empty coffee 
               pot.  Louise and Jimmy are sitting in a booth, both on the 
               same side.  They are both playing with their wedding rings.

                                     JIMMY
                         Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I 
                         never found you.  I'll say anything 
                         you want.  We'll find a way to get 
                         you out of this, whatever it is.

                                     LOUISE
                         Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill 
                         that makes you say all the right 
                         stuff?

                                     JIMMY
                         I'm choking on it.

               They sit for a minute.

                                     JIMMY
                         Honey?  Ummm... Do you want me to 
                         come with you?

               They look at each other, into each other and Jimmy can see 
               that Louise is already gone.  Louise is really touched that 
               he asked her that but she knows it's impossible.  She is 
               very kind to him.

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh... now... it's probably not such 
                         a good idea right now.  I'll... catch 
                         up with you later, on down the road.

               In her hand she's been holding the ring in the black box.  
               She puts it on the table and slides it back to him.  He stops 
               her, suddenly.  He covers her hand with his.

                                     JIMMY
                         You keep this!

               Jimmy is trying not to seem upset, so he's completely still.  
               A taxi pulls up outside.

                                     LOUISE
                         Your taxi's here.

               Jimmy pulls her to him and kisses her so passionately that 
               employees in the coffee shop look away.  A cook fans himself 
               with a spatula.  The taxi driver, who can see in, looks at 
               his watch.

                                     JIMMY
                         Are you happy, Louise?  I just want 
                         you to be happy.

               Louise looks at her hand and Jimmy's hand.

                                     LOUISE
                         I'm happy, sweetie.  Happy as I can 
                         be.

               Jimmy gets up and leaves the coffee shop.  Louise watches 
               him go.  A WAITRESS comes over and fills her coffee cup.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Good thing he left when he did.  We 
                         thought we were gonna have to put 
                         out a fire.

               The Waitress chuckles and the other waitresses do too.  Louise 
               waves to Jimmy in the back of the cab.  The cab driver winks 
               at her.  She smiles to herself.

               INT.  THELMA'S MOTEL ROOM - MORNING

               The room is totally trashed.  J.D. and Thelma are both asleep, 
               naked and hanging off either side of the bed.

               J.D. starts to stir...

               INT.  HAL'S BEDROOM - MORNING

               Hal is in bed with is WIFE.  He has to get up.  He is holding 
               his wife in his arms.

                                     HAL
                         Honey?

                                     SARAH
                         Yes, baby?

                                     HAL
                         Do you think you could ever shoot 
                         someone?

                                     SARAH
                         What?

                                     HAL
                         Do you think you could ever think of 
                         a set of circumstances that would 
                         just cause you to haul off and shoot 
                         someone?

                                     SARAH
                         I could shoot your cousin Eddie.

                                     HAL
                         Why?

                                     SARAH
                         Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.

                                     HAL
                         I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a 
                         stranger?

                                     SARAH
                         I don't know, honey.  I guess it 
                         would depend.

                                     HAL
                         On what?

                                     SARAH
                              (trying to picture it)
                         Well, maybe if they were trying to 
                         hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm 
                         sure I could shoot someone if they 
                         tried to hurt one of the children.

                                     HAL
                         Yeah, I could too.  But... I don't 
                         know why I'm even asking you this.  
                         It's just... we can't place anybody 
                         at the scene but these two gals that 
                         everybody swears is sweet as pie.  I 
                         don't know.  I keep hearing words -- 
                         impossible -- inconceivable.  If 
                         just one person would say...

                                     SARAH
                         Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You 
                         just don't shoot someone like that 
                         for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' 
                         for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband 
                         probably got ol' Harlan.

                                     HAL
                         That's what everybody says.  Only 
                         problem is nobody's husband was 
                         unaccounted for that night... Could 
                         you shoot Eddie in the face?  At 
                         point blank range?

                                     SARAH
                              (thinking)
                         In the leg.

                                     HAL
                              (getting up)
                         I gotta go to Little Rock.

               INT.  COFFEE SHOP - MORNING

               Louise is sitting in the booth by herself.  Thelma comes 
               hurrying by.  She looks disheveled but is grinning like an 
               idiot.  She sees Louise and charges into the coffee shop.

               Her energy and volume is several notches higher than the 
               rest of the people in the coffee shop.  There are a couple 
               more customers in there now.  Thelma slides into the booth 
               seated directly across from Louise.

                                     THELMA
                         Hi.

               She is shocked by Thelma's appearance.

                                     LOUISE
                         What happened to your hair?

                                     THELMA
                         Nothing.  It got messed up.

               Louise is studying Thelma closely as Thelma squirms in her 
               seat, barely able to contain herself.

                                     LOUISE
                         What's wrong with you?

                                     THELMA
                         Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?

                                     LOUISE
                         Yes, now that you mention it.  You 
                         seem crazy.  Like you're on drugs.

                                     THELMA
                         Well, I'm not on drugs.  But I might 
                         be crazy.

                                     LOUISE
                              (shaking her head)
                         I don't think I wanna hear what you're 
                         gonna tell me.

               Thelma is just about to shriek when the Waitress comes over 
               and puts a coffee cup on the table and pours some.

               Thelma gets a grip on herself for a moment then loses it as 
               the Waitress goes away.

                                     THELMA
                         Oh my God, Louise!!!  I can't believe 
                         it!  I just really can't believe it!  
                         I mean... whoa!

               Thelma is just laughing hysterically.  Louise suddenly 
               understands.

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.

                                     THELMA
                         I mean I finally understand what all 
                         the fuss is about.   This is just a 
                         whole 'nother ball game!

                                     LOUISE
                         Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  
                         You're making a spectacle.

                                     THELMA
                         You know, Louise, you're supposed to 
                         be my best friend.  You could at 
                         least be a little bit happy for me.  
                         You could at least pretend to be 
                         slightly happy that for once in my 
                         life I have a sexual experience that 
                         isn't completely disgusting.

                                     LOUISE
                         I'm sorry.  I am happy.  I'm very 
                         happy for you.  I'm glad you had a 
                         good time.  It's about time.  Where 
                         is he now?

                                     THELMA
                         Taking a shower.

                                     LOUISE
                         You left that guy alone in the room?

               Louise is getting a bad feeling.  She is already standing up 
               putting money on the table.

                                     LOUISE
                         Where's the money, Thelma?

               Thelma has forgotten all about the money.

                                     THELMA
                         Ummm... it's on the table.  It's 
                         okay.

               They are both leaving the restaurant now.  As they hit the 
               door they both break into a full run.

                                     THELMA
                         I don't remember.

               EXT.  MOTEL PARKING LOT - DAY

               They run across the parking lot around the back to the room.  
               The door is ajar and no one is in the room.  Louise goes in 
               and Thelma stays outside the door.

                                     THELMA
                         Goddamnit!  I've never been lucky!  
                         Not one time!

               Louise comes back outside.  She doesn't say anything.  She 
               is stoic, fighting tears.

                                     THELMA
                         Shit.  That little sonofabitch burgled 
                         me.  I don't believe it.

               Louise sits down on the sidewalk in front of the room.  Thelma 
               comes and sits beside her.  Neither one says anything for a 
               moment.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise?  Are you okay?

               Louise shakes her head no.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise... It's okay.  Louise?  I'm 
                         sorry.  I mean it.

               Louise has seen the end of the tunnel and there is no light.

                                     LOUISE
                         It's not okay, Thelma.  It's 
                         definitely not okay.  None of this 
                         is okay.  What are we going to do 
                         for money?  What are we gonna buy 
                         gas with?  Our good looks?  I mean... 
                         Goddamn, Thelma!

               Louise quietly starts to fall apart.  This causes Thelma to 
               leap into action.

                                     THELMA
                         Come on.  Stand up!  Don't you worry 
                         about it.  I'll take care of it.  
                         Just don't you worry about it.  Get 
                         your stuff.

               Louise is still sitting on the sidewalk.

                                     THELMA
                         Come on!  Damnit, get your stuff and 
                         let's get out of here!

               Louise slowly gets to her feet.

                                     THELMA
                         Move!
                              (to herself)
                         Jesus Christ, take your damn time.

               Thelma is hauling stuff out of the car.

               EXT.  MOTEL PARKING LOT - MORNING

               TIGHT SHOT of rear wheel of green T-Bird LAYING RUBBER out 
               of the motel parking lot.  Thelma and Louise, both looking a 
               little rougher than we've seen so far, drive away.

               EXT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Hal, FBI Man, various other police and detective types, pull 
               up in front of the house.  The front door swings open and 
               there stands Darryl looking like he's been shot out of a 
               cannon.

               EXT.  STREET - DAY

               Louise and Thelma pull into a convenience store.

               Police are tapping the phones, dusting for prints, etc., 
               while Darryl sits motionless in his recliner with a dull 
               expression on his face.

                                     HAL
                              (to Darryl)
                         As you know, we've tapped your phone.  
                         In the event that she calls in.

               Max comes up and joins them as they walk down the hallway.

                                     MAX
                         We're going to leave someone here at 
                         the house in the event that she calls 
                         in.  Someone will be here until we 
                         find them.

                                     HAL
                         The important thing is not to let on 
                         that you know anything.  We want to 
                         try and find out where they are.  
                         Now I don't want to get too personal, 
                         but do you have a good relationship 
                         with your wife?  Are you close with 
                         her?

                                     DARRYL
                         Yeah, I guess.  I mean, I'm about as 
                         close as I can be with a nut case 
                         like that.

                                     MAX
                         Well, if she calls, just be gentle.  
                         Like you're happy to hear from her.  
                         You know, like you really miss her.  
                         Women love that shit.

               EXT.  CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY

               Thelma and Louise are sitting in the car.  They've put all 
               their money together.

                                     LOUISE
                         Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna 
                         make a dent, baby girl.

                                     THELMA
                              (getting out of the 
                              car)
                         Don't worry about it.  You want 
                         anything?

                                     LOUISE
                         No.

               Thelma marches off to the store.  Louise puts a tape in the 
               deck and is listening to loud R&B MUSIC.  She checks herself 
               in the rearview mirror.  She takes her lipstick out and is 
               about to put it on.  She makes eye contact with herself and, 
               instead, throws it out the window, closes her eyes and leans 
               her head back on the seat.  She's in a world of shit.

               Thelma comes trotting out of the store and jumps into the 
               car.

                                     THELMA
                              (breathless)
                         Drive!

               Louise looks at her.

                                     THELMA
                         Drive!  Drive away!

                                     LOUISE
                              (driving away)
                         What happened?

               Thelma opens her purse and exposes a bag full of bills.

                                     LOUISE
                         What?  You robbed the store?  You 
                         robbed the Goddamn store?!

               Thelma shrieks with excitement.  Louise is completely stunned.

                                     THELMA
                         Well!  We needed the money!  It's 
                         not like I killed anybody, for God's 
                         sake.

               Louise shoots her a look.  She puts the car in gear and FLOORS 
               it out of the parking lot.  She is still looking at Thelma 
               as if she has completely lost her mind.

                                     THELMA
                         I'm sorry.  Well, we need the money.  
                         Now we have it.

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh shit, Thelma!!  Shit!  Shit!  
                         Shit!

                                     THELMA
                              (sternly)
                         Now you get a grip, Louise!  Just 
                         drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!

                                     LOUISE
                         Okay.  Shit, Thelma!  What'd you do?  
                         I mean, what did you say?

                                     THELMA
                         Well, I just...

               INT.  POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

               Hal, Max, various other cops, and Darryl all watch as TV 
               plays back VCR TAPE of Thelma in the convenience store pulling 
               a gun.  In perfect lip sync is:

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                         Alright, ladies and gentleman, let's 
                         see who'll win the prize for keepin' 
                         their cool.  Everybody lie down on 
                         the floor.  If nobody loses their 
                         head, then nobody loses their head...

               TIGHT SHOT of Darryl's face going deeper and deeper into a 
               state of shock.  TIGHT SHOTS of Hal, Max, etc., all looking 
               intently at the screen.

               VIDEO IMAGE of Thelma boldly ordering cashier to fill her 
               purse with money.  As he's loading the purse with bills, 
               she's taking beef jerky from the display and putting it in 
               there, too, while she points the gun at the cashier.

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                              (videotape playback)
                         You, sir... You do the honors.  Just 
                         empty that cash into this bag and 
                         you'll have an amazing story to tell 
                         all your friends.  If not, you'll 
                         have a tag on your toe.  You decide.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                              (incredulous)
                         Holy shit.

                         Lemme see the map.

               Louise throws the map across the front seat at Thelma and 
               FLOORS it.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               FADE IN:

               INT.  JIMMY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               Jimmy is entering the apartment building, carrying his 
               overnight bag.  Two men are sitting on the stairs.  They 
               stand as he comes in.  They are plainclothes police.  They 
               show their badges.  He leaves with them.

               EXT.  ROAD - TIGHT SHOT - J.D.'S BACKSIDE - DAY

               made only more prominent by the bulging wallet in his back 
               right pocket.

               J.D. is walking down the road and continues to walk as an 
               Oklahoma State Patrol car pulls up alongside him.  He smiles 
               and gives a friendly wave as they cruise along slowly beside 
               him.  We can see the cop nearest him talking, and then we 
               see J.D. stop walking and set down his duffel bag.  He reaches 
               for his wallet.  It's clear that they have asked for some 
               I.D.

               EXT.  RURAL ROAD - DAY

               Louise is driving.  They fly past a kid on his bike on a 
               long gravel driveway.  He watches them.  A huge cloud of 
               dust blows up as they pass him.  He turns and rides his bike 
               down the driveway towards the house.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

                                     THELMA
                         Louise, you'd better slow down.  
                         I'll just die if we get caught over 
                         a speeding ticket.

               Louise looks at the speedometer touching 80 mph and lets her 
               foot off the gas.  Louise is looking a little nervous.

                                     LOUISE
                         For the first time in my life, I 
                         wish this car wasn't green.

                                     THELMA
                         Are you sure we should be driving 
                         like this?  In broad daylight and 
                         everything?

                                     LOUISE
                         No we shouldn't, but I want to put 
                         some distance between us and the 
                         scene of our last Goddamn crime!

                                     THELMA
                         Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me!  
                         Like I'd been doin' it all my life!  
                         Nobody would ever believe it.

                                     LOUISE
                         You think you've found your calling?

                                     THELMA
                         Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!

               Thelma howls like a dog and drinks a little bottle of Wild 
               Turkey.

                                     LOUISE
                         You're disturbed.

                                     THELMA
                         Yes!  I believe I am!

               INT.  POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

               Jimmy is in a small room with Hal, Max, other cops, looking 
               stunned.

                                     JIMMY
                         I swear to God, she wouldn't tell me 
                         one thing!  Christ!  You oughta try 
                         to find that kid that was with 'em.

                                     HAL
                         Tell us about him.

                                     JIMMY
                         Just some young guy.  Around twenty 
                         years old.  Dark hair.

               Jimmy is really upset and has to really struggle to control 
               himself.

                                     JIMMY
                              (trying to remember 
                              him)
                         They said they'd picked him up along 
                         the way.  He was a student.  But he 
                         didn't look right.  But he left when 
                         they got to the motel.

                                     MAX
                         Do you understand that you may be 
                         facing an accessory charge?

                                     HAL
                         This is serious, son.  A man is dead.

                                     JIMMY
                         I know!  I'd tell you if I knew!  
                         Goddamn!  I know something happened, 
                         or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying 
                         to remember everything!  Find that 
                         fucking kid.  He probably knows 
                         something.

               EXT.  DRIVING SHOT - DAY

               Thelma and Louise are in the car.  Thelma is taking empty 
               little Wild Turkey bottles out of her purse and throwing 
               them out the window.

                                     LOUISE
                         So what's the plan, Thelma?  You 
                         just gonna stay drunk?

                                     THELMA
                         Try to.

                                     LOUISE
                         Litterbug.

               They come ROARING up on a semi-tanker carrying gas.  We see 
               their FISH-EYE REFLECTIONS in the shiny tanker.

               The mud flaps are the shiny silhouettes of naked women that 
               Thelma and Louise saw earlier.  The truck is going slower 
               than they are.

                                     LOUISE
                         Aw, great.  This always happens.  
                         Whenever you're in a hurry.

               She noses out to see if she can pass, but there's a car 
               coming.  The car passes and the truck HONKS.  The truck 
               driver's arm comes out his window and waves them past.

                                     THELMA
                         Isn't that nice?  Truck drivers are 
                         always so nice.  The best drivers on 
                         the road.

               As they get next to the truck, the truck driver is smiling 
               and waving at them.  They smile and wave back.  He flicks 
               his tongue at them.  Louise screams.

                                     THELMA/LOUISE
                         Ugh!!  Gross!!  Oh my God!  Aw, God!

               Louise FLOORS it and speeds past him.

                                     THELMA
                         Ugh!!  Why do they have to do that?

                                     LOUISE
                         They think we like it.  Maybe they 
                         think it turns us on.

               Louise shivers with disgust.

               Jimmy is looking at police mug shots of a lot of young guys.  
               Hal shows Jimmy a mug shot of J.D.

                                     HAL
                         Is this the guy you saw them with?

                                     JIMMY
                              (looking closely)
                         It's him.

                                     MAX
                              (clapping his hands)
                         Oh, happy day.

                                     JIMMY
                         You gotta be kiddin' me.  They picked 
                         up a murderer?!

                                     HAL
                         Armed robber.

                         Oh, great.

                              (to Hal)
                         They're flying him here right now.  
                         He was picked up this morning for 
                         parole violation.  They also found 
                         about six grand on him, so he probably 
                         knocked over something while he was 
                         out there.  They can drop him by 
                         here for questioning.  I'm so happy.

                         Yeah.

                                     LOUISE
                         I want you to call Darryl.

                                     THELMA
                         What for?

                                     LOUISE
                         To find out if he knows anything.  
                         If you think he does, you gotta hang 
                         up because it means the police have 
                         told him and the phone is probably 
                         tapped.

                                     THELMA
                         Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone?  You 
                         think so?

                         robbery, Thelma!

                                     THELMA
                         Murder one!  God, Louise, can't we 
                         even say it was self-defense?

                                     LOUISE
                         But it wasn't!  We got away!  We 
                         were walkin' away!

                                     THELMA
                         They don't know that!  It was just 
                         you and me there.  I'll say he raped 
                         me and you had to shoot him!  I mean, 
                         it's almost the truth!

                                     LOUISE
                         It won't work.

                         Why not?!

                                     LOUISE
                         No physical evidence.  We can't prove 
                         he did it.  We probably can't even 
                         prove he touched you by now.

               They both pause for a moment.

                                     THELMA
                         God.  The law is some tricky shit, 
                         isn't it?

               Then:

                                     THELMA
                         How do you know 'bout all this stuff 
                         anyway?

               Louise does not answer the question.

                                     LOUISE
                         Besides, what do we say about the 
                         robbery?  No excuse for that.  No 
                         such thing as justifiable robbery.

                                     THELMA

               Darryl is sitting in the hallway.  Two officers are leading 
               J.D. down the hall.

               Hal, Max, other plainclothes officers follow.  Darryl looks 
               at Hal questioningly.  Hal doesn't respond and the entourage 
               quickly goes into a room.  Darryl stands and crosses the 
               hall to the room as the door shuts in his face.

                         close to that same amount to a Miss 
                         Louise Sawyer.  Do you know her too?

                         He said he took it to a motel in 
                         Oklahoma City.  He also says that at 
                         that time he met a man.  He identified 
                         you through a series of mug shots.  
                         He also told us that you and Mrs. 
                         Dickinson seemed "close." Is that 
                         true?

                         have been a little bit jumpy.

               Max agrees and opens the door for the others to leave.  He 
               and Hal make eye contact before Max closes the door.

                         have committed armed robbery if you 
                         hadn't taken all their money?

                         you know they didn't just give it to 
                         me?

                         part of it, I'm gonna hold you 
                         personally responsible for anything 
                         that happens to them.  I've got no 
                         feelin' for you.  But I may be the 
                         only person in the world who gives a 
                         rat's ass what happens to them and 
                         you're either gonna tell me every 
                         damn thing you know, so there's a 
                         small chance I can actually do them 
                         some good, or I'm gonna be all over

                         then when he finds out that you're a 
                         possible accessory to murder and 
                         armed robbery, well, I think we can 
                         safely place your ass back in the 
                         slammer for at least the remaining 
                         eight, don't you?

                                     MAX
                         Oh, definitely.

                                     J.D.
                              (convinced)
                         Okay.  Is somebody gonna write this 
                         down?

               INT.  POLICE STATION - NIGHT

               Darryl is sitting in the hallway.  Hal comes out of the room 
               first.

                                     HAL
                         Mr. Dickinson, if you'll just hang 
                         on, I want a word with you and then 
                         we'll take you home.

               Police officers lead J.D. out of the interrogation room, 
               down the hallway.  Darryl is watching J.D. closely.  J.D. is 
               smirking at him. 

                                     J.D.
                              (slyly, to Darryl)
                         I like your wife.

                                     DARRYL
                              (going after him)
                         Come back here, you little shit!

               Hal and another police officer are restraining Darryl.

               J.D. is led off down the hall.

               EXT.  GAS STATION - NIGHT

               Louise and Thelma pull into a gas station.

               EXT.  GAS STATION - NIGHT

               A gas station attendant approaches as Louise and Thelma are 
               getting out of the car.

                                     LOUISE
                              (to attendant)
                         Fill her up.
                              (to Thelma)
                         There's a phone right over there.

                                     THELMA
                         Let's get it over with.

               Thelma and Louise walk to the phone.

                                     LOUISE
                         I'm not kidding, Thelma.  If you 
                         think he knows, even if you're not 
                         sure, hang up.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               The TV is ON and the place is a mess.

               Darryl, Hal, Max, and other cops spring into action as the 
               phone RINGS, putting on headsets, turning on tape recorders.  
               Darryl picks up the phone.

                                     DARRYL
                         Hello.

               EXT.  PAY PHONE - NIGHT

                                     THELMA
                         Darryl.  It's me.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Hal, Max, etc., all are gesticulating wildly.

                                     DARRYL
                              (real friendly)
                         Thelma!  Hello!

               EXT.  PAY PHONE

               Thelma hangs up the phone.

                                     THELMA
                              (matter-of-factly)
                         He knows.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Everyone is very disappointed, taking off their headsets, 
               turning off tape recorders and looking at Darryl like he's 
               an idiot.

                                     HAL
                         Shit.

               Darryl still holds the phone in his hand.

                                     DARRYL
                         What?!  All I said was hello.

               EXT.  PAY PHONE - NIGHT

               Thelma and Louise are staring at each other intently.

               Louise steps up to the phone.

                                     LOUISE
                         You got any change?

               Thelma digs in her bag and hands Louise a roll of quarters.  
               Louise gets out of the car and goes to the pay phone.  Thelma 
               follows her.  She puts the money in and dials.  It RINGS.

                                     LOUISE
                         Darryl, this is Louise.  Are the 
                         police there?

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               Again everybody springs into action.  Darryl is fumbling 
               with the phone.

                                     DARRYL
                         Uh, no!  No, why would any police be 
                         here?  Hey, where are you girls, 
                         anyway?

               Darryl gives Hal and Max a look as if he's got it completely 
               under control.  Clever guy.

               EXT.  PHONE - NIGHT

                                     LOUISE
                         Let me talk to whoever's in charge 
                         there?

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

                                     DARRYL
                         What are you talking about, Louise?

               Hal comes over and takes the phone away from Darryl.  Hal 
               looks at Max who nods, "take it."

                                     HAL
                         Hello, Miss Sawyer.  I'm Hal Slocumbe, 
                         Chief Investigator, Homicide, Arkansas 
                         State Police.  How are you?

               EXT.  PHONE - NIGHT

                                     LOUISE
                              (chuckling)
                         I've been better.

                                     HAL (V.O.)
                         You girls are in some hot water.

                                     LOUISE
                         Yes, sir.  I know.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

                                     HAL
                         You're both okay?  Neither one of 
                         you hurt?  You're bein' careful with 
                         that gun?

               EXT.  PHONE - NIGHT

                                     LOUISE
                         We're both fine.

                                     HAL (V.O.)
                         Good.  You wanna tell me what 
                         happened?

                                     LOUISE
                         Sure.  Maybe over coffee sometime.  
                         I'll buy.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

                                     HAL
                         I just want you to know, neither one 
                         of you are charged with murder yet.  
                         You're still just wanted for 
                         questioning.  Although, now, Mrs.  
                         Dickinson's wanted in Oklahoma for 
                         armed robbery.

               EXT.  PHONE - NIGHT

                                     LOUISE
                         No kiddin'.  Listen, we gotta go.  
                         I'll call you back, all right?

               Louise looks at her watch.

                                     HAL (V.O.)
                         Miss Sawyer, I don't think y'all are 
                         gonna make it to Mexico.  We should 
                         talk.  Please.  I wanna to help you.

               On hearing this Louise mouths the word "shit" in a very 
               frustrated way.

               Louise hangs up the phone.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

               All are busy trying to see if the call was traced.  Darryl 
               is back in his recliner still in shock.

               EXT.  PAY PHONE - NIGHT

               She is stomping back to the car.  Thelma follows doggedly.  
               A moving van pulls in and parks in the b.g.

                                     LOUISE
                         That J.D. kid is a little shit.

                                     THELMA
                         What.

               Louise stops as she is about to get in and faces Thelma who's 
               standing on the other side of the car.

                                     LOUISE
                         How'd they find out we're going to 
                         Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?

                                     THELMA
                         I... I...

                                     LOUISE
                         You told that thievin' little shit 
                         where we were goin'?!

               Louise yanks open her car door, gets in and slams the door 
               and fires up the ENGINE.  Thelma hops in quickly.

                                     THELMA
                         I just told him if he ever gets to 
                         Mexico to look us up.  I asked him 
                         not to tell.  I didn't think he would 
                         tell anybody.

                                     LOUISE
                         Why not?!  What's he got to lose?  
                         Other than my life's savings, that 
                         is.  Shit!

               Louise careens back onto the road.

                                     THELMA
                         I'm sorry.  I mean I...

               Louise slams on the brakes.

                                     LOUISE
                         Goddamnit, Thelma!  Let me explain 
                         something to you.  Right now we have 
                         only two things goin' for us.  One, 
                         nobody knows where we are, and two, 
                         nobody knows where we're going.  
                         Now, one of our things that was going 
                         for us is gone!

               Louise stops yelling for a moment groping for self-control.  
               Thelma looks pitiful.

                                     LOUISE
                         Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma!  
                         Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives 
                         now.  Let's behave that way!

                                     THELMA
                         You're right.

               The T-Bird flashes by on a road that looks a lot like Route

               All's quiet.  The large screen TV is ON and the room is filled 
               with dense smoke.  Hal, Max, sit at a table going over 
               paperwork.  Other plainclothes and surveillance guys play 
               cards.  Darryl sits crumpled in his recliner staring blankly

               Over music from tape:

               Thelma is sipping on a little Wild Turkey.

                         Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess 
                         maybe we could turn ourselves in and 
                         spend our lives trading cigarettes 
                         for mascara so we can look nice when 
                         our families come to visit us on 
                         Saturdays.  Maybe we could have 
                         children with the prison guards.

                         goin' back.  No matter what happens.  
                         So don't worry about me.

               Louise speeds up.

               Thelma hands Louise a little bottle of Wild Turkey and she 
               drinks it down.  Thelma has one too.

                                     THELMA
                         Can I ask you kind of a weird 
                         question?

                                     LOUISE
                         Yeah.

                                     THELMA
                         Of all the things in the world that 
                         scare you, what's the worst thing 
                         that scares you the most?

                                     LOUISE
                         You mean now or before?

                                     THELMA
                         Before.

                                     LOUISE
                         I guess I always thought the worst 
                         thing that could happen would be to 
                         end up old and alone in some crummy 
                         apartment with one of those little 
                         dogs.

                                     THELMA
                         What little dogs?

                                     LOUISE
                         You know those little dogs you see 
                         people with?

                                     THELMA
                         Like a Chihuahua?

                                     LOUISE
                         Those, too, but you know those little 
                         hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little 
                         fuckers with those ugly goddamned 
                         teeth?

                                     THELMA
                         Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.

                                     LOUISE
                         Yeah.  Those.  That always put the 
                         fear of God in me.  What about you?

                                     THELMA
                         Well, to be honest, the idea of 
                         getting old with Darryl was kinda 
                         startin' to get to me.

                                     LOUISE
                         I can see that.

                                     THELMA
                         I mean, look how different he looks 
                         just since high school.  It's bad 
                         enough I have to get old, but doin' 
                         it with Darryl around is only gonna 
                         make it worse.
                              (quieter)
                         I mean, I don't think he's gonna be 
                         very nice about it.

                                     LOUISE
                         Well, now, maybe you won't have to.

                                     THELMA
                         Always lookin' on the bright side, 
                         aren't ya?

               EXT.  MOONLIT DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT (MUSCO LIGHT)

               They are driving through Monument Valley.  The T-Bird speeds 
               through the beautifully moonlit desert.  It is almost like 
               daylight.

               MONTAGE of silhouettes of cacti, huge rock formations, desert 
               beauty SHOTS, etc.

               INT.  CAR - POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD - NIGHT

               The sky is bright and expansive and the road goes on forever.

                                     THELMA
                         This is so beautiful.

                                     LOUISE
                         Gosh.  It sure is.

                                     THELMA
                         I always wanted to travel.  I just 
                         never got the opportunity.

                                     LOUISE
                         Well, you got it now.

               They both look forward for another moment.  And then, at the 
               same time, they look at each other, each taking the other 
               one in completely, in this moment.

               They're saying everything to each other in this moment, but 
               their expressions don't change and they don't say a word.  
               MUSIC plays on the RADIO.

               EXT.  DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               A semi-gas tanker is up ahead on the road.  It looks like 
               the one they saw earlier.  It's got the same mud flaps...

               INT.  CAR - NIGHT

                                     LOUISE
                         Look!  Look who it is, Thelma.  I'll 
                         be darned.  What's he doin' way out 
                         here.

                                     THELMA
                         Just ignore him.

               Louise passes him and, as she does, he HONKS.  They look up 
               and he is wildly pointing to his lap.

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh, Christ.  I hate this guy.

                                     THELMA
                         We should have just ignored him.

               EXT.  DESERT HIGHWAY - DAWN (OVER MUSIC)

               The car is flying down the road.

               INT.  CAR - DESERT HIGHWAY - DAWN

               They are quiet for a moment, then Thelma starts quietly 
               laughing to herself.  She is trying to stop but cannot.

                                     LOUISE
                         What?

                                     THELMA
                              (shaking with laughter)
                         Nothing.  It's not funny.

                                     LOUISE
                         What?  What's not funny, Thelma!

               Thelma is trying to compose herself but cannot.

                                     THELMA
                         Okay, but...
                              (she can barely speak)
                         I can't say.

               Thelma isn't making a sound.  She is stuck in a convulsion 
               of laughter.

                                     LOUISE
                         What?!

                                     THELMA
                              (gasping for air)
                         Harlan.

                                     LOUISE
                         What?!  What about him?!

                                     THELMA
                         Just the look on his face when you...
                              (she is falling apart 
                              again)
                         ...it's not funny.

                                     LOUISE
                              (shocked)
                         Now, Thelma, that is not...

               Thelma is still trying to get a grip on herself.

                                     THELMA
                         Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!

                                     LOUISE
                              (scolding)
                         Thelma!

                                     THELMA
                              (impersonating Harlan)
                         Suck my dick... Boom!!

               Thelma is laughing wildly.

                                     LOUISE
                              (quietly)
                         Thelma.  It's not funny.

               Thelma has just crossed the line from laughing to crying.

                                     THELMA
                              (trying to catch her 
                              breath)
                         I know!

               They both get quiet.

               Thelma leans back just watching Louise.  She studies her as 
               if she's never really seen her before.  All of a sudden a 
               look of shocked realization comes over Thelma's face.

               She jerks upright and startles Louise.

                                     THELMA
                              (carefully)
                         It happened to you... didn't it?

               Louise knows what she is talking about.  She becomes 
               immediately agitated.

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't want to talk about it!  
                         Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you 
                         even...

                                     THELMA
                         ...in Texas... didn't it?  That's 
                         what happened... Oh my God.

               Louise looks as if she is looking for a way to flee.

                                     LOUISE
                              (fighting hysteria)
                         I'm warning you, Thelma.  You better 
                         drop it right now!  I don't want to 
                         talk about it!

                                     THELMA
                              (gently)
                         Okay, Louise... It's okay.

               Louise's eyes are wild, not seeing, while Thelma now seems 
               completely serene.

               EXT.  DESERT HIGHWAY - DAWN

               The car is SCREAMING down the road.  They drive through a 
               little stand of buildings.

               EXT.  DESERT HIGHWAY - LONG LENS SHOT - DAWN

               A car speeds up to try and catch them... The red and blue 
               lights pop on.  It is a New Mexico State Patrol car.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

               Louise sees the lights in the rearview mirror.  LOUISE'S POV 
               OF THE SPEEDOMETER at 100 mph.  Thelma is asleep.

                                     LOUISE
                         Shit!  Thelma, wake up!  Shit!  We're 
                         gettin' pulled over!

               Thelma jumps awake.

                                     THELMA
                         What!  What!  Oh shit!  Oh no!

               They are trying not to panic.  They are slowing down, but 
               still doing 70 mph.  The patrol car is right behind them.

                                     THELMA
                         What do we do?  What do you want to 
                         do?!

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't know!  Shit!  Let's just 
                         play it by ear.  He may not know.  
                         He may just give me a ticket.

                                     THELMA
                         Please, God, please don't let us get 
                         caught.  Please, please, please...

               Louise pulls the car off the road.  The patrol car pulls up 
               right behind them.  The lights shine brightly in through the 
               windows.

               EXT.  SIDE OF DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

                                     PATROLMAN (O.S.)
                         Turn off your engine.

               Louise does.  The PATROLMAN gets out of his car and approaches 
               their car.  He comes to the driver's side window.  It is 
               rolled up.

               PATROLMAN'S POV OF LOUISE smiling up at him.  He gestures to 
               her to roll her window down.  She does.

                                     LOUISE
                         Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?

                                     PATROLMAN
                         You wanna let me see your license, 
                         please?

               Louise fumbles in her purse for her wallet, opens it and 
               shows her license.

                                     PATROLMAN
                         You wanna take it out of your wallet, 
                         please?

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh yeah.

               She does and hands it to him.

                                     THELMA
                         I told you to slow down.  Hell, 
                         Officer, I told her to slow down.

                                     LOUISE
                         About how fast was I going?

                                     PATROLMAN
                         About a hundred and ten.  You wanna 
                         step out of the car, please?

               They walk to the back of the car.  He notes the license plate

                         Is this your car?

                                     LOUISE
                         Yes.

                                     PATROLMAN
                         You wanna come with me, please?  
                         Walk around and get in the car, 
                         please.

                                     LOUISE
                         In the back?

                                     PATROLMAN
                         Front.

                                     LOUISE
                         Am I in trouble?

                                     PATROLMAN
                         As far as I'm concerned, yes, ma'am, 
                         you are.

               Patrolman gets in the driver's side.  He picks up a clipboard 
               and clips Louise's driver's license to it.  He picks up the 
               hand mike for the radio and, as he does, a hand with a gun 
               comes in his car window.  It's Thelma and she puts the gun 
               to his head.

                                     THELMA
                         Officer, I am so sorry about this.  
                         Could you let go of that?

               He drops it.

                                     THELMA
                         I really, really apologize, but please 
                         put your hands on the steering wheel.  
                         See, if you get on that radio, you're 
                         gonna find out that we're wanted in 
                         two states and probably considered 
                         armed and dangerous, at least I am, 
                         then our whole plan would be shot to 
                         hell.  Louise, take his gun.

               Louise reaches over and takes his gun.

                                     LOUISE
                              (apologetic)
                         I am really sorry about this.

                                     THELMA
                         I swear, before yesterday, neither 
                         one of us would have ever pulled a 
                         stunt like this.  But if you ever 
                         met my husband, you'd know why I 
                         just can... You wanna step out of 
                         the car, please?
                              (she opens the door 
                              for him)
                         You wanna put your hands on your 
                         head, please?  Louise, shoot the 
                         radio.

                                     LOUISE
                         What?

                                     THELMA
                         Shoot the radio!

               Louise SHOOTS the car radio.  The cop flinches with each 
               shot.

                                     THELMA
                         The police radio, Louise!  Jesus!

               Louise fires TWO SHOTS into the police radio.  It BLASTS all 
               to hell.

                                     THELMA
                         You wanna step to the back of the 
                         car, please.  Louise, bring the keys.

               Louise reaches over and takes the keys.  She takes her license 
               off the clipboard.  She gets out and trots around to the 
               back of the car.

               Thelma is holding the gun on the Patrolman.  Suddenly Thelma 
               FIRES the gun, blowing two holes into the trunk cover.

                                     THELMA
                              (to Louise)
                         Open the trunk.

               Louise opens the trunk.

                                     THELMA
                              (to Patrolman)
                         You wanna step into the trunk, please?

                                     PATROLMAN
                         Ma'am, please... I got kids... a 
                         wife...

                                     THELMA
                         You do?  Well, you're lucky.  You be 
                         sweet to 'em.  Especially your wife.  
                         My husband wasn't sweet to me and 
                         look how I turned out.  Now go on, 
                         get in there.

               As he's climbing into the trunk, Thelma explains to Louise:

                                     THELMA
                         Air holes.

               He's all the way in and Louise closes the trunk.

               INT.  PATROL CAR - DAY

               Thelma opens the glove compartment.  She takes a box of spare 
               ammo and closes it.  Thelma takes the keys and gets out of 
               the car.  She walks around to the trunk.

                         Sorry!

                                     LOUISE
                              (from her car)
                         Sorry!

               Thelma hops into the car with Louise.  They look at each 
               other.

                                     LOUISE
                         Ready?

                                     THELMA
                         Hit it.

               Louise pulls the car back onto the road and they drive away.

                         I know it's crazy, Louise, but I 
                         just feel like I've got a knack for 
                         this shit.

                         Drive like hell.

               INT.  THELMA'S KITCHEN - MORNING

               Hal and Max are alone in the kitchen.  Hal switches on the 
               Mr. Coffee.

                                     MAX
                         It's just not working like this.  We 
                         gotta do something.  It'd be one 
                         thing if these girls were hardened 
                         criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is 
                         makin' us look bad.  I don't know... 
                         maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe 
                         that little creep lied.

                                     HAL
                         He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  
                         Nothin' at all.  He already got all 
                         their money.  I just don't know what 
                         we're dealin' with here.  Anyway, it 
                         went out again last night on 
                         Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just 
                         wait it out a little longer.  She 
                         said she was gonna call back.  Let's 
                         just sit tight.

                                     MAX
                         We don't have a whole lotta choice, 
                         do we?  I can't figure out if they're 
                         real smart or just really, really 
                         lucky.

                                     HAL
                         It don't matter.  Brains will only 
                         get you so far and luck always runs 
                         out.

               A cop walks into the kitchen and hands Hal a file that says 
               Louise Elizabeth Sawyer on the outside.  He opens it up and 
               starts looking through a personal history.  One piece of 
               paper is a case file from Texas containing an incident report 
               of a rape.  Stamped across it are the words "charges dropped."

                                     THELMA
                         Louise... are we still going to 
                         Mexico?

                                     LOUISE
                         Yes.

               Thelma pauses while she searches for the logic.

                                     THELMA
                         Then aren't we going in the wrong 
                         direction?

                                     LOUISE
                         Well, I figure if you take a state 
                         policeman, shoot up his car, take 
                         his gun and lock him in the trunk, 
                         it's best to just get on out of the 
                         state if you can.

                                     THELMA
                         Just asking.

               They are both quiet for a second.  Louise goes a little 
               faster.

               Thelma is digging through her bag.  She hands Louise a piece 
               of beef jerky.

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't want to see any more beef 
                         jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky 
                         you hand me is going out the window.  
                         It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole 
                         car smells like it.

                                     THELMA
                         It's good.  It's what the pioneers 
                         ate.

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't care what the damn pioneers 
                         ate.  You just keep that shit away 
                         from me, now I mean it.

               Thelma puts down her bag.

                                     LOUISE
                         And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, 
                         either.  It's burning a hole in my 
                         stomach.

                                     THELMA
                         Okay, okay... I've got some tequila.  
                         You want some tequila?

                                     LOUISE
                         You do?

                                     THELMA
                         Yeah, you want it?

                                     LOUISE
                         Yeah.

               Thelma starts to dig through her bag again.

                                     THELMA
                         It's in here somewhere.

               Louise is rubbing her face.  She looks pretty bad.  Her hands 
               are shaking.

                                     LOUISE
                         Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.

                                     THELMA
                         Are you alright?

               Louise does not really seem alright.

                                     LOUISE
                         I think I've really fucked up.  I 
                         think I've got us in a situation 
                         where we could both get killed.  Why 
                         didn't we just go straight to the 
                         police.

                                     THELMA
                         You know why.  You already said.

                                     LOUISE
                         What'd I say again?

                                     THELMA
                         Nobody would believe us.  We'd still 
                         get in trouble.  We'd still have our 
                         lives ruined.  And you know what 
                         else?

                                     LOUISE
                         What?

                                     THELMA
                         That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you 
                         hadn't come out when you did, he'd a 
                         hurt me a lot worse.  And probably 
                         nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause 
                         everybody did see me dancin' with 
                         him all night.  And they woulda made 
                         out like I asked for it.  And my 
                         life woulda been ruined a whole lot 
                         worse than it is now.  At least now 
                         I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry 
                         the son of a bitch is dead.  I'm 
                         only sorry that it was you that did 
                         it and not me.  And if I haven't, I 
                         wanna take this time to thank you, 
                         Louise.  Thank you for savin' my

                         I said all that?

                                     THELMA
                         No, Louise, you said the first part.  
                         I said all the rest.

               Louise is at a pay phone as the sky is just starting to get 
               light.  Thelma is in the bathroom nearby.  Louise has already 
               dialed and the phone is RINGING.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - MORNING

               The TV DRONES on in the b.g. as the phone RINGS there, 
               everyone leaps into action again.  Max picks up the phone.

                                     MAX
                         Hello.

                         She wants to talk to you.

                         Hey.

                                     HAL (V.O.)
                         How are things goin' out there?

                                     LOUISE
                         Weird.  Got some kind of snowball 
                         effect goin' here or somethin'.

                                     HAL (V.O.)
                         You're still with us though.  You're 
                         somewhere on the face of the earth?

                                     LOUISE
                         Well, we're not in the middle of 
                         nowhere, but we can see it from here.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - MORNING

               Hal smiles.

                                     HAL
                         I swear.  Louise, I almost feel like 
                         I know you.

                                     LOUISE (V.O.)
                         Well.  You don't.

                                     HAL
                         You're gettin' in deeper every moment 
                         you're gone.

                                     LOUISE (V.O.)
                         Would you believe me if I told you 
                         this whole thing is an accident?

                                     HAL
                         I do believe you.  That's what I 
                         want everybody to believe.  Trouble 
                         is, it doesn't look like an accident 
                         and you're not here to tell me about 
                         it... I need you to help me here.

               EXT.  PAY PHONE - MORNING

               Louise does not answer.

                                     HAL (V.O.)
                         Did Harlan Puckett...

               Through clenched teeth, repulsed:

                                     LOUISE
                              (interrupting)
                         No!

                                     HAL (V.O.)
                         You want to come on in?

               Louise thinks for a minute.

                                     LOUISE
                         I don't think so.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

                                     HAL
                         Then I'm sorry.  We're gonna have to 
                         charge you with murder.  Now, do you 
                         want to come out of this alive?

               The surveillance man motions to Hal to keep it going.

               Darryl comes in and immediately realizes Hal is talking to 
               Louise.  Darryl looks attentively at Hal.

                         You know, certain words and phrases 
                         just keep floating through my mind, 
                         things like incarceration, cavity 
                         search, life imprisonment, death by 
                         electrocution, that sort of thing.  
                         So, come out alive?  I don't know.  
                         Let us think about that.

                                     HAL (V.O.)
                         Louise, I'll do anything.  I know 
                         what's makin' you run.  I know what 
                         happened to you in Texas.

               Louise's eyes get wide as she hears this.

               A FINGER reaches up and presses down the lever and hangs up 
               the phone.

               ANGLE OF THELMA

               She has her finger on the lever.

                                     THELMA
                         Come on, Louise.  Don't blow it.  
                         Let's go.

               She walks away towards the car.  Louise is still standing 
               there holding the phone.  Thelma stops and looks at her.

                                     THELMA
                         Come on.

               Louise doesn't move.

               Frustrated, Hal slams down the phone.  He looks over at the 
               surveillance man who nods to say "we got it."  The whole 
               room reacts excitedly.  Everyone in the room springs into 
               action.  Max immediately picks up the phone and Hal watches 
               him intently.  He mouths the words to Max -- "I wanna go" 
               emphatically.  Max slightly shakes his head, still of the 
               phone.  Hal goes charging over to Max.

                                     HAL
                         Max.  You gotta take me there!  I'm... 
                         I'm the only one she's ever talked 
                         to.  I don't want anybody losin' 
                         their heads.  You know what happens.  
                         The volume gets turned way up and 
                         the next thing you know those girls 
                         are gonna get shot.

               Max, still holding the phone, is surprised by this outburst.

                                     MAX
                              (calmly)

                         You're not gonna make some deal with 
                         that guy, are you?  I mean, I just 
                         wanna know.

                         No, Thelma.  I'm not gonna make any

                         I can understand if you're thinkin' 
                         about it.  I mean, in a way, you've 
                         got something to go back for.  I 
                         mean Jimmy and everything.

                         Thelma, that is not an option.

                         But I don't know... something's 
                         crossed over in me and I can't go 
                         back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...

                         I know.  I know what you mean.  I

                         And we have to decide whether we 
                         want to come out of this dead or

               to an intersection in the middle of nowhere.  Louise stops 
               and looks at the map.

                                     LOUISE
                         We should head a little further in.  
                         There's not that many roads in this 
                         state.  I want to try to hit Mexico 
                         somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  
                         They probably wanna kill us in New 
                         Mexico.

                                     THELMA
                         You're drivin'.

               Louise takes a right turn and speeds down the road.

               EXT.  DESERT ROAD - DAY

               Louise and Thelma are singing along to a wild R&B SONG.  
               They do the hand movements as if they are the Supremes.

               They come roaring up on the semi-tanker, the same one they 
               have seen three times before.

                                     THELMA
                              (screaming over music)
                         Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look!  
                         See if that's him!

                                     LOUISE
                         It's him.  He's got California plates.  
                         It's the same guy.

                                     THELMA
                         Pass him!

               EXT.  DESERT ROAD - DAY

               Louise bears down really hard and passes him.  Again as they 
               get right next to him, he blows kisses down at them.

               He is leering at them and laughing.  Louise and Thelma drive 
               further down the road.

               Louise pulls the car off to the side of the road.  As the 
               truck gets close they start waving to him to stop.  He pulls 
               his truck off the side of the road and stops.  ANGLE ON Louise 
               and Thelma smiling up at him.  He chuckles to himself.  He 
               leans out the window.

                                     THELMA
                         Hi!

                                     THELMA
                         We're fine!  How are you?

                                     TRUCKER

               They turn off onto a dirt road and pull to a stop.

               INT.  TRUCK CAB - DAY

               The Trucker reaches over and opens a glove compartment crammed 
               full of condoms.  He grabs a few and shoves them in his 
               pocket.  He turns off his engine and gets out of the truck.

               EXT.  SIDE OF ROAD - DAY

               He walks up to the car.

               Louise and Thelma get out of the car.

                                     THELMA
                         Where you goin'?

                         way.

                         Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.

                                     THELMA
                         We think you have really bad manners.

               Louise nods.

                                     LOUISE
                         We were just wonderin' where you 
                         think you get off behavin' like that 
                         to women you don't even know.

               This is not what is supposed to be happening.

                                     TRUCKER
                         What?  What are you talkin' about?

                                     LOUISE
                         You know good and damn well what I'm 
                         talkin' about.

                                     THELMA
                         I mean really!  That business with 
                         your tongue.  What is that?  That's 
                         disgusting!

                                     LOUISE
                         And, oh my God, that other thing, 
                         that pointing to your lap?  What's 
                         that supposed to mean exactly?  Does 
                         that mean pull over, I want to show 
                         you what a big fat slob I am or...

                                     THELMA
                         Does that mean suck my dick?

                                     TRUCKER
                         You women are crazy!

                                     LOUISE
                         You got that right.

                                     THELMA
                         We think you should apologize.

               He is getting a little panicky.

                                     TRUCKER
                         I'm not apologizing for shit!

                                     LOUISE
                         Say you're sorry.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Fuck that.

               Louise pulls the gun they stole from the State Patrolman.

                                     LOUISE
                         Say you're sorry or we'll make you 
                         fuckin' sorry.

               He looks at the gun.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Oh, Jesus!

                                     THELMA
                         You probably even called us beavers 
                         on your CB radio, didn't you?

                                     TRUCKER
                         Yeah... sure did.

                                     THELMA
                         Damn.  I hate that!  I hate bein' 
                         called a beaver, don't you?

                                     LOUISE
                         Are you going to apologize or not?

                                     TRUCKER
                         Fuck you.

               Louise looks at his truck off in the distance.  She points 
               the gun at it, takes a second to get a bead, then SHOOTS two 
               of the tires flat.  The truck slowly sinks as the air escapes 
               from the tires.

                                     TRUCKER
                         Oh goddamn!!  You bitch!!

               Louise and Thelma look at each other.  They both turn towards 
               the truck and FIRE rounds into the tankers until they EXPLODE 
               in a huge ball of fire.  The truck driver screams at the top 
               of his lungs.  Louise starts the car and starts driving in 
               circles around the truck driver.  Thelma and Louise are both 
               howling at the top of their lungs.  Thelma is sitting on the 
               back of the front seat with her legs on the dashboard.

                                     TRUCKER
                         You fucking bitch!  Aaaaaaarrrgghh!!!  
                         You're gonna have to pay for that!!!  
                         I'm gonna make you pay for that!!  
                         You hear me??!!

               Louise stops the car right next to him.

                                     THELMA
                         Shut up.

               Louise takes off again and Thelma falls into the back seat.  
               They drive off trailing a huge cloud of dust.

               EXT.  DESERT - DAY

               Louise drives through the desert back towards the road, past 
               the burning debris of the truck.  As she gets to the road 
               she stops.  Thelma climbs into the front seat.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

                                     THELMA
                         Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot 
                         like that?

                                     LOUISE
                         Texas... You were right about what 
                         happened to me there.

               They pull away from the burning wreckage.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

               As Thelma and Louise talk, their voices are heard over the 
               following scene.

                         You know what's happened, don't you?

                                     THELMA (V.O.)
                         What?

                                     LOUISE (V.O.)
                              (smiling)
                         We've gone insane.

                                     THELMA (V.O.)

               EXT.  NEW MEXICO SIDE OF ROAD - DAY

               A battered old pickup truck is parked by the New Mexico State 
               Patrol.  An old man uses a crowbar to pry open the trunk.  
               The New Mexico State Patrolman hops out of the trunk.

               EXT.  DESERT ROAD - HELICOPTER SHOT - DAY

               Police Bulletin VOICE OVER BEGINS AND PLAYS OVER following 
               scenes:

               A police helicopter flies over the burning wreckage of the 
               fuel truck.  The truck driver is waving his arms as the 
               helicopter descends, blowing dirt all over him.

               INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - DAY

               Darryl sits practically comatose in a big chair.  His eyes 
               have a dull glaze as he stares first at one wall, then 
               another.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

               A TIGHT SHOT of a TAPE being shoved into the cassette deck.

               INT.  FBI JET - DAY

               Max and Hal sit next to each other in the jet.  Hal tries to 
               appear as if he's used to all this.  Max holds a cellular 
               phone to his ear.

               TIGHT SHOT of Max as we hear through the phone:

               Police VOICE OVER becomes part of scene.

                                     POLICE (V.O.)
                              (on phone)

                         stole the officer's weapon... 
                         tanker... blown up... terrorized...

               Max's face becomes troubled and more serious than we've seen 
               so far.  He looks at Hal as he hangs up the phone.

                                     MAX
                         You're not even going to believe 
                         this.

               WIDE SHOT of car speeding through the desert on an empty 
               highway west.  DRIVING SHOT -- Thelma has her face to the 
               sun with her eyes closed.  Louise is driving with a fierce 
               intensity.  They hardly resemble the two women that started 
               out for a weekend in the mountains two days earlier.  Although 
               their faces are tanned and lined and their hair is blowing 
               wildly there is a sense of serenity that pervades.

               EXT.  HELIPORT - DAY

               Hal and Max are climbing out of the jet and running across 
               the tarmac to a waiting helicopter.  Max is carrying a walkie-
               talkie now.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

               Thelma sits up suddenly.  An Arizona police car passes them 
               going eastbound.

                                     THELMA
                         Oh shit.  Louise... Do you think he 
                         saw us?

                         I don't know, but let's get off.

               LOUISE'S POV - REARVIEW MIRROR

               The police car cuts across the median to begin pursuit of 
               the girls.  The lights are flashing.

                         Is your seat belt on?

               Thelma puts her seat belt on.  Louise floors the car and it 
               streaks off, putting some distance between them and the police 
               car.  Thelma looks back at the police car.  She looks scared.

                                     THELMA
                         I guess we shoulda made some kinda 
                         plan for what to do if we get caught.

                                     LOUISE
                         Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get 
                         caught.

                         About two hundred and fifty miles.

                         How long do you think that'll take?

               EXT.  DESERT ROAD - DAY

               There are now two police cars behind them about half a mile 
               back.  They are going really fast.  A police helicopter 
               catches up to them and orders them to stop.  Thelma stands 
               and flips them off.

                                     THELMA
                         We're going to Mexico!

                         Uh oh.  There's another one.

               Louise and Thelma both are looking back at the two police 
               cars following them.  They turn back around just in time to 
               see a third Arizona State police car has pulled into the 
               middle of an intersection of the only road that crosses it 
               for miles.  They both scream.  Louise swerves just in time 
               to keep from hitting it broadside.  She goes off the road 
               and has to struggle to pull her car back onto the road, 
               leaving a huge cloud of dust.

                         Did you see that guy?!  He was right 
                         in the middle of the road!

               EXT.  DESERT ROAD - DAY

               The first two police cars are approaching the same 
               intersection.  They are driving side by side.  There is still 
               a huge cloud of dust that now covers the third car in the 
               middle of the intersection.

               INT.  POLICE CAR #1 - POV - DAY

               A huge cloud of dust blows across the road as he approaches 
               the intersection.  It clears to reveal the third police car 
               in the middle of the road, just as he and police car #2 reach 
               the intersection.  ANGLE ON POLICEMAN #1 as he screams and 
               swerves to the right.

               INT.  POLICE CAR #3 - DAY

               ANGLE ON POLICEMAN #3 AS HE SEES BOTH POLICE CARS HEADING

               right for him at 120 mph.  He screams and ducks down into 
               the seat.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - POLICE CAR #

               swerves to the right.  Police car #2 swerves to the left, 
               both barely missing police car #3.

               ANOTHER ANGLE as police car #1 and police car #2 both pull 
               back onto the road right next to each other.

               INT.  POLICE CAR #3 - DAY

               Policeman #3 sits up in the seat.  He can't believe he isn't 
               dead.  He puts his car in gear and takes off down the road 
               after them.

               EXT.  DESERT GHOST TOWN - DAY

               Louise and Thelma blow through a stand of buildings left 
               from when the train went through here.  There are two parallel 
               streets on either side of the one they're on and, as they 
               pass by buildings, they can see police cars ROARING down 
               these parallel streets trying to "head them off at the pass."  
               Louise FLOORS it and her car screams ahead.

                                     LOUISE
                         We probably shoulda filled up the 
                         car before we blew up that truck.

                                     THELMA
                         Why?

                         They'll probably catch us when we 
                         have to stop for gas!

                                     THELMA
                         I know this whole thing was my fault.  
                         I know it is.

                         understand by now, Thelma, it's not 
                         your fault.

                                     THELMA
                         Louise... no matter what happens, 
                         I'm glad I came with you.

               Louise swerves off the road and begins driving across the 
               desert.  All the police cars take off across the desert after 
               them.  They are now being pursued by at least fifteen cars.

                         I guess I went a little crazy, huh?

                         No... You've always been crazy.  
                         This is just the first chance you've 
                         had to really express yourself.

                         I guess everything from here on in 
                         is going to be pretty shitty.

                         Unbearable, I'd imagine.

                         I guess everything we've got to lose 
                         is already gone anyway.

               They smile.

               EXT.  DESERT - DAY

               It does look like an Army.  More police cars have joined, 
               and from every direction, police cars are swarming across 
               the desert, although none are in front of them.  Way off in 
               the distance, a helicopter joins the chase.

               INT.  CAR - DAY

               Thelma is looking way up ahead in the distance.

                                     THELMA

                         Way up ahead!

               Louise strains to see.  Whatever it is, Louise is barreling 
               towards it, the car leaving the ground as they fly through 
               the desert.

                                     LOUISE
                         Oh my God!!

               Louise starts to laugh and cry at the same time.

               Behind them is a huge wall of dust created by all the police 
               cars following them.  In front of them, looking larger every 
               moment, is the awesome splendor of the Grand Canyon.

                         It's grand!

               Louise has tears streaming down her face as she realizes 
               there is absolutely no escape.  She continues barreling 
               towards it without slowing down.

               EXT.  DESERT - DAY

               All the police cars are still following about a half a mile 
               behind.  The car is bouncing and flying across the desert.  
               Finally, they get about twenty yards from the edge and Louise 
               SLAMS on the brakes.

               Thelma and Louise are just waiting for the cars to catch up.  
               The police cars stop in a line about two hundred yards behind 
               them.  The dust from the cars is blowing across them.  They 
               just sit looking at the Grand Canyon.

               From the canyon, the FBI helicopter rises up in front of the 
               car.

               INT.  FBI HELICOPTER - DAY

               Hal sees Thelma and Louise for the first time.  They are 
               sitting in the car, oblivious in a way, to all the activity 
               around them.  He only takes his eyes off of them long enough 
               to look at Max.

                         All this for us?

               Thelma starts to laugh.  Louise is only concerned with missing 
               the cacti and other obstacles that lie before her.

               INT.  FBI HELICOPTER - DAY

               The helicopter lands behind the row of police cars.

               HAL'S POV

               He sees Thelma and Louise facing each other.  They look so 
               nice.  He can't stop looking.  He borrows the binoculars 
               from Max.  He sees Thelma and Louise in the car.  Some of 
               the police sharpshooters are sporting semi-automatic rifles.  
               Hal looks at Max.

                                     HAL
                         Hey!  Don't let them shoot those 
                         girls.  This is too much.  They got 
                         guns pointed at 'em!

                         These boys know what they're doin'.

               Max climbs out of the chopper.  Hal sits for a moment and 
               then leaps out and follows Max.

               They look at each other, look back at the wall of police

                         I'm sorry to bother you, I know you're 
                         real busy right now, but how many 
                         times, Max?  How many times has that 
                         woman gotta be fucked over?  You 
                         could lift one finger and save her 
                         ass and you won't even do that?

                                     MAX
                              (grabbing Hal)
                         Get a hold of yourself!  You are way 
                         out of your jurisdiction, now come 
                         on!  Calm down!  Don't make me sorry 
                         I let you come!

               Max lets go of Hal's lapels.

                                     HAL
                              (under his breath)
                         Shit!  I can't fucking believe this!

               Hal walks along with a look of total disbelief on his face.  
               He's shaking his head.  Slowly he breaks into a trot and 
               starts heading toward the front line.

                                     MAX
                              (shouting)
                         Hey.  Hey!

               Hal is running now and clears the front row of cars.

               There is a lot of confusion among the officers on the front 
               row.  Some shout, some lower their guns to look.

                                     ARIZONA COP #1
                         What in the hell?!

                                     ARIZONA #2
                              (lowering his rifle)
                         The son of a bitch is in my way!

               INT.  CAR - DAY

               They are still looking at each other really hard.

                                     THELMA
                         You're a good friend.

                                     LOUISE
                         You, too, sweetie, the best.

               SHOOT WITH OR WITHOUT.

               MUSIC:  B.B. King song entitled "Better Not Look Down" begins.  
               It is very upbeat.

                                     LOUISE
                         Are you sure?

               Thelma nods.

                                     THELMA
                         Hit it.

               Louise puts the car in gear and FLOORS it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT.  DESERT - DAY

               Hal's eyes widen for a moment at what he sees, and then a 
               sense of calm overtakes him and he mouths the word "alright."

                                     B.B. KING SONG (V.O.)
                         I've been around, I've seem some 
                         things, People movin' faster than 
                         the speed of sound, faster than a 
                         speedin' bullet.  People livin' like 
                         Superman, all day and all night.  I 
                         won't say if it's wrong or I won't 
                         say if it's right.  I'm pretty fast 
                         myself.  But I do have some advice 
                         to pass along, right here in the 
                         words to this song...

               EXT.  DESERT - DAY

               The cops all lower their weapons as looks of shock and 
               disbelief cover their faces.  A cloud of dust blows THROUGH 
               THE FRAME as the speeding car sails over the edge of the 
               cliff.

                                     B.B. KING SONG (V.O.)
                         Better not look down, if you wanna 
                         keep on flyin'.  Put the hammer down, 
                         keep it full speed ahead.  Better 
                         not look back or you might just wind 
                         up cryin'.  You can keep it movin' 
                         if you don't look down...

                                                                   FADE OUT

                                         THE END
