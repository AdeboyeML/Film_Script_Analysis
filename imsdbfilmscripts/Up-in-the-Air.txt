          MONTAGE BEGINS AS A SERIES OF IMAGES:
                         
          - Ryan and Alex getting dressed in a little kitchen in the
          church. They're in a hurry and a little sloppy, but there's a
          crooked joy in their faces.
                         
          - Jim standing at the alter with the priest getting a pat on

          - The band does a cheesy choreographed dance step.
                         
          - Jim makes a speech. He is not good at public speaking, but

          - Ryan pulls Kara onto the dance floor. She rests her head on
          his shoulder and they slow dance.

          INT. CONCOURSE, MILWAUKEE AIRPORT - MORNING
                         
          Ryan and Alex stand between their gates. One sign reads
          OMAHA. The other sign reads CHICAGO.
                         
                          ALEX
           When am I going to see you?
                         
                          RYAN
           You're just going to have to come
           and visit.
                         
                          ALEX
           So settled down. You're not going
           to change on me...
                         
                          RYAN
           Same guy. Just one address.
                         
          We hear a boarding announcement for Chicago. Alex begins to
          step away to her gate.
                         
                          ALEX
           Call me if you get lonely.
                         
          A beat. And then...
                         
                          RYAN
           ... I'm lonely.
                         
          Alex turns for her gate and joins the crowd. Ryan goes to say
          something. He has an impulse... but he finally ignores it and
          gets in line under the sign that reads "OMAHA".

          The door opens and Ryan wheels in his Roll-Away. He walks over
          to the window, parts the blinds and checks out his awful view.
           100.
                         
                         
          We see Ryan opening some mail. We see Ryan laying in bed.
                         
          It's quiet. It's alone.

          Natalie is giving Ryan a tour of the new ONLINE FIRING AREA -
          A series of cubicles with YOUNG GUYS ON HEADSETS. She is in
          her element and very proud of her work.
                         
                          NATALIE
           ... Some guy sits down in a
           conference room somewhere and a
           server routes their session to one
           of our termination engineers.
                         
                          RYAN
           You don't actually call them that.
                         
                          NATALIE
           I prefer "terminators", but it
           bumped with legal.
                         
                          RYAN
           Really? I can't imagine why.
                         
                          NATALIE
           They follow a workflow that can take
           them through anything from a standard
           dismissal to a violent aggressor.
                         
                          RYAN
           Are they actually on line, right now?
                         
                          NATALIE
           No, they're beta-testing. Role-playing.
           We go live at the end of the month.
           (catches one of the guys
           making a mistake)
           Kyle, you're running through the
           events too quickly. You have to give
           them time to acknowledge each
           statement. Okay? It's a legal thing.
                         
          Ryan can only watch.
                         
                         
          INT. RYAN'S OFFICE, CTC - DAY
                         
          Ryan is sitting at his desk. He puts on a HEADSET.

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, CTC - ANOTHER DAY
                         
          Craig is leading a meeting. Ryan seems focused on something
          on his laptop. We see his screen: An itinerary for GoalQuest.

          Ryan sits on a sofa, holding his BACKPACK. A slick GOALQUEST
          HOST enters the room.
                         
                          GOALQUEST HOST
           You ready to rock?

          INT. CONVENTION HALL, LAS VEGAS - DAY
                         
          Ryan stands in the wings. He takes a breath, then steps out
          in front of a sea of people.
                         
          The GOALQUEST XX stage is like nothing we've seen yet. Large
          and professional. Blue Banners hang from the ceiling. Digital
          projectors show Ryan's Headshot - What's In Your Backpack?
                         
          Ryan sets the BACK PACK on a table and quickly unzips it.
                         
          A breath.
                         
                          RYAN
           Last year, I flew three hundred
           fifty thousand miles. The moon is
           only two fifty.
                         
          A long beat. Uncomfortable. Ryan looks at the back pack.
                         
                          RYAN
           Imagine for a second that you're
           carrying a backpack... I want you
           to feel the straps on your
           shoulders... You feel them?
                         
          Ryan isn't feeling them. He is not inspired. He isn't
          believable. He's barely even there.
           102.
                         
                         
                          RYAN
           Now, I want you to pack it with all
           the stuff you have in your life.
           Start with the little things.
                         
          Ryan is trying, but he can't find the will to do this.
                         
                          RYAN
           The... um... The stuff in drawers
           and on shelves.
                         
          Ryan takes a beat. He just stares at the backpack and thinks
          about all the things he has removed from it... And then...
                         
                          RYAN
           Excuse me.
                         
          And with that, Ryan leaves the stage. Handlers try to figure
          out what Ryan is doing. The Host runs for the mic.

          She's wearing sweatpants and glasses. She's at home. She

          Alex is still speechless. Her eyes are angry and apologizing
          all at the same time.
