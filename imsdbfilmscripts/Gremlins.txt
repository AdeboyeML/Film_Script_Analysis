          HONG KONG - AN OUTDOOR MARKETPLACE
          Crowded. Filled with oriental and British merchants.
          You can buy anything here. Electronics. Food. Any-
          thing.

          RAND PELTZER
          walks through the owd. An American businessman.1-He
          wears a tas eful g3,y suit. He's thin, with distinguished
          good looks and thin brown hair. He's 56 years old.
          Rand looks around; fascinated by the vast array of people
          and merchandise. He stops at a booth. A tiny ORIENTAL,
          WOMAN stands behind the counter. Rand gives her a polite
          smile.

          RAND
          Hi. I'm from out of town...
          on business from the U.S.
          The woman nods and smiles.

          AN ORIENTAL MAN
          passes by. He is very old. Deep wrinkles. Long white
          hair. Ragged clothes. A rotted smile. Overhearing
          Rand, the man stops to eavesdrop.

          RAND
          (explaining to
          Oriental woman)
          I'm looking for a present...
          for my son.
          The woman nods. She searches through her wares. She
          holds up a basketball. Rand shakes his head.

          RAND
          He's not really involved in
          sports...
          The woman puts away the basketball. She picks up a Sony
          "Walkman". Rand again shakes his head.,

          RAND
          No. I want something unusual...
          something he can't get at home...
          something different..

          
          

          .2.

          A HAND
          reaches out and grabs Rand's arm. Startled, he turns.
          The Oriental man stands before him. He stares into Rand's
          eyes.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          I can help you.
          He leads Rand away from the booth.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          I offer something very different.
          Very unusual.
          Rand is puzzled. The Oriental leads him to a doorway.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          Follow me.
          He opens the door, motioning for Rand to follow. Rand
          pauses, skeptical.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          Come. Take a look. It will cost
          you nothing.
          (a beat)
          You won't be disappointed.
          The Oriental enters. Rand shrugs and follows.

          INSIDE
          Rand follows the man up a narrow, dark set of stairs.
          At the top, they enter a room.

          INT. ROOM

          Dark. No windows. No furniture. Filled with cardboard
          boxes and wooden crates.
          Rand crinkles his nose. It su,Qlls bad in here.
          The Oriental flips on a dim light bulb. He leads the
          nervous, apprehensive Rand to a dark corner of the room.
          The Oriental picks up a small, metal box. A HIGH PITCHED
          GIGGLE echoes from inside the box.

          

          

          

          

          3.
          Rand is very puzzled.
          The Oriental rests the box on a stack of crates. He opens
          the box.
          A TINY CREATURE is inside'.
          The animal is eleven inches tall and stands; upright on
          two legs. It has two arms, with small; four-fingered
          hands. Its body is covered with fluffy brown fur. The
          piercing eyes are big, sad. Its ears are long and pointed.
          A tiny black nose sits above a wide mouth, with small,
          square teeth.
          The creature is smiling. It lets out a giggle.
          Rand is delighted and surprised. He's never seen anything
          like this. The animal is more charming than a Disney
          character.
          The Oriental claps his hands.
          The creature leaps from the box, onto Rand's shoulder.
          The animal licks Rand's cheek.' He laughs, amused by the
          creature.
          The Oriental claps his hands again.
          The creature hops back into the box. It stares at Rand
          with those cute green eyes'.

          RAND
          (to the Oriental)
          What is it?

          ORIENTAL MAN
          It is called ' Mogwai ' .
          (a beat)
          A very rare and intelligent animal.
          I found it in the fields near my
          home It will obey all orders.
          It learns fast.
          The Oriental looks at Mogwai and claps his hands.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          (Chinese,; English

          SUBTITLES)

          

          

          

          

          4
          --Mogwai leaps to the ground. It scurries across the floor,
          to a wooden crate.
          Mogwai removes a raw tuna from the crate. It tears off a
          chunk of the fish and carries it to the oriental man..
          He takes the fish. Mogwai hops back into the box.
          Rand shakes his head. Amazed by the animal.
          he Oriental takes a bit from the raw fish. Juice runs
          own his chin. He smiles at Rand.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          And if you are ever in need of
          a song...
          He claps his hands to the creature.

          ORIENTAL MAN.
          (Chinese; English

          SUBTITLES)
          Music.
          Mogwai begins to hum, in an unearthly falsetto. It's
          beautiful.
          Rand watches with wide eyes. He feels like a child again.

          RAND -
          How much?

          ORIENTAL MAN
          One hundred American Dollars.
          Cash.
          Rand removes five twenties from his wallet. He gives
          them to the man.
          The Oriental smiles and claps his hands. Mogwai jumps
          onto Rand's shoulders. Rand pets it. Mogwai emits a cute
          giggle.

          ORIENTAL MAN
          It never sleeps. It will eat any-
          thing... but prefers raw meat.

          (PAUSE)
          It must always be kept indoors during
          the day. It lives in shadow. It
          hates bright light. Direct sunlight
          will kill it.
          Rand nods. He takes Mogwai from his shoulder and puts it
          into the box. Rand puts the box under his arm. The
          Oriental smiles

          

          

          

          

          ORIENTAL MAN
          Your son will enjoy his new friend.
          Rand smiles and exits. The Oriental takes a bite from
          his raw fish.

          Rand is on the pay telephon His baggage rests beside
          him.
          Mogwai is inside of a small plastic pet box. The creature's
          bright eyes shine from inside.

          RAND
          (into the phone)
          Yes, Fred. The Tai-Chan account
          is definite. MmmHmm. My plane
          l eaves in twenty minutes. See
          you in Pennsylvania.
          He hangs up. He picks up his bags and walks to the check-
          in counter.

          THE CHECK-IN GIRL
          tags Mogwai's box and puts it on the conveyer belt.
          Rand watches the box disappear through the baggage chute.

          CHECK-IN GIRL
          Don't worry, sir. Your pet will
          be safe.
          Rand smiles.

          Rand is eating his airline dinner. AN ORIENTAL STEWARDESS
          walks up and refills his coffee. He looks at her.
          with the word 'Mogwai'?

          She nods.

          RAND
          What does it mean?

          STEWARDESS
          Devil.
          She moves to the next passenger.
          Rand stares. Surprised. Confused.

          BILLY PELTZER
          a bank teller, writes out a receipt for a customer.

          

          

          

          

          7.
          Billy is 26 years old. His sturdy build and good looks are
          buried beneath wire rimmed glasses, slicked dirty-blonde
          .hair, a red sweater vest, a loose fitting checkered shirt,
          baggy corduroys and worn loafers.
          râ¢ Finishing the transaction with his customer, Billy looks to
          the line of waiting people.

          BILLY
          Next.

          MRS. DEAGLE
          an elderly woman, walks to Billy's window. She's a real
          prude. Tight lips. Heavy make-up. Bleached hair. Cheap
          fur coat. She hands Billy a personal check.

          TRACY ALLEN
          another teller, works beside Billy. Tracy is pretty. Big
          brown eyes. A sexy smile. Long dark hair. Perfect figure.
          25 years old.
          Tracy counts out some cash to a customer. She's trying
          to concentrate, to keep her mind on work.. But it's diffi-
          cult when

          GARY LUCIA
          the bank security guard, is trying to make her laugh. He
          stands by the bank entrance, making funny faces at Tracy.
          Gary is 30 years old. Former high school jock. Dark,
           thick hair. Deep brown eyes. Muscular. A strong, handsome
          face.
          Meanwhile, Billy gives the check back to Mrs. Deagle.

          BILLY
          I can't cash this, M'am. Your
          last check hasn't cleared.

          MRS. DEAGLE
          Don't you recognize me?

          BILLY
          No, M'am. I'm sorry...

          

          

          

          

          8.

          MRS. DEAGLE
          (loud, so everyone can

          HEAR)
          My name is Mrs. Julia Deagle! My
          husband manages the.Sparkle Market!
          We've been banking here for sixteen
          years!

          c eck hasn't cleared and...

          MRS. DEAGLE
          That's the problem with this world.
          It's a mess because of people like

          JI$

          BILLY
          It's not my.fault your check didn't
          clear, M'am,

          MRS. DEAGLE
          Don't get smart with me, oung man.

          BILLY
          I wasn't getting smart, I was...

          MRS. DEAGLE
          (shouting,-looking

          AROUND)
          Where's the president? I want to
          see the bank president!
          Billy rubs his eyes. Tense. Embarrassed.
          Everyone watches the scene. Tracy. Gary. The customers.

          ROLAND FRESCO
          the bank's Vice President, walks over to Billy and Mrs.
          beagle. Roland is tall, slender with thin grey hair and
          a pencil thin moustache. Friendliness and courtesy are
          his job. He smiles at Mrs. Deagle.

          ROLAND
          What seems to be the problem,
          M'am?

          MRS. DEAGLE
          My name is Mrs. Julia Deagle. This
          young teller is being very rude! I
          demand that you fire him!

          

          

          

          

          9
          Roland looks at Billy. Billy rolls his eyes. Roland
          smiles.

          ROLAND

          (COMFORTING)
          Now,-Mrs. Deagle...I'm sure this
          isn't that serious. I'm sure an
          apology would fix things right
          up. Wouldn't it?
          The woman shrugs.' Roland turns to Billy.

          ROLAND
          Apologize to the woman, Billy.
          Billy leans to Roland.

          BILLY
          (angry whisper)
          I. didn't do anything wrong.

          AA;

          ROLAND
          (doesn't care, the
          customer comes first)
          Just apologize.
          Roland.leans back and smiles at Mrs. Deagle.
          Billy looks at her. He doesn'-t want to do this.
          Everyone in the bank is watching him, waiting for him
          to take a stand.
          Billy sighs. He needs his job.

          BILLÂ°
          (forcing himself)
          I'm sorry, Mrs. Deagle.
          She nods and smiles. Roland puts his hand on the woman's
          shoulder.

          ROLAND
          Come back to my desk, Mrs. Deagle.
          I'll personally take care of your
          banking problems.
          Roland walks back to his office with Mrs. Deagle.
          Gary chuckles. Tracy goes back to work.
          Billy just sits. Angry. Humiliated. He calls the next
          customer.

          King". He walks to the bank lobby.

          TRACY
          stands in the lobby, putting on.her coat. Billy moves to
          help her.

          BILLY
          Let me.
          He helps her on with the coat.

          BILLY
          You look very pretty today.

          TRACY

          TRACY

          You're cute.
          Gary walks up. He puts his arm through Tracy's.

          GARY
          Let's go. I'm hungry.
          (notices Billy)
          Hey, Peltzer...Whydidn't you stand.

          GARY
          What's this?

          BILLY
          It's a book. You read 1t.
          Billy exchanges a smile with Tracy. Gary isn't amused.

          GARY
          I know that, asshole. I meant
          what's it about?

          C'mon. Let's go.
          Tracy gives a wave to Billy. She and Gary walk away.
          Billy watches. He draws an imaginary sword from his side.
          He lifts the sword and lunges forward. At Gary.
          Billy sits at a table. Alone. He's reading his book. He
          eats, but his wide eyes never leave the page. He's fas-
          cinated by the story. Like a child. He gets to a funny
          section.. He laughs.

          That's the kind of guy who'll shoot
          a president.

          .And the snow keeps coming, folks.
          Looks like we're gonna have a White
          Christmas. Another three inches is
          expected tonight...
          Billy looks out of his side window and sees

          PETE FOUNTANE
          walking home from school. Pete is 16 years old. A chunky,
           pleasant baby faced kid. With his bright orange down jacket,
          Pete resembles a tiny snowman.
          Suddenly, Pete.slips on the ice. Bam. Right on his ass.
          His school books scatter over the ground.

          Billy stops the car. He gets out and hurries to Pete.

          BILLY
          Pete...You okay?
          Pete nods. Billy helps him up. Pete brushes himself off.
          Billy is amused by the boy.

          BILLY
          You want a ride home?

          PETE
          Thanks. That'd be nice.
          Billy helps Pete pick up his schoolbooks.

          PETE
          (impressed by
          Billy's storytelling)
          Wow...
          Billy digs into his pocket and gives Pete the copy of
          "Once And Future King".

          BILLY
          Here. You can borrow it.
          Pete takes the book.

          PETE
          Hey, Billy...You know so much about
          Vikings and stuff...You should
          write one of these stories yourself.

          But as soon as it's published, you'll
          get one of the first copies. Speci-

          Pete smiles. Billy makes a turn. He pulls into the parking
          lot of

          DOUGAL'S ANTIQUES
          A huge, three story home, with an antique shop set up on
          the first floor.
          Billy and Pete get out of the car and enter the store.

          DORRY DOUGAL
          the 64 year old storekeeper, stands behind the counter.
          Dorry is husky, bald on top, with thick patches of red hair
          on his temples. A huge, red moustache sits beneath his
          bulbous nose. His arms are thick, hairy. A strong Irish-
          man.

          DORRY
          Good afternoon to you, Billy.

          BILLY
          Hi, Dorry.
          (eyes light)
          Is it ready yet?
          Dorry smiles. He reaches to a shelf behind the counter.
          He removes ,a long object, wrapped in a piece of green cloth.
          He rests it on the counter.

          Billy watches with.wide eyes. Pete is curious.
          Dorry slowly unwraps the object. Inside the cloth, is a
          long silver sword, with a gleaming blade and an engraved
          steel.holster.. - Pete is impressed..

          DORRY
          (to Pete)
          It's an authentic replica of an
          Eleventh Century sword.
          Billy's eyes examine every inch of the sword. It's
          beautiful.

          DORRY
          I got most of the rust off...But
          there were a couple spots that
          wouldn't budge.
          Billy runs his finger along the blade.

          DORRY
          Careful. It's sharp.
          A big smile covers Billy's face.- He's in love with the
          sword.

          BILLY
          What do I owe you?

          DORRY
          Two hundred. You can pay me twenty
          a week.
          Billy pulls a twenty from his wallet and pays Dorry.
          Billy carefully wraps the sword and puts it under his
          arm.

          BILLY
          Thanks, Dorry.

          DORRY
          My pleasure, son.

          BILLY
          Okay.

          ironed, or that you have a hot
          meal on the table...

          BILLY
          No. It isn't. I'm old enough
          to take care of that stuff myself.
          I'm old enough to get a place of
          my own.

          LYNN
          Don't start that again. Your
          Father's coming home tonight.

          Good. I think we should talk
          about it.

          LYNN
          It'll put him in a bad mood.

          BILLY
          No, it'll put you in a bad mood.
          Lynn and Billy exchange a glare. They look down at their
          food.
          A few silent, uncomfortable moments pass.
          Lynn looks back to Billy. She smiles. Time for the
          tender approach. She touches his hand.

          old and grey, working on my 25th

          Lynn stands and whispers to Billy.

          LYNN
          Please, let's forget about this.
          Just for tonight. Okay?
          Billy pauses. Finally gives in and nods.
          Lynn stands. She pops another valium and exits to greet
          her husband. We hear them, exchange an excited ".hello".
          They kiss and laugh, glad to be in each other's arms.
          Billy just sits. Burning.

          Hi, Dad.
          They hold each other for a second. Lynn closes the front
          door. Rand picks up Mogwai's case. Lynn turn's to her
          husband.

          RAND
          (takes Lynn's hand)
          Not now. I've got a surprise for
          both of you. Come on.
          He leads them into the living room. Lynn and. Billy exchange
          a puzzled glance. They follow Rand.

          INT. LIVING ROOM

          Rand dims the lights. He motions for Billy and Lynn to
          sit on the sofa. They do. Barney sits on Billy's lap.
          Rand sits in front of them, on a leather easy chair. He
          rests Mogwai's case on his lap. He opens the case.
          Mogwai leaps out, onto the coffee table.
          Lynn and'Bill are startled. They stare at the creature in
          wonderment.
          Barney hates it. He growls at Mogwai.

          

          

          

          

          21.
          Rand lights a cigarette. He turns to Mogwai and claps
          his hands. The creature picks up an ash tray and carries
          it to Rand. Mogwai hops onto Rand's lap.
          Lynn and Billy are amazed...

          BILLY
          (staring at Mogwai)
          What is it? A.monkey? A rat?.

          RAND
          Your new pet.

          BILLY

          (UNCERTAIN)
          Mj Oh, yeah?...
          Mogwai starts to sing, humming in that unearthly falsetto.

          BILLY
          What's that?

          RAND
          He's singing.

          BILLY
          Sounds kind of creepy.
          Barney still growls.

          RAND
          Barney! Be a good dog and go up-
          stairs!
          Barney reluctantly hops off Billy's lap and exits.
          Lynn stares at Mogwai.

          LYNN
          I think he's just darling.
          Mogwai.
          Rand holds the creature out to Billy.

          Maybe later.

          RAND
          C'mon. He won't bite.
          Billy forces himself to take the creature. Mogwai nestles
          close to Billy. Rand smiles at his son.

          RAND
          He likes you.
          Billy looks nauseous. Lynn stands.

          LYNN
          You two look so cute together.
          I have to take a picture.
          Lynn walks to a nearby drawer, opens it and removes-a
          Kodak Instamatic.
          Mogwai is on Billy's shoulder, licking his cheek.. Billy
          hates it.

          RAND -
          I want you to take good care
          of him.
          Lynn focuses the camera on Billy and Mogwai.

          LYNN
          Okay smile.
          Billy forces a smile. Mogwai still licks his cheek.
          Lynn snaps the picture. Flash!
          Mogwai lets out a high scream. Frightened of the bright
          light, Mogwai jumps back, accidentally scratching Billy's
          cheek.

          BILLY
          Little bastard.
          Mogwai scurries back to Rand. He pets the creature,
          comforting it

          Settle down, Billy-There's no
          reason to get upset. The little
          fellow's scared. He hates bright
          light..
          Billy shrugs. He wipes his fingers along the scratch on
          his face. He looks -at t em.
          There's blood on hisï¿½4ingertips.
          Billy looks at Mogwai.
          The creature looks at Billy. It giggles.

          area.
          Mogwai watches Billy. from the darkness of the book shelves.
          Above Billy., The creature begins to sing.
          Billy tries to ignore Mogwai's singing. No good. It gets
          on his nerves. Billy slams his hand on the desk top. He
          glares at the creature.

          BILLY
          Shut up.
          Mogwai stops singing. Billy goes back to his writing.
          Mogwai.hops from the shelf. Staying out of the direct
          light, the creature moves across the desktop and cuddles
          up to Billy's arm. He jumps back.

          BILLY
          Get off of me.
          Mogwai just looks at him.

          BILLY
          Get.off`my desk.
          Billy shines the bright.desk light into the creature's
          eyes. Mogwai screams and jumps. off the desk, to the floor.

          Billy goes back to his work.
          Mogwai is-bored. The creature leaps up to the bed.. It
          sees the sword. Mogwai lifts one end, examining it. It's
          too heavy. The sword slips off the bed and falls to the
          floor.
          Billy turns.
          Mogwai takes a step back. Guilty. Frightened.
          Billy picks up the sword. The handle is chipped.

          BILLY
          (angry, to Mogwai)
          You stupid little...
          Billy raises the sword over.Mogwai. He's ready to kill
          the tiny creature.
          Mogwai loo] .s up at Billy. The creature is shivering. It
          is frightened. It's big, green eyes are watery.
          Billy suddenly feels sympathetic. He lowers the sword and
          picks up the.creature.

          BILLY

          (TENDER)
          I'm sorry.. .just try to be more

           CAR. RADIO (V.0.)
          It looks like the snow has stopped
          for awhile. But don't put away those
          ear muffs, more flurries are
          scheduled for tonight...

          Tracy is getting out of her car. Billy walks up to her.

          BILLY
          Starting work early today?

          TRACY
          Oh, hi. Well, I thought the
          roads would be icy.

          BILLY
          We've got a half hour before
          work. Wanna go have a cup of
          coffee?

          BILLY
          .and if I sell the novel, I'll
          â¢be able to quit the bank.

          TRACY
          I'd love to quit. I'd run straight
          to the airport and buy a one way
          ticket to Paris.

          BILLY
          Why Paris?

          TRACY
          I've only seen it in movies and
          T.V... . But it seems like it's
          got everything that this town
          doesn't...Museums...great restaur
          ants... Beautiful artworks and
          architecture...
          (embarr-a s-s-ed )
          Listen to me, talking like I've
          been there 10 times. I shouldn't
          get so carried away. It's only a
          dream.

          BILLY
          Hey...Don't give up on your dreams.
          They just might come true.
          Tracy shrugs and takes a sip of coffee.

          BILLY
          Can I ask you a personal question?
          (Tracy nods)
          What is it with you and Gary? Is
          he your boyfriend?

          TRACY
          He thinks he is.

          BILLY
          Do you think he is?

          TRACY
          No. I think of him more as a friend.
          But he thinks of me as a lot more.

          BILLY
          So there's a possibility...I mean...
          I.just might have a chance with you?

          TRACY
          (smiles),
          Don't give up on your dreams. They
          just might come true.
          They both laugh.

          CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL
          Standing across the street, looking into the coffee shop
          window. He watches Billy and Tracy. An angry, jealous

          Dimly lint with Billy's small desk lamp. Billy waters his
          pl)ants_ ith a.spray bottle.,
          Mggwai's case sits on the ed. The creature is inside.
          Billy finishes his watering. He sits at his desk. He
          takes adrink from glass of milk and snacks from a plate
          of brownies. He proofreads some pages from his novel.

          PETE (O.S.)
          Hello? Is anybody home?

          BILLY

          (SHOUTS)
          n here, Pete.
          Billy holds the tray of brownies to him.

          BILLY
          Want some?

          PETE _
          I'm s'posed to be on a diet...
          He grabs a brownie. He notices Mogwai's case.

          PETE
          What's in there?
          Pete walks over and opens the case. Mogwai hops out, onto
          the bed. The creature giggles. Pete is, taken aback.

          PETE
          What is it?

          BILLY
          A present from my Dad.
          Pete picks up the creature and pets it. Pete likes Mogwai.

          PETE
          It's neat.
          Billy shrugs. Mogwai sees the brownies. The creature hops
          from Pete's hands, onto the desk. Mogwai grabs a brownie
          and starts to eat.

          

          

          

          

          28.

          PETE
          Hey, Billy.. .You think I might
          be able to borrow it? Just for
          a night?

          BILLY
          I dunno, Pete...

          PETE
          C'mon...My Mom will never know.
          I'll hide it under my bed.
          Pete reaches down to pick up Mogwai. His hand clumsily
          knocks over the water bottle.
          A few drops of water splash Mogwai.
          The creature arches its back and lets out a high pitched
          scream.
          Billy is surprised. Pete takes a step back. Scared.
          Mogwai tenses up. The spots on its body that were hit with
          water begin to bubble... .expand...'
          Billy can't believe his eyes.
          Mogwai writhes in pain. The spots on its body expand more,
          getting bigger, bigger.. .ready to explode.
          Billy and Pete stare. Fascinated.
          The spots burst.

          FOUR NEW CREATURES
          popout. Clones of Mogwai.
          The spots on Mogwai's body bond together and disappear, as
          if they were never there.
          There are now five identical creatures on the desktop.
          Billy and Pete share a shocked glance.
          Billy grabs the water bottle. He has to be certain that
          he wasn't halucinating. He splashes a little more water
          on one of the new creatures.
          The process begins again. The creature's body,contorts.
          A few lumps form. The lumps expand until...they burst.

          THREE MORE CREATURES ARE BORN.
          Billy tries to make sense out of it all.
          EIGHT CREATURES stand on.the desk top, examining their
          new world.
          Billy picks up his glass of milk. He splashes some milk
          on one of the crealtures.
          Nothing happens.

          BILLY
          They must only multiply with plain
          tap water.

          Wow..â¢.thisâ¢is better than "Twilight Zone ( )
          Pete looks at Billy.

          PETE
          Now can I have one?

          BILLY
          (still dazed)
          Huh? Well, yeah. I guess so.
          Pete grabs one of the creatures, taking it from the group.
          It cries out. In a high, piercing scream.
          The other creatures leap at Pete. They grab the creature
          and bring it back to their group.

          PETE

          (SCARED)
          Maybe I won't take one.
          The creatures have moved to the brownies. They rip the
          brownies to pieces, devouring them. They're giggling.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Rand sits in a chair, opposite Billy. The 8 creatures

          these things.

          RAND
          We know they're cute.. We know.."
          they're intelligent. And now we
          know they multiply by water.

          BILLY

          I mean, if I throw water onï¿½Barney
          over there, we're not gonna;getjten

          A creature licks Rand's ear. He chuckles.

          RAND
          All I know, is that I've got a million
          dollars sitting in my lap.

          BILLY
          Huh?

          RAND
          I'm going to market these things.

          BILLY

          Oh, Christ. C'mo'i,Dad...that's ...

          RAND
          Just imagine the excitement when
          word gets out. Everyone will want
          a Mogwai of their very own.

          BILLY
          Don't you think we should have them
          checked out first? Just to make
          sure...

          The sun rises behind the house. Snow is falling.

          INT. ATTIC

           The tr p door opens. Billy and Rand climb inside. They
           .both carry flashlights.
          They s ine the lights through the attic, looking for the
          creatu es. They see nothing.
           Billy spots something. He nudges his Father.
           There are NINE INDIVIDUAL PODS, stuck to various places-on
          the floor. The pods are 16 inches long, 12 inches in dia-
           meter. They are wrapped with a vein-like wire and covered
          with a thick, syrupy glaze.

          RAND
          What in the hell?...
          Billy picks up a broomstick andl pokes one of the things.
          Won't budge. Hard as a rock.

          BILLY
          Damn things are stuck to the
          floor.
          Rand picks up a baseball bat. He raises it over his head
          and swings down, hard. Against the pod.
          The bat snaps in two.
          The pod is unblemished.
          Rand rubs his stinging hands. Billy and Rand just look
          at each other. Puzzled.

          Roy Hanson sits with Billy and Rand. Lynn pours them
          coffee. Roy has just examined the pods.

          Like a butterfly?

          ROY
          Exactly. Those things in the
          attic-are cocoons. Inside,. the
          creatures are going through some
          sort of change...a metamorphosis.

          BILLY
          Why did they attack my dog?

          ROY
          Simple. They're animals. They
          were hungry. Aside from water,
          food is their main concern.

          RAND
          How long until they hatch?

          ROY
          A week...a month...I really can't
          say.

          BILLY

          (STANDS)
          I'm not waiting around to find
          out.

          ROY
          Billy, don't be hasty...You've
          stumbled onto a new life form.
          What comes out of those cocoons
          could be a major scientific
          discovery...

          BILLY
          Screw'science. I want them des-
          troyed.

          RAND
          Billy ...Maybe Mr. Hanson's got
          a point...

          BILLY
          (stern, bitter)
          Dad, they killed Barney. Or
          have you already forgotten?
          Rand just looks'at his son. Lynn pops a valium in the
          background.

          Red hot light. The flame of a torch.

          CAMERA PANS UP TO
          RAND. He's holding the gas torch, aiming it at the cocoon.
          Billy stands beside him. They're inside-theattic.
          Rand shuts off the torch. He touches the cocoon. It
          appears unharmed.

          RAND
          Not even warm.
          (shakes his head,

          SURPRISED)
          They're indestructible.

          BILLY
          Now what do we do?

          RAND
          I get back from Seattle on
          Wednesday. I'll call some con-
          struction people. They'll come
          in next week and cut these things
          out of the floor.

          BILLY
          I don't think we should wait. Let's
          do it ourselves.

          RAND
          No. It's late. I've got an early
          plane to catch.

          (PAUSE)
          The attic door is locked. There are
          no windows up here. Nothing can get
          in or out.
          Rand pats Billy on the back.

          RAND
          Son, you've got to stop worrying.

          CLOSE UP - BILLY
          A doubtful, uncertain expression on his face.

          INT. ATTIC

          The cocoons are bubbling furiously; as if they were being
          baked in an oven.
          Suddenly, a crack appears on one. Then another. And
          another. Cracks begin to cover all the cocoons.
          Green smoke seeps from the thin openings. A slow soft
          hiss is heard.
          They're hatching.

          Billy looks away. Angry. Saddened.
          He notices the cocoons. All hatched.
          Sounds echo from downstairs. Thumps. Giggles.
          Billy's face goes white with fear. There's more.
          He dashes out of the attic.

          UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
          Billy walks slowly. Clutching his sword. Ready for an
          attack.
          He descends the stairs.

          A CREATURE
          leaps from the overhead chandelier. It lands on Billy's
          back.
          The creature tries to bite Billy's neck.
          Billy slams his blade 'nto Mogwai. He whacks the creature.
          Again and again.
          Finally, Mogwai falls to the floor.
          Billy brings down his blade. Hard.
          It slices Mogwai's head off. The creature's body quivers.
          It dies.
          Billy moves to the living room.

          LIVING ROOM
          Dimly lit. The fireplace burns. The Christmas tree lights
          flash.
          Billy enters.

          AN OBJECT
          flies at Billy from across the room. He ducks.
          A DINNER PLATE smashes against the wall behind him.
          Billy looks to the

          CHINA CABINET.
          A CREATURE sits on the middle shelf. Giggling. It throws
          another plate at-Billy.
          He bats the plate away with his sword.
          Mogwai continues to throw plates at him.
          Billy dodges the plates, making his way to the China Cabinet.
          There, he lunges forward with his sword. Bullseye. Mogwai
          is stabbed. Straight through the chest.

          The creature screams, writhing in pain. It falls from the
          China shelf to the floor. Dead.
          Billy slowly moves across the room. His eyes dart back
          and forth, looking for creatures.'
          He walks by the fireplace.
          Three large RED VELVET STOCKINGS hang from the mantle.
          Each one is inscribed with a name: BILLY, RAND and LYNN.

          A-CREATURE
          pops out of each stocking. Growling. Snarling.
          Startled, Billy jumps back.
          The three creatures hop to the floor and move towards

          BILLY:
          He clutches his sword. Tight.
          Two creatures leap at him.
          He spears one in mid-air.
          He quickly spins around, knocking the other Mogwai to the
          ground. He stabs the creature in the throat. He twists
          the sword until Mogwai chokes to death on its own blood.
          The remaining creature attaches itself to Billy's leg.
          It takes a bite from his calf.
          Billy cries out in pair.
          Mogwai stays on. Biting hard.
          Billy kicks his leg near the fireplace.
          Scared of the firelight, Mogwai lets go.
          Billy stabs the creature.. He holds Mogwai in the roaring
          flames of the fireplace. Mogwai screams until it burns to
          a crisp.
          Billy removes his steaming sword.
          The charred creature collapses into the flames. Dead.
          Billy checks his leg. A small bite.
          He walks to the kitchen.

          Billy stands quietly!'in the doorway.

          TWO CREATURES
          are inside. They don't notice Billy.
          One has crawled into the large blender. It laps up the
          left over white icing.
          The other sits on the table. It nibbles on the Santa cookies.
          Billy looks at the bl!ende1r. It's' unplugged.
          Billy moves quickly. He dashes across the room and plugs
          in the blender. It starts with'a loud whirr.
          The startled creature spins inside.. Mogwai's screams
          die as it is chopped into a green mush.
          The remaining creature growls at Billy.
          Billy lunges forward with his sword.
          Mogwai leaps out of the way, onto the kitchen cabinet.
          Billy turns to the creature.
          Mogwai stands in front of the open microwave oven.
          Billy pokes at the creature with his sword.
          Mogwai takes a few steps back.
          Billy still pokes at Mogwai, forcing the creature into
          the oven.
          Billy quickly closes theoven door.
          Mogwai is trapped inside.

          Billy flips the oven switch to "bake". The microwave
          purrs.
          Inside, Mogwai screams and pounds against the glass door.
          Soon, the creature falls.' Its body quivers. The armor-,.
          like skin bubbles and pops. Mogwai boils to death.
          Bill wipes the swea from hs brow and exits the kitchen.

          LIVING ROOM
          Billy enters. He looks at the dead creatures. He sighs.
          Relieved. They're all gone.
          Billy rests his sword against the wall. He picks up the
          telephone and dials "0".

          BILLY
          Yes, could you connect me with
          the Sheriff's Office?...

          A SWIFT SHADOW
          moves across the floor, behind Billy.

          BILLY
          Hello? ...Is this Sheriff Lucia?...

          A CLAW
          tears the phone cord from the wall.

          Billy turns. Face to face with Mogwai.
          Billy glances to his sword. A few feet away. Against
          the wall.
          Mogwai takes a step closer.
          Billy reaches for the sword.
          The creature leaps and lands on Billy's chest, knocking
          him to the floor. {
          .Billy wrestles with the creature. He tries to grab the
          sword, but Mogwai is clawing and biting at him.
          Billy's hand finally reaches the sword. He snatches it.
          He brings down the blade, into the creature's arm.
          Mogwai jumps back. Wounded.
          Billy stands. He raises his sword to finish off the creature.
          Mogwai dodges theblade, jumping to the window ledge.
          Billy moves toward the creature.
          Mogwai smashes through'the window, escaping into the night.
          Billy hurries out of the house.

          OUTSIDE
          The blizzard is starting up.
          Billy arrives at the broken window. He looks to the ground
          and sees

          MOGWAI'S FOOTPRINTS IN THE SNOW
          They stretch across the backyards of suburbia, disappearing
          into the darkness.
          Following the footprints, Billy runs after the creature.
          a cute, blonde-haired, blue-eyed 8 year old
          backyard. She is building A snowman.

          Before Peggy can scream, Mogwai grabs her.
          The creature pulls Peggy inside the snowman.
          Peggy puts up afight. But she isn't strong enough. Her
          little feet kick as she is pulled inside of the snowman.

          BILLY(
          arrives in Peggy's backyard. He sees the young girl's
          legs kicking from the snowman's torso.
          Billy rushes over. He grabs Peggy's legs. A tug of war.
          Billy pulls Peggy out of the snowman.

          Billy quickly attacks the snowman with his sword.
          He swings and swings until "Skippy" is nothing but a pile
          of snow.
          But there is no sign of Mogwai.
          Billy spots footprints leading away from the snowman.
          Mogwai has escaped.
          Billy runs after the footprints.
          Peggy watches him disappear around the corner of the house.
          Peggy's Mother opens the door. She is puzzled by the pile of

          sits in front of the two men. A serious, helpless look
          covers his face.
          Frank leans toward Billy.

          FRANK
          (holding back a

          LAUGH)
          Let me get this straight... You're
          telling me that 'little monsters'
          are multiplying by the hundreds,
          down at the 'Y'?

          BILLY
          Yes... that's right...

          FRANK
          These little things killed your
          Mother and the Fountane boy?
          Billy nods.

          FRANK
          And they eat human flesh?

          Frank looks at Billy.

          FRANK
          Look, Billy...We all know that you
          have a very active imagination. My
          brother told me about the books you
          read down there at the bank ...Now,
          Dungeons and Dragons are fine if
          you're five years old, but...
          Billy stands. Upset.

          BILLY
          My Mother is dead. So is my friend.
          I am not imagining things.
          Billy glares at Frank. The Sheriff sighs. He looks at
          Officer Brent.

          FRANK
          Brent, go with Peltzer...check
          out the 'Y'...then his house.

          just throw vuu out on your ass for

          Frustrated, Billy exits with Officer Brent.
          Frank shakes his head. He picks up the phone and dials.

          Officer Brent parks the 'car. Billy silts beside him.
          Brent looks at the building.

          BRENT
          Looks fine. I don't see anything.

          BILLY
          They're inside.
          Brent checks his pistol. It's loaded.

          BILLY
          Look...You can't go in there
          alone. It's'suicide. You've
          got to radio for more help...

          Brent handcuffsBilly to the grating of the police car.

          go- in there...
          Brent gets out of the car and walks to the building.
          A nervous, frustrated Billy watches.

          BRENT
          walks to the building's front door. Locked. He smiles.
          He takes astep back, draws his gun and shoots off the
          door lock.
          He enters.

          His sword lies on the back seat. Billy grabs it.
          He begins to pound at the handcuff chain with his blade.

          INT. Y.M.C.A. HALLWAY

          Pistol drawn, Brent walks down the hallway, to the gym
          doors.
          He can hear the sounds from inside. Gurgling. Breathing.
          Giggling.
          He takes a drink from his hip flask. He enters the gym.

          INSIDE
          Brent is shocked by what he sees.

          HUNDREDS OF PAIRS OF BURNING GREEN EYES
          fill the gymnasium, shining in the darkness. Like a
          starry night.

          DROVES OF MOGWAI
          are still coming out of the swimming pool.
          Brent is frozen. He tries to scream.
          The creatures notice him. Several move towards him.
          Brent fires his pistol. Useless. There are too many
          creatures.

          BILLY
          He hears the gunshots. He moves faster, desperately
          hacking at the handcuff chain with his sword.

          INSIDE - BRENT
          drops his gun. Out of bullets. He turns to run.

          A creature leaps. It lands on his back.
          Another leaps at him. He falls to the ground.
          Brent screams-as the:creatures jump him.
          They cover him like a blanket.
          They feast.

          CUT TO:

          BILLY
          Sweating. Nervous. Hacking away at the handcuff chain.
          Brent's screams fade in the background.
          Billy looks out the side window. He sees

          THE Y.M.C.A.'S FRONT DOORS BURST OPEN
          Droves of creatures pour out into the night.

          BILLY
          panics. He hacks at the chain. Harder. Faster.

          THE CREATURES
          move toward the police car.

          BILLY
          finally breaks the handcuff chain. He quickly moves to
          the driver's seat and starts the car.

          THE POLICE CAR

          He flips on the police siren and heads for town.

           CUT TO:

          THE SUBURBS
          Peaceful. Calm. Christmas lights twinkle.

          THE POLICE CAR
          suddenly squeals down the main road. Lights flashing.
          Siren blaring.

          BILLY
          steers the patrol car into the first driveway.
          The car screeches to a stop. Billy gets out. Sword in
          hand, he runs to the front door of the house. He
          knocks. Hard.

          MR. FUTTERS
          a balding, middle-aged man, wearing a bathrobe and pajamas,
          answers the door.

          There are these little things...
          animals...They're all over the
          place! They'll kill you and your
          family!...
          Mr. Futters starts to laugh.

          MR. FUTTERS
          Have you been drinking?

          BILLY
          No sir, I...

          MR. FUTTERS
          And what the hell is that? A
          sword?

          BILLY
          Yes...

          MR. FUTTERS
          And what are-you doing with the
          Sheriff's car? Are you on drugs?
          Billy starts to explain when

          MR. DEAGLE
          the next door neighbor, walks onto his porch.
          Deagle is a portly man, with curly grey hair and a beard.
          He calls to Mr. Futters

          

          

          

          

          71.

          MR. DEAGLE
          Hey, Joe...I saw the police car.
          You in some kind of trouble?

          MR. FUTTERS
          ,No, it's this Peltzer kid. He
          thinks we're gonna get: eaten up
          by wild animals. And he's
          carrying a sword.

          MR. DEAGLE
          Did you say 'Peltzer'? Billy
          Peltzer?

          MR. FUTTERS
          1 Yeah...

          MR. DEAGLE
          (shakes his head)
          He's a nut. Went crazy in the
          bank today. Called my wife all
          kinds of names.
          (to Billy)
          You smartass son of a bitch. If
          I was ten years younger I'd beat
          the crap out of you.
          Billy sighs, frustrated.

          MRS. DEAGLE
          joins her husband on the porch.

          MRS. DEAGLE
          What's the matter?...
          (she sees Billy)
          Oh, it's you. Here to
          apologize?

          I hope they lock you up for
          good, and throw away the key.
          Mr. Deagle puts his arm around his wife.

          MR. DEAGLE
          C'mon back inside, dear. Let's
          finish watching 'Dallas'.

          You've got ten seconds to get
          the hell out of my yard. Then
          I'm.calling the Sheriff...if he
          isn't out looking for you already.
          He slams the door and goes inside.
          Billy just stands there. Defeated. Frustrated.

          A CREATURE
          hisses. Behind Billy.
          Billy turns. Mogwai leaps at him.
          Billy raises his sword and swings.
          He knocks the creature down. He stabs Mogwai.
          Mogwai dies with a long scream.
          Billy looks up and sees

          THE PACK OF CREATURES
          moving down Main Street. They have arrived. Looking for
          food.
          Many break into the house across the street. There are
          some human screams. Then the house lights go out.

          Billy runs to the police car. He opens the door and gets
          inside.
          A creature leaps at him.
          Billy slams the car door. It severs the creature4si-rand..
          Several creatures surround the car.
          Billy hears a familiar voice. Screaming. He looks out
          the window.

          MRS. DEAGLE
          comes running out of her house, towards the police car.
          f_ She-'s screaming for help.

          I
          A creature is on her back.
          Another creature leaps at her.
          She falls. Into the snow.
          Several creatures attack Mrs. Deagle. Her screams fade.
          So does her life.

          BILLY
          looks away. More creatures are. surrounding the car.
          They pound against the windows. They want in.

          Two creatures stand there Growling. 'Hungry. They,
          move to Tracy.
          She screams.
          Billy gets to Tracy. He quickly pulls her out of the
          window. They begin to climb down the ladder.

          ON THE GROUND BELOW
          a creature jumps onto the ladder.
          Tracy. is startled. She nearly falls. Billy grabs. a. better
          hold of her. He drops his sword. It falls to the ground
          and lands in the snow.
          The creature looks up and sees Billy and Tracy. A few
          feet above. Mogwai begins to climb the ladder, going
          after them.
          Billy and Tracy start to climb up the ladder.
          But the two other creatures come out of Tracy'.s bedroom
          window. They see Billy and Tracy below. They climb oft
          after them, down the ladder.
          Billy and Tracy are trapped. Sandwiched between the
          creatures.
          Billy looks to his sword on the ground. So far away.

          

          

          

          

          REV. 4/30/82 78
          Thinking fast, Billy pulls the ladder back.
          It sways. He pulls harder.
          The ladder tilts to the ground. Falling.
          The three creatures are thrown to the ground, into the
          deep snow.
          Billy and Tracy ride the ladder down. The snow breaks
          their fall.
          The creatures dig their way out of the snow. They move
          towards Billy and Tracy.
          Billy snaps up his sword and jumps to his feet. Ready
          to fight. He keeps one protective arm around Tracy.
          The creatures surround them. Waiting for the right moment
          to attack.
          One of the creatures moves forward.
          Another leaps behind Billy.
          Billy lunges forward and spears the first creature.
          He quickly reels around, slicing the other creature in
          two.
          Both creatures lie in the snow. Dead.
          Billy turns to the last Mogwai. With two swings of his
          blade, he kills the creature.
          Billy wipes the green blood off his sword with his coat
          sleeve. Breathless, he looks at Tracy .
          Hair .hangs in his eyes. Blood runs down the side of his.
          sweaty, unshaven face. His dark brown eyes stare at Tracy.
          The transformation from meek bank clerk to sexy hero is
          complete.
          He embraces her. They run to the police car and get inside.
          Billy'starts the car. He and Tracy drive off into the
          night.

          INT. SHERIFF'S CAR

          Gary drives. Frank sits beside him. Gary flips on the siren
          and lights. He smiles. Like a little kid. Frank reaches
          over and.turns off the siren. Gary complains.

          GARY
          Hey, C'mon...

          FRANK
          I got a headache.

          But this is an emergency. We
          gotta warn everybody! The gremlins
          are coming!
          Gary laughs. Frank sighs

          GARY
          So when are you gonna make me
          Deputy?

          FRANK
          When you grow up.

          GARY
          Why don't you fire Brent. He's
          nothin' but a drunk. I'could do
          a lot better.
          They arrive at the outskirts of town. Frank notices some-
          thing up ahead.
          He can see the shadows of the creatures. Crawling on
          houses. Running across the front lawns.
          Frank motions for Gary to slow down.

          FRANK
          Something looks weird.
          (rolls Jown. his

          WINDOW)
          Damn windshield.`:: frozen. Can't
          see a thing.
          He sticks his head out the window to look out.
          Gary continuesto drive.
          Frank turns from outside, back to Gary.

          A CREATURE
          leaps onto the car's passenger' side. The creature grabs
          Frank' arm. He tries to shake off the creature.
          Gary gl nce over. Shocked. Horrified.
          Mogwai takes a huge bite out of Frank's arm. He screams.
          Gary turns to help him.

          THE POLICE-CAR
          slides on the ice. It slams-into a guard rail, flips over
          a ditch and spins to a stop.

          CUT TO:

          BILLY'S CAR
          Billy drives, as fast as possible through the heavy snow.
          He's headed out of town. Tracy sits beside him. She
          looks out the window..

          OUTSIDE
          The rows of once peaceful, cheerful homes are now the
          scenes of frenzied horror.
          People run out into the night, screaming for help, only
          to be dragged to the ground by creatures.
          Ravaged bodies lie in the snow. Frozen.
          An ambulance is overturned on the roadside.
          Phone lines are town down.
          The creatures have made their way across town. They now
          attack the last few houseson the block.

          I'll get him out.
          Billy quickly opens the police car door. He jumps out.

          OUTSIDE
          He closes the door. Tracy is safe inside.
          Billy walks to the.sheriff's car. He stays in the safety
          of the headlight's beam.
          Billy stops a few feet from the sheriff's car.
          The passenger side is crushed. The driver's side is
          barely damaged, save for a dented, jammed door.
          Gary pounds against-the door. He wants out.
          Billy grabs the car handle. He pulls hard. The door
          pops open. He pulls Gary out.
          Gary gets to his feet. He's okay. Billy looks inside
          the car.
          Billy closes the door.

          GARY
          What.about my brother? Can we
          get him out?

          BILLY
          He's dead.
          Tears fill Gary's eyes. Billy leads Gary to the car.

          BILLY
          C'mon. Just stay in the light.
          They're afraid of the light.
          Gary walks. He looks scared. Helpless.
          They get to the police car. Billy opens the door.

          She smiles. Glad to see him alive. They kiss. Gary puts
          his arm around her..
          Billy hops into the driver's seat. He rests the sword
          beside him.--He--starts the car and continues to drive.,
          Gary gives Tracy another kiss. He needs her comfort.
          Billy just stares ahead, at the snowy road.

          Closed.. But the upstairs lights are on. Someone is
          home.
          Everything here looks calm. Untouched. Safe.
          The police car pulls into the driveway.

          INSIDE
          Billy turns to Gary and Tracy.

          BILLY
          We're just outside of town...
          Doesn't look like the creature's
          got here yet.
          (a beat)
          Let's go inside and warm up.
          They exit the police car.

          DORRY
          comes to the door. He sees the worn, hollow faces of Gary
          and Tracy. He sees the bruised and bloodied Billy.

          Dorry bandages Billy's calf. Gary sits with Tracy on
          the sofa.
          Billy finishes telling the full story to everyone.

          BILLY
          .and they originate from this
          marketplace in Hong Kong.
          Dorrystands and shakes his head.

          DORRY
          Hard to believe. Like Satan's
          come to walk the earth.

          BILLY
          (looks at everyone)
          You see...they''re drawn to water.
          Now, if my hunch is correct... They'll
          be leaving town, and heading for the
          water tower-which means they'll have
          to pass by here tonight.
          (a beat)
          We have to get help. These things
          have to be kept under control. If
          they get to the water tower .they
           could spread all over the St ate...
          maybe the Country. They're like
          inhuman divining rods.

          GARY
          Why didn't you think of that before,
          Peltzer?

          BILLY
          I did. But nobody would listen.

          GARY .
          Maybe if you weren't such a nut
          people would believe you.

          anywhere.
          Gary still glares at Billy.

          BILLY
          That's not true.

          Stop it.

          GARY
          You did it. You killed all
          those people.. You're. a murderer,
          Peltzer.
          Billy lunges at Gary. They fall to the ground. Fighting.
          Dorry and Tracy break it up.

          TRACY
          If we want to stay . alive... We
          have to stick together.
          Billy turns away. Cooling off.
          Gary is comforted by Tracy. But she keeps her eye on
          Billy. Dorry looks at everyone.

          DORRY
          We should get in touch with
          the authorities.

          Gary's cigarette lighter illuminates the room. Everyone
          stays quiet. They listen.
          THE GIGGLING of several creatures echoes from outside.

          BILLY
          They're here.
          A frightened Gary holds Tracy.

          GARY
          Now what do we do?
          The giggling gets louder. Closer. Billy turns to Dorry.

          BILLY
          Do you have a place without win
          dows?... .A place where we could be
          safe?

          I've only been this scared two
          other times in my life. Once
          was when I got drafted. The
          other, was when I was six years
          old.
          (everyone listens)
          It.was Christmas Eve. My sisters
          and I were decorating the tree
          with our Mother. We were singing
          caroles...happy ...excited...
          waiting for Dad to get home from
          work.
          (a beat)
          A few hours passed, and we started
          to worry. Dad wasn't home yet. My
          Mother called the office. They said
          he left.

          (PAUSE)
          After about a week... the police gave
          up. My Mother was close to a nervous
          breakdown... The rest of us weren't
          eating.. .we couldn't sleep.. .Every-
          thing was falling apart.

          (PAUSE)
          It was snowing outside. The house
          was cold. I threw some logs on
          the fire.--..That's when I noticed
          the smell.
          (a beat)
          The firemen came. They broke
          through the chimney top. We were
          all waiting, expecting them to
          pull out some dead cat or bird...
          Instead, they pulled out my Father.

          (PAUSE)
          He was dressed in a Santa Claus
          suit. He had been climbing down
          the chimney on Christmas Eve,
          his arms loaded with presents.

          The coroner said that he lost
          his footing. He slipped and
          broke his neck. Died instantly.
          His body was lodged in the narrow
          chimney shaft.

          (PAUSE)
          ,That how I found out there was
          no Sahta Claus.
          Everyone has a chilled look on their faces. Dorry just
          stares.
          Billy stands and clears his throat..

          BILLY
          Well...I think you should all
          try and get some sleep.
          (a beat)
          I'll watch the door.
          Everyone agrees. Billy moves his chair in front of the
          door.

          Gary stretches out on the sofa, expecting Tracy to cuddle
          with him. Instead,"she walks:over to Billy.

          TRACY
          Billy...
          He looks at her. She gives him a comforting smile.

          TRACY
          I just wanted to say thanks...
          I mean...If it wasn't for you, I
          don't know what any of us would
          have done.
          Billy smiles.

          TRACY
          is it okay if I sleep here? On
          the floor beside you?...I'd feel
          a lot safer.
          Billy nods. Tracy moves a carpet next to Billy's chair.
          She lies on the carpet. She closes her eyes.
          Gary watches from the sofa. Jealous.

          

          

          

          
          Dorry has fallen asleep in his chair.
          Billy sits. Sword on his lap. He guards the door.
          Sounds still echo-from downstairâ¢s,.throughout the antique
          store.

          CLOSE-UP - BILLY
          The horror of it all finally hits him.
          His eyes fill with tears.
          He cries. Alone.

          The others are asleep.
          Billy's hand quivers. The sword drops to the floor. He
          wakes. Startled. He quickly grabs the sword.
          Everyone else wakes from the sound.

          and fight these things. At least
          until we can get help...
          Tracy folds her arms.

          The creatures have been here.
          The dead body of an old man is slumped across a table.
          A half eaten Big Mac is still in his hand.
          In a booth, sits a dead family: Mother, Father, boy and
          girl. Their food still sits-in front of them. Untouched.
          A dead cashier girl lies on the counter.

          BILLY, TRACY, GARY AND DORRY
          sit at a table in the rear of the restaurant. Away from
          the grisly sights.-
          They eat burgers and fries. Gary takes a bite of his
          burger and nods to Billy.

          BILLY
          It's.possible. But it's more
          important to get at the creatures.
          We've got the advantage now. It's
          daylight.

          GARY I
          You know where they are, Peltzer?

          BILLY
          No...But they're all gathered in
          one place. And the sun rose before
          they could make it to the water
          tower. So they must be holed up
          between here and there.

          Okay...just remember;.We've got
          to stick together. And keep close
          to the flashlight. They're scared
          of the light.
          Everyone nods. Gary turns on the flashlight.

          Countless pairs of green eyes shine in the darkness. The

          Billy takes off his coat and shirt. He removes his T-shirt.
          He looks at Gary.

          Gary reluctantly takes. off his T-shirt. Billy ties the
          two shirts together. He winds them into a cord.
          He finds a connection in the gas line. He begins to
          pound against it with the handle of his sword. The. sounds

          The CLANG of Billy's sword hitting the pipe is heard.
          Several of the creatures group together. They move from

          Billy gives one final hit to. the gas line. The connection
          snaps. He stuffs the line with his and Gary's shirt. He
          turns the gas back on and lights the end of the crumpled.
          shirt with a match. The flame slowly creeps up the shirt,
          to the line.

          Not your gun. There's too
          many. Use the light.
          Gary stops shooting and fumbles for his flashlight.

          Tearing.
          Billy picks up his sword and begins to knock the creatures
          off Dorry.
          Creatures come at Tracy. She picks up a section of thick
          lead pipe and bats off the oncoming Mogwai.
          Gary finally turns on the flashlight beam. It keeps some
          of the Mogwai at bay.
          Fire creeps up the T-shirt, getting closer to the gas
          line.
          Billy gets all-the creatures off Dorry.
          More creatures come through the door.
          Gary gets scared. He drops the flashlight and runs

          THE CREATURE ON THE BACK SEAT
          opens its eyes. It lets out a high pitched, wounded cry.
          Tracy picks up the sword, ready to kill the creature.
          Billy stops her.

          BILLY
          Wait...
          He looks out the rear window.

          THE PACK OF CREATURES
          are following the police car.

          BILLY
          looks at the creature on the back seat. It still cries
          out in that high pitched scream.

          BILLY
          (to Tracy)
          Hear that? He's calling his
          friends for help. They're
          following us. As long as
          he's alive and screaming... they'll
          come after him.

          104.

          BILLY
          We can't kill him. He's our
          bait. We'll be able to lead them
          away from the water tower.
          (points to the
          back seat)
          Just keep an eye on the thing...
          make s re it doe n' hurt us.
          Tracy keeps the swo d on the cre ture. Billy guns the
          engine and screeches off. He looks to the rearview
          mirror.

          THE COUNTLESS GREEN EYES FOLLOW..

          DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. EXXON STATION - LATER THAT NIGHT

          The station is deserted. A clock in the window reads

          5:27 AM.

          THE POLICE CAR
          pulls into the station'lot.
          Billy and Tracy get out. They look tired. Worn. They've
          been driving all night. Billy pumps gas into the car.

          THE WOUNDED CREATURE
          still lies on the back seat. Mogwai still screams in
          its high pitched wail.

          TRACY
          looks into the distance.

          THE PACK OF GREEN EYES
          is visible. A few miles away.. They move to Tracy and
          Billy's direction.

          BILLY
          We'd better hurry. They're
          getting close.
          They.. get into the car..

          INSIDE
          Billy starts the car. Tracy looks into the back seat.

          TRACY
          Billy!...

          THE CREATURE IS GONE.
          Billy and Tracy are shocked. Puzzled.

          CUT TO:

          BEHIND THE POLICE CAR
          The creature has crawled outside, through the rear
          window. It crawls BENEATH THE CAR, moving into the engine.

          BILLY AND TRACY
          look around. Puzzled. Confused.

          BILLY
          Where in the hell?...

          SUDDENLY
          The car stalls. Billy tries to re-start it. No good.
          Dead engine.
          GIGGLING echoes from under the hood.
          Billy and Tracy get out of the car.

          OUTSIDE

          THE PACK OF CREATURES ARE GETTING CLOSER.
          Billy and Tracy move to the-car's hood. Billy opens it.

          MOGWAI
          is inside. Its mouth is full of tangled wires and plugs
          that the creature has ripped from the engine. Mogwai
          giggles at Billy.

          BILLY
          (to Tracy)
          Check the garage... ee if
          there's a bag...a b x...

          Tracyhurries to the garage.

          INT. STATION GARAGE

          Tracy finds a small, red metal toolbox., She empties
          it and carries the box back to the car.

          BILLY
          grabs the creature. Mogwai is still wounded and dazed.
          But it manages to bite and scratch at Billy.
          Tracy holds the tool box open. Billy forces Mogwai inside.
          He closes the tool box and locks it shut.
          Mogwai is trapped inside. The creature pounds against
          the metal. Its loud cry echoes from inside.
          Billy checks the car's engine.

          BILLY
          Damn! He ripped out the
          coil wires! The car won't
          run without them!

          TRACY
          Can you fix it?
          Billy looks into the distance. The creatures are getting
          very close..

          BILLY
          There's no time.

          Billy looks into the distance, at the top of a hill.

          A GREENHOUSE
          sits in a large open area. It overlooks the entire town
          of Kingston Falls.

          BILLY AND TRACY
          run up the hill, towards the Greenhouse.

          THE MOGWAI
          move fast. They're getting closer to Billy and Tracy.
          Some of the creatures travel beneath the snow. Others
          hop through it.

          center of the Greenhouse.
          Billy takes Tracy's hand. They run to the tree. They
          begin to climb to the top.

          THE CREATURES
          crash through the Greenhouse doors. Several of them
          surround the tool box. Mogwai screams from inside. Others
          tear through the Greenhouse, smashing plants, overturning
          tables, etc.
          The creatures spot Billy and Tracy, climbing the tree.
          The Mogwai move to the tree.

          Dawn is approaching.
          Billy looks below him.

          THE CREATURES
          climb the tree, scurrying up to Billy and Tracy.
          Billy fights off the oncoming Mogwai with his sword.

          AT THE TREE'S BOTTOM
          Several creatures have begun to gnaw at the tree trunk.

          BILLY AND TRACY
          are near the treetop. They cling to a large, thick branch.
          The creatures still chase after them. Billy keeps them
          at bay.

          THE RED METAL TOOL BOX.

          SEVERAL WORKERS cleaning up the debris, repairing the
          broken Greenhouse windows.
          The workers load the trash onto a dump truck.
          Outside, the snow is melting. The sun shines bright.

          A BURLY, MUSCULAR WORKER
          walks up to the table and picks up the tool box. He shouts

          driving home in his van. Later that afternoon. The radio
          plays a Country tune.

          THE TOOL BOX
          rests on the seat beside him.

          SUDDENLY
          the tool box begins to shake. Something pounds against it
          from inside.

          THE WORKER
          pulls his van to the roadside. He stares at the shaking
          tool box. His eyes are wide. Scared.
          The worker grabs the tool box. He gets out of his van.

          OUTSIDE
          The tool box shakes and rattles in the worker's hand.
          Frightened, he throws the box-over a hilly, wooded area
          at the side of the road.

          tumbles down a steep hill.
          It lands at the bottom and bounces into a
