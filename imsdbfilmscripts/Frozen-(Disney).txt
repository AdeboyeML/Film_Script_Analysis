   A humble castle, built of wood, nestled in a deep fjord.


   INT. CASTLE, NURSERY -- NIGHT

   ELSA (8) sleeps in her bed. Her little sister ANNA (5) pops
   up beside her.

                            YOUNG ELSA
                  ...Go play by yourself.

   Elsa shoves Anna off the bed.

   Anna lands butt to floor, sighs, defeated. But then she gets
   an idea. She hops back on the bed and lifts one of Elsa's
   eyelids.

   Anna, now wearing snow boots, pulls Elsa by the hand.

   The girls sneak into the ballroom. Elsa shuts the door.

                  Do the magic! Do the magic!

   Elsa laughs and waves her hands together. Snowflakes suddenly
   burst forth and dance between her palms, forming a snowball.
   Elsa throws the snowball high into the air. Snow bursts out
   and flurries around the room. Anna dances about, catching
   flakes in her palms and mouth.

   Elsa stomps her little slippered foot and a layer of ice
   suddenly coats the floor, forming a giant ice rink. Anna
   slides off, laughing.

                  I love you, Olaf.

   -Anna and Olaf appear to be dancing. REVEAL: Elsa is actually
   propelling them across the ice floor with her magic.

   -The girls slide down snowbanks together!

   -Anna fearlessly jumps off a snow peak into mid air.

   Elsa suddenly slips.

   Her magic accidentally STRIKES Anna in the head. Anna tumbles
   down a snowbank and lands, unconscious.

   Elsa runs to Anna and takes her in her arms. A streak of
   Anna's hair, where struck, turns white.

   EXT. THE VALLEY OF THE LIVING ROCK -- NIGHT

   Kristoff hops off Sven at the edge of a deep valley. They
   hide behind a rock and peek out.

   Down below, the King holds a frightened Elsa. The Queen holds
   the still unconscious Anna.

                            KING
                  Please, help. My daughter!

   Suddenly, a bunch of rocks tumble down the valley toward
   them. It looks as though they'll be crushed!

   But, luckily, the rocks stop at their feet. The rocks then
   unfold, revealing bright faces.

                               YOUNG KRISTOFF
                  Trolls...?

   The rock in front of Kristoff "wakes up." Meet BULDA.

                  Shush. I'm trying to listen.

   She grabs Kristoff and Sven by hand and hoof and hugs them
   close. Sven licks her face and she eyes them both.

                  Cuties. I'm gonna keep you.

   Back below, the crowd parts for a troll as old as the Earth.
   They call him GRAND PABBIE. He approaches arthritically, but
   determined. He nods respectfully to the king.

                  safe.... But don't worry, I'll
                  leave the fun.

   Grand Pabbie pulls out a glowing blue energy from Anna's
   head. We see her memories floating right above her. Grand
   Pabbie changes all of her magical memories to ordinary
   memories -- snowy play indoors with the girls in their
   nightgowns changes to outdoors on the winter fjords with the
   girls in winter gear. He puts the ordinary memories back in
   her head.

                  Listen to me, Elsa, your power will
                  only grow.

   As he speaks, he conducts the Northern Lights to show a
   silhouette of an adult Elsa creating magical snowflakes.

                            PABBIE (CONT'D)
                  There is beauty in your magic....
                  But also great danger.

   The snowflakes turn to sharp spikes.

                  You must learn to control it.

   In the Northern Lights display, the sharp spikes cause human
   figures to panic and attack Elsa.

                  Fear will be your enemy.

   They pass the May Pole being raised and a Sami ice harvester
   chatting with his reindeer. We recognize them as Kristoff and
   Sven, all grown up. Sven hops around excitedly like a dog and
   nuzzles Kristoff's chest.

   Kristoff pulls a carrot out of his shirt pocket and hands it

   She falls back and lands in a small wooden boat. It tips off
   of the dock. She's heading overboard. But just then, the
   horse slams his hoof into the boat and steadies it.

   He drops to his knees, head bowed. The horse bows too,
   curling his hoof up and out of the boat.

   The boat tips. Hans tumbles on top of Anna. Awkward.

   The horse slams his foot back into the boat to stabilize it.
   Anna and Hans tumble the other way. Anna lands on top of him.

   too, once again taking his hoof out of the boat.

   Anna grabs Elsa's hand. She pulls off Elsa's glove. Elsa
   gasps, spins around and reaches for the glove in panic.

   Elsa backs away from the baby. She knocks into the fountain,

   GASPS of shock and fear sweep over the crowd.

   The Duke and thugs come out the door.

   Elsa glances back at Anna, but turns away. She tentatively
   steps out onto the fjord. It freezes instantly. She breaks
   into a run, as the water freezes over with each step.

   scrambles into the mountains.

   He doesn't come back. Anna grabs onto a branch of a leaning
   conifer, tries to pull herself to her feet, but the tree
   snaps upright and releases all its snow onto her. GROAN.

                  time, so I just thought, maybe she
                  has a thing about dirt.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Didn't your parents ever warn you
                  about strangers?

   Anna eyes Kristoff up and down, then slides away from him.

                            ANNA
                  Yes, they did.... But Hans is not a
                  stranger.

                  Ew. Look it doesn't matter; it's

                  Doesn't sound like true love.

                  Are you some sort of love expert?

                            KRISTOFF
                  No. But I have friends who are.

                  You have friends who are love
                  experts.... I'm not buying it.

   Sven suddenly stops, ears perked in alarm.

   Kristoff clamps his hand over Anna's mouth.

                            KRISTOFF
                  I mean it. SHHH.

   Kristoff stands, looks into the dark woods surrounding them.
   Sensing something behind them, he holds up his lantern. Its
   light reflects off...EYES. Several.

                            KRISTOFF(CONT'D)
                  Sven, go. Go!

   Sven takes off.

   Flashes of white dart through the woods. Kristoff hops into
   the back of the sled, grabs a torch. Lights it.

                  Wolves. What do we do?

                             KRISTOFF
                  Because I don't trust your

                            ANNA

   A wolf jumps at them, but Kristoff kicks it off.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Who marries a man she just met?

   Anna grabs the lute, swings it right at Kristoff's head.

                            ANNA
                  It's true love!

   He screams, as she...BAM!...swings past Kristoff and knocks a
   wolf away.

   Just then Kristoff is yanked off the sled by another wolf.
   The torch goes flying. Anna catches it, shocked.

                            ANNA
                  Christopher!

   Kristoff grabs onto a loose rope hanging from the back of the
   sled and holds on for dear life as he's dragged behind.

                            KRISTOFF

                  AH!

   Anna thinks fast, uses the torch to light a blanket on fire.

                            ANNA
                  Duck!

   Anna throws the flaming blanket right at him. He ducks. The
   blanket hits the wolves. They tumble off Kristoff.

                            KRISTOFF
                  You almost set me on fire!

   Anna reaches out a hand, pulls Kristoff back onto the sled.

                            ANNA
                  But I didn't.

   Sven cries out. There is a massive gorge ahead.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Get ready to jump, Sven!

                  You don't tell him what to do!

   Kristoff shoves a satchel into her arms then scoops her up.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  I do!

   Kristoff tosses Anna onto Sven, then unhooks Sven's harness
   from the sled.

                  Jump, Sven!

   Sven jumps the gorge with Anna on his back.

   Kristoff goes flying off behind them, still on the sled.

   Anna and Sven land safely on the other side of the gorge.

   Kristoff's sled loses momentum. It's not going to make it. He
   leaps off. He flaps his arms, claws at the air.

   He slams into the snowy edge of the cliff. Hanging by his
   hands, he looks down to see his sled hit the ground far below
   and burst into flames.

   Suddenly, he starts to slip. He claws at the loose snow, but
   it's clearly hopeless. He's going down.

                  Uh-oh. No, no, no.

   To make matters worse, an AXE comes flying right at his face.

                  AH! NO, NO, NO!

   REVEAL: The axe is tied to a rope, then wrapped around Sven.
   Anna helps Sven pull Kristoff to safety.

   Kristoff rolls onto his back, exhausted. Anna peeks down at
   the burning sled.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  Whoa.... I'll replace your sled and

   Anna walks off, sadly. Sven comes over and nuzzles Kristoff.

                  Of course I don't want to help her

   INT. FROZEN WILLOW TREES -- DAY

   Anna, Kristoff, and Sven walk beneath frozen willows. The
   hanging branches glisten like Christmas lights. Sven knocks
   them with his antlers. They tinkle like chimes.

                  I never knew winter could be so
                  beautiful.

   Suddenly, a voice comes in from nowhere. We'll call that
   voice OLAF.

                  YEAH...It really is beautiful,

                  Must we bleach the joy out of it
                  all? I'm thinking like maybe some
                  crimson, chartreuse...

   While this is going on, Anna and Kristoff look around for the
   source of the rambling. They look at Sven - could he actually
   be talking? Sven looks back at them, his antlers tangled in
   branches, just as baffled as they are.

   In the meantime, a nose-less snowman, Olaf, wanders up behind
   them.

                  Well, almost.

   She digs into Kristoff's satchel, holds up a carrot just as
   Olaf turns toward her. The carrot accidentally slams all the
   way through his head.

                            OLAF

                  just.... Are you okay?

   Olaf sees a tiny piece of carrot sticking out between his
   eyes. He lights up.

                  Are you kidding me? I am wonderful!

                  So cute. It's like a little baby
                  unicorn.

   Anna reaches behind Olaf to the bulk of the carrot sticking
   out the back of his head, and pushes it forward.

                  over. Hi everyone. I'm Olaf. And I
                  like warm hugs.

   Olaf opens his arms wide to Anna. That triggers a memory. It
   takes her a moment to place it, but then she does.

                            ANNA

   He pulls the rope from his bag. Just then Olaf steps out from
   behind a rock and waves to Kristoff.

   Anna climbs the steps with Olaf. Sven tries to follow. His

   Kristoff runs to his aide.

   Sven obediently plops his reindeer butt down and wags his

   blizzard taking over the room.

   Elsa's fear, so strong, sucks the blizzard back into her and
   then it bursts out, unwittingly, like a sharp snowflake.

   Anna is STRUCK right in the heart. She grasps her chest in
   pain and stumbles back. She falls to her knees.

   Elsa gasps when she sees Anna. Just then, Olaf and Kristoff
   rush into the room to Anna's side.

   Anna doesn't have the answer. Kristoff sees spiky ice shadows
   creeping down the walls. Puts a protective arm around Anna.

                  Anna, I think we should go.

   Elsa waves her arms and builds a giant, menacing snowman.
   We'll call him MARSHMALLOW.

   Olaf's head smashes into a snowbank nearby.

   Anna and Kristoff duck as the rest of Olaf slams into the
   snowbank.

   Marshmallow turns to go back into the castle.

   Incensed, Anna tries to march back up the stairs.

   man be.

   Anna backs down...for a moment. Then she grabs a snowball and
   throws it at Marshmallow.

   The tiny little ball hits Marshmallow's back, not making even
   the slightest dent. But it's enough to infuriate him. He
   ROARS. Spikes shoot out of his joints.

                            KRISTOFF

   Kristoff pushes Anna along. Sven runs off in the opposite
   direction. Olaf's belly and butt fall and follow Sven.

   Marshmallow goes charging after Anna and Kristoff as Olaf's

                  This just got a whole lot harder.

   Anna and Kristoff leap and slide down a steep slope. They
   tumble to a stop at the bottom just as Marshmallow lands hard
   right behind them.

   They're off again...through a maze of conifers that sag under
   the weight of the snow, Marshmallow hot on their trail.

                               KRISTOFF
                  This way!

   Anna grabs a branch of a sagging trees and releases all of
   the snow. The tree snaps upright, knocking Marshmallow back.

   Anna and Kristoff burst out of the conifer forest and almost
   run right off a cliff. They stop short, toes on the edge.

   Anna jumps and pulls Kristoff over the edge with her. They
   hang upside down over the cliff by the rope. The rope catches
   their fall.

   Back up top, Olaf emerges from the woods. He's a complete

   Suddenly Anna is surrounded by trolls. They body-surf/roll
   Anna over to Kristoff. She falls into his arms.

   BACK OUTSIDE: Hans is nearly crushed by Marshmallow. He rolls
   away. Jumps to his feet. And with agile might, he slices
   Marshmallow's leg off with his sword. Marshmallow stumbles
   back, off balance. And falls off over the cliff, but not
   before striking Hans. Hans goes over the edge.

   spikes lower from the second thug's neck. He takes advantage

   arrow releases. The arrow hits the ice chandelier, hanging
   directly above Elsa.

   Kristoff tries to walk on ahead, but Sven uses his antlers to
   lift Kristoff off the ground.

   Sven makes an "of-course-she-isn't" face. Kristoff gets it;
   he's made his point.

   Just then the wind picks up. Kristoff looks back at the
   kingdom. Sees a violent winter storm swirling over the
   castle. Sharp ice claws its way up the castle, encasing it.

                            KRISTOFF (CONT'D)
                  Anna.

   Without hesitating, he dashes back down the mountain. Sven
   runs after him, catches up. Kristoff grabs Sven's harness and
   jumps onto his back.

   CLICK. The door swings open. We see a carrot in the lock and
   hear a giggle of victory. Olaf takes the carrot, puts it back
   on his face. Then he sees Anna lying there.

                  ...I love you.

   Olaf realizes what's happened. He's so excited about it, he
   lifts his head right off his body and exclaims--

                            OLAF
                  An act of true love will thaw a
                  frozen heart.

                            ELSA

                      (realizing)
                  Love.... Of course.

   Elsa looks at Anna with confidence.

                            ANNA
                  Elsa?

                            ELSA
                  Love.

   Elsa lifts her arms, and the ground shakes and cracks. The
   ice and snow breaks away and rises high into the air.

   Beneath their feet the bow of a ship thaws.

   The entire fjord melts and other boats right themselves.

   The villagers come out to see the warmth returning.

   In one final wave, Elsa draws all of the snow into a giant
   snowflake in the sky, then waves it away, leaving only a warm
   summer day.

                            ANNA
                  I knew you could do it.

                  Hands down, this is the best day of
                  my life...and quite possibly the
                  last.

   Elsa waves her hand and surrounds Olaf with a swirl of cold
   air. He refreezes. Above his head she leaves a little,
   perpetually-snowing storm cloud. Olaf loves it.

                            OLAF
                  Hey, my own personal flurry.

   Kristoff sees Hans trying to get to his feet. He marches
   toward him, prepared for a fight. But Anna puts up a hand and
   stops him.

                            ANNA
                  Uh. Uh. Uh.

   She'll handle this. She goes over to Hans.

                  Anna? But she froze your heart.

                  The only frozen heart around here
                  is yours.

   She turns away from him, proud of her words. But not yet
   satisfied, she turns back and punches him right in the face.

                            HANS
                  Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

   He falls overboard.

   Elsa comes over to Anna and hugs her. Over her shoulder,
   Kristoff meets Anna's eyes. She smiles brighter, happy.

   EXT. ARENDELLE -- DAY

   It's a beautiful summer day. The mighty ships have been
   repaired and are sailing away.

   On one of the ships, HANS is thrown into a brig.

   Down on the dock, Arendelle guards lead the Duke and his two
   thugs to their ship.

                            DUKE
                  This is unacceptable. I am
                  innocent. I'm a victim of fear.
                  I've been traumatized.

   Kai steps down from the gangplank to the dock.

                            KAI
                  I have a message from the Queen.

                  Arendelle will henceforth and
                  forever no longer do business of

                            DUKE
                  Weselton. It's Weselton!

   The guards usher him and his thugs onto their ship.


   EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE -- DAY

   Anna runs through the crowd, pulling a blindfolded Kristoff
   along behind her. She's so excited she can't stand it.

                            ANNA
                  Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on!

   She runs him right into a pole.

   EXT. ARENDELLE DOCKS -- DAY

   Anna skips to the perfect spot and stops.

   She takes off the blindfold. Kristoff opens his eyes. Before
   him sits the most beautiful, suped-up sled. Sven poses in
   front of it -- Vanna White-style.

                            ANNA (CONT'D)
                  I owe you a sled.

                            ANNA
                  Yes. And it's the latest model.

                            KRISTOFF
                  No. I can't accept this...

                            ANNA
                  You have to. No returns. No

                  named you the official Arendelle
                  Ice Master and Deliverer.

   Sven shows off the Ice-Master-and-Deliverer medal like he's
   king of the bucks.

                            KRISTOFF
                  What? That's not a thing.

   But he can't help but admire her enthusiasm.

                            ANNA
                  Sure it is. And it even has a cup
                  holder.... Do you like it?

                             KRISTOFF
                  Like it?

   He sweeps her up high overhead and spins her around.

                  I love it.... I could kiss you!

                  we? Wait, what?

   She gives him a quick kiss on the cheek.

                  We may.

   He smiles and goes for it. It's a true love's kiss, alright.

   We move past them to find Olaf enjoying the summer.

   With his snow cloud safely overhead, he's free to smell the
   flowers, which he does. Then sneezes his carrot nose off.

   Sven catches it between his teeth. Olaf gasps as Sven sucks
   the whole carrot into his mouth. It's gone.

   Olaf's face sinks in sadness. But not to fear, Sven spits the
   carrot back out and jams it into Olaf's face where it
   belongs. It's completely covered in reindeer spit, but Olaf
   doesn't seem to mind. He hugs Sven happily.

   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD -- DAY

   The gates to the castle are wide open. In the courtyard,
   stands Elsa.

                            ELSA
                  Are you ready?

   Villagers cheer. Elsa stops and creates an ice rink. The
   people, skates at the ready, hope onto it and twirl about.

   Elsa then freezes the fountain in a beautiful design and adds
   some snow flurries for atmosphere.

   Anna comes slipping in. Elsa catches her.

                            ANNA
                  I like the open gates.

                            ELSA
                  We are never closing them again.

   Elsa then waves her hand and magical ice skates (literally
   made of ice) form on Anna's boots.

                            ANNA
                  What? Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful,
                  but you know I don't ska--

   Elsa grabs Anna's hands and pulls her along on the ice. Anna
   slips and slides, but laughs in delight.

   Sven goes slipping past. Kristoff runs after him.

                            KRISTOFF
                  Look out. Reindeer coming through!

                  That's it. Glide and pivot and
                  glide and pivot.

   We pull away slowly, into the sky. We arrive at a bird's-eye
   view to see that where the castle had crumbled has been
   repaired with a ice.

   All is right in Arendelle.

                                                   FINAL FADE OUT.
