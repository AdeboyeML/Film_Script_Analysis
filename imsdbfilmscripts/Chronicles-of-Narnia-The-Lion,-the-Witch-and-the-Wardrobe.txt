                         Edmund Get Away from there! What do 
                         you think you're doing?! Peter!

                         (grabs Edmund) Come on! To the shelter, 
                         now!

                         (grabs things from next to her bed with 
                         a flashlight, notices Lucy in bed) Lucy, 
                         come on! Lucy!
 
               Pevensies are running to the shelter, we hear them shouting, 
               Hurry up! and RUN!
 
               Edmund turns around, as if forgetting something.

                                     EDMUND
                         Wait, dad!

               Run inside, grabs picture gets blown against the wall

                         Come on idiot (Throws Edmund onto the 
                         ground and starts shouting) Why do you 
                         always have to be so selfish! You only 
                         think about yourself. Why can't you 
                         ever do as you're told!
 
               Peter slams the shelter door

                         If Dad were here, the war would be over,

                         If dad wasn't fighting and the war was 
                         over we wouldn't have to go.

                         The Professor knew we were coming?
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         Perhaps we've been incorrectly labeled?

                                     MRS. MACREADY
                         I'm afraid so. Is that it then? Haven't 
                         you brought anything else?
 
                                     PETER
                         No, ma'am. It's just us.

               IN THE HOUSE

               While driving the horse over the lawn, some comments like giddy 
               up, good girl
 
                                     MRS. MACREADY
                         The professor is unaccustomed to having 
                         children in his house, and as such, 
                         there are a few rules we need to follow. 
                         There will be no shouting' or running', 
                         no improper use of the dumbwaiter, NO 
                         touching of the historical artifacts 
                         and above all, there shall be no disturbing' 
                         of the Professor.

               To Lucy You saw the outside. This place is huge. We'll be able

               LUCY IN WARDROBE/NARNIA

                         (Gasp)

               Looks behind and finds Narnia. Tumnus shows up

                                     LUCY AND TUMNUS
                         AAAUUUGGGGHHHHH!!!

                                     TUMNUS
                         (slowly walking out as Lucy picks up 
                         packages) Uh, CH... gk, ch (random noises)
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         Were you hiding from me?

                                     TUMNUS
                         Huh, um, n..n.. no, I..I... I didn't 
                         want to scare you,
 
                                     LUCY
                         if you don't mind my asking...what are 
                         you?
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         Why, I'm a faun! And you must be some 
                         beardless dwarf?
 
                                     LUCY
                         I'm not a dwarf, I'm a girl! And actually 
                         I'm tallest in my class.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         But you're saying, you're a daughter 
                         of Eve?
 
                                     LUCY
                         Well, my mum's name is Helen...

                                     TUMNUS
                         Yes, but you are, in fact, human.

                                     LUCY
                         Of course.

                                     TUMNUS
                         What are you doing here?

                                     LUCY
                         Well, I came in through the wardrobe 
                         in the spare room, and-
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         Spare Oom, is that in Narnia?

                                     LUCY
                         Narnia? What's that?

                                     TUMNUS
                         My dear girl, you're in it!  Everything 
                         from the lamp post, all the way to castle 
                         Cair Paravel on the Eastern Sea, every 
                         stick and stone, every icicle, is Narnia,
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         This is an awfully big wardrobe

                                     TUMNUS
                         I'm sorry, please allow me to introduce 
                         myself, my name is Tumnus
 
                                     LUCY
                         Glad to meet you, Mr. Tumnus! *extends

                         Why?

                                     LUCY
                         I-I don't know! People do it when they 
                         meet each other.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         Lucy Pevensie, from the shining city 
                         of War Drobe in the far land of Spare 
                         Oom, how would it be if you came and 
                         had tea with me?
 
                                     LUCY
                         Oh! Well, thank you very much! But I 
                         probably should be getting back...
 
                         
                                     TUMNUS
                         Oh, come on! It's not every day I get 
                         to make a new friend! And there's a... 
                         roaring fire! And toast and cakes! And 
                         maybe... we'll even break into the sardines.
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         Well, maybe for just a little while... 
                         if you have... sardines.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         By the bucket load,

                         Come Along.

                                     IN TUMNUS' HOUSE
                         
                                     LUCY
                         Can I help you with that?

                                     TUMNUS
                         Why thank you!

               Lucy looks at the picture.

                                     TUMNUS
                         Oh... That is my father.

                                     LUCY
                         He had a nice face. You look just like 
                         him.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         No, were not alike at all really.

                                     LUCY
                         My father is fighting in the war.

                                     TUMNUS
                         My father went away to war too... but 
                         that was a very long time ago... before 
                         this dreadful winter.
 
                                     LUCY
                         Winter isn't all bad. There's ice skating 
                         and snow ball fights. Oh! And Christmas!
 
                         
                                     TUMNUS
                         We haven't had Christmas in a hundred 
                         years here.
 
                                     LUCY
                         (shocked) No presents for a hundred 
                         years?
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         But, oh, you would have loved Narnia 
                         in spring! The Dryads and the Fauns 
                         would dance all night... but we never 
                         got tired. And oh, the music! Such music. 
                         Would you... like to hear some now?
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         yes please

                                     TUMNUS
                         (gets flute out) Now, are you familiar 
                         with the Narnia lullabies?
 
                                     LUCY
                         (shakes her head): No, I'm afraid I'm 
                         not
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         Good, because this probably won't sound 
                         anything like one.
 
                                     LUCY
                         Oh I must go

                                     TUMNUS
                         It's too late for that now I'm such 
                         a bad faun
 
                                     LUCY
                         No. You're the nicest faun I've ever 
                         met.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         Then I'm afraid you've had a very poor 
                         sampling.
 
                                     LUCY
                         I'm sure you're very sorry, and you'll 
                         never do it again.
 
                                     TUMNUS
                         It's not something I have done, Lucy 
                         Pevensie. It's something I'm doing.
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         What are you doing?

                                     TUMNUS
                         I'm kidnapping you. It's the White Witch, 
                         the one that makes it always winter, 
                         and never Christmas. She told me that 
                         I If I ever was to come across a son 
                         of Adam or a daughter of Eve, I am supposed 
                         to turn it over to her!
 
                                     LUCY
                         But I thought you were my friend



               TUMNUS AND LUCY OUTSIDE/RETURN TO ENGLAND



                                     TUMNUS
                         We must move quietly the woods are full 
                         of her spies, even some of the trees 
                         are on her side
 
                                     LUCY
                         I think so. (Tumnus starts to return 
                         her handkerchief, but she gives it back) 
                         Keep it, you need it more than I do.
 
                         
               Tumnus laughs, and touches Lucy's nose...

                                     MR. TUMNUS
                         Go...   Come on, go!

               Lucy runs off, and Mr. Tumnus returns to his home

               Lucy heads for the wardrobe



               BACK IN ENGLAND



                                     PETER
                         98, 99, 100... Ready or not here I come.
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         I'm back, I'm back, it's alright,

                                     EDMUND
                         Shhh, he's coming.

                                     PETER
                         You know, I'm not sure if you two have 
                         quite gotten the idea of this game!
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         but weren't you wondering where I was?
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         That's the point! That's why he was 
                         seeking you!
 
                                     SUSAN
                         Does this mean I win?

                                     PETER
                         I don't think Lucy wants to play anymore.
 
                         
               Susan looks in the wardrobe..

                                     SUSAN
                         The only wood in here is the back of 
                         the wardrobe.
 
                                     PETER
                         One game at a time Lu, we don't all 
                         have your imagination.
 
                                     LUCY
                         But I wasn't imagining!

                                     SUSAN
                         that's enough

                                     EDMUND
                         Well I believe you.

                                     LUCY
                         You do?

                                     EDMUND
                         Yah, didn't I tell you about the football 
                         field I found in the bathroom closet?
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         Why don't you just stop it, you always 
                         have to make everything worse. Grow 
                         up!
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Shut up! You think you're dad, but you're 
                         not! (storms out)
 
                                     SUSAN
                         well, that was nicely handled! (walks 
                         away too..)
 
                                     LUCY
                         It was really there... 

                                     PETER
                         Susan's right. That's enough..



               THAT EVENING... EDMUND ENTERS NARNIA AND MEETS THE WHITE WITCH



               Lucy closes the wardrobe and she dissolves to night

               Pan down on candle burning out, Lucy gets out boots and not slippers 
               and takes candle.
 
               Flushing toilet as Edmund comes out and sees Lucy

               Follows her to wardrobe Candle blows out when she opens it and 
               walks in as Edmund does
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Lucy, Lucy. I hope you're not afraid 
                         of the dark (shuts door)
 
               Lucy, Lucy?

               Edmund is soon in Narnia, he walks around... and is amazed by 
               it all
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Lucy? Lucy! I think I believe you now!
 
                         
               Hears bells.

                                     EDMUND
                         Lucy?

                                     DWARF
                         Yah! (whipping sound)

               Edmund dives out of the way into the snow and then the dwarf 
               jumps out and throws a whip around Edmunds legs
 
               Dwarf puts knife to Edmund's throat

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         What is it Ginarrbrik?

                                     EDMUND
                         He won't let go!

                                     DWARF
                         Is that how you address the Queen of 
                         Narnia?
 
                                     EDMUND
                         I didn't know?

                                     DWARF
                         Well, you shall know her better afterwards.
 
                         
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Wait! What is your name Son-of-Adam?
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         Edmund, your majesty.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         And how was it, Edmund, that you came 
                         to enter my dominion?
 
                                     EDMUND
                         I walked through a wardrobe following 
                         my sister.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Your sister? How many are you?

                                     EDMUND
                         four

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Edmund you look so cold! Come and sit 
                         with me here on my sledge. (Edmund joins 
                         her) Now, would like something warm 
                         to drink.
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Yes...your majesty.(Take vial and drops 
                         a green drop on snow that become a hot 
                         drink that the dwarf gives Edmund) How 
                         did you do that?
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I can make anything you like.

                                     EDMUND
                         Could you make me taller?

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I can make anything you like to eat
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         Turkish Delight

               Drop once again comes down and makes the box of Turkish Delight 
               and the Dwarf gives it to Edmund
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I'd love to see your family

                                     EDMUND
                         They're nothing special

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I have no children of my own and you 
                         are such a good little boy (I never 
                         could hear those words right) where 
                         I could see, one day, you becoming prince 
                         of Narnia - maybe even king.
 
                                     EDMUND
                         (mouth full) Really?

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         (nods) Of course you'd have to bring 
                         your family.
 
                                     EDMUND
                         They're nothing special

                                     EDMUND
                         Oh, Peter will be king too?

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         No! But a king needs servants.

                                     EDMUND
                         I-I guess I could bring 'em.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Beyond these woods, do you see those 
                         two little hills? My house is right 
                         between them. You'd love it there Edmund, 
                         it has whole rooms simply stuffed with 
                         Turkish Delight!
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Couldn't I have some more now?

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         NO! (smiles) Don't want to ruin you 
                         appetite.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I'm going to miss you Edmund. But we 
                         are going to see each other soon.
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         I hope so.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Until then...dear one. (WW drives of 
                         and Ed is left alone)
 
                                     LUCY
                         Edmund? Oh Edmund!!!! (hugs her brother) 
                         I saw Mr. Tumnus again and he's fine!!! 
                         The White Witch hasn't found out about 
                         him helping me!
 
                                     EDMUND
                         The White Witch?

                                     LUCY
                         She calls herself the Queen of Narnia, 
                         but she really isn't. Edmund? Are you 
                         okay? You look awful.
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Well what do you expect! It's freezing! 
                         How do we get out of here?
 
                                     LUCY
                         Come on...this way.



               BACK IN ENGLAND



                                     LUCY
                         (turns on the light and jumps on Peter) 
                         Peter, Peter wake up! It's there, it's 
                         really there!
 
                                     PETER
                         (rolls over still half asleep) Lucy, 
                         what are talking about?
 
                                     LUCY
                         Narnia! It's all in the wardrobe, like 
                         I told you!
 
               Susan comes in.

                                     SUSAN
                         Oh Lucy, you've been dreaming.

                                     LUCY
                         No I wasn't, I saw Mr. Tumnus again! 
                         Oh, and this time - Edmund went too.
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         You saw the faun?

                                     LUCY
                         Well, he didn't actually go there with 
                         me. What were you doing Edmund?
 
                                     EDMUND
                         I-I was just playing along. You know 
                         what little children are like these 
                         days, they just don't know when to stop 
                         pretending (sits on his bed looking 
                         smugly at Lucy)
 
               Lucy starts to cry and runs out of the room. Susan runs after 
               her and so does Peter - who shoves Edmund over
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Ow!

               Lucy runs down the hall and smack into the Professor, she looks 
               up a little frightened and then starts her crying all over again, 
               hugging him
 
                                     MRS. MACREADY
                         You children are one shenanigan shy 
                         of sleeping' in the stable- oh, Professor! 
                         I told them you were not to be disturbed.
 
                         
                                     PROFESSOR
                         Oh, it's alright Mrs. Macready - I'm 
                         sure there's a logical explanation. 
                         But I think this one needs some hot 
                         chocolate.
 
                                     MRS. MACREADY
                         Yes Professor. Come on, dear.

               Mrs. Macready takes Lucy down the hall. Peter and Susan turn 
               to go
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         *Ahem* (the two turn and follow him 
                         into his office and the Professor sits 
                         at his desk and takes some tobacco out 
                         of it's silver apple case and puts it 
                         in his pipe)
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         You seem to have upset the internal 
                         balance of my housekeeper.
 
                                     PETER
                         We are very sorry sir, it won't happen 
                         again.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         It's our sister sir, Lucy.

                                     PROF
                         The weeping girl?

                                     SUSAN
                         Yes sir, she's upset.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         Hence the weeping

                                     PETER
                         We can handle it! (takes Susan's sleeve)
 
                         
                                     PROFESSOR
                         Oh, I can see that.

                                     SUSAN
                         She thinks she's found a magical land 
                         in the upstairs wardrobe.
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         What did you say!?

                                     PETER
                         The wardrobe upstairs, Lucy thinks she's 
                         found a forest inside.
 
               Susan and Peter sit on a couch and the Professor sits in a chair 
               across from them
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         What was it like?

                                     SUSAN
                         Like talking to a lunatic!

                                     PROFESSOR
                         No, not her - the forest!

                                     PETER
                         You're-you're not saying you believe 
                         her?
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         No, not her - the forest!

                                     PETER
                         You....you actually believe her?

                                     PROFESSOR
                         Well don't you?

                                     SUSAN
                         Well, logically it couldn't possibly 
                         be there!
 
                                     PROFESSOR
                         What do they teach at these schools?
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         Edmund said they were only pretending
 
                         
                                     PROFESSOR
                         And he's the more truthful one is he?
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         No, this would be the first time.

                                     PROFESSOR
                         Well then, id your sister isn't lying 
                         and isn't mad then logically we must 
                         assume that she is telling the truth. 
                         She's your sister, isn't she? You're 
                         a family! It's high time you start acting 
                         like one!
 
               


               CRICKET



                                     PETER
                         Peter winds up, goes for the bowl!
 
                         
               Ball hits Edmund in the leg

                                     EDMUND
                         Ow!

                                     PETER
                         Whoops! Wake up, Dolly Daydream!

                                     EDMUND
                         Can't we play hide and go seek again?
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         I thought you said that it was a kid's 
                         game.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         Besides, we can all use the fresh air.
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         Not like there's air inside

                                     PETER
                         Are you ready then?

                                     EDMUND
                         Are you? (smacks his bat on the ground 
                         and gets ready to hit the ball)
 
               Peter pitches the ball, hard, and Edmund whacks it good and it 
               smashes through an upstairs window and crashes into a suit of 
               armor.


 
               UPSTAIRS



               The children are looking at the broken window and the suit of 
               armor on the floor
 
                                     PETER
                         Well done, Ed!

                                     EDMUND
                         You bowled it!

                                     SUSAN
                         Listen, Mrs. Macready is coming

                                     PETER
                         Run!

                                     EDMUND
                         (runs to the wardrobe and opens the 
                         door) Come on!
 
                                     SUSAN
                         You have got to be joking.

                                     PETER
                         Go!

                                     SUSAN
                         Get back!

               SOUNDS OF KIDS GRIPING

               Susan and Peter fall backwards.



               IN NARNIA



                                     SUSAN
                         Impossible!

                                     LUCY
                         Don't worry, it's probably just your 
                         imagination
 
                                     PETER
                         I don't suppose saying we're sorry would 
                         quite cover it?
 
                                     LUCY
                         No, it wouldn't. But this might!

               Lucy nails Peter in the face with a snowball, he throws one back 
               at her and a snowball fight
 
               begins. Susan hits Ed in the arm with one

                                     EDMUND
                         Ow! (rubs his arm) Stop it! (They all 
                         realize that Ed lied)
 
                                     PETER
                         You little liar!

                                     EDMUND
                         You didn't believe her either!

                                     PETER
                         Apologize to Lucy. (He just looks at 
                         her)
 
                                     PETER
                         Say you're sorry! (Peter steps up to 
                         him)
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Alright! I'm sorry.

                                     LUCY
                         That's alright, some little children 
                         just don't know when to stop pretending. 
                         (looks at him smugly)
 
                                     EDMUND
                         (mutters): Very funny.

                                     SUSAN
                         Maybe we should go back

                                     EDMUND
                         Can't we at lease take a look around?
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         I think Lucy must decide!

                                     LUCY
                         I all want you to meet Mr. Tumnus!
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         Well Mr. Tumnus it is (walks into the 
                         wardrobe again)
 
                                     SUSAN
                         We can't just walk around in these clothes!
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         (comes out) We can use these coats.
 
                         
                                     SUSAN
                         Peter, they don't belong to us.

                                     PETER
                         Well I don't think the professor will 
                         mind. And if you think about it logically 
                         we are not even taking them out of the 
                         wardrobe. (Hands coat to Edmund)
 
                                     EDMUND
                         But that's a girl's coat!

                                     PETER
                         I know.

               OUTSIDE AGAIN



               They step outside, they hear rustles from the bushes. Mr. Beaver 
               approaches
 
                                     LUCY
                         It's a beaver.

               Peter approaches the beaver, clicking his tongue

                                     PETER
                         Here, boy *clicks* come here...*clicks*
 
                         
               Peter let's out his hand, Mr. Beaver stares at it then sits upright
 
               
                                     MR.BEAVER
                         Well, I ain't gonna smell it if that's 
                         what you want!
 
                                     EDMUND
                         It's a talking beaver!

                         Lucy Pevensie?

                                     LUCY
                         Yes?

               Mr. Beaver hands her the handkerchief

                                     LUCY
                         This is the handkerchief I gave to Mr-
 
                         
                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Tumnus. He gave it to me just before 
                         they took him.
 
                                     LUCY
                         Is he alright?

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Further in.(Mr. Beaver scurries off, 
                         Susan grabs Peter by the arm)
 
                                     SUSAN
                         Peter, we don't know what you are doing.
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         She's right. How do we know we can trust 
                         this beaver?
 
                                     PETER
                         He say's he knows the faun.

                                     SUSAN
                         He's a beaver...he shouldn't be saying 
                         anything!
 
                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Is everything alright?

                                     PETER
                         Yes. We were just talking

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         That's better left for safer corners.

                         He means the trees.

               Walk to Beaver's dam through the cliffs under a bridge and then 
               they see the Dam

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         It's long been told that two sons of 
                         Adam and two daughters of Eve will appear 
                         to defeat the White Witch, and restore 
                         peace to Narnia.
 
                                     PETER
                         And you think we're the ones???

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Well you'd better be, Aslan's already 
                         fitted out your army!!!
 
                                     PETER
                         I think you've made a mistake; we're 
                         not heroes!
 
                                     SUSAN
                         We're from Finchley!

                                     PETER
                         I think it's time we were going.

                                     LUCY
                         But what about Mr. Tumnus?

                                     PETER
                         Sorry Lucy. It's out of our hands.
 
                         
                                     SUSAN
                         Thank you for your hospitality.

                                     PETER
                         Ed, time to go- Ed? (looks around the 
                         room) I'm going to kill him.
 
                                     MR. BEAVER
                         You may not have to...Has Edmund been 
                         to Narnia before?
 
               Shot of Ed walking to the Witch's castle without his coat - shot 
               of the others trying to catch up to him
 
                                     PETER
                         Hurry up!

               They reach the top of the hill and see Ed going through the Witch's 
               castle gates
 
                                     LUCY
                         (shouting) Edmund!

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Shh! They'll hear ya!

               Peter starts to run after Edmund but Mr. Beaver grabs him by 
               the sleeve of his coat
 
                                     PETER
                         Get off me!

                                     PETER
                         We just can't let him go!

                                     BEAVER
                         Don't you get it?! He's the bait! She 
                         wants all of ya in there!!! To kill 
                         ya!
 
                                     SUSAN
                         This is all your fault! None of this 
                         would have happened if you had just 
                         listened to me in the first place!
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         So you knew this would happen?

                                     SUSAN
                         I didn't know what would happen...
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         Stop, this fighting isn't going to help 
                         Edmund
 
                                     BEAVER
                         She's right. Only Aslan can save him 
                         now.
 
                                     PETER
                         Then take us to him.



               EDMUND AT THE WITCH'S HOUSE



               Edmund is walking through the courtyard and see's Giant Rumblebuffin. 
               He walks further in and see's a stone lion - he draws glasses 
               and a moustache on it
 
               Edmund continues through the courtyard, he steps over what he 
               thinks is a log of some sort...only to be lurched on by Maugrim!
 
               
                                     MAUGRIM
                         Stand still stranger!

                                     EDMUND
                         I'm a Son of Adam, I met the Queen in 
                         the woods!
 
               Maugrim gets off him.

                                     MAUGRIM
                         My apologies, fortunate favourite of 
                         the queen - or perhaps not so fortunate.
 
                         
               walks into the throne-room

                                     MAUGRIM
                         Wait here (Edmund sees the glorious 
                         throne, and sits on it longingly. Then, 
                         the witch comes up behind him and says, 
                         scaring him half to death.)
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         You like it!

                                     EDMUND
                         (he jumps up startled) Ye... yes, your 
                         majesty!
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I thought you might

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Tell me, you sisters, are they deaf?
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         No

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         and your brother, unintelligent?

                                     EDMUND
                         Well I think so, but mom says...

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Then how dare you come alone! Edmund, 
                         I ask so little of you
 
                                     EDMUND
                         They just don't listen to me!

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Couldn't even do that!

                                     EDMUND
                         I...I did bring them half way. There 
                         at the dam at the house of the beaver's!
 
                         
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Well...I guess your not a total lost 
                         then.
 
               Edmund approaches again.

                                     EDMUND
                         Is there any chance I may have some 
                         more Turkish delight now?
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Ginnabrick, our guest is hungry

                                     GINNABRICK
                         This way...for your num nums...

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Maugrim!!!! You know what to do....
 
                         
               Maugrim let's out a howl, Edmund realizes the horrible truth 
               as wolves surround the castle...they charge from the castle
 
               

               BACK AT THE BEAVERS HOUSE



                                     MAUGRIM
                         Take them

                                     MR.BEAVER
                         Hurry Mum, they are after us!

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         right then...

                                     SUSAN
                         What is she doing?

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         Don't worry, you'll thank you me later. 
                         it's a long journey and a beaver gets 
                         cranky when he's hungry.
 
                                     BEAVER
                         I'M CRANKY NOW!

                                     SUSAN
                         Do you think we should bring jam?

                                     PETER
                         Only if the Witch has toast.



               GOES INSIDE THE TUNNEL



                                     MR. BEAVER
                         This should lead to Aslan's

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         I thought it lead to your mums!

               Lucy falls howling.

                                     LUCY
                         They're in the tunnel!

               (run further, comes to dead end)

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         You should have brought a map!

                                     BEAVER
                         There was no room next to the jam!
 
                         
               He jumps out of the hole. Everyone else follow. Once Peter gets 
               out, Lucy falls on a bunch of stone things.
 
               Lucy gets up! They all see stone animals!

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         He was my best mate! (cries)

               they cast aside the fox , where he lays whimpering on the ground

                         more troops.
 
                                     MR. BEAVER
                         You've seen Aslan!

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         What is He like?

                                     FOX
                         Like everything we have ever heard. 
                         He'll be a good help fighting the White 
                         Witch
 
                                     SUSAN
                         We are not planning fighting any witch
 
                         
                                     FOX
                         Surely King Peter...

                         We just want to get our brother back.
 
                       

  
               BACK TO THE WITCHES HOUSE.. IN THE DUNGEON



               Edmund, in chains at the witches palace. He attempts to eat the 
               food he is given, but coughs and spits it out, because of its 
               taste. He then attempts to drink a cup, which is frozen. He then 
               throws it on the tray.
 
                                     MR. TUMNUS
                         Are you gonna eat that? (from the other 
                         prison)
 
               Edmund gives him the food.

                                     EDMUND
                         Mr... Tumnus.

                                     MR. TUMNUS
                         Your Lucy Pevensies brother.

                                     EDMUND
                         I'm Edmund!

                                     MR. TUMNUS
                         You have the same nose.

               Edmund rubs his nose.

                                     MR. TUMNUS
                         Is your sister alright? (no answer) 
                         Is she safe?
 
                                     EDMUND
                         I... I don't know!

               White Witch comes in and they go back to their places

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         My wolves tore that dam apart, your 
                         little family was nowhere to be found. 
                         (Lifts Edmund off the ground) Where 
                         are they?!
 
                                     EDMUND
                         I don't know..

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Then you are no longer any use to me...Guard
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         Wait they said something about Aslan
 
                         
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Aslan! Where?

                                     MR. TUMNUS
                         Stranger has only been in Narnia a short...(Hit 
                         in head)
 
                                     EDMUND
                         I left before I could hear anymore...I 
                         wanted to see you again.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Guard!

                                     GUARD
                         Yes, your majesty

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Release the Faun (Guard hit chains and 
                         Tumnus cries out in pain as they drop 
                         him by the Witch) Do you know why you 
                         are here?
 
                                     MR. TUMNUS
                         Because I believe in a free Narnia
 
                         
               Witch stares at him coldly

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         You're here because he (points at Edmund) 
                         turned you in...for sweeties. (turns 
                         to dwarf and guard) Take him (Tumnus) 
                         upstairs and ready my sleigh, Edmund 
                         misses his family.
 


               THE ROCK BRIDGE



                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Now Aslan's camp is just over there 
                         by the stone table just across the frozen 
                         river.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         River?

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         It's been frozen for 100 years

                                     PETER
                         It seems so far

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         It's the world dear, did you expect 
                         it to be small?
 
                                     SUSAN
                         Smaller...

               They continue their journey.



               BACK TO EDMUND



               Dwarf brings Edmund up and he sees Tumnus turned to stone

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Whenever you are ready Son-of-Adam.
 
                         
               Sleigh goes off into forest with Edmund looking at the cold White 
               Witch

                         If he tells me to Hurry up one more 
                         time I'm going to turn him into a big 
                         fluffy hat
 
                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Hurry up Son-of-Adam! We don't have 
                         all day.

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         It's her! Run!

               Quick down here!



               FEW MINUTES PASSES



                                     LUCY
                         Maybe she's gone.

                                     PETER
                         I'll go and have a look

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         No, you're no good to Narnia dead.
 
                         
                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         Neither are you Beaver.

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Thanks dear.

               Long pause and some noise then...

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         AHHH!....

                                     LUCY
                         AHHH!

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         I hope you've been good, because there 
                         is someone here to see you.
 
               Father Christmas stands there.

                                     LUCY
                         Merry Christmas, Sir!

                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         It certainly is, Lucy. Thanks to you.
 
                         
                                     SUSAN
                         I thought there was no Christmas in 
                         Narnia.
 
                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         It hasn't been for a hundred years. 
                         But now the Witch's power is crumbling. 
                         (he goes to his bag and throws it to 
                         the ground)
 
                                     LUCY
                         Presents!

                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         Lucy, Eve's Daughter. These are for 
                         you. The juice of the fire flower. If 
                         you, or one of your friends are wounded, 
                         one drop of this cordial will restore 
                         them. And though I do not expect you 
                         to use it, this.
 
                                     LUCY
                         Well, I think I could be brave enough.
 
                         
                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         I'm sure you could. But battles are 
                         ugly affairs. Eve's Daughter, Susan. 
                         Trust in this bow, for it does not easily 
                         miss.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         What happened to, 'battles are ugly 
                         affairs?'
 
                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         And, though you don't seem to have trouble 
                         making yourself heard, this. When you 
                         put this horn to your lips and blow 
                         it, wherever you are, help will come.
 
                         
                                     SUSAN
                         Thanks.

                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS
                         And, Peter. These are tools, not toys. 
                         The time to use them may be soon at 
                         hand.
 
                                     FATHER CHRISTMAS

                         Long live Aslan! (he gets in his sleigh 
                         and rides off)
 
                                     THE CHILDREN
                         Bye... Merry Christmas!

                                     LUCY
                         Told you he was real!

                                     PETER

                                     SUSAN
                         Wait, maybe we should think about this.
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         We don't have time.

                         I was just trying to be realistic

                                     PETER
                         No, you're trying to be smart...as usual!

               Stabs sword into the ice, and they float away...

               They get to shore. Peter has Lucy's coat in hand, but no Lucy.
 
               
                                     SUSAN

                         Has anyone seen my coat?

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Your brother has you well looked after.
 
                         
               Everyone laughs and embraces.

                                     MRS. BEAVER
                         I don't think you'll be needing those 
                         coats any more!
 
               Walk through and see spring coming about and flowers budding 
               as they leave there coats and head toward Aslan's Camp
 
               BACK TO THE WATERFALL, THE WITCH, EDMUND AND DWARF

                         It's so warm here! (Cold look from Witch) 
                         I think I'll go check the sleigh.

                         We found the traitor (Carrying the Fox) 
                         He was gathering troops near the sharwood 
                         forest.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Nice of you to drop by. I understand 
                         you were so helpful to my wolves last 
                         night.

                         Not to seem rude, but I wasn't actually 
                         talking to you (Looks at Edmund)
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         (Looks first to Edmund and than at Fox) 
                         Where is ASLAN! Answer me! (About to 
                         hit him with wand)
 
                                     EDMUND
                         Wait! The Beavers said something about 
                         the Stone Table and an army.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Thank you Edmund. It is good for this 
                         creature to see some honesty before 
                         he dies..
 
                                     EDMUND
                         NO!(Fox to stone and White Slaps Edmund

                         Think who's side you are on. MINE...(turns 
                         his head) Or theirs? If it is a war 
                         Aslan wants (turns butterfly to stone) 
                         It's a war he shall get.
 


               AT ASLAN'S CAMP



                                     SUSAN
                         Why are they all staring at us?

                                     LUCY
                         Maybe they think you look funny.

               Peter smiles.

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         Oh stop your fussing Mrs. Beaver. You 
                         look lovely.
 
               Peter pulls out sword.

                                     PETER
                         (To Oreius) We have come to see Aslan.
 
                         
               Tent starts to blow in breeze and everyone kneels. Aslan comes 
               from the tent and the children kneel
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Welcome Peter Adam's son, Welcome Susan 
                         and Lucy daughters-of-Eve. Welcome Beavers. 
                          You have my thanks, but where is the 
                         fourth.
 
                                     PETER
                         That's why we are here.

                                     SUSAN
                         We had a little trouble along the way.
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         He's been captured by the White Witch
 
                         
                                     CROWD
                         Captured!

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         He betrayed them your Excellence!

                                     OREIUS
                         Then he has betrayed us all

                                     ASLAN
                         Peace Oreius.

                                     PETER
                         It is my fault really. I was too hard 
                         on him.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         We all were.

                                     LUCY
                         Sir, he's our brother.

                                     ASLAN
                         I know dear and that makes the betrayal 
                         all the worse. It may be harder than 
                         you think
 


               PETER AND ASLAN ON HILL



                                     ASLAN
                         That is Cair Paravel of the four thrones 
                         one of which you must sit as High King.

                         You doubt the prophecy

                                     PETER
                         No, that's just it...you're not who 
                         I think I am
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Peter Pevensie formerly of Finnchley. 
                         Beaver also said you wanted to turn 
                         him into a hat.
 
               light laughes Peter there is a Deep Magic that rules over Narnia. 
               It defines right from wrong and helps us fulfill destinies, both 
               yours and mine.
 
                                     PETER
                         I don't think I will be able.

                                     ASLAN
                         You were able to get your family here.
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         Not all of them.

                                     ASLAN
                         I will do what I can for Edmund. I too 
                         want my family safe.
 


               SUSAN AND LUCY ARE GOING DOWN TO THE RIVER



                                     SUSAN
                         Mother hasn't had a dress like this 
                         since before the war
 
                                     LUCY
                         Maybe we had bring back a whole trunk 
                         load when we go home.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         If we go home...Sorry I guess I am like 
                         that. Remember when we use to have fun?
 
                         
                                     LUCY
                         Yes, before you go boring.

                                     SUSAN
                         Oh really (Splashes water and this continues 
                         as Susan goes to get towel and...)
 
                         
               WOLVES

                                     WOLF
                         Now, We're very tired. We'd prefer to 
                         kill you quickly.
 
               (Throws towel)

                                     CUT TO
                         Peter and Aslan

               Susan's horn is blown, Peter runs to her direction, Aslan follows 
               him
 
                                     CUT TO
                         Susan and Lucy

               Susan and Lucy are in a tree and wolf trying to get them. Peter 
               come back through the river
 
               Aslan pins the second wolf to the ground and says to his group
 
               
               Stay back. This is Peter's battle.

               The wolf attacks him. And everyone thinks he is dead

                                     SUSAN AND LUCY
                         Peter... no!

               They run up to him, and see he is alive and looks disgusted by 
               killing the wolf. Aslan lets go the other wolf
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Follow him! He'll lead you to Edmund. 
                         Peter, clean your sword.
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Rise, Sir Peter Wolfsbane--Knight of 
                         Narnia.
 
               Peter looks at Aslan in awe

               All embrace him and are excited about this



               WITCHES CAMP



               Edmund is tied to tree as the Dwarf taunts him

                                     GENERAL OTMIN
                         The Minotaurs on the left, send in the 
                         dwarfs first.
 
               White Witch looks at the plans and then...

               Aslan's army comes in and there is confusion. White Witch goes 
               through camp and see Dwarf to tree, knife in hat and him tied 
               and gagged. She takes the knife and looks like she's going to 
               kill him then cuts him down
 
                                     DWARF
                         You're not going to kill him?

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Not yet! We have work to do (turning 
                         to Otmin)
 


               MORNING ASLAN'S CAMP



               Aslan and Edmund are on the rock above camp Peter comes out and 
               see him and then the girls
 
                                     LUCY
                         EDMUND!

               Peter stops her. Aslan motions Edmund down and they go to the 
               group of his siblings
 
                                     ASLAN
                         What's done is done. There is no reason 
                         to bring up the past with your brother.
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         Hello...

                                     LUCY
                         Oh, Edmund (Hugs him and Susan does 
                         too)
 
                                     SUSAN
                         How are you feeling?

                                     EDMUND
                         I'm feeling kinda tired

                                     PETER
                         Get some rest...and Edmund try not to 
                         wander off again.
 
               Some time later, breakfast

                                     LUCY
                         Narnia isn't going to run out of toast 
                         Edmund
 
                                     PETER
                         then you better pack some for the journey
 
                         
                                     SUSAN
                         So were going home?

                                     PETER
                         You are, I promised I'd keep you three 
                         safe but there's no reason I can't stay 
                         and help.
 
                                     LUCY
                         but they need us...All four of us

                                     PETER
                         Lucy it's too dangerous. You almost 
                         drowned, Edmund was almost killed!
 
                         
                                     EDMUND
                         Which is why we have to stay.

               They all look at him.

                                     EDMUND
                         I've seen what the White Witch can do 
                         and I've helped her do it, and we can't 
                         leave these people behind to suffer for it.

               Lucy holds Ed's hand.

                                     SUSAN
                         Well I guess that's it then. *gets up*
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         Where are you going?

                                     SUSAN
                         (picks up bow and quiver) To get in 
                         some practice.
 
               Susan and Lucy practice shooting at the target. Then it cuts 
               to Peter and Edmund practicing sword fighting
 
                                     PETER
                         Come on Ed, sword hand up like Oreius 
                         showed us.
 
               The beavers come running up. Edmund's horse rears

                                     EDMUND
                         Whoa horsey!

                                     HORSE
                         My name is Philip.

                                     EDMUND
                         Oh, sorry

                                     MR. BEAVER
                         you better come quick the White Witch 
                         has requested a meeting with Aslan...
 

                         
               WITCH IN ASLANS CAMP



                                     DWARF
                         Jadis.. Jadis!!!

               Jadis arrives at the camp, Cyclops carry her bed-thingy...She 
               hops down, and walks towards Aslan
 
                                     JADIS
                         You have a traitor in your midst, Aslan.
 
                         
               Everyone gasps.

                                     ASLAN
                         His offence was not against you.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Have you forgotten the Deep Magic?
 
                         
                                     ASLAN
                         Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch. 
                         I was there when it was made.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Then you will know that the boy belongs 
                         to me. (turns to crowd) That boy (points 
                         to Edmund) will die on the Stone Table.
 
                         
                                     PETER
                         Come and take it then.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         You think that a simple threat will 
                         deny me my right, little king? Aslan 
                         knows that if I do not have blood as 
                         the law demands, all of Narnia will 
                         be overturned, and perish, in fire and 
                         water.
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Enough, I shall talk with you alone.
 
                         
               (time passes and the Witch exits tent)

                                     ASLAN
                         The Witch has denounced her claim on 
                         Edmund
 
               Narnians cheer.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         How will I know your promise will be 
                         kept?
 
               Aslan roars. the White Witch falls into her seat and the Narnians 
               laugh. The White Witch leaves. Aslan sighs and walks into his 
               tent.
 


               THAT NIGHT...



               Lucy is quietly resting, when she see's a shadow...she wakes 
               Susan
 
                                     LUCY
                         Susan!

               Susan see's the shadow, the two leave their tent. Aslan is leaving 
               the camp...they follow him. and follow him...and follow him. 
               Until-
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Aren't you suppose to be in bed?

                                     LUCY
                         We couldn't sleep

                                     SUSAN
                         Please, Aslan. Couldn't we come with 
                         you?
 
                                     ASLAN
                         I would be glad of the company tonight.
 
                         
               (Walk further)

                                     ASLAN
                         It is time. From now on, I must go on 
                         alone. Thank you Susan. Thank you Lucy. 
                         And farewell.
 
                                     LUCY
                         (later after lots of jeers towards Aslan 
                         as he walks to the Stone Table) Why 
                         doesn't he fight back?
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Bind him. Wait. First let him be shaved.
 
                         
               More jeers and catcalls...

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         Tonight, the Deep magic will be appeased, 
                         but tomorrow, we will take Narnia, Forever!
 
                         
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         You know, Aslan, I'm a little disappointed 
                         in you. Did you really think that by 
                         giving your life you would save the 
                         Human boy? Ha. You are giving up your 
                         life, and saving no one. So much for 
                         love.
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         In that knowledge... Despair... and 
                         DIE!!!!!!
 
               She plunges in the knife and Aslan's growls in pain and his eyes 
               slowly close
 
                                     WHITE WITCH
                         The great cat is DEAD!!

               Her army cheers loudly.

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         General, gather your army and prepare 
                         for battle. However short it may be.
 
                         
               Otmin lets out a huge roar



               AFTER THE WHITE WITCH AND CREATURES ARE GONE


               The girls come up and cry and lean on Aslan. Lucy gets an idea, 
               unscrews her potion
 
                                     SUSAN
                         It's too late. He's gone. I'm sure he 
                         knew what he was doing.
 
                                     
                         We have to go.

                                     LUCY
                         We can't just leave him here.

                                     SUSAN
                         Lucy there's not time. We have to tell 
                         the others.
 
                                     LUCY
                         The Trees

               Back at Aslan's camp in the boys' tent

                                     DRYAD
                         Fear not my princes. I come with tidings 
                         of grave news..
 
               Peter walks out of the tent.

                                     PETER
                         It is true, he's gone

                                     EDMUND
                         Then you'll have to lead us. There's 
                         a whole army out there waiting to follow 
                         you.
 
                                     PETER
                         I can't

                                     EDMUND
                         Aslan believed you could. And so do 
                         I.
 
                                     OREIUS
                         what are your orders?

               Peter looks at map... you see the battle field



               BATTLE



                                     GRYPHON
                         They come, you highness, in numbers 
                         and weapons far greater then our own.
 
                         
                                     OREIUS
                         Numbers do not win a battle

                                     PETER
                         No, but I bet they help

               Arrival of the Witch's army

                                     WHITE WITCH
                         I take no interest in prisoners. Kill 
                         them all
 
               Army charges, gryphons attack

                                     OTMAN
                         Look to the sky



               BATTLE TRULY BEGINS



                                     PETER
                         Are you with me?

                                     ORIEUS
                         To the death!

                                     PETER
                         FOR NARNIA, AND FOR ASLAN!!!!

               PETER'S CHARGE BEGINS

               Back to the girls at the Stone Table

               Lucy and Susan wake up.

                                     SUSAN
                         We should go.

                                     LUCY
                         I'm so cold.

               They start walking away...Stone Table cracks

                                     LUCY
                         Susan!

                                     SUSAN
                         What have they done?

               Aslan appears, sending shivers down EVERYONE'S spine!

                                     SUSAN AND LUCY
                         ASLAN!

               Aslan laughs.

                                     SUSAN
                         We saw the Witch, the knife.

                                     ASLAN
                         If the Witch knew the true meaning of 
                         sacrifice, she might have interpreted 
                         the Deep Magic a little differently. 
                         For she would know that if a willing 
                         victim who had committed no treachery 
                         died in a traitors stead, the Stone 
                         Table would crack and death itself would 
                         begin to unwind.
 
                                     SUSAN
                         We sent the word that you were dead. 
                         Peter and Edmund would have gone to 
                         war.

                         (draws knife) We have to help them.
 
                         
                                     ASLAN
                         We will, but not alone. Now, climb on 
                         my back. We have a long ways to go and 
                         little time to get there. And you might 
                         want to cover your ears. ROAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
                         
               BACK TO THE BATTLE

                                     PETER
                         Fall back! Draw them to the rocks!
 
                         
                                     BEAVER
                         That's the signal! Get ready!

                                     EDMUND
                         FIRE!

               Swish! Bang! Grunt! Crash! Clash! Roar! Aaaahhh!!! Ouch!

               Peter falls off his unicorn. Oreius and the rhino charge

                                     PETER
                         Stop!

               They don't.

               Witch ducks attack, parries blades, spins her wand and turns 
               Oreius to stone
 
               Back to Aslan and the girls.. at the Witches house

               Cuts to stone centaur in the Witch's castle. Lucy and Susan are 
               looking for Mr. Tumnus. Lucy finds him and starts to cry, while 
               Susan hugs her. Aslan walks up and breathes on Mr. Tumnus, and 
               Mr. Tumnus is restored. He falls forward into Lucy and Susan's 
               arm
 
                                     LUCY
                         Susan this is...

                                     SUSAN
                         MR TUMNUS!!!!

               They hug....then they see Aslan

                                     ASLAN
                         Come, lets search the castle - others 
                         may still be trapped inside and Peter 
                         will need all the help he can get.
 
                         
               BACK TO THE BATTLE

                                     PETER
                         Ed! There are too many of them! Go! 
                         Get out of here! Get the girls, and 
                         get them home!
 
                                     BEAVER
                         Come on, you heard him!

               Ed starts to leave, then sees the Witch. And starts to go back
 
               
                                     BEAVER
                         Peter said to go!

                                     EDMUND
                         Peter's not King yet!

               Edmund rushes down the hill and breaks the witch's sword, then 
               she stabs him with the remainders of her wand. so the next thing 
               that is actually said is a grunt issued from Edmund and... 
 
               
                                     PETER
                         Edmund!!(silenced)

               Peter and the Witch fight, then they see Aslan

                                     WITCH
                         Impossible!

               Aslan rushes to kill the Witch, everything disappears

                                     ASLAN
                         It is finished.

               The three Pevensies reunite

                                     SUSAN
                         Where's Edmund?

               The dwarf hobbles up and is about to finish Edmund

                                     SUSAN
                         Edmund! (shoots arrow, kills the dwarf)
 
                         
               Edmund coughs and gasps. Lucy pulls out her cordial and places 
               one drop on Edmund's lips. He stops moving momentarily before 
               gasping and sitting up
 
                                     PETER
                         When are you ever going to do are you're 
                         told?
 
               Laughing and hugging  Group Hug Lucy gets the idea to heal everyone 
               and she walks over too someone else who is hurt. Then you see 
               Cair Paravel, and horns blowing. The coronation of the Pevensies 
               began. They walk up the aisle happily, and stand next to their 
               cool chairs.
 
                                     ASLAN
                         Bring forth the crowns!

               Tumnus and Mr. Beaver bring out the crowns.

                                     ASLAN
                         (As they put on her crown) To the glistening 
                         eastern sea, I give you Queen Lucy the 
                         Valiant. To the great western woods, 
                         (puts his crown on) King Edmund the 
                         Just. To the radiant southern sun, (puts 
                         crown on) Queen Susan the Gentle. (crown 
                         put on) And to the clear northern skies, 
                         King Peter the Magnificent. Once a king 
                         or Queen of Narnia, always a king or 
                         queen.
 
                                     EVERYONE
                         Long live King Peter! Long live Queen 
                         Susan! Long live King Edmund! And long 
                         live Queen Lucy!
 
               Aslan walking on the beach in the sunset

               Lucy runs out to the balcony and see him walking away

                                     TUMNUS
                         We'll see him again.

                                     LUCY
                         When?

                                     TUMNUS
                         In time...you mustn't press him, He 
                         isn't a tame lion...
 
                                     LUCY
                         No, but he's good...

                                     TUMNUS
                         Here (pulling a hankie from his person) 
                         I think you need this more than I do.
 
                         
               she takes it and sees that Aslan has disappeared and begins to 
               cry softly, her and Tumnus hold hands as she looks into the sunset.

               WARDROBE AT NIGHT

               Lucy tries to get into the wardrobe and then...

                                     PROFESSOR
                         I don't think you'll get back in that 
                         way...you see I've already tried.

                         Will we ever go back?

                                     PROFESSOR
                         I expect so, probably when you least 
                         expect it. What's to say Keep your eyes 
                         open (They walk out the room and the 
                         wardrobe door opens a crack and a light 
                         and smoke come out and we hear a roar)
