                         BLINDING WHITENESS
          We hear a MAN GASPING softly.     Rhythmically.
          A LUMINOUS PALE SHAPE slowly forms out of the searing
          whiteness. Gradually we realize we're moving across the
          ALABASTER BODY of a WOMAN. Her skin translucent.

          ON THE WOMAN'S FACE
          Ethereal.   Her eyes closed.     Her face lifeless.   Then...
          ...her eyes open. She looks straight at us with unseeing
          pale blue eyes. This is ANNA (late 20s).
          We pull back. PAUL (30s) makes love to Anna. Their
          movements perfunctory. Passionless. He turns to look at
          her. Realizes she's not there. He suddenly stops.
          Rolls off her. Sits on the edge of the bed.

                                                  PAUL
                      What's wrong?

                                                  ANNA
                      Nothing.
          Anna leans down and picks up her RED SLIP from the floor.

                                                  PAUL

                                            (SIGHS WEARILY)
                      You used to enjoy it. Now it's...
          He shakes his head.    Frustrated.   Lights a cigarette.

                                                  PAUL
                      ...it's like fucking a corpse.
          Paul immediately realizes he's gone too far.      Turns to Anna.

                                                   PAUL
                      Shit.   I'm sorry.   That was--
          Anna gets out of bed. Walks towards the bathroom.       Paul
          puts his head in his hands.

                         

          INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Through the fogged shower partition we see the blurred
          ghostly figure of Anna. Paul walks in.

                                                  PAUL
                      Anna. I'm sorry. That was a stupid
                      thing to say.   But you know sometimes...
                      sometimes it's like you're not here
                      anymore. Like you're somewhere else.

                                                                      2.

                         

                         
          Anna doesn't reply.

                                                PAUL
                    Is this about us?

                         ON ANNA
          her head bowed as she lets the water wash over her.

                                                ANNA
                    It's not about us.

                                 PAUL (O.C.)
                    Then what is it?

                                                ANNA
                    I don't know.

                                 PAUL (O.C.)
                    I just want us to be happy.
          Anna doesn't move.    We sense the emptiness inside her.

                                 PAUL (O.C.)
                    Are you happy?
          She closes her eyes.    Forces herself to reply.

                                                   ANNA
                    I'm happy.

          A DROP OF BLOOD
          falls into the water.   Then another drop.

                         ON ANNA
          her nose is bleeding. She touches her lips. Looks
          impassively at the blood on her fingertips. The SOUND OF
          WATER carries into the next scene...

                                                       FADE TO WHITE.

                         

          A STREAM OF CRYSTAL BLUE WATER
          A MAN'S HANDS penetrate the water. Thin and elegant.
          Perfectly manicured. Turning slowly as he washes them
          meticulously. He picks up a crisply folded white towel.
          Dries his hands carefully. Snaps on white latex gloves.

          A beautiful morning. We move through a tranquil cemetery.
          Pastoral and idyllic. Dappled light falls through old
          trees onto statues of grieving angels.

                                                                   3.

          (70s) past caskets tastefully arranged on faux-marble
          pedestals. He's a serene man. Quiet and professional.

          INT/EXT. ANNA'S CAR - MORNING

          Anna drives past the strip malls of a small suburban town
          in a GREEN TOYOTA. On the dashboard a KITSCHY BOBBLEHEAD
          DOLL nods its head from side to side. Anna pulls up to a
          red light. Glances across at the other cars. We see the
          vacant faces of COMMUTERS staring blankly into space.
          The light changes. Anna hasn't noticed. The car behind
          her HONKS in frustration. She quickly pulls out...
          ... just as a SUV turns in front of her. She slams on
          her brakes. Hard. Missing the SUV by inches. The
          DRIVER screams at her. His face contorted in ugly rage.

          INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - MORNING

          Classes have started. JACK (11), a serious looking boy,
          walks through a silent corridor. Up ahead two OLDER
          BOYS, a TALL KID and a KID with ACNE, push a GEEKY BOY
          against a locker. Jack tries to pass by unnoticed.

                                                 TALL KID
                    Hey.   Jack-off!
          Jack walks faster. The two Older Boys set off after him.
          He darts into a corridor. Ducks into an empty classroom.

                         

          INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. BIOLOGY CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Jack waits anxiously by the door. It looks like he's
          lost the bullies. Then a sudden rustling noise makes him
          jump. He turns. TINY CHICKS huddle in a plastic
          incubator on a table. Jack moves over to them.

                                 TALL KID (O.C.)
                    Didn't you hear me Jack-off?
          Jack swivels round. The Tall Kid walks towards him as
          the Acne Kid guards the door. Jack doesn't reply.

                                                ACNE KID
                    He must be deaf.

                    You deaf Jack-off?
          Jack ignores them.   Irritating the Tall Kid even more.

                                                TALL KID
                    Can't fucking speak either.
          He pushes Jack against the table, toppling the incubator.
          Panicked, the CHICKS scatter across the surface. Just
          then the door opens. Anna walks in.

                                                ANNA
                    What's going on?
          She glances at the Older Boys then at Jack.

                    Nothing? The incubator didn't just
                    fall by itself.
          The Older Boys stare at Jack.    Waiting for his reaction.

                                                 JACK
                    I tripped.   It was an accident.
          Anna looks at Jack carefully.    She knows he's lying.

          Jack doesn't hear her. He's mesmerized by a SOLITARY
          CHICK standing motionless in the corner of the incubator.

          Suddenly one of the fluorescent ceiling lights behind her

          WHUMPH. The next light dies. Anna quickens her step.

          cold pool of light.

          with medication. She's clearly been bed-ridden for some
          time. An electric wheelchair in the corner of the room.
          Anna appears at the door. Beatrice scrutinizes her for a
          second. Then returns to her knitting.

                                                BEATRICE
                    Terrible color.
          Anna moves to the beside table.   Picks up a dirty plate.

                                                ANNA
                    Can I get you something to eat?

                                                BEATRICE
                    I'm not hungry.

                                                ANNA
                    You have to eat.

                                                BEATRICE
                    I don't have to do anything.

                    The doctor said--

                                                BEATRICE
                    The doctor's an idiot. He doesn't know
                    what he's talking about.
          Anna sighs. Trying hard not to let her Mother provoke
          her. Beatrice glances up. Anna avoids her look.

                                                BEATRICE
                    Why did you do it? Today of all days.

                                                ANNA
                    What have I done wrong this time?
          Anna goes to the window.   Draws back the curtains.

                                                BEATRICE
                    You've forgotten haven't you?

                                                ANNA
                    No I haven't forgotten.   The service
                    isn't till six.

                                                BEATRICE
                    Then you've got plenty of time to wash it
                    out.

                                                                   13.

                                                BEATRICE
                    Then dye it back. You can't show up at
                    the funeral looking like that. Like some
                    prostitute.

                                                ANNA

                    constantly arguing with me?
          Anna bites her tongue.    Heads to the door.

                                                BEATRICE
                    Where are you going?

                                                ANNA
                    To do the washing up.

                                                BEATRICE
                    The sheets need changing.    They haven't
                    been changed in months.

                                                ANNA
                    I changed them Monday.
          Anna goes to the cupboard.    Takes out clean sheets.

                                                BEATRICE
                    You weren't here Monday. You never sleep
                    at home anymore. What if something
                    happened to me in the middle of the night?

                                                ANNA
                    Nothing is going to happen to you.

                    wasn't living in sin with that lawyer of
                    hers. Doing God knows what. They always

          Anna dumps the sheets on the bed. As she turns to leave
          Beatrice's hand darts out and grabs Anna's wrist.

                                                   BEATRICE

          A warm intimate room. Peaceful. Rows of chairs filled
          with ELDERLY MOURNERS. Eliot stands respectfully beside
          a casket. FATHER GRAHAM (50s) reads at a lectern.

          EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

          Anna, in a black dress, walks quickly along the gravel
          driveway. She stops. Stares out over the cemetery.

                                 FATHER GRAHAM (O.S.)
                    ...certain hope of the resurrection to

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Anna slips into the back of the room. Eliot leads MRS.
          HUTTON (60s) to the body of her husband, JAMES HUTTON
          (70S), lying in the casket. Mrs. Hutton touches a
          bouquet of white roses by the casket.

                                 MRS. HUTTON
                    White roses. They were his favorite.
                    How did you know?

                                                ELIOT
                    They just seemed appropriate somehow.

                                 MRS. HUTTON
                    He looks so peaceful. As if he's only
                    sleeping.
          Anna approaches Mrs. Hutton.   She doesn't notice Eliot
          watching her carefully.

                                                  ANNA
                    Mrs. Hutton.    I'm so sorry.

                    favorite student.

          Anna smiles awkwardly.     Uncomfortable.

                                    MRS. HUTTON
                       How's your mother?

                                                    ANNA
                       Fine.   She sends her condolences.

                                    MRS. HUTTON
                       You look tired dear.

                                                    ANNA
                       No.   I'm fine. Everything's fine.
          But we can see in her eyes that everything's not fine.
          Mrs. Hutton nods, then turns to greet another MOURNER.
          Anna steps nervously up to the coffin.

                         ANNA'S POV
          James Hutton lies peacefully amongst the velvet trimming.
          Suddenly his LIPS PART... as he GASPS SOFTLY.

                         VIEWING ROOM
          Anna steps back terrified. Stares at Hutton. His face
          serene again. It must have been her imagination. She
          glances up quickly. Embarrassed.
          Eliot's still observing her.     He nods to her cordially.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - DAY

          A spartan room at the top of the house. Eliot carefully
          pins a POLAROID of Hutton lying in a coffin to the wall.
          Next to Hutton's photograph, we briefly glimpse the edge
          of ANOTHER POLAROID.
          Eliot stares intently at Hutton's image for a moment,
          then takes off his jacket and moves to the window.

                         ELIOT'S POV
          Anna's by her car rummaging in a bag for her keys.
          Getting increasingly frustrated.

                         

          EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - DAY

          Anna suddenly looses it. Angrily dumps the contents of
          her bag onto the driveway. She kneels down. Grabs the
          keys. Throws the rest of her things back into the bag.
          She stands. Leans against the car. She looks weary.
          She glances up at the sky desperately trying to hold back
          her tears. Black storm clouds gather on the horizon.

                                                                    16.

                         
          Anna brusquely wipes away her eyes with the back of her
          hand. Pulls herself together. Angry with herself.

          INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING

          Paul sits at a window table. It's raining hard outside.
          He glances at his watch then nervously checks his
          pockets. Pulls out a RING BOX. He looks at it for a
          moment then slips it back into his pocket.
          As he refills his glass, Anna appears outside holding her
          raincoat above her head. She stares at Paul for a moment
          through the window marbled with rain.
          Paul suddenly notices Anna at the window.   He starts.
          Spills some of his red wine on his shirt.
          CLOSE on the red stain. It unfurls like a flower.
          Spreading out over the white material.

                                 ANNA (O.C.)
                    Sorry about that.
          Paul dabs the stain with a napkin.

                    You scared the life out of me.
          Anna laughs as she sits down.   Paul looks up at her.

                                                 PAUL
                    Your hair.

                    red. I mean it's not really you is it?
          A WAITER appears at the table before Anna can reply.

                                                WAITER

                    I don't always have the duck.
          Paul shrugs. Pours Anna some wine as she looks through
          the menu. The Waiter taps his pen on his pad
          impatiently. Anna sighs. Puts the menu aside.

                                                ANNA
                    I'll have the duck.
          Paul smiles as the Waiter leaves. Anna tries to ignore
          him. But after a second she can't help smiling back.

                                                PAUL
                    The duck is very good.
          Anna's smile broadens. The tension between them broken
          for the moment. Paul reaches across. Touches her hand.

                                                PAUL

                    This is good.
          She picks up the bottle.    Checks the label.

          A large room. Tall vaulted ceilings. White tiles. Soft
          morning light seeps in from a small round window set high
          on one wall. The room is silent. Still. Like a chapel.
          In the semi-darkness we see a BODY on a porcelain slab
          covered with a white sheet.
          We hear a key turn in a lock. Then another lock.       The
          room's suddenly flooded with a harsh white light.
          Eliot steps inside the room. He takes off his jacket.
          Carefully places it on a coat-hanger. Puts on a pale
          blue smock then snaps on the latex gloves. His every
          move meticulous. Measured. Like a ritual.
          Eliot walks over to the slab, his surgery clogs softly
          clacking against the tiled floor. He looks at the slab
          for a moment then slowly pulls the sheet away
          revealing...
          ANNA'S BODY. Pale and lifeless. An ugly gash above her
          eyebrow. Cracked violet lips. A rip in her black dress
          soaked with a dark stain. She's only wearing one shoe.
          Eliot gently takes off the watch from her stiff wrist.
          Places it inside a brown paper bag. Eases off the shoe.
          Picks up a scalpel from a tray of instruments on a steel
          trolley. Delicately slices open her dress. Peels it off.
          He's about to cut the straps of her RED SLIP when...
          Anna OPENS HER EYES.
          She looks straight at us with unseeing pale blue eyes.
          Strangely Eliot's not surprised.   He calmly steps back.
          Watches her carefully.
          Anna's eyes slowly focus on Eliot.     She's groggy.   Confused.

          Paul wakes up. Badly hung-over. Still in his clothes.
          Sunlight streams into the room. Blinding him. He
          reaches across. The bed's empty. He's surprised for a
          moment then remembers the argument the night before.
          He gets up. Sits on the edge of the bed. Lights a
          cigarette. He notices his jacket on the floor. Leans
          down. As he pulls out the BlackBerry from his jacket, the
          RING BOX falls onto the floor. Paul doesn't notice.

          Disoriented. She moves her head with difficulty.

          Eliot slides a wooden head-rest under her neck and studies
          her wounds, touching them delicately. Thinking about how
          to conceal them. He turns to a tray of instruments.
          Picks up a needle. Leans over Anna.
          The needle pierces her brow. Sliding cleanly through her
          skin. She doesn't feel any pain as Eliot carefully sews
          the wound. He's meticulous. Clearly very good at his job.
          Eliot glances at his watch. Picks up a SYRINGE and an
          AMPOULE OF AMBER LIQUID. Draws up the amber liquid.
          Anna's alarmed. She tries to pull back.

          Eliot smiles. Amused she caught him out.   He continues
          washing his hands.

          switches off the main lights.

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          Eliot steps into the hallway. Stops by a vase of
          flowers. He plucks a dead petal. Crushes it. Curiously
          sniffs his fingers. Then heads to the casket room.

          CLOSE ON Anna's face. She looks empty. Dispirited.
          Just then something catches her attention...
          The light from the window glints off a pair of LARGE
          SCISSORS on the steel trolley. Anna stumbles to the
          trolley. Feeling her way through the semi-darkness.
          Grabs the scissors.
          Just then she notices a BODY, covered with a white sheet,
          lying on a gurney in the corner. She turns away.
          Scared. But then, almost against her will, she
          approaches the gurney. As if drawn to the body. She
          slowly pulls the sheet away...
          The dead body of an OLD WOMAN. Staring blindly at Anna
          with cloudy opaque eyes. Long greasy gray hair. Shaken,
          Anna pushes herself against the wall.

                                                 ANNA

          stands by his bicycle in the bushes watching him. Eliot
          looks up. As if sensing someone was spying on him. Jack
          steps back quickly behind a tree.

          As Paul turns away, he notices a door with a sign on it:
          AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. Paul glances around. Then
          quickly walks over to the door.

                         

          INT. POLICE STATION. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

          A dozen wrecked cars. Twisted metal. Paul's footsteps
          echo through the empty garage. It's dark. Out the
          corner of his eye Paul glimpses a SHAPE move quickly
          around a pillar. He stops. Unsettled.
          Just then we hear a WOMAN'S FOOTSTEPS. Her high-heels
          clicking on the concrete floor. There's something
          strange about the sound. UNNATURAL. Paul listens
          nervously. The footsteps grow fainter. Then fade away.
          The garage is silent again. Too quiet.
          Paul moves apprehensively over to Anna's GREEN TOYOTA.
          The car's a mess. One side's completely caved in. He
          touches the car.   Pulls open the door. Squeezes into
          the driver's seat.

                         ANNA'S CAR
          Glass everywhere. Paul glances at the KITSCHY BOBBLEHEAD
          DOLL on the dashboard flecked with blood. He places his
          hands on the steering wheel. Suddenly he hears a strange
          noise. He looks up...
          The KITSCHY DOLL. Its head NODDING SLOWLY. Its smiling
          face now unnaturally sinister. Turning towards us until
          it abruptly stops. Staring straight at us.
          Paul looks at the doll transfixed. Just then a PALE
          WOMAN'S HAND slowly reaches through the window... and
          touches Paul's shoulder. He jumps. Turns.
          ANNA stands by the car. Staring blankly at him.   The
          color drains from Paul's face.

          The Police Captain, Tom Peterson, stands by the car where
          Anna was a second ago. He pulls his hand away from
          Paul's shoulder. Looks at him with concern.

                                                                     39.

          Anna was there. He shoves the door open. He's about to
          step out when he turns back and grabs the Kitschy Doll.

          carefully watches Eliot as he pulls on his pale blue
          smock then walks over to a cabinet.

          BEHIND ANNA'S BACK
          her hands clutch the large scissors.

                         PREP ROOM
          Eliot opens a cabinet full of boxes of hair dye with
          photographs of smiling women. As he prepares the dye he
          looks across at Anna. She's staring at something behind
          him. Eliot turns. Sees the uncovered body of the Old
          Woman on the gurney. He quickly walks over. Carefully
          pulls the white sheet over the Old Woman.

                                                   ANNA
                      Who is she?

                                                  ELIOT
                      Mrs. Whitehall.
          He mixes the dye in a bowl as he moves over to Anna.

                                                  ELIOT
                      You shouldn't be afraid of her.   The dead
                      can't harm the dead.

                      But I'm not dead!
          Anna's hand suddenly FLIES UP...   she slashes at Eliot's
          face with the SCISSORS.
          The sharp edge misses his cheek by inches. Eliot drops
          the bowl. Stumbles back against the steel trolley.
          Instruments crash to the floor.
          Anna staggers to the door. Her legs weak. Her long lank
          hair falling over her eyes. She frantically wrenches at
          the door handle but it's locked. Eliot gets up. Slowly
          moves towards Anna. She turns. Raises the scissors.

                                                  ANNA
                      Stay where you are.

                      Give me the scissors. I only want to
                      help you.

                                                  ANNA
                      Don't come any closer.     I swear to God
                      I'll kill you.
          Eliot walks right up to her.     His face now inches from hers.

                      Go ahead.
          Anna doesn't move. Eliot looks her steadily in the eye.
          He reaches for her hand. Slowly. Deliberately. He brings
          the scissors to his cheek. Then lets go of Anna's hand.

          CLOSE ON ELIOT'S FACE
          The sharp tip pushes into his skin.

                                                  ELIOT

          For a moment we think she might do it.      But then she wavers.

                      What are you waiting for?
          Anna's confidence falters. She slowly lowers her hand.
          The scissors fall onto the floor. Anna looks down
          defeated. Her breath labored. Suddenly she realizes...

                                                  ANNA

                                                  ELIOT
                      You think you're still alive because
                      you're still attached to life. It's
                      normal. You're just imagining you still
                      have symptoms of life.
          She's not listening. Eliot takes a roll of paper towels.
          Kneels down, picks up the bowl of dye and mops up the mess.

                                                  ANNA
                      Maybe I was in some kind of coma. The

          He stands up.    Sighs wearily.

                                                 ELIOT

                    But because I have a gift.

                    To help them make the transition.
          Anna's stunned. For the first time we sense a seed of
          doubt in her mind.

                                                ANNA

                    Not everyone needs my help. Some let
                    go as soon as their body dies. Others
                    don't let go until long after they're
                    in the grave.

                    You're here so I can bury you.
          Anna's silent. Trying to make sense of what she's just
          heard. Eliot takes her arm. Leads her to the slab.

                                                  ELIOT
                    Come.    We've wasted enough time already.
          She lies down submissively. Suddenly very tired.       Eliot
          leans over her to apply what's left of the dye.

          She weakly pushes him away. Anger flashes across Eliot's
          face, but just as quickly he controls it.

                                                ELIOT
                    You people. You all think that if you

          Anna turns her head away.   Clearly he's struck a chord.

          Eliot rips off his latex gloves.    Tosses them into a bin.

                    regrets. And now she's at peace. She

          Eliot stands in the doorway. He switches off the light.
          His body silhouetted by the light from the hallway.

                    you then. No-one will talk to you there.
          The door clicks shut behind him. Anna doesn't move.
          Clearly unsettled by Eliot's words. After a moment she
          looks at the Old Woman. She moves over. Hesitantly
          pulls away the white sheet. Stares at the Old Woman
          curiously. Then tentatively touches her cheek.

          Jack lies in bed staring at the ceiling. On his bedside
          table an alarm clock reads 2.38AM. He looks across at an
          Anglepoise lamp in the corner of the room bent over an open
          shoebox. He gets up. Walks towards the muted light.
          The SMALL CHICK huddles in the shoebox. It looks dead even
          though it's eyes are open. Jack's about to reach into the
          box. Then changes his mind. He looks at the lamp. Switches
          it off. After a moment he switches it back on again.

          He suddenly looks around. Not quite sure why he came into
          the room in the first place. He moves over to a CD player.
          Mechanically switches it on. Music fills the room. He
          turns the volume higher. Then all the way up. The music's

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - NIGHT

          Anna lies on the slab. Curled in a fetal position. O.S.
          we hear the UNNATURALLY LOUD metallic drip of a faulty
          faucet. Slow. Rhythmical. Anna opens her eyes. Stares
          at us. Terrified. Then she turns her head.
          The Old Woman sits on the other slab. Slowly brushing
          her tangled gray hair with a silver backed brush.
          Anna looks around anxiously. The room is strangely
          larger. The perspective not quite right. Certain
          objects look absurdly small or abnormally large. She
          notices a TINY DOOR. Half hidden by a steel trolley.
          The door's slightly ajar. Anna's surprised.
          The Old Woman shakes her head. Staring blindly at Anna
          with opaque eyes. Anna ignores her. Moves quickly to
          the tiny door. As she approaches, the door seems to grow
          to normal size.
          Then we realize it's Anna who has shrunk. The steel
          trolley now towers high above her. The massive
          instruments on the trolley look like menacing insects
          cast in surgical steel. She opens the door. Revealing a
          solid wall of DARKNESS.

          FROM INSIDE THE DARKNESS
          the small shape of Anna in the doorway. The huge dark

          Room behind her.

          ...a CHILD'S HAND darts out of the darkness. Grabs Anna's
          wrist. Pulling her in with surprising strength. Anna
          struggles to free herself. But the hand drags her deeper
          into the darkness. The door slams shut behind her.

          An innocent looking YOUNG GIRL (6) materializes out of
          the blackness. She looks like a young Anna.

          "AVE MARIA" filters into the room. Anna opens her eyes.
          She's confused. She gets up awkwardly. Looks around the
          room. The other slab's empty. The Old Woman's gone.
          Anna stumbles over to the trolley. Pushes it aside.
          Desperately searching for the tiny door. She touches the
          wall. There's nothing there. Frustrated she turns to a
          counter crowded with instruments. She sweeps her arm
          across the counter top in rage. Sending everything
          crashing to the floor.

          him. He turns. Jack's at the top of the stairs.
          Staring down curiously at the Prep Room door.
          Eliot observes him cautiously. Did Jack hear the sound
          as well? Jack looks back at Eliot. Smiles. Then
          without a word, turns and heads back up the stairs.

          fully clothed. An empty bottle of bourbon on the bedside
          table. Behind him the curtains stir.
          The KITSCHY DOLL'S head begins to slowly nod. Turning
          towards us. We hear the eerie rustling sound again.

          up and closes the window. The WHISPERING starts again.
          This time from the bathroom.
          Paul walks over to the bathroom door. As he touches the
          door handle... the whispering STOPS. Paul hesitates.

          Nothing. The bathroom's empty. Paul looks around

          in the mirror. Leans wearily against the washbasin.

          the mirror CRACKLES softly. Paul turns on the taps.
          Splashes cold water on his face. He's about to reach for
          a towel when he senses something. He cocks his head
          slightly. A feeling.
          He turns and checks out the bathroom. Nothing. Paul
          dries his face. As he replaces the towel... the sound of
          dripping water ABRUPTLY STOPS. Silence.
          Suddenly the SHOWER STARTS RUNNING.
          Paul's paralyzed with fear. Steam wreathes the room in a
          cloud of vapor. He turns slowly towards the shower.

          Anna stands in front of the shower with her back to him.
          She slips off her bathrobe and hangs it on a hook. Then
          her hand moves to her chest. There's a STRANGE WET
          SUCKING sound...

          the hook next to her bathrobe.

          ON THE STILL BEATING HEART
          dripping crimson blood onto the bone white tiles.

                       Anna.
          Anna turns slowly. Her skin's like alabaster. Unnaturally
          translucent. A bloody gash where her heart used to be.
          The steam from the shower curls around her like a mist.
          She looks hauntingly beautiful. Mesmerizing. A line of
          thick black fluid trickles from her nose. Paul turns
          away. Horrified. When he turns back a second later
          Anna's not there. The bathroom's empty. The shower's
          not even running.

          Jack opens the fridge. It's almost empty. He takes out
          a carton of milk. Sniffs it. Recoils from the smell.
          From the living room we hear the LOUD sound of a TV.

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - EVENING

          Anna's still sitting on the floor. The place is clean
          and ordered again. She watches Eliot unzip a garment
          bag. He lifts out a plain black dress.

                                                    ANNA
                      What's that?

                                                  ELIOT
                      It's your dress. For your funeral. Your
                      mother brought it round this morning.
          As Eliot takes out a pair of shiny black shoes from a
          plastic bag, Anna moves haltingly over to the dress. She
          touches the material puzzled.

                                                  ANNA
                      This isn't my dress.
                             (realizes with shock)
                      This is my mother's dress! It was
                      supposed to be for her funeral. Why has
                      she given it to me?
          Eliot starts folding the plastic bag. He notices
          something else inside. He opens the bag. Hesitates then
          takes something out.

          ON ELIOT'S HAND
          An old-fashioned wooden rosary.

                         PREP ROOM
          Eliot looks at it for a moment. Then glances over at
          Anna. She's still staring at the dress. He opens a
          drawer beneath the counter. It's full of rosaries and
          printed Holy cards. He quickly drops the rosary into the
          drawer. Closes it. Then turns back to Anna.

                                                  ANNA
                      It should have been her not me.
                             (turns to Eliot)
                      She was the one dying. Not me.
          Eliot unlocks the door. Jams it open with a door stop.
          Slips his keys back into his jacket pocket. Takes off
          his jacket and hangs it up. He moves over to a
          collapsible gurney folded on the floor. Bends down and
          snaps open the side-rails. Anna looks at the open door.

                                                  ANNA
                      I'm not ready to die.
          Eliot looks up at Anna sadly.

                      I'm not ready to die.   Not yet.
          She glances at the open door again.    Eliot follows her look.

                                                  ELIOT
                      There's nothing out there for you
                      anymore.
          As Eliot turns back to the gurney, Anna notices Eliot's
          jacket hanging beside her. Realizes the KEYS are in the
          pocket. She quickly glances back at Eliot. He's still
          busy adjusting the gurney. She leans over to his jacket.

                         ON ELIOT
          as he gets up and turns to Anna.

                         PREP ROOM
          Anna looks at him calmly. We can't tell if she managed to
          get his keys or not. Eliot pulls on his jacket and wheels
          the gurney through the door. He steps back into the room.
          Nudges the door stop away with his foot.

                                                  ELIOT
                      I'll be back soon.
          The door locks behind him with a CLICK.

                         

          EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          Eliot pushes the gurney to a WHITE VAN with black tinted
          windows (Note: The same kind of van that cut in front of
          Anna just before the accident).

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

          Anna listens anxiously to the CRUNCH of Eliot's feet on
          the gravel outside. After a moment she hears the van
          drive away. She unfurls her fist revealing Eliot's keys.

          As Eliot slides in a CD he notices the fuel gauge. He's
          low on gas. He glances into his rear-view mirror and
          makes a left turn.

                                                                  54.

          Anna staggers to the door. There's at least a dozen keys.
          She frantically chooses one and shoves it into the lock.

                                                ANNA
                           (begging the door to open)
                    Please.
          It doesn't fit. She's panicking. She fumbles for
          another key. It almost fits. She forces it. The key
          SNAPS OFF LOUDLY in the lock.

                                                ANNA
                    No!
          Anna looks around desperately. Sees a tray of instruments
          on the steel trolley. She scrambles over. Finds a pair of
          surgical pliers. She moves back to the door.

                         

          EXT. GAS STATION - LATER

          Eliot replaces the pump nozzle.   Walks over to the cashier.

                    Thirty-four fifty.
          In the b.g. Jack, a carton of milk in his hand, steps out
          of the gas station. Eliot doesn't notice him as he pulls
          out a roll of notes. Hands over two twenties. Then he
          frowns. Something's wrong. He checks his pockets again.
          He can't find his keys. He walks quickly away.

                                                 CASHIER
                    Sir.   Your change.
          Eliot ignores him. Scrambles into his van. Intrigued,
          Jack watches Eliot drive away. Then unlocks his bicycle.

          stunned for a second. Then pulls open the door.

          door, leaving the keys in the lock. As she opens the door,
          HEADLIGHTS sweep across the hallway.

          It's dark. Anna pulls at the back door. It won't budge.
          She panics. Sees a kitchen knife on the counter.
          Quickly grabs it. As she steps back, she knocks over a
          metal bucket. The sound's DEAFENING in the silent house.

          hallway towards the kitchen.

          changes his mind. Heads in the opposite direction

          Paul's stunned. He stares at the phone as if it was
          possessed. Then slowly puts it down.

          Anna looks at the phone in disbelief. The MONOTONOUS
          TONE DRONES in the ear piece. She doesn't notice Eliot
          appear in the doorway.

          Anna drops the phone. Backs away towards a window.      Eliot
          walks over and calmly replaces the phone.

                      He still feels your presence. You're
                      only causing him more pain. If you
                      really loved him, you'd accept your death
                      and let him go.

          A PALE CADAVEROUS WOMAN. Sunken eyes.      A blood-stained

          step. Just then he notices something outside. We see a
          brief flicker of unease in Eliot's eyes.

          Strangely Jack isn't scared. He continues staring up at

          dyed back to brown. She slowly closes her eyes.
          CLOSE ON RED DYE draining into the sink.
          Eliot picks up the scissors. Carefully slices open
          Anna's red slip. Delicately peels the slip off her body.
          Anna doesn't react.
          CLOSE ON Anna. She opens her eyes. Confused.     She turns

                    Jack. Anna's dead.
          Paul's words ECHO loudly.   The bustling corridor goes silent.

                                                                    64.

                    I can't help her anymore.
          Paul turns and walks away.    Jack grabs his arm.

                                                JACK
                    Maybe you just don't love her anymore?
          Paul turns and hits Jack with the back of his hand.     Jack
          falls to the ground. Paul stands over him enraged.

                                                PAUL
                    You little fuck. You think this is funny?
          He's about to hit Jack again when a STOCKY TEACHER grabs
          him. Paul tries to struggle loose.

                                                STOCKY TEACHER
                    Hey!
          The CHILDREN stare at Paul. A SECURITY GUARD runs across
          talking into a walkie-talkie. Another TEACHER bends down.

                                                TEACHER
                    Are you alright sweetie?
          Jack nods numbly. Looking up all the time at Paul.      The
          Security Guard grabs Paul's arm.

                                                SECURITY GUARD
                    The police are on their way.
          Paul watches Jack stand shakily.   Realizes what he's
          done. He reaches out to Jack.

                                                PAUL
                    Jack... I'm sorry...

          Paul sits at a table. Staring blankly at a row of CCTV
          monitors. The door opens. Tom walks in.

                                                TOM

          Tom's relieved. Paul turns back to the monitors.     The
          ghostly figure of a YOUNG FEMALE TEACHER drifts
          hypnotically across the screen.

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY

          Eliot leans over Frank's body on the slab. Rolling a
          ball of wax in his hands to warm it up. He gently moves
          Frank's head to one side. In the b.g. Anna lies on her
          slab watching Eliot work.

                         ANNA'S POV
          Frank stares back at her with open dull eyes. His face
          partially reconstructed with plaster of Paris.

                         PREP ROOM
          Eliot smooths the wax over the plaster to give Frank's
          face a more natural texture. Then picks up a piece of
          wire with a fishhook-like barb at each end.

                                    ANNA (O.C.)
                       What's that for?
          Eliot looks up surprised. Anna stands beside him.        He
          leans down. Peels back Frank's upper lip.

                                                                     66.

                    His mouth.   To keep it closed.
          Eliot imbeds one barb into the upper gum then pries back
          Frank's lower lip. He attaches the other barb into the
          lower gum, then twists the wires tightly together. He
          picks up two plastic caps covered in small knobs.

                                                ELIOT
                    Now his eyes.
          He inserts the caps into Frank's eyes. Pulls his eyelids
          over them. Glues the eyelids together.

                                                ANNA
                    Is this how you'll prepare my body?
          Eliot looks at her for a moment.   Smiles reassuringly.

                                               ELIOT
                    No. There's no need. I had to rebuild
                    his face. You're still beautiful.

                                                ANNA

                    Yes.    A brother. He's coming in later.
          Anna touches the white sheet covering Frank's body.

          We see a brief flicker of pain in Anna's eyes.

                                                                      67.

                    upset when I cried.     He said crying
                    never helped.
          Anna suddenly looks very weary. She leans heavily
          against the slab. As if she's about to fall.

                                                ELIOT
                    You should rest.
          He guides her back to the slab.    Helps her lie down.

                    You're getting weaker.    It's almost time.
          Eliot strokes her hair tenderly.    She looks up at him.

                                                ANNA

                    Why do we die?
          A long beat.

                    To make life important.
          Anna's fingers curl around his hand. Like a vulnerable
          child. Totally trusting in him. Eliot looks down at Anna
          sadly. We sense he's conflicted. Confused. Wavering.
          But then reluctantly he reaches for a SYRINGE filled with
          AMBER LIQUID on the steel trolley. He injects her gently
          in the neck. Watches over her for a moment. Then moves
          to the window. He picks up a window pole. Pulls the
          shutter across the window plunging the room into darkness.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

          Eliot moves through the Funeral Home pulling heavy drapes
          over the windows and closing doors. It feels like a
          ritual. The once airy sunlit rooms are darker now. More
          ominous. Claustrophobic.

          CLOSE ON a stream of crystal blue water.    We pull back.
          Eliot picks up a white towel. Dries his hands. Deep in
          thought. He moves to his desk. Picks up a Polaroid.

                                                                     68.

                         ROOM
          Suddenly Eliot looks up sharply.   As if someone had spoken
          to him.

                                                ELIOT
                    Think nothing of it Mr. Houseman.    No
                    need to apologize.
          Eliot moves over to the wall.

                    I really enjoyed our time together.
          We pull back slowly. Eliot's talking to a POLAROID of an
          OLD MAN. We pull back further... the wall's covered in
          HUNDREDS OF POLAROIDS of BODIES in open coffins.
          Most of them have closed eyes but we glimpse some with
          their eyes wide open. Eerily staring at us. Eliot
          touches the Polaroid of a YOUNG MAN. We see the fear in
          the Young Man's eyes.

                                   ELIOT (O.C.)
                    Anthony.    Anthony. Always confused.
          Just then we hear the doorbell ringing downstairs.    Eliot
          moves to the window.

                         ELIOT'S POV
          A POLICE OFFICER stands at the front door.    A SQUAD CAR
          parked on the driveway.

          shoulders, her head facing straight upwards.

                                                ELIOT
                    Your brother's here.
          Vincent turns back to Eliot. We're not sure if Eliot was
          speaking to Frank or to Vincent. Eliot pulls the sheet
          away. Frank's face is flawless. No sign of any damage.

                                                VINCENT
                    He looks so peaceful. You've done a
                    beautiful job. Thank-you.

                                                ELIOT
                    You should remember him as he used to be.
          Suddenly we hear a FAINT RUSTLING sound. Vincent glances
          again at Anna's body. Her head is now turned to one side.
          Wasn't she facing upwards a moment ago? Vincent's puzzled
          for a second then shrugs. Must have been his imagination.

                                                VINCENT
                    That's the schoolteacher isn't it?
          Eliot pulls the sheet over Anna's face.

                    else I can help you with?
          Vincent frowns.   Turns back to Eliot.

                                                                   70.

                      His smile.    It was a bit more...
          Vincent raises his fingers to his mouth, trying to find
          the right word.

                                                  ELIOT
                      I'm glad I could help.

                                                  VINCENT
                      Do you mind if I have a couple of minutes
                      alone with him?
          Eliot hesitates.      Then smiles.

                                                   ELIOT
                      No.   Not at all. I'll wait outside.
          As Eliot leaves, Vincent looks at Frank's body. After a
          moment he glances at Anna again. Then at the door. He
          quickly moves over to Anna. Looks at her curiously then
          pulls down the sheet. He reaches over... and CARESSES
          HER BREAST. Mesmerized by her naked body.
          As Vincent's hand moves down her body, he bumps against
          the trolley. Instruments CRASH to the floor. He pulls
          back the sheet just as Eliot enters the room.

                                                    VINCENT

          Eliot notices the sheet covering Anna's body is slightly
          askew. He reaches over and straightens it. Then looks
          coldly at Vincent. There's an uncomfortable silence.

                                                  VINCENT
                      Well. I guess I should be off then. I'll
                      see you at the service. Thanks again.
          Vincent glances one last time at Anna then leaves. The
          door locking shut behind him. Eliot stares at the door.

                                                  ELIOT
                      I just told you. That was your brother.
                             (turns to Frank)
                      You had an accident. You're dead. Why
                      do you people never listen to me?
          Frank doesn't move.    His mouth still wired shut.

                                                   ELIOT
                      No.   It's not a gift.   It's a curse.
          Eliot picks up a compact. Roughly layers Frank's cheeks
          with thick rouge. With every word he gets more agitated.

                                                  ELIOT
                      I take care of each of you as if you were
                      my children. I wash the shit from your
                      bodies. I dress you. I do everything to
                      make you look more beautiful than when
                      you were alive. And what do you do?
          Eliot's extremely irritated now.     He grabs a garish red
          lipstick. Smears Frank's lips.

                                                  ELIOT
                      You argue with me. As if it were my fault
                      you're dead. As if I was to blame.

          ON FRANK'S FACE
          The crudely drawn bright red lips.     Clown-like circles of
          rouge. Gaudy and macabre.

                                   ELIOT (O.S.)
                      You don't talk because you have nothing
                      to say. And you have nothing to say
                      because you're a corpse.

                         PREP ROOM
          From Eliot's reaction it seems as if Frank has started to
          talk again.

          INT. JACK'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          The curtains are drawn. Jack's Mother, still motionless,
          in front of the blaring TV. Jack stops in the doorway.

          His mother doesn't reply. Jack leaves. After a moment
          she slowly turns her head. Stares at the empty doorway.

                         

          EXT. CEMETERY - LATER

          Jack cycles through the cemetery. He pulls up by a bush.

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          The service hasn't started yet. Jack walks nervously
          through the empty room to an open casket. He glances
          back, then leans over the coffin.

                         JACK'S POV
          Frank Merano lies nestled in the velvet interior.    His
          face placid. No sign of the gaudy make-up.

                         VIEWING ROOM
          Jack stares in fascination at Frank's body. He reaches
          into the casket. Touches Frank's cold hand.
          In the b.g. Eliot walks into the viewing room.     He stops
          surprised. Watches Jack intently.

          Anna stares vacantly at the ceiling. Eliot places a bunch
          of tulips on the trolley. Turns on a CD. CLASSICAL MUSIC
          fills the room as before. He moves over to Anna. Gently
          Pulls away the sheet.

          Eliot fills a bowl with water.     Carries it to the slab.

                    I miss the sun.
          Anna glances up at the shuttered window. Eliot snaps on
          his latex gloves. Picks up a sponge and wets it in the
          bowl of water. Anna turns to the tulips.

          Eliot raises Anna's arm. Delicately washes her armpit.
          Along the length of her arm. Her skin pale.

          The sun's low on the horizon. Eliot whistles softly to
          himself as he digs a grave. Working meticulously. Like
          everything else he does. Suddenly a SHADOW falls over

                    I was always pushing Paul away.      He
                    thought I didn't love him.

                                                 ELIOT
                    Did you?

                                                ANNA
                    He was the only one I ever loved. But I
                    never told him that. And then he stopped
                    loving me.
          Eliot stares at her intently.    Comes to a decision.

                                                ELIOT
                    What would you do if you had another
                    chance?
          Anna's puzzled. Eliot goes to the door and unlocks it.
          Moonlight floods in from upstairs. Washing it with a cold
          light. Anna doesn't move.

                                                                     86.

                    Well?   Isn't this what you wanted?
          Eliot holds out his hand.   Anna takes it hesitantly and
          rises from the slab.

                         

          EXT. FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT

          Mist drifts through the cemetery. Anna stands in the
          driveway. Pale and ghoulish in her black funeral dress
          and shiny black shoes. She starts walking.

                         

          EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Anna approaches her mother's house.    Paul opens the door.
          He's not surprised to see her.
          Beatrice stands just behind him.     A black shawl over her
          head and arms.

                         

          INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          In the candlelight we can see the house is full of OLD
          WOMEN. Their faces deeply lined. Wearing identical
          black shawls. They stare at Anna, whispering in
          different rhythms. Unintelligible words undulating like
          an ANCIENT PRAYER.

                         

          INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Paul and Beatrice lead Anna to the bed. As she lies down
          we realize the bed is full of BLACK SOIL. Clouds of ugly
          flies hang in the air. BUZZING noisily.
          The Old Women surround Anna in a tight circle. Leaning
          over her. Making her feel claustrophobic. She can smell
          their rotting breath as their prayers grow LOUDER.
          Through the chaos of words we begin to make out...

                                                  OLD WOMEN
                    Spit it out.
          Anna doesn't understand. Then she feels something in her
          mouth. Growing. Gagging her. The Women are SCREAMING.

                                                  OLD WOMEN
                    Spit it out.
          Anna spits out... white maggots.     She gags again.   Closes
          her eyes. Shakes her head.

                                                  ANNA
                    No.

                                                                   87.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - NIGHT

          Anna's eyes snap open. She's still in the Prep Room.
          She steps back from the doorway. Terrified.

                                                ELIOT
                    I thought you were different. You all
                    say you're scared of death. But the
                    truth is you're more scared of life.
          Eliot switches off the lights.

                                 ANNA (O.C.)
                    I'm glad I'm dead. I'm glad it's over.

                         

          EXT. ROAD BY FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT

          Paul sits in his car. Staring out at the Funeral Home as
          he nervously smokes a cigarette. The light in Eliot's
          room goes off. Paul waits for a moment. Then gets out
          of his car. Stubs out his cigarette.

                         

          EXT. FUNERAL HOME - MOMENTS LATER

          Paul treads carefully along the side of the Funeral Home.
          It's a full moon. The trees rustle ominously in the
          wind. Casting eerie shadows against the dark house.
          He finds a window. Tries to open it. It won't budge.
          Just then he hears a noise in the bushes. He crouches
          down quickly. Listens hard. Nothing.

          FROM THE BUSHES
          Someone watches Paul tentatively move to another window.

                         FUNERAL HOME
          Paul strains to open the window when suddenly... he's
          caught in a circle of bright light. Paul turns quickly.
          A DARK FIGURE stands over him. Menacing.

                                                MAN'S VOICE
                    What the fuck are you doing here?
          The Figure lowers the flashlight.   It's Tom.

                                                TOM
                    I'm taking you home.

                         

          EXT. JACK'S HOUSE. GARDEN - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON black earth.   A trowel digs into the soil.

                                                                   88.

                         

                         
          We pull back. Jack's just finished digging a hole in the
          flower bed. A shoebox beside him. He takes off the lid.
          The Chick trembles in the corner of the box. Jack slowly
          replaces the lid. Puts the box into the grave. He
          pushes the earth over it. The box jerks. We hear the
          faint RUSTLING of the Chick inside.

                                                 JACK
                     Don't be scared. It's better this way.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - DAWN

          Eliot lies on his bed. Dressed in a dark suit. He hasn't
          slept at all. His eyes rimmed red. He checks the clock on
          the bedside table. It's 4.30am. He glances to the
          window. Dawn light seeps into the room.

                         

          EXT. FUNERAL HOME - DAWN

          Eliot walks through the garden. A pair of small secaters
          in his hand. He stops by a bed of violets. Still
          covered in morning dew. He kneels and starts cutting the
          delicate flowers.

                         

          INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAWN

          Anna lies on the slab in her burial dress.   Her eyes closed.
          Eliot enters the room. He doesn't lock the door behind
          him. Doesn't turn the lights on. Doesn't change into
          his mortician smock.
          He approaches the slab. The violets in his hand. Pulls
          over a chair and sits next to Anna. Places the violets
          on the steel trolley beside her.
          He looks at her intently. For the first time he seems
          uncertain. Vulnerable. As if questioning himself.
          After a while he suddenly gets up and heads towards the
          door. He's about to close the door behind him...

                                  ANNA (O.C.)

          Her eyes still closed.

          Eliot pauses.   Too confused to look back at her.

          CLOSE ON Beatrice's face.    Her eyes closed.
          A HAND delicately powders her forehead. As if she's
          being prepared for her own funeral. We pull back.
          Beatrice, dressed in black, sits in front of a mirror.
          Diane applies her make-up. Beatrice opens her eyes.

                       be at peace soon.
          Anna nods.    SIGHS deeply... her BREATH FOGS the mirror.
          She frowns. Touches the SMALL CIRCLE OF CONDENSATION on
          the glass. Looks up at Eliot in shock.

          raise her hand to push him away but she's too weak.

          Anna's fading away.    Her hand drops limply to her side.

          He picks up a Polaroid   camera. The flash explodes in a
          blinding white light.    He pulls out the Polaroid. Peels

          Anna's funeral is in progress.   Eliot stands by her
          casket. Surrounded by wreathes of tulips and lilies.
          Beatrice, in her wheelchair, in the front row. Diane
          beside her. A SCHOOLTEACHER sits behind them with Jack

          almost as if he's jealous. Jack notices Eliot's look
          then turns and stares at Paul.

          EXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - MOMENTS LATER

          Paul grabs a shovel by the grave. Starts digging. Then
          the shovel clunks against wood. He kneels down. Scrapes
          away the earth from the coffin. Then pulls open the lid.
          Anna's eyes are WIDE OPEN.     Her fingernails torn and bloody.
          Paul grabs her shoulders. Pulls her out of the grave.      Her
          body slumps limply like a rag doll.

                                                 PAUL
                    Anna.   I'm here. Please God.     Anna.
          He desperately tries to revive her. But there's no life
          left in her. He's about to give up when...
          Anna's hand TWITCHES. Then after a moment she GASPS.
          Her eyes slowly focus on Paul.

                                                ANNA
                    Paul?

                                                 PAUL
                    Baby.   Thank God.
          Paul gently helps Anna to her feet.    She looks round.
          Dazed. Turns back to Paul.

                                                ANNA
                    You came back for me.

                                                PAUL
                    I came back for you.     You're safe now.

                                                ANNA
                    Promise?

                    Promise.
          Just then Paul hears a rustling sound behind him. He
          turns. Nothing. He cocks his head slightly. There's
          something unnerving about the silence.
          Suddenly a CROW rises noisily into the air. Paul starts.
          Then watches, relieved, as the crow disappears into the
          dark sky. He turns back to Anna... she's not there.

                                                PAUL
                    Anna?
          Paul looks round desperately. Runs between the stone
          crosses and statues of grieving angels searching for her.

                                                                       99.

          Just then he glimpses SOMETHING MOVE among the trees.
          Runs over. Nothing. The cemetery is empty. The trees
          appear to SHIMMER for a moment. Paul shivers. Pulls his
          jacket around him. He doesn't notice the candles on
          Anna's grave behind him suddenly BLOW OUT.

                         

          INT/EXT. ELIOT'S VAN. ROAD - NIGHT

          We hear the sound of a SIREN. The AMBULANCE blasts past.
          Eliot slides a disc into the player. CLASSICAL MUSIC
          fills the van. He strums the wheel. Enjoying the music.

                         

          EXT. CEMETERY. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          Paul frantically runs into the parking lot.    Still
          calling out for Anna.

                                                  PAUL
                    Anna!
          Suddenly the interior light in his car comes on.    Paul
          looks at the car nervously.
          He heads over to it.   Apprehensive.   Then... the car door
          slowly CLICKS open.
          Paul stops.   Stares into the car.   There's no one there.

                         

          INT. PAUL'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

          Through the windshield we see Paul approach the car.
          He peers in nervously. Then cautiously gets in. As he
          switches the interior light off, the camera moves slowly
          around him revealing...
          ... ANNA sitting in the passenger seat.

                                                ANNA
                    Are we going home?
          Paul turns sharply.    Stunned.   Anna moves towards him.

                                                ANNA
                    Or do you want to make love here?

                    Where did you go?
          Anna puts her fingers on Paul's lips. Clearly turned on.
          We hear the sound of something being UNZIPPED.

                                                                  100.

                    so much.
          A line of BLOOD trickles from his nose. He touches his
          lips. Looks blankly at the blood on his fingertips. A
          drop of blood falls on Paul's white shirt. It unfurls
          like a flower. Spreading out over the material.

                                                 ANNA
                    I love you.   I always did.
          Anna hungrily kisses him. He responds passionately.
          Suddenly we hear a SHARP METALLIC SOUND.

                    It's only the scissors...
          We see the growing anxiety in Paul's eyes.    Anna's just
          interested in his lips.

                    put them on the table.
          Paul pulls back.   Terrified.

                    You're safe now. We're finally together.
          A strong bright light sweeps across Paul's face. Like
          the headlights of the car on the blind curve earlier.
