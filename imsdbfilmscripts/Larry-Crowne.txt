          Mercedes Tainot is in the back -- her mind far from her
          classroom. She is preoccupied.
          The applause for the speaker jolts her.

           Did you notice? No script. No
           notes. So it can be done.
          The class breaks up. Pinedo makes it a point to pick up some
          DynaSem brochures. Larry remains, scribbling notes.

          EXT. TATTOO PARLOR - STAIRS TO UPPER FLOOR

          Music is playing. A nice view is revealed as Mercy arrives on
          a nice little porch. On a little table sits a potted plant.
          In the potted plant is an Altoids tin.
          Mercy gives it a rattle. In the tin, a brand new key.

                         
          Mercy takes the key. Slides it into the lock and slowly
          opens the door.
          The music gets louder. She can't see much into the tiny
          flat, but she can make out...
          Larry, arranging the last of his stuff.
          Mercy stands at the door until he sees her.

                         
          When he does, he says nothing. But steps to her and smells
          her - her neck, her hair.

          No larger than the nook of his old house. Breakfast is being
          served.
          The most beautiful woman ever to wear a bathrobe has made
          French Toast and is settling into the Breakfast Nook.
          Larry Crowne has his hair all on one side of his head -- post-
          Afternoon-Of-Amok-Loving. His arm shows a Navy tattoo that
          may be old or new...
          Mercy Tainot glows in and out. She slides next to him, close

           Mercy is still in her robe, riding on Larry's scooter, back
           and forth in front of the Parlor and Talia's store.
           Larry is having coffee, sitting on the steps, watching her
           ride back and forth.
           She is getting good.

                         
           Talia and the gang spill out of the store to watch her.

           Hoots and laughter.
           Larry uses his robe as a matador's cape, Mercy as the bull.
           As she passes under his flaring cape...
