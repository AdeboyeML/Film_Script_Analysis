           Give us that, Deagol, my love!

                      DEAGOL
           Why?

                     SMEAGOL V/0
           They cursed us. Murderer. Murderer they
           called us. They cursed us and drove us
           away.

             And we wept, Precious, we wept to be so
             alone. And we forgot the taste of bread,
             the sound of trees, the softness of the
             wind . . . We even forgot our own name.
                  (in a choking cough)
             Gollum! Gollum!

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM in the CAVE staring at the RING in his hand.

                  (ecstatic)
             My Precious.

EXT. CULVERT, VALE OF MORGUL - DAWN

ANGLE ON: A GRIM LANDSCAPE, covered in THORN BUSHES and the
scars of RECENT FIRES. The DARK MORGUL VALLEY disappears up
towards the MOUNTAINS.

SETTLE ON: FRODO and SAM in a FILTHY CULVERT.
SAM twitches in a RESTLESS SLEEP. But FRODO is awake . . . His
hand trails down to the CHAIN around his NECK ...

A SUDDEN HISS! FRODO quickly hides the RING as GOLLUM peers
at them with GLEAMING EYES.

                        GOLLUM
             Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies! We
             must go, yes, we must go at once!

SAM STIRS, looks at FRODO . . .

                        SAM
             Haven't you had any sleep, Mr Frodo?

FRODO shakes his HEAD.

                        SAM (cont'd)
             I've gone and had too much!

SAM looks at the dead, BROWN TWILIGHT, below the LOWERING
CLOUD.

                        SAM (cont'd)
             It must be getting late.

                        FRODO
             No . . . no it isn't. It isn't midday yet.
             The days are growing darker.

The GROUND suddenly QUIVERS, as a ROLLING, RUMBLING NOISE
ECHOES down the VALLEY.

                        GOLLUM
             Come on, must go, no time ...

                        SAM
             Not before Mr Frodo's had something to eat.

                        GOLLUM
             . . . no time to lose, silly.

SAM shoots GOLLUM a HOSTILE LOOK and turns back to rummage in
his KNAPSACK. He holds up a piece of dried LEMBAS BREAD to
FRODO.

                        SAM
             Here.

                        FRODO
             What about you?

                        SAM
                  (lying badly)
             I'm not hungry - leastways, not for lembas
             bread.

                        FRODO
             Sam.

                        SAM
                  (confessing)
             Alright. We don't have that much left.

            We have to be careful or we're going to run
            out. You go ahead and eat that, Mr Frodo.
            I've rationed it. There should be enough.

FRODO looksa t SAM questioningly.

                        FRODO
            For what?

                       SAM
            The journey home.

FRODO says nothing.                                            .

EXT. CULVERT, VALE OF MORGUL - DAY

WIDE: FRODO and SAM follow GOLLUM as he leads them on the
wining, torturous path ... clambering through BRACKEN and
over JAGGED ROCKS.

                       GOLLUM
            Come, Hobbitses. Very close now. Very close
            to Mordor! No safe places here. Hurry!
            Shhh.

GANDALF leads ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, THEODEN and GIMLI through
dark woodland . . .

Far off, half veiled int he swirling STEAM, the TOWER of
ORTHANC stands ... Unbroken by the storm. Pale waters lap
about its feet.

ANGLE ON: TWO SMALL HOBBITS are sitting on the SMASHED WALL
. . . MERRY and PIPPIN! SPREAD before them is a feast of
BREADS, MEATS and WINE. They PUFF on long pipes as they lie
back in the SUN.

                       PIPPIN
             I feel like I ' m back at the Green Dragon,
             after a hard days work.

                       MERRY
             Only, you've never done a hard days work.

MERRY cuts PIPPIN off before he can respond in kind.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Welcome, my Lords, to Isengard.

                        GANDALF

ANGLE ON: GANDALF, ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI stare at the
SIGHT before them . . .

                       GIMLI
             You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led
             us on, and now we find you feasting and
             smoking.

                        PIPPIN
                  (mouth full)
             We are sitting on a field of victory,
             enjoying a few well-earned comforts.
             The salted pork is particularly good.

                        GIMLI
                  (suddenly interested)
             Salted pork?

                     MERRY
           We're under orders from Treebeard, who's
           taken over management of Isengard.

WIDE: GANDALF leads the company through the flotsam and
jetsam which floats upon the muddied waters surrounding the
TOWER ... TREEBEARD, the GIANT ENT, strides towards them,
ALARMING all but GANDALF.



                     TREEBEARD
           Huraroom ... Young Master Gandalf, I'm glad
           you've come. Wood and water, stock and ,
           stone I can master, but there's a wizard to
           be managed here ... Locked in his tower.

                      GANDALF
           And there Saruman must remain, under your
           guard, Treebeard.

                     GIMLI
           Let's just have his head and be done with
           it.                            .

GANDALF stares up the long length of the DARK TOWER . . .

                      GANDALF
                (quietly)
           No. He has no power any more.

THE OLD ENT nods his head wisely . . .

                       TREEBEARD
           The filth of Saruman is washing away ...
           Trees will come back to live here, young
           trees . . . wild trees.

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, his eye caught by something lying in the WATER

ANGLE ON: The MUDDY waters GLOWING wit a golden light . . .

ARAGORN turns as, quick as a FLASH, PIPPIN has jumped off his

            Peregrin Took! I'll take that, my lad!

PIPPIN doesn't move, his eyes staring in wonder at the smooth
black stone ...

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
            Quickly, now!

RELUCTANTLY, PIPPIN hands the PALANTIR to GANDALF ... who
immediately smothers it in his cloak.

EOWYN watches as ARAGORN moves away . . . a voice speaks in her
ear.

                        THEODEN
             I am happy for you.

EOWYN looks at her UNCLE, as THEODEN follows her gaze.

                       THEODEN (cont'd)
             He is an honourable man.

             You are both honourable men.

             It was not Theoden of Rohan who led our
             people to victory.

EOWYN looks at him questioningly, disturbed'by his tone.

          No news of Frodo?

          No word ... nothing.

                     ARAGORN
          We till have time.

GANDALF turns quickly to ARAGORN.

                    ARAGORN (cont'd)
          Every day Frpdo moves closer to Mordor.

GANDALF watches his friend's face . . . seeking reassurance.

                    GANDALF
          Do we know that?

          That Frodo is alive.

          Yes - yes, he is alive.

EXT. MORGUL VALLEY - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM lie asleep amidst scrubby bushes near a

                     SMEAGOL
          Too risky, too risky. The thieves! They
          stole it from us. Kill them . . . kill them
          ... kill them both!

SMEAGOL wakes suddenly, shaking, his face drenched in SWEAT,
eyes wide in horror.

SMEAGOL'S features suddenly transform into the MALEVOLENT
face of GOLLUM!

                        GOLLUM (cont'd)
             Mustn't wake them, mustn't ruin it now!

SMEAGOL casts a quick glance over his SHOULDER to the
SLEEPING figures of FRODO and SAM as he clambers off his ROCK
. . . silently sidling towards the EDGE of a STAGNANT POOL.

                        SMEAGOL
             They knows, they knows, they suspects us.



SMEAGOL stares into the MURKY depths of the WATER.

The SURFACE RIPPLES as the face of GOLLUM appears as SMEAGOL'S
REFLECTION.

                      SMEAGOL
           We must get the Precious. We must get it
           back.

                      GOLLUM
           Patience, patience, my love. First we must
           lead them to her.

                      SMEAGOL
           We lead them to the windy stairs.

                      GOLLUM
                (prompting)
           Yes, the stairs ... and then?

                        SMEAGOL
           Up, up, up, up the stairs we go . . . until
           we come to . . .
                 (naughty excitement)
           ... the Tunnel!

                      GOLLUM
                (quiet)
           And when they go in, there's no coming out.
           She's always hungry, she always needs to
           feed. She must eat, all She gets is filthy
           Orcses.

                      SMEAGOL
           And they doesn't taste very nice, does
           they, Precious?               .

                      GOLLUM
                (sinister)
           No . . . not very nice at all, my love. She
           hungers for sweeter meats . . .

CLOSE ON: SAM . . . his EYES flicker OPEN . . .

                         GOLLUM (cont'd)
           "Hobbit meat." And when She throws away the
           bones and the empty clothes, then we will
           find it . . .

                      SMEAGOL
           And take it for Me!

          For us . . .

                     SMEAGOL
          Yes, we, we meant for us . . .
               (choking cough)
          Go Hum! Go Hum!

                     GOLLUM
               (sly)
          The Precious will be ours once the
          Hobbitses are dead!

SUDDEN ANGLE ON: SAM image mirrored in the water as he SMACKS
GOLLUM on the HEAD with his POT!

               (yelling)            ,Â·     .

SAM drops the POT and FLINGS himself ON TOP of GOLLUM! GOLLUM
SCREAMS . . . his ARMS and LEGS FLAILING WILDLY!

                     GOLLUM
               (crying)
          No! Not! Help! Master!

ANGLE ON: FRODO staggers over to SAM and PULLS HIM OFF
GOLLUM.

                    FRODO
          No, Sam! Leave him alone!

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM, huddled on the ground        WHIMPERING and
SOBBING.

                      SAM
               (fuming)
          I heard it from his own mouth        he means
          to murder us!

            Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly!
            He's a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates Smeagol
            and who makes up nasty lies!

SAM makes for SMEAGOL again . . . with a look of MURDEROUS
RAGE.

                       SAM
            You miserable little maggot! I'll stove
            your head in!

FRODO grabs SAM'S ARM.

                       FRODO
            Sam! If you scare him off, we're lost.

SAM pulls away from FRODO . . .

                       SAM
            I don't care! I can't do it, Mr Frodo. I
            won' t wait around for him to kill us !

                       FRODO
                 (fierce whisper)
            I'm not sending him away.

SAM stares at FRODO . . . at a loss.

                       SAM
            You don't see it, do you? He's a villain!

                       FRODO
                 (lowers voice)
            We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not
            without a guide. I need you on my side.

ANGLE ON: SAM, his face softening.

           I know, Sam, I know.
                (whisper)
           You must trust me.

FRODO beckons to GOLLUM.

                      FRODO (cont'd)
           Come, Smeagol.

GOLLUM turns slowly, staring at SAM through hooded, HATE-FILLED
EYES ... and SMILES.

EXT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - EARLY DAWN

ARAGORN joins LEGOLAS on the STEPS to the GOLDEN HALL, oblivious
to the CHILL WIND . . . they look out across the SLEEPING CITY to
the LOOMING MOUNTAIN RANGE BEYOND . .-. DARK CLOUDS mark the sky.

                      LEGOLAS
           The stars are veiled, something stirs in
           the east . . . A sleepless malice.

LEGOLAS looks at ARAGORN . . . realisation in his face.

                      LEGOLAS (cont'd)
           The eye of the enemy is moving.

INT. EDORAS, SLEEPING QUARTERS - EARLY DAWN,

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN . . . he is AWAKE! He sits up . . . ANXIOUS,
FIDGETY . . .

Suddenly he hops out of bed and creeps towards the SLEEPING FORM
of GANDALF.

                      MERRY
           (whispers)
           What you doing?

PIPPIN gasps with FRIGHT! MERRY is sitting up, wiping sleep
from his eyes. He moves on . . .

ANGLE ON: A sleeping GANDALF lies with eyes wide open! But
PIPPIN is undeterred . . .

MERRY sits up, a worried look on his face.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin? Pippin? Pippin! What are you doing?

With quick stealth, PIPPIN lifts the WRAPPED PALANTIR from
GANDALF'S grasp ...

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin, are you mad?

                        PIPPIN
             I just want to look at it. Just one more
             time.

                       MERRY
             Put it back! Put - it - back!

PIPPIN unwraps the PALANTIR and as MERRY looks on HORRIFIED,
he gazes INTENTLY into it.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin!

As PIPPIN lays his hands on the CRYSTAL, a SICKLY PALE light
slowly spreads from the GLASS BALL onto PIPPIN'S FACE ... his
EYES WIDEN.

                       MERRY (cont'd)
             Pippin!



EXT. EDORAS GOLDEN HALL - EARLY DAWN

On the STEPS of the GOLDEN HALL, LEGOLAS turns to ARAGORN

             He is here.

INT. EDORAS, SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

PIPPIN suddenly starts to HYPERVENTILATE . . . He STAGGERS
BACKWARDS, PALANTIR held rigidly before him . . .

THE GREAT EYE OF SAURON seems to LEAP from the FIRE . . . PIPPIN
is bathed in the FIERY RED LIGHT.

PIPPIN sinks to his KNEES, his mouth open in a soundless SCREAM
. . . He FALLS BACKWARDS, powerless to release the FIERY GLOBE.

                        MERRY
             Help! Someone help him!

GANDALF wakes with a start! Just as ARAGORN enters, and
wrenches the PALANTIR from PIPPIN'S HANDS . . . PIPPIN FALLS to
the FLOOR! . . . ARAGORN spins away, reeling backwards, the
PALANTIR falling from his HANDS . . .

The PALANTIR rolls across the FLOOR, causing EVERYONE in the
room to COWER BACK.                                    ;


ANGLE ON: GANDALF throws a BLANKET over it, ANGRY DISBELIEF
on his face! He rounds on PIPPIN.                    ,

                        GANDALF
             Fool of a Took!

GANDALF lifts the HOBBIT'S SLUMPED HEAD.

                        MERRY
             Pippin!

PIPPIN is trembling ... GANDALF calms him . . .

                        PIPPIN
             Gandalf! Forgive me.

          courtyard of stone . . . It was dead!

FLASH INSERT: A lone white tree silhouetted by flames.

                        PIPPIN (cont'd)
             The city was burning ...

             Minas Tirith???
                  (to PIPPIN)
             Is that what you saw?

                  (terrified)
             I saw . . . I saw him . . . I could hear his
             voice in my head.

                     GANDALF
          And what did you tell him? Speak!

                        PIPPIN
          He asked me my name, I didn't answer . . . he
          hurt me . . .

CLOSE ON: GANDALF stares at PIPPIN with a FRIGHTENING
INTENSITY . . .

                    GANDALF
          What did you tell him about Frodo and the
          Ring?

INT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - DAY

THEODEN stands in the GOLDEN HALL, gravely listening to
GANDALF ... ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI look on . . .

                     GANDALF
          There was no lie in Pippin's eyes; a fool,
          but an honest fool he remains. He told
          Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.

ANGLE ON: GIMLI lets out a sigh of relief.

GANDALF turns to look at THEODEN.

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             We've been strangely fortunate. What Pippin
             saw in the Palantir was a glimpse of our
             enemy's plan.

GANDALF looks from on to the other of the, gathered company.

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas
             Tirith. His defeat at Helm's Deep showed
             our enemy one thing.

The WIZARD turns towards ARAGORN . . .

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             The heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are
             not as weak as he supposed. There is
             courage still - strength enough left to
             challenge him.

THEODEN listens intently, saying nothing.

                                    GANDALF (cont'd)

ANGLE ON: GANDALF rounds on THEODEN . . .

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             If the beacons of Condor are lit, Rohan
             must be ready for war!

THEODEN holds GANDALF'S gaze.

           Tell me. Why should we ride to the aid of
           those who did not come to ours?

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns to look at THEODEN.

                      THEODEN (cont'd)
           What do we owe Gondor?

                      ARAGORN
                (low and urgent)
           I will go.

                        GANDALF

           No!

           They must be warned.

                      GANDALF
           They will be.

                (louder, to all)
           Understand this . . . things are now in
           motion that cannot be undone.

GANDALF turns on his heel . . . and stares at a surpirsed
PIPPIN.

                      GANDALF (cont'd)
           I ride for Minas Tirith! And I won't be

PIPPIN catches up to MERRY.

INT. EDORAS STABLES - DAWN

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN is dumped unceremoniously onto the back of
SHADOWFAX as GANDALF hurriedly prepares to leave . . .

                     PIPPIN
               (nervous)
          How far is Minas Tirith?

                     GANDALF
          Three days ride as the Nazgul flies and
          you'd better hope we don't have one of
          those on our tail.

MERRY thrusts a SMALL PACKAGE into PIPPIN'S HAND . . .

                     MERRY
          Here - something for the road.

PIPPIN stares down at the leather-bound bundle of PIPE-WEED.

                     PIPPIN
          The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

                     MERRY
          I know you've run out . . . you smoke too
          much, Pip.

                     PIPPIN
          But we'11 see each other soon?

A WORRIED MERRY exchanges glances with GANDALF.

                      PIPPIN (cont'd)
          Won't we?

                     MERRY
          I don't know . . . I don't know what's going
          to happen.

GANDALF mounts SHADOWFAX.

          Take her by the safest road. A ship lies
          anchored in the Grey Havens. It waits to
          carry her across the Sea . . . The last
          journey of Arwen Undomiel.

SLOW MOTION: As ARWEN rides through the FOREST the FIGURE of
a SMALL BOY of about 5 SUDDENLY runs across the path in front

As ARWEN watches the BOY moves away, the TREES begin to thin
. . . the BOY continues running. One by one the TREES TRANSFORM
into TALL WHITE PILLARS ...

ARWEN'S POV: The BOY now stands within a VISION of the
majestic architecture of the great Gondorian city of MINAS
TIRITH.

A SILHOUETTED FIGURE appears in the distance and moves
towards the CHILD . . . the BOY runs to the FIGURE.

ARWEN watches as the FIGURE holds out its arms - swinging the
LAUGHING CHILD into the AIR . . .

The figure turns to reveal ... ARAGORN, a little older,
dressed in the casual finery of a GONDORIAN NOBLE.

CLOSE ON: The'CHILD, now in ARAGORN'S ARMS looks directly at
ARWEN . . . it is a QUIET LOOK filled with INFINITE SADNESS.

that can never be, the CHILD she and ARAGORN will never have.

           Arwen, there is nothing for you here ...
           only death.

ARWEN shuts her eyes ... when she opens them again the VISION
is gone . . . she is staring at DARK TREES once more.

                     ELF ESCORT O.S.
           Lady Arwen?

ARWEN turns towards her COMPANION who stares at her,
concerned.

                     ELF ESCORT

          Arwen?

ANGLE ON: ARWEN breathing hard, walking towards ELROND with a
fierce light in her eyes . . .

                    ARWEN
          You have the gift of foresight - tell me
          what you have seen.

CLOSE ON: ELROND his face grim.                  '

          I looked into your future and I saw death.

                    ARWEN
          There is also life.                           ,

Her father turns away ...

                     ARWEN (cont'd)
          You saw there was a child . . .
          you saw my son.

ELROND stares into space, the fight seems to go out of him.
He won't look at her . . .

                        ARWEN
             But it is not lost ...

                        ELROND
             Nothing is certain.

ANGLE ON: ARWEN gently takes her FATHER'S face in her hands
and turns him toward her . . .

                      ARWEN
           Some things are certain. If I leave him now

             It has begun.

             This was my choice. Ada ... Whether by your

ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX powers along the COUNTRYSIDE.

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN, huddled in front of GANDALF, the WIND
sailing through his hair.

           We have just passed into the realm of
           Condor!

EXT. MINAS TIRITH - DAWN

ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX gallops up onto a LOW RIDGE . . .

ANGLE ON: Before them is the DARK MASS of Mount Mindolluin,
its tall WHITE FACE whitening in the RISING SUN. Upon its out-
thrust knee is the Guarded City: MINAS TIRITH.

With SEVEN WALLS OF WHITE STONE, so strong and old that it
seems to have been not built, MINAS TIRITH looks carven by
giants out of the bones of the earth.

                     GANDALF
          Minas Tirith . . . City of the Kings.

Suddenly the SUN climbs over the eastern hills,     and sends
forth a SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT that GLEAMS against th    e face of the
CITY. The TOWER OF ECTHELION stands high within     the topmost
walls. WHITE BANNERS break and FLUTTER from the     BATTLEMENTS
in the morning breeze.

ANGLE ON: The stares of frightened GONDORIANS as GANDALF and
PIPPIN gallop through the WINDING STREETS . . .

AERIAL SHOT: SHADOWFAX, carrying GANDALF and PIPPIN up
towards the 7th LEVEL.

MINAS TIRITH is built in 7 LEVELS - each behind a CIRCULAR
DEFENSIVE WALL. Each level rises - the city reaches a height
of nearly 1000 FEET on its TOPMOST LEVEL.

A towering BASTION of NATURAL ROCK - shaped like a sharp
ship's prow - bisects the city from the 2nd LEVEL to the TOP.

EXT. MINAS TIRITH, COURT OF THE KINGS - DAY

SHADOWFAX arrives at a GREAT CITADEL on the SUMMIT of the
CITY - 1000 FEET above the PELENNOR FIELDS.

GANDALF and PIPPIN dismount, leaving the GUARDS of the
CITADEL to tend to SHADOWFAX. GANDALF hurries off . . .

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN as he takes in his surroundings, his eye
caught by a DEAD TREE that stands in the middle of the COURT,
FOUR SOLEMN CITADEL GUARDS standing sentry around it.

                         PIPPIN                             ;

             It's the tree.           ,
                  (hurrying after GANDALF)
             Gandalf! Gandalf!

                       GANDALF
             Yes, the white tree of Gondor. The tree of
             the King.

GANDALF leads PIPPIN across a FLAT COURT of WHITE STONES,
surrounded by GREEN LAWNS . . . towards a GREAT HALL benejath
the GLEAMING TOWER.                                         '

             Lord Denethor, however, is not the King. He
             is a steward only. A caretaker of the
             throne.

GANDALF lowers his voice, as they approach the TOWER HALL.

             Now, listen carefully. Lord Denethor is
             Boromir's father. To give him news of his
             beloved son's death would be most unwise
             ... And do not mention Frodo . . . Or the
             Ring . . . And say nothing of Aragorn either.
                  (hesitates)
             In fact, it's better if you don't speak at
             all, Pippin Took.

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, suitably chastened, nods.

INT. MINAS TIRITH TOWER HALL - DAY

ANGLE ON: A LONG SOLEMN HALL ... with ROWS OF BLACK MARBLE
PILLARS. Between the pillars stand a silent company of TALL
KINGS carved in cold STONE.

GANDALF strides down the HALL, with PIPPIN following
obediently behind.

At the FAR END, upon a DAIS OF MANY STEPS, sits a LARGE,
EMPTY THRONE . . . and on the wall behind is the IMAGE of a
FLOWERING WHITE TREE set in GEMS.

At the FOOT of the DAIS, in a small STONE CHAIR, sits an OLD
MAN, gazing at his lap: DENETHOR - the Lord Steward of
CONDOR.

                        GANDALF
             Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, Lord and
             Steward of Gondor.

DENETHOR does not look up as GANDALF and PIPPIN approach.

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             I come with tidings in this dark hour - and
             with counsel.

DENETHOR slowly raises COLD EYES . . .

             I offer you my service, such as it is, in
             payment of this debt.

DENETHOR looks at PIPPIN blankly, overcome with grief.:

                         GANDALF
                  (to PIPPIN)
             Get up!

             My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for
             Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming
             ... the Enemy is on your doorstep. As
             Steward, you are charged with the defence
             of this city. Where are Condor's armies?

            Rohan. Light the beacons.

DENETHOR smiles at GANDALF, as if amused by something.

                        DENETHOR
                 (softly)
            You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for
            all your subtleties.you have not wisdom. Do
            you think the eyes of the White Tower are
            blind? I have seen more than you know. With
            your left hand you would use me as a shield
            against Mordor and with your right you
            would seek to supplant me.

                (contemptuous)
           I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan. Oh,
           yes. Word has reached my ears of this
           Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you
           now, I will not bow to this Ranger from the
           North - last of a ragged house, long bereft

                 (explosive)
            The rule of Condor is mine, and no others!

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, horrified. GANDALF looks at Denethor
closely for a moment, then turns on his heel to leave, PIPPIN
follows.

                      GANDALF
            Come.

GANDALF and PIPPIN stride from the TOWER HALL ... DENETHOR
slumps back into his SEAT.

INT. MINAS TIRITH, PIPPIN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN is carefully laying out a SMALL UNIFORM of
the ROYAL GUARD on a bed.

                     PIPPIN
          So, I imagine this is just a ceremonial
          position . . . I mean, they don't actually
          expect me to do any fighting . . . do they?

WIDE: GANDALF STANDING QUIETLY on a BALCONY that overlooks
the GREAT CITY.

                      GANDALF
          You're in the service of the Steward now -
          you're going to have to do as you're told,
          Peregrin Took . . .
               (under his breath)
          Guard of the Citadel!

EXT. MINAS TIRITH BALCONY - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN as he stares up at the vast NIGHT SKY.,

                     PIPPIN
          It's so quiet.

GANDALF watches the young HOBBIT.



                     GANDALF
          It's the deep breath before the plunge.

                      PIPPIN
          I don't want to be in a battle . . . but
          waiting on the edge of one I can't escape
          is even worse.                                L
               (tense)                                  :
          Is there any hope, Gandalf - for Frodo and
          Sam?

GANDALF joins PIPPIN as they look towards the distant, jagged
MOUNTAINS of MORDOR . . .

                        GANDALF
             There never was much hope.

PIPPIN looks up at him, unnerved. GANDALF gives him a small
self-deprecating smile . . .

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
             Just a fool's hope.

GANDALF and PIPPIN share a quiet moment as they stare out
towards the FIERY SKY over MORDOR . . .

                       GANDALF V/0
                  (grim)
             Our enemy is almost ready, his full
             strength gathered. Not only Ores, but men
             as well.

             Mercenaries from the coast . . . All will
             answer Mordor' s call.

ANGLE ON: GANDALF . . . he is almost talking to himself now ..
like a man unable to prevent a sure disaster.


                       GANDALF
             This will be the end of Gondor as we know
             it. Here the hammerstroke will fall
             hardest.

INSERT IMAGE: The BATTLE-SCARRED CITY of OSGILIATH - last
bastion between MINAS TIRITH and MORDOR . . .

                       GANDALF V/0
             If the river is taken, if the garrison at
             Osgiliath falls, the last defence of this
             city will be gone.

CLOSE ON: PIPPIN ... desperately seeking reassurance.

                       PIPPIN
            But we have the White Wizard. That's got to
            count for something.

GANDALF looks down at PIPPIN, he says nothing ...

                        PIPPIN (cont'd)
                 (nervous)
            Gandalf?

GANDALF stares into the distance as if seeing something in
his mind's eye.

INSERT IMAGE: A TOWERING, HOODED FIGURE, DRESSED in BLACK, is
being dressed in ARMOUR by attendant ORCS ...

                           GANDALF V/0
            Sauron    has yet to reveal his deadliest
            servant    . . . The one who will lead Mordor's
            armies    in war, the one they say no living
            man can    kill.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF still staring intently as if facing his
enemy in .person.

                        GANDALF
            The Witchking of Angmar . . .

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN looks up at GANDALF, afraid to ask . . .

                       GANDALF (cont'd)
            He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

ROUGH-HEWN ROAD ... GOLLUM CAREFULLY.peers OVER the lip of
the GULLY ___

ANGLE ON: MINAS MORGUL, a MASSIVE DEAD CITY, set upon a ROCKY
KNEE at the HEAD OF THE morgul valley. CORRUPT and LOATHSOME,
it glows with a SICKLY LUMINOUS LIGHT - like a CORPSE CANDLE.

TWO HUGE, BESTIAL STONE STATUES guard the BRIDGE that leads
to the CITY ...

           Come away, come away. Look! We have found

FRODO and SAM look AGHAST at the sight of a NARROW, NEAR-
VERTICAL STAIRCASE, cut into the ROCK-FACE ... Directly in
FRONT of the MINAS MORGUL GATES.

             The secret stairs . . . climb!

SUDDENLY! FRODO staggers across the ROAD . . . as if some
FORCE, other than his own will, is at work! He lurches
towards the BRIDGE . . . towards MINAS MORGUL!

             No, Mr Frodo!

                  (disorientated)
             They're calling me!

FRODO falls to the GROUND.

AT THAT MOMENT: the GROUND QUIVERS, and a great RUMBLING
NOISE rolls across the ground and ECHOES in the mountains.

The cold, dull MORGUL VALLEY is suddenly VIOLENT and FIERCE,
as UPRUSHING FLAME springs from MOUNT DOOM.

MINAS MORGUL ANSWERS: A FLARE of LIVID LIGHTNING, FORKS of
BLUE FLAME, SPRING UP from the TOWER into the SULLEN CLOUD.

FRODO and SAM sink to the ground, holding their hands against

SHIVERING, rising swiftly to a PIERCING PITCH beyond the

a long sickening WAIL, to SILENCE.

ANGLE ON: FRODO slowly RAISES HIS HEAD . . . across the NARROW
VALLEY, directly opposite the HOBBITS, the LORD OF THE NAZGUL

             This war is long planned. Sauron has hated

EOWYN turns and runs SMACK into ARAGORN ...

                     EOWYN
          Just to the encampment. It's tradition for
          the women of the Court to farewell the men.

ARAGORN smiles . . . reaching past her, he lifts a cover to reveal
a SWORD, strapped to the side of the saddle of her HORSE.

EOWYN deftly pulls the cover back down. She looks at ARAGORN.

                        EOWYN (cont'd)
                  (softly)
             The Men have found their Captain - they
             will follow you into battle, even to death.
                  (quietly)
             You have given us hope.

PULL BACK: to reveal THEODEN stares around at the STREETS and
PEOPLE of EDORAS . . . it is as if he knows he will not see
this place again.

                       THEODEN V/0
             So . . . It is before the walls of Minas

TILT DOWN ... following the NAZGUL as it SWOOPS out of LOW-
LYING, MURKY CLOUDS tossing MEN in the AIR like LIMP RAG-DOLLS!

GANDALF thunders into view, raising his STAFF ...

A SHAFT OF WHITE LIGHT suddenly stabs upwards! The NAZGUL
SWERVES AWAY from the LIGHT, as it pierces the LOW CLOUD!

For a BRIEF MOMENT, SUNLIGHT streams through the hole onto
PELENNOR FIELDS . . . The NAZGUL circle away from the SUN RAYS,
swiftly spiralling higher and higher.

The NAZGUL defeated, GANDALF and the RANGERS ride towards the
safety of MINAS TIRITH.

GANDALF ...

                        FARAMIR   (cont'd)
             They broke through    our defences. They have
             taken the bridge a   nd the West Bank.
             Battalions of Ores    are crossing the River.

                        IORLAS
             It is as the Lord Denethor predicted - long

             Foreseen and done nothing!

FARAMIR suddenly STARES at PIPPIN. GANDALF reads the surprise
in his eyes.

             Faramir? ... This is not the first halfling

FARAMIR shakes his head.

EXT. CIRITH UNGOL STAIRS - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM following GOLLUM up the dizzying
STAIRWAY, carved into the SHEER CLIFF.

The STEPS are NARROW, UNEVENLY SPACED, and many are BROKEN.
They are so STEEP that FRODO and SAM climb as if on a LADDER Â·
their desperate FINGERS clinging to the STEPS ABOVE - trying
not to look at the LONG BLACK FALL below them.

ANGLE ON: FRODO'S foot slips and for a brief moment he is
HANGING PRECARIOUSLY from the ROCK-FACE.

                      GOLLUM
            Careful, Master - careful! Very far to
            fall. Very dangerous on the stairs.

EXT. CIRITH UNGOL LEDGE - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM peering down from ABOVE . . . he has reached a
SMALL LEDGE.

                      GOLLUM

EYES WIDENING.

ANGLE ON: FRODO, head bowed, trying to pull himself up. He
doesn't notice GOLLUM'S HAND reaching for the RING !

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM'S FINGERS . . . closing in on the RING   ...

ANGLE ON: SAM, still TEETERING on the PRECIPITOUS STAIRS
DRAWS HIS SWORD!

                  (alarmed yell)

STARTLED, FRODO looks down at SAM, losing his footing in the
process . . .

                        SAM (cont'd)
             Get back, you. Don't touch him!

ANGLE ON: SAM'S horrified face as . . .

GOLLUM'S out-stretched HAND suddenly GRASPS FRODO'S ARM

GOLLUM glares down at SAM.

             Why does he hates poor Smeagol? What has
             Smeagol ever done to him? Master?

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM blinks, masking the MALICE of his EYES with
their heavy pale lids.

ear:

           He   wants it - he needs it. Smeagol sees it

             My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

                        DENETHOR
             Much must be risked in war. Is there a

             do his Lord's will?

             Alright, alright - you just startled me is
             all.
                  (peering over the cliff's edge)
             What were you doing?

                          SMEAGOL
                  (sly)
             Sneaking!

Too exhausted to argue, SAM turns away.

                        SAM
             Fine, have it your own way.

SAM gently shakes FRODO'S shoulder.                            -

                        SAM (cont'd)
             Sorry to wake you, Mr Frodo. We have to be
             moving on.

SAM rummages through his KNAPSACK, looking for a bite to eat.
FRODO sits up slowly.

                        FRODO                              .
             It's dark still.

                        SAM
             It's always dark here -

CLOSE ON: SAM stops rummaging . . . SHOCK on his face.

           What? That's all we have left!

SAM slowly turns to GOLLUM ...

                      SAM
                (dawning realisation)
           He took it! He must have!

                      GOLLUM
                (shocked)
           Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol. Smeagol
           hates nasty Elf bread!

                     SAM
           You're a lying wretch! What did you do with
           it?

                      FRODO
           He doesn't eat it . . . he can't have taken
           it.

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM slaps his hand against SAM'S JACKET . . .
sending LEMBAS CRUMBS RAINING DOWN!

           What's this? Crumbs on his jacketses!
                (fake outrage)
           He took it! He took it! I seen him, he's
           always stuffing himself when Master's not

FRODO COLLAPSES on the GROUND!

CLOSE ON: SAM'S horrified face!

                       SAM
            Alight, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it to
            go so far, I was so angry . . . Here, let's
            rest up a bit.

SAM attempts to fuss around FRODO ...

                  (exhausted)
            I ' m alright.

                      SAM
           No, no, you're not alright! You're
           exhausted! It's that Gollum; it's this
           place; it's that thing around your neck. I
           could help a bit . . . I could carry it for a
           while - share the load.

STARES into the EARNEST eyes of SAM.

                       FRODO

FRODO pushes SAM away, clutching at the RING beneath his shirt

FRODO rises to his FEET, as if empowered with a frightening
intense ENERGY.

                       GOLLUM
            See! See! He wants it for himself.

                       SAM

FAST PUSH IN . . . to PIPPIN looking on as DENETHOR eats.

                      DENETHOR
           Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

                      PIPPIN
                (uneasy)
           Well . . . yes, at least, well enough for my
           own people ... but we have no songs for
           great halls and evil times . . . we seldom
           sing of anything more terrible than wind or
           rain.

                      DENETHOR
           And why should your songs be unfit for my
           halls, or for hours such as these. Come -
           sing me a song!

PIPPIN'S simple, clear voice echoes through the VAST HALL.

                      PIPPIN V/0
           Home is behind, the world ahead,
           And there are many paths to tread.
           Through shadow to the edge of night
           Until the stars are all alight.
           Mist and shadow, cloud and shade:
           All shall fade, all shall fade.

             I bring five hundred men from the Westfold,
             my Lord.

             We have three hundred more from Fenmarch,
             Theoden, King.

                  (quietly)
             Where are the riders from Snowbourne?

                  (quietly)
             Six thousand spears . . . less than half of
             what I had hoped for . . .

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns to THEODEN ...

                       ARAGORN
             Six thousand will not be enough to break
             the lines of Mordor.

                     THEODEN
          More will come.

             mountain . . .

GIMLI'S eyes travel to a ROW of ANCIENT STANDING STONES that
mark the ENTRANCE to a ROAD leading away from the ENCAMPMENT
and INTO the MOUNTAIN.

                       GIMLI
             That road there - where does that lead?

                       LEGOLAS

MERRY exhales - excited and terrified in equal measure. In

EOWYN steps back, laughing ...

MERRY hurries off    . . . EOMER watches the YOUNG HOBBIT leave.

                        EOMER
             You should not encourage him.

                        EOWYN
             And you should not doubt him.

                        EOMER
             I do not doubt his heart ... Only the reach
             of his arm.

                        GUARD
             King Theoden awaits you, my Lord.

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT

ARAGORN hurries towards THEODEN'S TENT ...

INT. THEODEN'S TENT, DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT

ANGLE ON:- THEODEN looks up as ARAGORN enters.

                       THEODEN
             I take my leave.

ANGLE ON: THEODEN bows slightly to the HOODED FIGURE and
LEAVES, shooting ARAGORN a strange look as he goes ...

CLOSE ON: The FIGURE stands and pulls back the HOOD . . . to
reveal ... ELROND.

                    ARAGORN
          My Lord, Elrond.

                       ELROND
             I come on behalf of one whom I love.

ELROND'S face is ETCHED with PAIN ...

                    ELROND (cont'd)
          Arwen is dying.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN receiving this news ... ASHEN-FACED.

                        ARAGORN
             She stayed?

                       ELROND
             She will not long survive the evil that now
             spreads from Mordor.

ELROND'S eyes fall to the EVENSTAR which hangs around
ARAGORN'S neck . . .

                        ELROND (cont'd)
             The light of the Evenstar is failing. As
             Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.
             Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the
             Ring. The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn, the
             end has come.

                       ARAGORN
             It will not be our end, but his.

                         ELROND
             You ride to war, but not to victory.
             Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith -
             this you know - but in secret he sends
             another force which will attack from the
             river . . .

CLOSE ON: ARAGORN looks at ELROND in shock.

                       ELROND (cont'd)
             A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the
             South.

FLASH INSERT: A FLEET of BLACK SAILS moving along a SILVER
RIBBON of WATER .

                        ELROND (cont'd)
             They will be in the city in two days . . .
             You're out-numbered, Aragorn. You need more
             men.

                        ARAGORN
             There are none.

ELROND hesitates a BEAT ...

                      ELROND
                (quietly)
           There are those who dwell in the mountain.

A SUDDEN WIND rushes through the TENT, lifting HANGINGS,
scattering MAPS, knocking over GOBLETS . . .

As ARAGORN looks at ELROND, an IMAGE FLASHES in his MIND'S
EYE . . . The GHOSTLY FIGURE on the DIMHOLT ROAD . . .

ARAGORN looks at ELROND in shock . . .

                    ARAGORN
          Murderers, traitors - you would call upon
          them to fight? They believe in nothing.
          They answer to no-one.

                     ELROND
          They will answer to the King of Condor.

ARAGORN' S eyes fall to a PLAIN BLACK SCABBARD, which ELROND
draws from beneath his robes.

CLOSE ON: ELROND' S long white fingers draw the hilt of a
SWORD from the scabbard to reveal . . . a ELVEN SWORD glints in
the firelight!

                     ELROND (cont'd)
          Anduril, flame of the West . . . forged from
          the shards of Narsil.

ARAGORN takes the sword . . . staring at it in wonder.

                        ARAGORN
          Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of
          Elendil . . .

ARAGORN draws the long blade from its sheath . . .

                     A RAG OR N (c on t' d)
          . . . the blade that was broken shall return
          to Minas Tirith.

                      ELROND
            The man who can wield the power of this
            sword can summon to him an army more deadly
            than any that walks this earth.

ELROND stares hard at ARAGORN . . .

                      ELROND (cont'd)
            Put aside the Ranger - become who you were
            born to be - take the Dimhplt Road.

A HEAVY SILENCE hangs in the room.

                         ELROND (cont'd)

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN re-sheathes the SWORD.

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: As ARAGORN readies BREGO for leaving EOWYN
approaches ... her temper barely held in check.

                       EOWYN
            Why are you doing this?

ARAGORN looks over his shoulder at her . . .

                      EOWYN (cont'd)
            The war lies to.the East. You cannot leave
            on the eve of battle. You cannot abandon         ;
            the men.

ARAGORN rounds on her ...

                       ARAGORN
             Why have you come?

                        EOWYN
                  (hesitant)
             Do you not know?

ARAGORN looks at her sadly, not wanting to hurt her.

                        ARAGORN
                  (gentle)
             It is but a shadow and a thought that you
             love . . . I cannot give you what you seek.

EOWYN steps back at though STRUCK . . . she watches stricken as
ARAGORN leaves . . .

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU'- NIGHT

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN leads his horse through the TENTS towards
the DIMHOLT ROAD.

A LIGHT FLARES ahead.of him . . .

ANGLE ON: A SHORT FIGURE steps out of the SHADOWS . . . PIPE in
hand.

                        GIMLI
             And just where do you think you're off to?

ARAGORN looks at GIMLI - GRATEFUL for his COURAGE but
determined to go ALONE.

                        ARAGORN
             Not this time ... This time you must stay,
             my friend.

                        LEGOLAS O.S
             Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness
             of Dwarves?

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN looks at LEGOLAS as he appears, leading his
HORSE - already SADDLED.

GIMLI steps closer to ARAGORN.

                        GIMLI
             You might as well accept it - we're going
             with you, laddie.

ARAGORN shakes his head, smiling his acceptance.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI as they slowly ride
towards the BACK of the PLATEAU . . . Past the ANCIENT
STANDING STONES that lead to the NARROW PASS.

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: THEODEN and GAMLING watch the RETREATING FIGURES of
ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI ... ROHAN SOLDIERS emerge from
their tents, crestfallen to see ARAGORN leave.

ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI disappear into the SHADOWS of the
MOUNTAINS. The ROHAN SOLDIERS murmur among themselves,
"What's happening?", "Where's he going?"

                    GAMLING
          Lord Aragorn!

                    ROHAN SOLDIER O.S.
          Why does he leave on the eve of battle?

                    GAMLING
          He leaves because there is no hope.

CLOSE ON: THEODEN as he moves forward.

                    THEODEN
          He leaves because he must.

                     GAMLING
          Too few have come. We cannot defeat the
          armies of Mordor.

                      THEODEN
          No, we cannot . . .
               (surveying his frightened Men)
          But we will meet them in battle,
          nonetheless.

EXT. THEODEN'S TENT, DUNHARROW PLATEAU - DAWN

ANGLE ON: THEODEN looks at EOWYN who stands as if turned to
stone ... she is looking up at a LIGHTENING SKY ... The QUIET
before the MEN depart for WAR . . .

                      THEODEN
                (gentle)
           I have left instruction: the people are to
           follow your rule in my stead ... take up my
           seat in the Golden Hall ... long may you
           defend Edoras if the battle goes ill.

ANGLE ON: EOWYN turns to the KING ... her FACE a BLANK ...
She speaks without emotion.

                      EOWYN
           What other duty would you have me do, my
           Lord?

THEODEN moves towards her, taking up her HAND . . .

                     THEODEN
               (quiet)
           Duty? ... No, I would have you smile again -
           not grieve for those whose time has come.

EOWYN slowly lifts her head . . .

                     THEODEN (cont'd)
           You shall live to see these days renewed.

CLOSE ON: THEODEN lifts EOWYN faces to look into her EYES . . .

             What kind of an army would linger in such a
             place?

                       LEGOLAS
             One that is cursed ... Long ago the Men of
             the Mountain swore an oath to the last King
             of Condor - to come to his aid, to fight,
             but when the time came, when Condor's need
             was dire, they fled ... Vanishing into the
             darkness of the mountain ... And so Isildur
             cursed them - never to rest until they had
             fulfilled their pledge.

SILENCE surrounds them, there are no birds, no wind. Only the
OMINOUSLY MUFFLED THUD of their horses hooves on the dank FIR-
NEEDLES.                                     '

EXT. DIMHOLT GLEN - DAY

ANGLE ON: Before them, at the ROOT OF THE MOUNTAIN, a SHEER
WALL of ROCK towers . . .

                     GIMLI
               (terrified whisper)
          The very warmth of my blood seems stolen
          away.

Within the walls, a creepy DARK DOOR gapes like a mouth of
night. SIGNS and FIGURES are carved above its WIDE ARCH.

                     LEGOLAS
               (translating)
          The way is shut. It was made by those who
          are dead, and the Dead keep it. The way is
          shut.

AT THAT MOMENT: A CHILL WIND seems to rush out of the DOORWAY
. . . ARAGORN stares into the BLACKNESS, his HAIR BLOWING
WILDLY. The HORSES REAR and'BUCK'in terror, turning and
GALLOPING AWAY.

                       ARAGORN
          Brego!

             I do not fear death ...

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN WALKING into the BLACKNESS.

LEGOLAS quickly follows . . . swallowed by the DARKNESS.

CLOSE ON: GIMLI left ALONE . . . He hesitates, struggling with hi
FEAR.

                         GIMLI
             Well, this is a thing unheard of ... An Elf
             will go underground when a Dwarf dare not.
                  (gritting his teeth)
             Oh! I ' d never hear the end of it!

GIMLI plunges into the TUNNEL behind the OTHERS!

EXT. DUNHARROW ENCAMPMENT - DAWN

MUCH ACTIVITY ... HORNS SOUND ... the ENTIRE CAMP is on the
MOVE ... fires are DOUSED, TENTS pulled down, HORSES saddled.

EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - DAWN

ANGLE ON: THEODEN strides through the CAMP, EOMER at his SIDE.

                     THEODEN
          We must ride light and swift. It's a long
          road ahead ... and man and beast must reach
          the end with the strength to fight.

ANGLE ON: MERRY . . . preparing a LITTLE PONY with a SADDLE and
SUPPLIES. He is wearing an OVERSIZED HELMET and ROHIRRIM
CLOTHING . . . he looks at once NERVOUS and EXCITED.

KING THEODEN breaks away from a COLUMN and rides up to MERRY.

             It is a three day gallop to Minas Tirith.

                        THEODEN
             I will say no more.

KING THEODEN wheels his HORSE away . . .

MERRY is bitterly DISAPPOINTED. He stands, head down - a TINY
DEJECTED FIGURE - as the MIGHTY ROHIRRIM on their LARGE
HORSES ride by . . . a jangling sea of HELMETS, SHIELDS and
BANNERS.

SUDDENLY . . . MERRY is plucked off the ground! A SOLDIER has
snatched him by the collar ... and plonked him down on their
SADDLE!

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN leads LEGOLAS and GIMLI into a WIDE CAVERN

FRODO slips as he tries to follow the voice . . . He puts his
HAND to the WALL to STEADY HIMSELF but quickly YANKS it away
... STRANDS of a WHITE THREAD stuck to his HAND.

                        FRODO
             It's sticky . . . What is it?

GOLLUM is nowhere to be seen ... only his voice echoes back
down the LABYRINTH of TUNNELS.

                         GOLLUM O.S.
             You will see . . . Oh, yes . . . You will see.

FRODO FREEZES!

FRODO begins to run in BLIND PANIC ...

EXT. CIRITH UNGOL STAIRS - DAY

SAM stumbles blindly down the ANCIENT STAIRS, reckless and
uncaring, his face pale and devastated.

CLOSE ON: SAM'S FOOT slips . . .

... SUDDENLY, as if the ground has given way beneath him, SAM
is slipping and sliding dangerously OUT OF CONTROL.

ANGLE ON: SAM thudding into a LARGE ROCK, which saves him.
from tumbling headlong over the PRECIPICE.

Something catches SAM'S EYE . . . he stares, barely breathing.

CLOSE ON: A package of LEMBAS BREAD . . .

ANGLE ON: SAM looking BACK UP the LONG STEEP STAIR . . .

INT. SHELOB'S TUNNEL - DAY

FRODO is running BLINDLY . . . He falls, trapped in the sticky
substance which CLINGS to him. As he lays on the ground,
unable to move, a VOICE comes to him as if froma distant-;,,
memory . . .

                     GALADRIEL V/0
           I give you the light of Earendil - our most
           beloved star. May it be a light for you in
           dark places when all other lights go out.

CLOSE ON: FRODO fumbles in his JACKET, FEAR growing in him
. . . he pulls out the GLASS PHIAL - his GIFT from GALADRIEL -
he holds it aloft.

                      FRODO
                (stronger)
           Aiya Earendil Elenion Ancalima!

LOW ANGLE ON: The LIGHT instantly REVEALS a HUGE LOATHSOME
SPIDER . . . towering over FRODO!

CLOSE ON: SHELOB the SPIDER HISSES at the LIGHT! TWO great
clusters of many-windowed EYES protrude from her bulbous
head. Her LEGS are bent, with a 12 FOOT SPAN and HAIRS that
stick out like steel spines. Her HUGE, SWOLLEN BODY, a vast
bloated bag, sways and sags between her legs. Her age-old
BLACK HIDE is knobbly and pitted, blotchy with LIVID MARKS
. . . but her belly underneath is PALE and LUMINOUS.

SHELOB beats the air with her FORELEGS.

ANGLE ON: Calling up all his remaining STRENGTH and
RESOLUTION, FRODO forces his LEGS to MOVE . . . he backs away -
keeping his EYES on SHELOB.

SHELOB crawls SLOWLY towards him ... then, with sudden .
hideous SPEED, she ATTACKS!

She lashes out with her FRONT LEGS ... FRODO is flung back
... the GLASS PHIAL clatters to the TUNNEL FLOOR, casting an
eerie LOW LIGHT.

SHELOB squats above FRODO, her EYE CLUSTERS fidgeting with
hideous delight, gloating over a prey trapped beyond all hope
of escape.

SUDDENLY! FRODO draws STING! He slashes wildly at the GIANT
SPIDER . . . hewing off the TIP of A LEG!

SHELOB SPASMS . . . a WILD BLUR of thrashing LEGS!

ANGLE ON: FRODO leaps to his feet and RUNS - not even pausing
to pick up the PHIAL of LIGHT!

TRACKING BACK: with FRODO as he careers blindly down NARROW
TUNNELS, gasping in the CHOKING AIR ... looking back over his
shoulder for any sign of SHELOB.

ANGLE ON: FRODO sees the TUNNEL EXIT ahead . . .

. . . just as he runs straight into a great COBWEB!

wrench STING free of the STICKY WEB.

            Naughty little fly,
            Why does it cry?

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM on the other side of the WEB . . .

                       GOLLUM
            Caught in a web
            Soon you'll be . . .
            . ?. Eaten!

ANGLE ON: FRODO as he SLASHES WILDLY with STING. The SHINING
BLADE of STING as it hacks through the FIBROUS STRANDS. They
whip and snap back into FRODO'S FACE as he cuts himself free.

ANGLE ON: Back up the TUNNEL - lit by the LIGHT OF GALADRIEL -
SHELOB'S HEAVING SHADOW approaches . . .

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM watches in mounting disbelief as STING
slashes through the WEB ... DISBELIEF turns to FEAR as SHELOB
gets closer and closer, GOLLUM quickly turns and BOLTS::.. . . .

FRODO hacks at the WEB and with a last desperate LUNGE, frees
himself ... STING is caught in the WEB ... FRODO leaves the
SWORD and THROWS HIMSELF through a narrow CREVICE . . .

EXT. PASS OF CIRITH UNGOL - DAY

ANGLE ON: FRODO stumbles out of SHELOB'S LAIR . . . Tumbling
onto COLD ROCK.

ANGLE ON: FRODO covered in COBWEBS, wild-eyed and drenched in
SWEAT . . . - H e looks up as GOLLUM lunges at him.  ;:

             It wasn't us! It wasn't us! Smeagol
             wouldn't hurt Master.

ANGLE ON: FRODO'S fingers squeeze tighter around GOLLUM'S
THROAT.

                        SMEAGOL (cont'd)
             Smeagol promised. You must believe us. It
             was the Precious - the Precious made us to
             do it.

FRODO has a sudden moment of SELF REALISATION and releases
GOLLUM, horrified at his VIOLENCE.

ANGLE ON: GOLLUM cowering back . . . COUGHING and SPLUTTERING.

ANGLE ON: FRODO looking at SMEAGOL, in SHOCK, he gets to his
FEET.

                  (shaky)
             I have to destroy it, Smeagol. I have to
             destroy it for both our sakes.

SMEAGOL stares at FRODO in DISBELIEF . . . in a FURY he LUNGES
at FRODO who falls backwards, dangerously close to the edge
of the PRECIPICE - GOLLUM tumbles over FRODO's BODY and FALLS
to the bottom of the RAVINE ...

EXT. PASS OF CIRITH UNGOL - NIGHT

FRODO, overcome with EXHAUSTION, stumbles down the steep
stairs of CIRITH UNGOL . . . He is full of REMORSE at his
TREATMENT of SAM ...

GALADRIEL leans down towards FRODO, OFFERING her hand ... for

wanting to lie down . . . But he knows what he must do.

ANGLE ON: An IRON DOOR creaks OPEN . . . FARAMIR'S PROCESSION
enters a WIDE VAULTED CHAMBER.

The LANTERN LIG HT throws great SHADOWS upon the SHROUDED
WALLS of a wide  VAULTED CHAMBER. ROW upon ROW of MARBLE TOMBS
are visible in  the DIM LIGHT. Upon each TOMB lies a SLEEPING
FORM, carved in  STONE, hands folded.

DENETHOR speaks in a HUSHED VOICE . . .

                       DENETHOR
                (whisper)
           No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No long

The SERVANTS place FARAMIR'S UNCONSCIOUS BODY on a STONE
TABLE in the centre of the CHAMBER. They stand, heads bowed

CLOSE ON: FRODO suddenly senses the LURKING MALICE . . . he
SPINS AROUND: Before he can react, SHELOB VICIOUSLY STABS
FRODO in the NECK with her monstrous abdominal STINGER!

GREEN OOZE trickling from her WOUNDED EYE.

With HIND LEGS, SHELOB picks SAM off the ground and TOSSES
him BACKWARDS! SAM lands heavily . . . and SHELOB POUNCES!

SAM'S HEAD. As she splays her legs to drive her huge bulk
down on him, SAM lifts the ELVEN BLADE above his head,

ANGLE ON: MOUNT DOOM . . . 50 M,ILES AWAY - across the barren
GORGOROTH PLATEAU - the mountain is erupting streams of ASH
and LAVA high into the air, lighting the low cloud blanket of
MORDOR with a flickering ORANGE WASH.

With immense trepidation, FRODO and SAM head down the steep
path into the dark kingdom . . .

. . . TWO TINY FIGURES in a bleak, foreboding landscape. Before
them lies the PLAIN of GORGOROTH ... Their eyes are drawn to
the OMINOUS SILHOUETTE of MOUNT DOOM ...

FIRES which glow on the PLAINS beneath them ... thousands

SAM cannot see what FRODO sees. GENTLY, he urges FRODO on.

             Frodo has passed beyond my sight. The
             darkness is deepening.

He turns and crosses the HALL to reveal the presence of
GIMLI, LEGOLAS, EOMER and ARAGORN . . .

ARAGORN, his back to GANDALF . . .

                    GANDALF
          It's only a matter of time. He has suffered
          a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of
          Mordor our enemy is regrouping.

GIMLI sits insolently on the SEAT of the STEWARD . . .

                    GIMLI
          Let him stay there. Let him rot. Why should
          we care?

GANDALF looks across at the DWARF . . . His face ashen.

                    GANDALF

             I have sent him to his death.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns around suddenly . . .

                        ARAGORN
             No.

GANDALF looks up sharply at ARAGORN . . .

                       ARAGORN (cont'd)
             There is still hope for Frodo. He needs
             time and safe passage across the Plains of
             Gorgoroth. We can give him that.

                        GANDALF
             How?

                        ARAGORN
             Draw out Sauron' s armies - empty his lands.
             Then we gather our full strength and march
             on the Black Gate.

At this, GIMLI CHOKES on his pipe . . . EOMER steps forward.

                        EOMER
             We cannot achieve victory from strength of
             arms .

                        ARAGORN
             Not for ourselves . . . But we can give Frodo
             his chance if we keep Sauron' s eye fixed
             upon us. Keep him blind to all else that
             moves .

                         LEGOLAS
             A diversion . . .

CLOSE ON: GANDALF speaks in a low tone to ARAGORN . . .

                         GANDALF
                  (doubtful)
             Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not
             take the bait!

scree bank and land on the road below . . . their attention is
fixed on the PLAIN below ... thousands of ORCS can be seen
marching away from MT. DOOM . . .

                       SAM
            Look, the Ores! They're moving off. You
            see, Mr Frodo - some luck at last.

EXT. GORGOROTH PLAIN, MORDOR - DAWN

FRODO and SAM ... moving across a HELLISH dry landscape of
twisted volcanic rock and STEAMING FISSURES.

40 MILES AWAY, MOUNT DOOM rises out of the PLAIN . . . its feet
founded in ashen ruin, its huge cone rising to a great
height, where its reeking head is swathed in cloud.

             Take mine . . . there's a few drops left.

FRODO gratefully takes a SMALL SIP from SAM'S BOTTLE . . .
hands it back.

                       FRODO
             There'll be none left for the return
             journey.

                       SAM
                 (softly)
             I don't think there will be a return
             journey, Mr Frodo.

A moment of EYE CONTACT between FRODO and SAM as they
acknowledge what lies ahead.

SAM offers FRODO his hand . . . and PULLS HIM UP.

EXT. PLAINS OF GORGOROTH - DAY

WIDE ON: FRODO and SAM staggering across the TORTURED
LANDSCAPE ... they are no longer WEARING the ORC ARMOUR.

CLOSE ON: FRODO is walking half-bowed, often stumbling . . . as
if his eyes not longer see the way before his feet.

His right HAND is pressed against his CHEST ... supporting a
HEAVY WEIGHT. His left HAND often rises, as if to ward off
some invisible blow. SAM watches him, CONCERN etched across
his FACE . . .

CLOSE ON: FRODO as a malevolent VOICE in his head calls to
him . . . "Baggins - Baggins" . . .

CLOSE ON: SAM looking behind him in time to see . . .

WIDE ON: A RAY of RED LIGHT stabs through the GLOOM and

From behind the HUGE GATES, the terrifying CHANTING and the
CLANGING of the ARMOUR of THOUSANDS ...

With the SOUND of TORTURED METAL, the MASSIVE GATES begin to
open . . . LEGOLAS, MERRY and EOMER look on in trepidation.

With the EYE OF SAURON sweeping the PLAINS around them, SAM
gets to his feet ...

             I see in your eyes the same fear that would
             take the heart of me. The day may come when
             the courage of Men fails; when we forsake
             our friends and break all bonds of
             fellowship; but it is not this day - an
             hour of wolves and shattered shields, when

EXT. HOBBITON FIELDS - EARLY MORNING

LYRICAL MUSIC OVER ...

A COLD WINTER'S MORNING ... Out of the FOG rattles a SMALL
COVERED WAGON; GANDALF is at the REINS.

ANGLE ON: FRODO, SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN are waiting on PONIES
for the WAGON . . . all are wearing their GREY ELVEN ROBES.

                      FRODO V/0
           Bilbo once told me, the great stories never
           end - that each of us must come and go in
           the telling. His part in this tale was now
           over. There would be no more journeys for
           Bilbo. Save one.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF arrives in his CART . . .

                                                     DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WEST FARTHING - DAY

WIDE ON: The WAGON trundles along at a SEDATE PACE.

SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN ride behind, leading FRODO'S EMPTY
PONY.

                       BILBO O.S.
                (frail)
           Tell me again, lad. Where are we going?

                      FRODO O.S.
           To the harbour, Bilbo. The Elves have
           accorded you a special honour. A place on
           the last ship to leave Middle-earth.

INT. WAGON - DAY

CLOSE ON: FRODO is SITTING in the WAGON . . . his ARM around
his UNCLE BILBO.

BILBO is extremely OLD and FRAIL. He is DOZING . . . his head
slumped.


                                                       (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


BILBO'S eyes flutter OPEN . . . with effort he raises his head


                        BILBO
                  (frail)
             Frodo ... Any chance of seeing that old
             ring of mine ... the one I gave you?

                        FRODO
                  (quietly)
             Sorry, Uncle . . . I'm afraid, I lost it.

                        BILBO
                  (frail)
             Oh . . . pity. I should like to have held it
             one last time.                                   Â·

BILBO nods back to sleep ... FRODO rests his head against
him.

                                                         DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. THE GREY HAVENS - DUSK

ANGLE ON: FRODO, walking arm-in-arm with BILBO through a
beautiful ELVEN BOAT-HOUSE ... GANDALF follows with MERRY,
PIPPIN and SAM.

CLOSE ON: As BILBO looks up, he is STUNG by the BEAUTY before
hm . . .
 i

                        BILBO
             Oh! Well, here's a sight I have neverÂ·seen
             before.

TRACKING: Passing under a beautiful ELVEN ARCHWAY . . .

. . . to reveal a WHITE SHIP, ready to depart from a WHITE
STONE DOCK.

ANGLE ON: ELROND, CELEBORN and GALADRIEL are waiting for
them.

The SETTING SUN slowly dropping behind the SEA ... visible
between the HEADLANDS of a beautiful INLET.
                                                          (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


The lighting is beautiful . . . S U N streams through the sails,
casting an ethereal glow on THE GROUP as they walk onto the
DOCK.

BILBO bows in acknowledgement to ELROND, CELEBORN and
GALADRIEL, who return his GREETING.

                       GALADRIEL
             The power of the Three Rings is ended. The
             time has come for the Dominion of Men.

                        ELROND
                  (ELVISH: with subtitles)
             I Aear can ven na mar.

             T he Sea calls us ho me.


ELROND holds out his ARMS to BILBO who suddenly seems MUCH
YOUNGER and SPRIGHTLIER . . . He sets off down the PATH TOWARD
his HOSTS . . .

                        BILBO
             I think I'm quite ready for another
             adventure.

BILBO walks down toward the BOAT and BOARDS with ELROND . . .

ANGLE ON: FRODO looks up . . . GALADRIEL is watching him. She
SMILES, TURNS and BOARDS the BOAT . . .

GANDALF kneels before SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN - who are all
looking TEARFUL.

                       GANDALF
             Farewell, my brave Hobbits. My work is now
             finished. Here at last, on the shores of
             the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship.

There is GREAT SADNESS . . . MERRY SNIFFLES LOUDLY.

                        GANDALF (cont'd)
             I will not say: "do not weep", for not all
             tears are an evil.

CLOSE ON: GANDALF turns and walks away . . . FRODO is DOWNCAST
... SUDDENLY, GANDALF turns and looks toward him.

                      GANDALF (cont'd)
           It is time, Frodo.

ANGLE ON: GANDALF looks at FRODO then turns and slowly walks
towards the GANGPLANK to board the SHIP.

                      SAM
                (alarmed)
           What does he mean?

CLOSE ON: FRODO turns to SAM. . . .

                       FRODO
                (gently)
           We set out to save the Shire, and it has
           been saved ... but not for me . . .

                       SAM
                (shaken)
           You don't mean that - you can't leave.

ANGLE ON: SAM looks down . . . FRODO is holding BILBO'S RED
JOURNAL out towards him.

                      FRODO
           The last pages are for you, Sam.

SAM is SOBBING . . . MERRY and PIPPIN are DISTRAUGHT . . . .

FRODO hugs MERRY and PIPPIN, and last of all SAM . . . and
climbs on board the SHIP.

ANGLE ON: FRODO a look of WONDERMENT crosses his face . . . as
he STEPS FORWARD and ACCEPTS GANDALF'S HAND . . . finally
released from his pain, care falls from his face . . . he is
the young FRODO we first met so long ago.

SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN comfort each other as the WHITE SHIP
glides away from the DOCK ...

WIDE ON: The WHITE BOAT sails away towards the HEADLANDS,
disappearing into the GOLDEN LIGHT of the SETTING SUN.

ANGLE ON: SAM in growing darkness, still follows the
departing SHIP with his eyes, MERRY and PIPPIN are already
preparing to leave.

                                                           CUT TO:

EXT. NO.3 BAGSHOT ROW - MORNING

ANGLE ON: SAM walks up the path towards his house . . .

A LITTLE GIRL toddles up to greet him.

                       SAM
            Elanor!

He hugs his daughter . . .

                       FRODO V/0
            My dear Sam. You cannot always be torn in
            two. You have to be one and whole for many
            years. You have so much enjoy and to be and
            to do. Because Sam, your part in the
            journey goes on.

ANGLE ON: ROSIE COTTON steps up and kisses SAM on the cheek
. . . she gives him a TINY BABY BOY to cradle.

                       SAM
            Hello, little Frodo!

ANGLE ON: SAM with his FAMILY . . . he draws a deep breath:

                      SAM (cont'd)
           Well ... I'm back.

SAM looks at his LOVELY FAMILY with GREAT HAPPINESS, tinged
with a little SADNESS . . .

SAM and ROSIE take the CHILDREN'S HANDS and enter BAGSHOT . . .
the BRIGHT YELLOW DOORWAY closes behind them.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK.
