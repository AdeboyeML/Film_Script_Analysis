     THE ADDAMS FAMILY - 11/6/90


     FADE IN:


A1   EXT. ADDAMS MANSION FRONT STEPS - CHRISTMAS EVE            A1

     A GROUP OF CAROLERS, their eager faces upturned, SINGS an
     endless and cloying roundelay of "Little Drummer Boy."
     They sing with self-righteous good cheer. As they
     pompously begin their umpteenth verse,
     THE CAMERA SLOWLY PANS UP THE ADDAMS MANSION -- past
     the black wreath on the front door, past broken windows,
     weather-beaten shingles, a creaking shutter.

     THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN TO THE ROOF

     where the Addams Family members, GOMEZ, MORTICIA, GRANNY,
     PUGSLEY, WEDNESDAY, and LURCH, their faithful butler,
     gleefully POUR a CAULDRON OF BUBBLING, STEAMING PITCH
     over the edge.

     AS THE CAULDRON TIPS, THE CAMERA PUSHES INSIDE, THE


     BLACKNESS OF THE PITCH FILLS THE SCREEN. TITLES BEGIN.


                                               DISSOLVE TO:


1    INT. DIM HALLWAY - SEVEN O'CLOCK A.M.                      1


     C.U. AN OVER-SIZED "CUCKOO" CLOCK --

     The clock is a perfect REPLICA OF THE ADDAMS FAMILY
     HOUSE, down to the creaking shutter. It chimes the hour.
     In ONE WINDOW, a LITTLE MECHANICAL GOMEZ bends a
     MECHANICAL MORTICIA back until she's almost off her feet
     and plants a kiss between her clockwork decolletage.
     One, two, three mechanical kisses, counting toward
     seven o'clock.



     IN ANOTHER WINDOW, A MECHANICAL PUGSLEY hangs a
     MECHANICAL WEDNESDAY from a noose on a gallows, up and
     down.
     Meanwhile, little BURSTS OF FOG float off the rooftop
     where a little MECHANICAL GRANNY cranks her fog machine.
     The front door of the house pops open, and a MECHANICAL
     LURCH appears and begins sweeping.
     Just then, THING, the disembodied hand with the
     full-bodied personality, CLIMBS into view over the back
     of the clock.
     Thing leaps to the floor and SCAMPERS down the hall.

     He runs past a couple of doors, past a pair of LEGS in
     pajamas, feet in bedroom slippers. He skids to a halt
     and BACK TRACKS to the legs. He pulls on the cuff of
     the pajama bottoms. They belong to GOMEZ, who stands
     in the doorway to

A2   INT. FESTER'S ROOM                                         A2

     Gomez wears a fez and a smoking jacket over his pajamas.
     Even at this early hour, he puffs on his trademark cigar.
     Gomez is all enthusiasm or all despair. At the moment,
     he radiates unfathomable woe.

                              GOMEZ

                Think of it, Thing. He's been gone
                for twenty-five years. For twenty-
                five years we've attempted to
                contact Fester in the great
                beyond...
     The room is a dusty, cobweb-filled, long-unoccupied shrine
     to Gomez's lost brother, Fester. Gomez drifts in from the
     doorway.
     The room has remained untouched since Fester's
     disappearance as a teenager. The thick coating of dust
     and cobwebs adorns the mementoes of a rapscallion's youth
     - a football pennant from Alcatraz, headless sports
     trophies, a high school photo with all the other students
     keeping as much distance from Fester as possible.
     As he lovingly and morosely surveys the room:

                              GOMEZ

                ... And for twenty-five years,
                nothing. Not a whisper, not a
                clue. I'm beginning to think my
                my brother truly is lost.
     Gomez sighs.   Thing TUGS at his cuff, pulling him towards
     the

B2   INT. HALLWAY - SAME TIME                                   B2

     Galloping ahead of Gomez, Thing leaps onto an
     old-fashioned door latch and the door swings open INTO

2    INT. GOMEZ AND MORTICIA'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME              2

     Gomez approaches the bed.   Asleep on scarlet satin sheets
     is...

     MORTICIA

                      (gazing at Morticia)
               Look at her -- I would die for her.
               I would kill for her. Either way
               -- what bliss.
     Low-voiced, incisive, and subtle, with Morticia, smiles
     are rare. The ghostly whiteness of her complexion is
     offset by the red of the pillowcase upon which her hair
     is spread like a diabolic halo. A dark Garbo, sultry
     and remote, she's a ruined beauty.
     Morticia OPENS HER EYES.

                             GOMEZ

                      (adoringly)
               Unhappy, darling?

                             MORTICIA

                      (passionately)
               Oh, yes, yes. Completely.

     Pugsley crouches on the floor, playing with his kid-sized
     chemistry set.
     The walls of his room are covered with road signs he's
     collected -- "Bridge Out!", "Detour! Excavation Ahead!",
     "Dangerous Undertow!", "Keep Clear! High Voltage!"
     SAWED-OFF STOP SIGNS, still on their poles, are stacked
     in the corner.



     In another corner stands a CYLINDRICAL FLOOR-TO-CEILING

     FISH TANK, FILLED WITH PIRANHA.

     This tubby energetic monster of a nine-year-old boy has
     every chance of growing up to be the public monster his
     parents would be proud of.
     He MIXES chemicals in a beaker. The brew steams.    Grin-
     ning wickedly, Pugsley SWALLOWS it down.
     He contorts, undergoing the beginnings of a transforma-
     tion, then SHRINKS to the size of a mouse. Laughing, he
     crawls out of his human-size pajamas.

     Solemn and mournful, ten-year-old Wednesday has black
     hair and white skin like her mother. She sits on a stool
     among the stored Addams' family objects, ONE END OF A

     STRING TIED TO HER TOOTH, THE OTHER TIED TO A TRAP DOOR.

     The trap door is flung open, GRANNY pokes her head
     through. She's a giggly hag who looks like she was in
     the bathtub when the hairdryer fell in.
     Wednesday's pulled tooth swings at the end of the string.

                             WEDNESDAY

               Thank you, Grandmama.
     In a foul mood, Granny tromps up into the attic.




                             GRANNY

               You kids are going to have to kill
               your own breakfast this morning.
     Wednesday opens a cigar box. Inside the box are assorted
     human and animal teeth, fangs and dentures, along with a
     collection of glass eyes. Wednesday drops her tooth in
     the box.

     Gomez takes Morticia in his arms. As she languidly
     drapes herself across his chest, she is caught in a
     sudden shaft of sunlight. She squints. On the bedside
     table beside her, Morticia's OVERSIZED CARNIVOROUS

     ORCHID WILTS.





                             MORTICIA

               Gomez... the sun... il me perce
               comme un poignard.

     He kisses his way up to her neck, then, suddenly
     bursting with enthusiasm and a sense of purpose, LEAPS
     from the bed, drawing his bedside saber from its sheath
     and BRANDISHING it at the offending beam.

                            GOMEZ

              En garde monsieur sole!
     He thrusts and parries, pantomiming a duel with the
     shaft of light.

                            MORTICIA

              Gomez?

              Last night, you were... unhinged.
              You were like some desperate,
              howling demon. You frightened me.
              Do it again.

      TULLY ALFORD, the family attorney, and his wife, MARGARET,
      approach "GATE," a wrought-iron monstrosity that opens of
      its own accord. Though Tully comes here often and
      Margaret has been here before, they never cease to be
      startled by "Gate."
      Tully has a puffy, once handsome face, and an embittered
      grey aura that is the mark of a middle-age misspent.
      High-strung and superficial, Margaret is more disap-
      pointed in Tully than he is in himself.
      Margaret passes through Gate first. Then, as Tully passes
      through, Gate slams on him, clipping him and catching the
      end of his coat. Tully fights Gate for his coat.

      Morticia is looking for her children. She discovers
      Pugsley ASLEEP, curled up on the SILVER PLATTER WHERE THE
      TWO-HEADED PIG LAY. She finds this enchanting.
      Gomez enters.   Morticia shushes him; she points to the
      platter.

                             MORTICIA

                      (whispering)
               Look - our little boy.

               So sweet. He looks just... like
               a little entree.
      Pugsley wakes up; he looks around.

               Not since before the Mamushka.

      Gomez rallies the family for the search. Morticia wears
      a black cloak. Granny has grabbed her divining rod.
      Lurch distributes torches, then stands aside, awaiting
      instructions. Pugsley helps Gomez unroll an ancient map
      of the area.

                             GOMEZ

               Fan out. Pugsley - head for the dung
               heap. Mama and Morticia - the shallow
               graves. I'll take the abyss, and
               Lurch - check the bottomless pit.

               Up here.
      They look up at Fester, looking down at them from
      Wednesday's window.

                             GOMEZ

               Fester! You take the ravine!     And
               the unmarked, abandoned well!

      Thing tugs at the cuff of Gomez's pants.       Gomez nods.

                                GOMEZ

                  That's the spirit, Thing - lend a

      They all sweep off, with Gomez in the lead.

      Fester is still at the window.      Abigail joins him.

      TULLY -




      sitting in an armchair, basking in the rays of sunshine
      that beam from a copy of "The Sun Also Rises." Tully
      smiles at them.

       Gomez reaches a stately mausoleum at the far end of the
       cemetery. Two proud marble vultures guard the entryway.
       Gomez lowers the uplifted claw of one of the vultures and
       the stone doors slide open. He steps into -

       Inside it is catacomb-like, filled with the bleached
       bones of the Addams dead. Gomez's torch casts shadows
       -- one of which belongs to Wednesday, curled asleep on a
       stone sarcophagus. Relieved to find her, Gomez
       approaches quietly. He doesn't want to wake her up. He
       lifts her tenderly in his arms.

      Gate can't open. He rattles miserably on his hinges --
      locked tight with heavy chains and yellow police tape -
      large "NO TRESPASSING!! COURT ORDER!! ADDAMS FAMILY -
      KEEP OUT!!" signs are posted on Gate's rusty bars.

      hurries down the walkway, waving his legal document.

                               TULLY

                 This is a restraining order, Gomez.

                               GOMEZ

                 A restraining order?

                               TULLY

                 It requires you to keep a distance of
                 one thousand yards from this house.
                 You've got about nine hundred and
                 ninety-nine yards to go - catch my

                 Not your house, moustache! Not any
                 more! It belongs to the eldest living
                 descendant, the older of the brothers

      GOMEZ

      already sits in the passenger seat of the Duesenberg, his
      coat draped over his shoulders as if he were an invalid,
      his head thrown back.
      Morticia carries out Cleo, her carnivorous plant. Granny
      carries her favorite cauldron, Wednesday one of her Marie
      Antoinette dolls, Pugsley his chemistry set. Lurch uproots
      his favorite tree and joins the procession. Thing follows,
      dragging a toy wagon packed with his rings, his glove.

      Morticia leans into frame. With an icepick and a hammer,

      Sighing deeply, she stands back to admire her handiwork.

      As she turns to Gomez, we see the interior of the bungalow

      plastic and orange shag carpet.

      GOMEZ

      sits slumped in a   chair made from wagon wheel and nauga-
      hyde. It's as if    all of his insane, vibrant energy has
      been leeched from   him. He's a broken man. He looks back

      worried look.

      comes from the bathroom, nibbling a wrapped bar of motel
      soap.

       Wednesday and Pugsley are at their lemonade stand. They
       are negotiating with a PRISSY LITTLE GIRL IN A GIRL SCOUT
       UNIFORM. The girl scout carries several boxes of Girl
       Scout cookies.

                       (with grave doubts)
                Is this made from real lemons?

       White clapboard. Geraniums in the flower boxes.
       Surrounded by a white picket fence.



       Carrying his SAMPLE VACUUM CLEANER AND BUCKET, the tools of
       his new trade, Lurch carefully opens the little white gate.

       AT THE DOOR,

       he rings the doorbell, afraid he might break something.
       A BLONDE HOUSEWIFE in tennis whites, obviously in a hurry,
       opens the door -- only to be greeted by a BUCKETFUL OF
       SLOP thrown past her, onto her peach Oriental rug. She
       SCREAMS in horror, turns to challenge the perpetrator of
       this atrocity and, seeing Lurch, SCREAMS again.
       In a panic, she tries to slam the door on Lurch, but, like
       the salesman's manual undoubtedly advised, he STICKS his
       foot in the way. The door partially RIPS off its hinges.
       Lurch steps inside and shuts the door as best he can.
       A moment passes. The door swings open and Lurch exits,
       jauntily waving a check.

                          dabbing her eye with
                          a fingertip)
                  Look - I'm weeping.
        Abigail exits. The minute the door shuts, Fester gets
        out of bed. He is fully clothed. He goes to the window,
        and begins to climb out.

        Morticia, fully dressed, wearing her cloak, heads off
        down the walk. Unseen by her, Thing trails after.

        Morticia, just outside Gate, struggles to get it open,
        Thing clutching the bars, also attempting to block her
        way.

                                MORTICIA

                  Stop it, you two.
        Morticia breaks free of Thing.

        the sight of Morticia on the stoop.

                                MORTICIA

                  I would like to speak with Fester.
        Tully steps aside.

                                TULLY

                  We've been expecting you...
        Morticia crosses the threshold.

155   EXT. INTERSECTION AT THE FOOT OF THE ADDAMS HILL - NIGHT 155

      Thing does his damnedest to flag down any of the few
      oncoming cars. He waves to no avail, DANCES AROUND in
      frustration, then tries HITCHHIKING, sticking out his
      thumb. A passing car splashes him with mud.
      Screwing up his courage, in a kamikaze leap, he GRABS
      ahold of the bumper of the next car that comes along and
      hangs on for dear life as the car SPEEDS down the street.

      Morticia is now stretched out on the torture RACK. Fester
      and Tully are securing her hands and feet, under Abigail's
      supervision. Fester seems torn, agitated, upset.

                             MORTICIA

                      (to Abigail, graciously)
               You are a desperate woman, consumed
               by greed and infinite bitterness.
                      (a beat)
               We could have been such friends.

                             ABIGAIL

               I don't think so. The vault,
               Mrs. Addams - any thoughts?

                      (sweetly, to Abigail)
               Despite everything, I don't hate
               you. I pity you. Persecution,
               fiendish torture, inhuman depravity -
               sometimes it's just not enough.

                             ABIGAIL

               Gordon - let's get started.

                             FESTER

               But, Mother...

               I'm not stalling! Stop badgering me!

                             TULLY

               I'd love to, you know that, but -
               I've got this stomach thing. When I
               torture people. It's just me.

                                ABIGAIL

               Do it!

               Where's your bathroom?




                               ABIGAIL


               NOW!

      Tully shuts his eyes and tightens the rack. Morticia's
      bones make a horrible POPPING, STRETCHING SOUND. She
      MOANS, rather sensually.

                               ABIGAIL

               Again!
      Tully tightens the rack again. More BONE-POPPING NOISES.
      Morticia MOANS again, even more orgasmically.

                               ABIGAIL

               Tighter!
      Tully tightens the rack a third time. BONE-POPPING NOISES.
      Morticia MOANS, very voluptuously. She opens her eyes.
      She sighs, in afterglow. She glances at Tully.

                             MORTICIA

                      (to Tully, flirtatiously)
               You've done this before.

      Thing leaps dramatically onto the porch, then stops dead
      to knock on the cabin door.
      After a beat:

                                GOMEZ (O.S.)

               Who is it?     We're paid through
               Thursday.
      He opens the door.    Thing rushes in.

      Frustrated, Thing grabs a SPOON and begins tapping out

      MORSE CODE.

                        (to Gomez)
                 A day alone - only that would be
                 death.
      Gomez kisses Morticia's hand.

                                 ABIGAIL

                 Knock it off!    The vault, Addams -
                 right now!

                               FESTER

                 But, Mother can't we...
      Gomez reaches for the book that will open the secret
      panel:

                               ABIGAIL

                 Can it, Gordon! Stop dragging your
                 feet! You disgust me - you're nothing
                 but a useless, snivelling baby! A
                 stone around my neck! What was I
                 thinking - I should've left you where
                 I found you!
      At Abigail's final words, Fester suddenly LEAPS FORWARD.

                               FESTER

                 No tricks, Gomez! That's the wrong
                 book!

      CLOSE UP

      Gomez's hand is on the right book, "Greed," but Fester
      stops him from pulling it.




                                 FESTER

                 Allow me...
      Gomez looks into Fester's eyes -- realizing what he's
      about to do.

                               GOMEZ

                        (murmuring)
                 Good show, old man...
      Fester reaches for a DIFFERENT BOOK -- "Hurricane Irene:
      Nightmare from Above."
      Seeing the title of the book, Tully suddenly panics:

               Oh, really?

                             TULLY

               I'm your friend, Gordon - think
               of the doubloons!

                             FESTER

               They're not yours, Tully!     Back off!



      ANGLE on Gomez, releasing Morticia from the torture wheel.

                             MORTICIA

               Quickly, my darling!
      He helps her down from the wheel.

                             GOMEZ

               Leather straps, red-hot pokers...

                             MORTICIA

               Later, my dearest.
      ANGLE on Fester, facing off with Abigail, as Tully cowers.

                             ABIGAIL

               Keep the book closed, Gordon -
               listen to mother!

                             FESTER

               I'll never listen to you - not

                             ABIGAIL

               I had to be strict with you -
               because I cared! Put it down!

                             FESTER

               You never really loved me!
      ANGLE on Gomez and Morticia, nearing the bookcase.

                             GOMEZ

               Come, my love - to safety!

                 You're a terrible mother!   There,
                 I said it!
       Fester opens the book, and blasts Tully out of the window.
       Then he blasts Abigail out as well.
       ANGLE ON GOMEZ, who has now pulled the right book, "Greed",
       to open the bookshelf. Amid the storm, he is leading
       Morticia behind the bookshelf. He tries to hold the
       bookshelf open for Fester to follow, fighting the gale
       force winds.

                               GOMEZ

                        (calling out to Fester)
                 Old man! This way!
       ANGLE ON THING, across the room, struggling across the
       floor toward the bookshelf. Thing fights the wind,
       which pelts him with papers and other flying debris.
       Gomez can no longer fight the storm, and the bookshelf
       slams shut. Fester desperately tries to close the book to
       quell the storm, but a HUGE BOLT OF LIGHTNING ZAPS HIM.
       He falls to the floor, with electricity coursing through
       him.



       MOVE IN on the storm raging within the pages of the book,
       then -

174   EXT. ADDAMS MANSION, NEXT OCTOBER - NIGHT                174

      A group of little CHILDREN approach the front door. There
      is a hand-lettered sign on the door reading "HALLOWEEN
      OPEN HOUSE." The children are dressed in traditional
      Halloween costumes - there's a witch, a ghost, a skeleton,
      etc., and they all carry trick-or-treat bags. They giggle
      and chatter. One of the children is pushed forward, and
      he KNOCKS on the front door. As the door opens, the
      children CHANT:

                             CHILDREN

               Trick or...
      They freeze in mid-chant. We do not see who has opened
      the door, but the children do. After a beat, they SCREAM
      IN HORROR and run, terrified, back toward the street.




                                                  CUT TO:

175   INT. FRONT HALL - SAME TIME                               175

      Lurch is closing the front door, looking puzzled.
      The family is busily decorating the house for their annual
      Halloween festivities. All the decorations are elegant
      yet ancient, dusty and faded. The crystal gloves in the
      chandeliers have been replaced by miniature jack o-
      lanterns. Skeletons, each wearing a top hat, hang from
      the sconces by the nooses around their necks. There are
      clusters of black and orange balloons, covered with
      cobwebs. Uncle Fester and Thing are draping the banisters
      and stairway railings with a garland made from crepe
      paper, dead branches and spanish moss. Skulls, each
      holding a candle, are scattered about, on the stairs and
      the furniture. A stuffed, life-size scarecrow leans
      against the stairway, with a pitchfork through its throat.
      A banner on the wall reads "HAPPY HALLOWEEN", and the
      letters drip with blood.
      Gomez hangs upside down from the balcony.   Morticia hands
      him a decoration.
      Granny appears from the kitchen, carrying a tray of food.

                             GRANNY

               Well, it's their loss. I even
               made finger sandwiches.
      Perched on Fester's shoulder, Thing shakes in fear.

                             FESTER

                      (petting Thing)
               Oh, calm down.

                               PUGSLEY (O.S.)

               Here we come!



      Wednesday and Pugsley come down the stairs. Wednesday
      is dressed in her usual style, but Pugsley is dressed as
      a tiny version of UNCLE FESTER, COMPLETE WITH BALD HEAD AND
      GREATCOAT. The adults are delighted. Gomez flips down
      onto his feet.

                             GOMEZ

               Pugsley, old man!

               Look at you.

                      (to Uncle Fester)
               How do you like it?
      Fester is very touched; he picks Pugsley up.

      Everyone starts to move toward the den. There is a KNOCK
      on the door. Everyone turns. Lurch opens the door.
      Standing outside are Margaret and Cousin It. Margaret is
      dressed as a fairy princess, complete with wand. Cousin
      It wears a cowboy hat, a bandanna and a holster. Margaret
      is radiant, obviously very much in love.

                             MARGARET

               Hello, Margaret. Cousin It - I
               almost didn't recognize you.

                             MARGARET

               Isn't he handsome? Everyone keeps
               asking where he bought his costume.

                             GOMEZ

                      (admiringly)
               It is a wonderful hat.

                      (solemnly)
               This is my costume. I'm a homicidal
               maniac. They look just like everyone
               else.

      Fester and Pugsley are posed at one end of the room.
      Lurch has set up an easel and canvas; he is painting
      Fester and Pugsley's portrait.
      Gomez and Wednesday are sitting on the floor amid
      newspapers, carving a pumpkin.
      Morticia is knitting. Margaret and Cousin It sit together,
      holding hands. Granny brings people cups of steaming
      punch, from a punch bowl.

               Halloween - it's such a special
               time. Ghosts and goblins. Witches
               on broomsticks.

               Children begging in the streets.

               Now that I've got my memory back.

               For the picture?
      Fester pops a light bulb into his mouth.   It lights.
      Pugsley giggles.
      Gomez stands up, having finished the pumpkin. He places
      it on a table, and lights the candle inside. The pumpkin
      glows. It has ONE EYE IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS FOREHEAD.
      Everyone oohs and ahhs.

                             FESTER

               You know, all the old sayings are
               true. There's no place like home.
               And blood is thicker than water.




                             MORTICIA

               And just as refreshing.

                             GOMEZ

               All right, everybody - time for a
               game! What shall it be - bobbing
               for apples?

                             MARGARET

               Charades?

                             COUSIN IT

               Ooot glibber glip.

                             MORTICIA

               Of course - "Wake The Dead."

                             FESTER

                      (delighted, to Gomez
                       remembering this childhood
                       favorite)
               "Wake The Dead"!

                             GOMEZ

                      (equally excited)
               "Wake The Dead"! Out to the cemetery!
               Come on, everyone!
      Everyone starts to exit, chattering happily.

                             MARGARET

                      (to Granny)
               I've never played this before -
               how does it go?

                             GRANNY

               Did you bring a shovel?

                             PUGSLEY

               Uncle Fester, will you be on my team?

                               WEDNESDAY

               No, mine!

                             FESTER

                      (to Wednesday)
               I tell you what - we'll give you a
               head start. Three skulls and a
               pelvis - how's that?
      Pugsley and Wednesday cheer and run out.   Fester faces
      Gomez.




                             FESTER

               My own dear brother - who could be
               more precious?

                             GOMEZ

               Blood is thicker than water, old man.

                             MORTICIA

                      (touched by the
                       brothers devotion)
               And just as refreshing.
      Gomez offers his hand.   Fester takes it, in a manly
      handshake.

                             GOMEZ

               Let us never be parted.

                             FESTER

               Let us always be as one.



      Fester flips Gomez in a JUDO FLIP.
      Gomez LANDS -
      At the foot of a glass display case. The camera pans up
      the case. It contains ABIGAIL AND TULLY, EXPERTLY

      MOUNTED AND STUFFED.

      Fester rises, dusting himself off.

                             FESTER

                      (joyfully, to Gomez
                       and Morticia)
               Come on!

                             MORTICIA

               We'll catch up.
      Fester runs out.

178   INT. FRONT HALL                                            178

      Everyone is gone. Morticia and Gomez have drifted into
      the front hall; they are moving toward the front door.

                              MORTICIA

                       (deeply satisfied)
                Our family... what are they?

                              GOMEZ

                Oh, Tish - what a night. Everyone
                -- together at last. What more
                could we ask?




                             MORTICIA

                Gomez?
      Morticia holds up the garment she's been knitting - it's
      a BABY JUMPER WITH THREE LEGS.

                              GOMEZ

                       (ecstatic)
                Cara mia... is it true?

                              MORTICIA

                       (shaking her head
                        "yes")
                Oui, mon cher...
      They embrace, as the front door SWINGS OPEN, of its own
      accord.

                                                CUT TO:


179   EXT. ADDAMS MANSION - SAME TIME                            179




      Morticia and Gomez are silhouetted in the doorway. There
      is a FULL MOON. In the distance, a wolf HOWLS. Wispy
      GHOSTS flit through the night sky. A human SCREAM is
      heard, followed by Granny's CACKLE. In the cemetery,
      torches are seen, like fireflies.




                                                FADE OUT.


                              THE END
