               INT. DARK ROOM - NIGHT

               Pitch dark. We hear two men speaking FRENCH in hushed voices.
               NOTE: All dialogue is in French until otherwise noted.

                                       DANIEL
                               (whispering)
                          Turn on the flashlight.

                                         JULIEN
                          I'm trying.    It doesn't work.

                                       DANIEL
                          It has to work. You just bought it this
                          afternoon.

               A beat.

                                       JULIEN
                          Do they come with batteries?

                                       DANIEL
                          You didn't buy batteries?

                                       JULIEN
                          I thought they came with batteries.

                                       DANIEL
                          I can't believe you didn't check.

                                       JULIEN
                          I bought everything you put on the list.
                          Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight.
                          Batteries were not on the list.

                                       DANIEL
                          Why should I have to put it on the list?
                          It's like saying to buy a car with tires.

               

               EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT

               A wealthy neighborhood of Paris off the Champs Elysees. Large
               homes line the secluded street. We see the silhouette of a man in
               a Peugeot. We MOVE IN closer to see RAYMOND GAYET, 30's, waits
               nervously.

               

               INT. DARK ROOM -- NIGHT

               Dark. DANIEL FORAY lights his Zippo lighter. He is late 30's,
               tall, handsome with eyes that seem to twinkle in the glow of the
               flame. Beside him is JULIEN LABESSE, 30's, hyper. Daniel places
               the LIGHTER on a small table and moves over to a PAINTING on the
               wall. Daniel stops at one, removes a pen knife and starts to cut
               the canvas from the frame.
               Daniel rolls up the canvas.

               

                                                                          2.

               

                                          DANIEL
                          Let's go.

               Julien starts to pick up the ZIPPO.

                                       DANIEL
                          Be careful it's...

               Too Late! Julien has already picked it up. It burns his hand ans
               he flicks it away. It flies through the air and lands in the corner
               of the room. The CURTAINS catch on fire.

                                          DANIEL
                          ... hot!

               Julien panics! He grabs the canvas out of Daniel's hand and begins
               beating the flames with it. Daniel looks at him with disbelief.
               Julien flails his arms wildly as he beats back the flames. He
               turns to Daniel pleased that his efforts have extinguished the
               fire, but unaware that the canvas has now caught on fire. A beat.
               Julien sees the flames and puts them out. Daniel just stares at
               him. He opens the canvas. The painting is ruined.

               

               EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

               A Mercedes parks in front of the Peugeot, boxing it in between it
               and a car behind it. The DRIVER gets out and walks away.

               

               INT. HOUSE FOYER -- NIGHT

               Daniel and Julien move through the darkness.

                                       DANIEL
                          Light your lighter. I can't see
                          anything... and try not to burn down
                          the house!

               Julien remove a lighter and presses it. The entire room fills
               with light. Julien stares at the flame amazed.

                                          OLD MAN'S VOICE
                          Don't move!

               They turn to see an old man standing at the top of the stairs in
               his bathrobe. He is frail, his face pasty white. He is holding a
               very long, double-barrel shotgun.
               Julien looks to Daniel with a 'what now' expression. The old man
               slowly moves down the stairs. He loses his balance and falls down
               the stairs, tumbling head over heals until he reaches the bottom.
               Daniel and Julien stare at the old man who is sprawled out on the
               floor, motionless.

                                          JULIEN
                          Is he dead?

                                          DANIEL
                          I don't know.     He looks dead.

               

                                                                            3.

               

                                       JULIEN
                          He looked dead before he fell.

               The old man groans, then opens his eyes.    He grabs his shotgun.
               Daniel and Julien run to the door.

               

               EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Daniel and Julien run towards the street.

                                       DANIEL
                          Start the car! Start the car!

               Raymond starts the engine.   Daniel and Julien rush across the street
               and get in the back seat.
               Raymond tries to pull out but there are only a few inches between
               the Mercedes in front and the car behind. Like a pinball stuck
               between two bumpers the Peugeot jerks rapidly back and forth.

               

               INT. PEUGEOT -- CONTINUOUS

               Daniel and Julien stare angrily ar Raymond.

                                       JULIEN
                          You didn't think to move the car before
                          we came out!

               Daniel looks out his window and sees...
               DANIEL'S POV -- the old man runs out of his house with his shotgun
               and heads towards the car.
               Raymond is desperately trying to get the car free. They all slide
               down as the old man fires. The windows on the left side of the
               car shatter.

                                       DANIEL
                          Raymond, get us out of here!

               Raymond pops up and returns to getting the car out as the old man
               opens the breach of the shotgun to reload..
               Raymond floors the Peugeot keeping his foot on the brake. The
               engine revs. He turns the wheel to the left and releases the brake.
               The Peugeot juts forward smashing into the rear of the Mercedes
               and pushing in out into the street. Before the old man can take
               aim the Peugeot is speeding down the street.

               

               INT. PEUGEOT -- MOVING -- NIGHT

               Raymond bites his lip nervously as he drives.    Julien finds the
               whole thing amusing. Daniel leans forward.

                                       DANIEL
                               (to Raymond)
                          You know what makes a good get away
                          driver?
                                       (More)

               

                                                                          4.

               
                                       DANIEL (Cont'd)
                               (controlled anger)
                          Being able to get away!

                                       RAYMOND
                          You're always pointing out my negative
                          qualities. My analyst says positive
                          reinforcement is a much more productive
                          way of relating with people.

                                       JULIEN
                          Fine. Raymond, we'd like to commend you
                          on how well you fucked up tonight.

               

               EXT. STREET, PARIS -- DAY

               A narrow street. Daniel carries the cardboard tube as he walks
               with Julien and Raymond. They enter a WAREHOUSE.

               

               INT. BASTALDI'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Two large desks are lined up face to face. One is empty. The
               other is occupied by LAURANT BASTALDI, 40's, all business. Off to
               the side is MARCEL BUROT, 40's. Daniel, Julien and Raymond enter.
               As they approach the desk Daniel glances at Marcel who is staring
               at him.

                                        MARCEL
                               (amused)
                          I heard you almost got your ass blown
                          off last night. Some thief. A regular
                          black panther.

               Marcel glances at Bastaldi to see if he appreciates his comments.

                                        RAYMOND
                          A Black Panther was a member of an African
                          American militant group in the sixties,
                          Marcel. I think you're referring to The
                          Pink Panther.

                                       MARCEL
                          Pink panther, black panther. Who gives
                          a shit? And I don't remember asking you
                          a God Damn thing, you little turd.

                                       RAYMOND
                          There's no reason to be abusive. You're
                          projecting your anger on me as a defense
                          mechanism.

                                       MARCEL
                          What the hell is he talking about?

                                       RAYMOND
                          I'm talking about human beings
                          communicating openly and honestly.

               

                                                                             5.

               

                                       MARCEL
                          How about getting on your knees and
                          communicating with my dick?

                                       BASTALDI
                          Shut up! Both of you!    You're giving me
                          a fuckin' headache.

               A beat. Raymond and Marcel stare at one another.     We HEAR a muffled
               GROANING SOUND in the b.g.

                                       DANIEL
                          Where's your brother?

                                       BASTALDI
                          Vincent's in the States on business.
                               (a beat; referring to
                                the painting)
                          That it?

               Daniel lays the cardboard tube containing the painting on the desk.
               Bastaldi removes the painting. To him it is not a work of art,
               just a commodity to be sold. He opens his desk drawer, removes
               several large stacks of money and hands them to Daniel.

                                        BASTALDI
                          Okay.   Now I've got something I want to --

               We HEAR the groaning sound again. Bastaldi looks irritated. He
               gets up and walks over to a closet. He opens to the doors to reveal
               a man in his underwear, his wrists tied behind his back, his mouth
               taped shut. A wire noose is around his neck forcing him to stand
               on his tip toes to avoid hanging himself.

                                       BASTALDI
                          Do you mind? I'm trying to do some
                          business here.

               The man looks at Bastaldi through pleading eyes and mumbles
               something.

                                       BASTALDI
                          One more sound out of you and I'm going
                          to cut your fuckin' tongue out.

               Bastaldi closes the door.   Daniel looks at him inquisitively.

                                       BASTALDI
                          You take someone in. Give them a steady
                          job and how do they repay you? By
                          claiming to misplace a shipment of your
                          merchandise.

                                       RAYMOND
                          Maybe he did misplace it.

                                       BASTALDI
                          You misplace your car keys.   You misplace
                          your cell phone.

                                                                            6.

               
                                       BASTALDI (Cont'd)
                          You do not misplace one hundred and forty
                          seven wide-screen TV's!

                                       DANIEL
                          Laurant, how long has he been in there?

               Bastaldi looks puzzled.

                                          BASTALDI
                          I don't know.     What day is today?

                                          JULIEN
                          Thursday.

                                        BASTALDI
                          Is it Thursday already?    This week has
                          just shot by.

               Bastaldi thinks about something for a moment, then...

                                       BASTALDI
                          You and your crew speak English, don't
                          you?

               Daniel is still staring at the closet.

                                       BASTALDI
                          Hey Daniel! Hello?
                               (snaps his fingers)
                          Do you guys speak English?

                                          DANIEL
                          Uh, yeah.

                                        BASTALDI
                          Good.   I have a job for you in America.

               Bastaldi tosses a photo of a middle-aged American couple.   He points
               to a diamond necklace around the woman's neck.

                                       BASTALDI
                          The Taylors from Chicago. Very rich.
                          An acquaintance of mine recently quit
                          working for Mrs. Taylor as an assistant.
                          She tells me they keep all their jewelry
                          in a safe in their bedroom.

                                       JULIEN
                          It seems like a long way to go for a
                          necklace.

                                       DANIEL
                          Besides, we don't know the city and--

                                       MARCEL
                               (overlapping)
                          Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you
                          want to go.
                                       (More)

               

                                                                               7.

               
                                       MARCEL (Cont'd)
                          He's telling you you're going! And if
                          he's telling you you're going to be going
                          then you are going to go!

                                       BASTALDI
                          Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely
                          redundant explanation.

                                       DANIEL
                          C'mon, Laurant, America?

                                       BASTALDI
                          The job is worth about two million euros.
                          Pull this off and you and your crew could
                          make some real money, Daniel. You leave
                          tomorrow.

               They know they don't have a choice.

                                       JULIEN
                          We're going to need to find someone who
                          knows the city.

                                       MARCEL
                          I know someone.

               

               EXT. NOTRE DAME -- DAY

               The plaza is filled with tourists. Moving through the crowd is
               SAMI ZERHOUNI, Algerian, late 20's, a small time street hustler,
               dressed in jeans and a "I Love Paris" tee-shirt. He passes a
               MAN who is about to take a picture and lifts his wallet.
               Sami moves on. He sees two overweight women standing at a
               vendor's cart, holding a large wad of MONEY. The woman puts the
               cash back in her purse, but does not zip it up.
               Sami moves in behind her and slips his hand into the purse. She
               zips the bag closed. Sami's face fills with pain as the zipper
               catches the hair of his arm. The women walk towards the
               cathedral. Sami has no choice but follow after them. He tries
               to match their pace so he doesn't alert them of his presence.
               The woman looks back and sees Sami's hand. She pulls her bag
               away, ripping a section of hair off his arm, then swings the
               bag, putting all of her weight behind it. It hits Sami squarely
               in the face. He lands on his back with a thud. WALLETS and
               BILLFOLDS fly out from every one of his pockets.
               He staggers to his feet and starts to pick up the wallets when
               he sees...

               HIS POV -- ACROSS THE PLAZA:    of two police officers moving
               towards him .
               He knows he has no more time.    He takes off running, disappearing
               into the crowd.

               

                                                                           8.

               

               INT. CAFE -- LATIN QUARTER -- DAY

               Sami is at the bar. He sees Marcel enter and runs towards the
               back. Standing in his way is one of Marcel's MEN. Sami turns
               around as Marcel approaches and forces a smile.
               NOTE:   All dialogue is now in English unless otherwise noted.

                                        MARCEL
                           Going somewhere?

                                       SAMI
                           Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody
                           else. If I knew it was you I would have
                           never run.

               A long, awkward beat as Marcel just glares at him.

                                        SAMI
                           You're probably here for the money I owe
                           you.
                                (off Marcel's nod)
                           I don't have it.
               Marcel opens the door to the bathroom and pushes Sami inside.

               

               INT. BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

               Marcel closes the door.   He is face to face with Sami.

                                        SAMI
                           You know this is how rumors get started.

               Marcel punches Sami in the stomach. He drops to his knees. A
               beat. The door to the bathroom opens and the LARGE MAN peers
               inside. He stares awkwardly at what he perceives as the beginning
               of a sexual act.

                                         SAMI
                           Told you.

               Marcel slams the door then grabs Sami by the ear and yanks him to
               his feet.

                                        MARCEL
                           Today's your lucky day, Sami.

                                        SAMI
                                (breathlessly)
                           Yeah, I can see that.

                                        MARCEL
                           Normally I'd be breaking your fingers
                           right now, but I'm going to give you a
                           chance to make enough to pay me back and
                           have some extra for yourself. We have a
                           group going to Chicago to do a job.
                           You're going with them.

               

                                                                            9.

               

                                          SAMI
                          Me?

                                       MARCEL
                          You lived there. You know the city.

                                       SAMI
                          I've still got a few legal problems back
                          in the States.

               Marcel glares at him.

                                       SAMI
                               (nervously)
                          But I'd be... I'd be happy to go.

               Marcel stares at him with hard expression.

                                       MARCEL
                          If you try to leave town I'll know. If
                          you manage to leave town I'll find you...
                          and the next time we meet in a bathroom
                          I'll be cutting you up into little pieces.

               He hands Sami a piece of paper.

                                       MARCEL
                          Be at this address at nine o'clock
                          tomorrow morning.

               

               INT. CAFE -- MORNING

               Daniel sits with Julien.    At the end of the bar Raymond is on the
               pay phone.

                                       RAYMOND
                               (in French)
                          Yes, Mama. Yes, I have my vitamins. I
                          have everything. Of course I'm coming
                          back. I'm not leaving you. I'm only
                          going to be gone a few days. I'll call
                          you when I get there. Okay? I've got
                          to go now.
                               (listens)
                          Mama, I've got to go.
                               (listens)
                          No, I'm not yelling.

               Sami enters and walks over to Daniel and Julien.

                                         SAMI
                          I'm Sami.    Marcel sent me.

                                       JULIEN
                          What is it you do, Sami?

               

                                                                         10.

               

                                       SAMI
                          You know, a little of this, a little of
                          that. I've boosted cars, stole radios,
                          run a few scams. Right now I'm into
                          pick-pocketing.

                                        JULIEN
                          I see.   A master criminal.

                                       SAMI
                          Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel.
                          You guys don't want me, I'll be more
                          than happy to leave.

               The door opens. ZERO enters. No one knows his last name. He is
               40's, blonde hair, leather jacket, black pants. Looks more like a
               rock-star than a criminal. His eyes are flat and there is an
               intensity about him that is unnerving. Zero casually nods to
               Daniel. Zero stares at Sami as Daniel leads him over.

                                        DANIEL
                               (to Sami)
                          This is Zero.

                                       SAMI
                          Hi. I'm one and this is two, three,
                          four and five.

               Sami laughs at his little joke. The others cringe. One look in
               Zero's eyes tells Sami what everyone else already knows: This is
               not someone to fuck with. Julien puts his arm around Sami and
               leads him away from the others.

                                       JULIEN
                          Let me give you some advice. You don't
                          want to piss him off because he'll kill
                          you for the fun of it. What you want to
                          do is keep your mouth shut and do what
                          we tell you.

                                       ZERO
                               (in French)
                          So, we are going to America?

                                        DANIEL
                          In English.   Sami doesn't speak French.

                                       ZERO
                          Where are you from?

                                        SAMI
                          Algeria.

                                       ZERO
                          And you don't speak French?

               

                                                                         11.

               

                                       SAMI
                          Well, you know, not all Algerians speak
                          French. It's a matter of what school
                          you went too. Me I never really --

                                       ZERO
                               (overlapping)
                          -- Zero isn't interested in your life
                          story.
                               (to Daniel)
                          Who gets killed?

                                       DANIEL
                          Hopefully no one.

                                       ZERO
                               (confused)
                          No one? Then why is Zero here?

               Sami leans over to Raymond.

                                       SAMI
                          He speaks about himself in the third
                          person?

                                       RAYMOND
                          Feel free to correct him if you want.

                                       DANIEL
                               (to Zero)
                          I just want you there in case there's
                          trouble.

                                       ZERO
                          And if there is, then Zero can kill
                          someone?

                                       DANIEL
                          We'll see.

               

               EXT. CAFE -- DAY

               Daniel and the others step out carrying their suitcases. The door
               to a limousine opens and Marcel gets out. The scene is in FRENCH.

                                       BASTALDI
                               (to Daniel)
                          I thought I would accompany you to the
                          airport to say bon voyage... and tell
                          you that Marcel will be going with you.

                                       DANIEL
                          What?

                                       BASTALDI
                          This is a considerable move up for you,
                          Daniel. The temptation of having so
                          much money might be too much for you.

               

                                                                         12.

               

                                       DANIEL
                          You don't trust me?

                                       BASTALDI
                          I don't trust anyone. You don't get to
                          the top of this game by trusting people...
                          and after all, you are a thief. It's in
                          your nature to steal. I'm just protecting
                          my investment.

               

               INT. LIMO -- MOVING -- DAY

               For many of them this is the first time they have ever been inside
               a limo. Julien pours himself a drink. Sami plays around with the
               air conditioner.

               Zero turns on the radio and clicks through a few stations until he
               comes to RENAUD singing "Des que le vent souffera." He leans back
               in his seat, bobbing his head to the music. Marcel doesn't like
               it. He changes the station. We hear JOHNNY HALLYDAY singing, "Que
               je taime."

                                       MARCEL
                          That's better.

               Zero doesn't like it. He pushes the button returning to the Renaud
               song and stares at Marcel. Marcel, not to be outdone returns the
               Hallyday song. Like two children they click the buttons of the
               radio, switching back and forth between Renaud and Hallyday.
               Bastaldi has had enough.

                                        BASTALDI
                          Stop it!   Both of you!

               He turns off the radio. A long beat. Marcel, like a child who
               has to have the last word starts singing to himself quietly, but
               loud enough for Zero to hear.

                                       MARCEL
                               (singing)
                          ... que je t'aime... que je...
               Marcel sees Bastaldi glaring at him and stops.

               

               EXT. O'HARE AIRPORT -- MORNING

               Daniel and the crew get into a mini-van taxi.

               

               EXT. CHICAGO DRIVING MONTAGE -- MORNING

               Quick cuts of the familiar sights of the city. The Sears building.
               Chicago board of trade building. Grant park. Then with each
               successive cut the beauty of the city seems to fade until we are
               in...

               

                                                                           13.

               

               EXT. STREET -- MORNING

               An industrial section of the city. Empty streets. Run down
               buildings. Graffiti filled walls and burnt out hulls of abandoned
               cars line the street. The taxi driver leans out his window.

                                       TAXI DRIVER
                          Are you sure you guys have the right
                          address? This ain't no tourist area.

               Marcel looks at a piece of paper he is holding.

                                        MARCEL
                          Yes.   We are sure.

               The taxi speeds off, leaving them standing on the sidewalk, their
               bags in a pile. Suddenly, from out of nowhere three BLACK TOUGHS
               appear and walk over. Daniel looks behind him and sees another
               two approaching from the rear. Zero calmly sits down on one of
               the suitcases.

                                       SAMI
                          Let me handle this.

               LAMAR, 30's, the leader of the group steps forward.

                                          SAMI
                          Hey, brother.     What's happening, man?

               Sami raises his hand as if to greet Lamar.

                                       LAMAR
                          Don't you brother me, motherfucker.

               Sami looks like an idiot with his hand up in the air.   He casually
               lowers it. Lamar looks over the group and grins.

                                       LAMAR
                          What's in the bags?

                                       JULIEN
                          Dirty underwear.

               Lamar forces a laugh.

                                       LAMAR
                          Dirty underwear. That's a good one.
                          Let me explain something to you. This
                          is my street and you're gonna give me
                          want I what or I'm gonna bust your heads
                          open.

               Raymond steps forward and places his hand on Lamar's arm.

                                       RAYMOND
                          Lamar, violence is never an answer to
                          settling disputes. I can see you have a
                          lot of anger... but this is not the way
                          to get it out.

               

                                                                          14.

               

                                       LAMAR
                          Get outta my face!

               Lamar removes a knife. The others in his group bring out an
               assortment of clubs, chains and pipes.

                                       LAMAR
                          Now, are you going to give me the
                          suitcases? Or are we going to have to
                          take them?

               Zero is still sitting on one of the suitcases.

                                       ZERO
                          Va te faire foutre!

                                       LAMAR
                          What did he say?

                                       DANIEL
                          He said to go fuck yourself.

                                       ZERO
                          We are tired and bored with your bullshit.
                          So, put that stupid little knife away
                          before Zero shoves it up your ass.

                                         LAMAR
                          Who is Zero?

                                         JULIEN
                          He is.

                                       LAMAR
                               (to Julien)
                          He speaks about himself in the third
                          person?

               Julien shrugs his shoulders.

                                       LAMAR
                          Maybe Zero would like to get off his ass
                          and take my knife from me?

                                       ZERO
                          If you insist.

               Zero stands up and raises his hand.   He is holding a .9mm Glock.
               He aims it at Lamar's head.

               Lamar's brave exterior quickly fades now that he is looking down
               the barrel of the gun. The rest of his gang turns and runs away.
               Zero aims the gun at his groin.

                                       ZERO
                          Leave now before Zero shoots off those
                          little raisins you call balls.

               Lamar runs away. Daniel and the others smile at Zero as they pick
               up their bags and walk towards a building.

               

                                                                           15.

               
               Zero is left with Sami who stares at him with disbelief.

                                       SAMI
                          You put a loaded gun in your bag and
                          brought it through customs? How stupid
                          is that?

                                       ZERO
                          Zero did not put it in his bag.    He put
                          it in yours.

               Zero grins and walks away.

               

               EXT. WAREHOUSE -- MORNING

               The crew stands at a door. Marcel knocks.     A peep-hole in the
               door is opened and an eye looks them over.

                                       MARCEL
                          We are looking for Sophie.    Laurant send
                          us.

               The door is opened by SOPHIE (the girl in the photo on Bastaldi's
               computer). She is late 20's, beautiful.

                                          SAMI
                               (softly)
                          Ouh La La.

               

               INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MORNING

               An old building, the rooms are partitioned off by sheets hanging
               from the ceiling. The main area is an artists workspace where
               large abstract paintings lean against the wall.

                                       SOPHIE
                          I wasn't expecting this many of you.
                          I've got a few sleeping bags you can
                          use.

                                          SAMI
                          Thanks.

               Of to the side, sitting on the couch is WAYNE, 20's, a burn-out
               with long hair and a scraggly goatee. His face is buried in a
               bong as he sucks in a lung full of marijuana. He watches a cartoon
               show on the television.

                                       SOPHIE
                               (to all of them)
                          This is Wayne. My roommate.

               Raymond walks over to him.

                                          RAYMOND
                          I am Raymond.     Thank you for allowing us
                          to stay here.

               

                                                                          16.

               

                                       WAYNE
                          No problem, man.
                               (offers him the bong)
                          Hey, you wanna hit?

                                          RAYMOND
                          No thank you.

               Raymond looks at the television and sees a cartoon show.

                                       RAYMOND
                          Oh, Pepe Le Pew. He is very funny and
                          quite well known in France.

                                       WAYNE
                          Yeah, I dig him.

                                       RAYMOND
                          Although a cartoon I feel he shares a
                          universal theme: We are all searching
                          for love. No?

               Wayne stares at him with a dead pan expression as he tries to
               assemble a coherent thought.

                                        WAYNE
                          Whoa...   That's deep.

                                       SOPHIE
                          You guys hungry?

               

               INT. COFFEE SHOP -- AFTERNOON

               Because of the hour the room is not crowded. Only a few PEOPLE
               sit at the counter sipping coffee. A WAITRESS, 50's, bee hive
               hair style, face covered in make up arrives at the table.

                                       WAITRESS
                          Ready to order?

               Julien looks up at her.

                                       JULIEN
                          Could we see a wine list please?

                                          WAITRESS
                               (smirks)
                          That's cute.

                                       SOPHIE
                          They don't have a wine list.

                                       JULIEN
                          Oh, then we will have the house wine.

                                       WAITRESS
                          Sure -- and would you like that before
                          your escargot in white truffle sauce?

               

                                                                            17.

               

                                       JULIEN
                          I did not order escargot.

                                       SAMI
                          They don't serve wine here.

                                       JULIEN
                          What kind of restaurant doesn't serve
                          wine?

                                         SAMI
                          This kind.

                                         JULIEN
                          Okay.    I will have a beer.

                                       WAITRESS
                          I don't think he's grasping the concept.
                          Iced tea, lemonade, coca cola, sprite or
                          root beer.

                                       JULIEN
                               (to the others)
                          C'est quoi root beer?

                                       DANIEL
                          He'll have a sprite.    We'll all have
                          sprite.

                                       WAITRESS
                          Good. Now that we've gotten the beverage
                          selection out of the way, dare we move
                          on to the main course?

                                         ZERO
                          Idiot.

               Zero grins as he puts a cigarette in his mouth.     The waitress pulls
               it out of his mouth.

                                       WAITRESS
                          And no smoking.

                                       ZERO
                               (in French)
                          No smoking? No drinking?       What kind of
                          country is this?

               

                                                                         CUT TO:

               

               CLOSE ON MAN'S FACE.
               VINNY, 40's, not the brightest bulb on the tree. His head snaps
               back as someone punches him in the face. Blood flows from his
               nose. We are in...

               

                                                                           18.

               

               EXT. ALLEY -- AFTERNOON

               Two GANGSTERS stand on each side of Vinny. They are JOEY "TWO
               TONS" 40's, could have a second career as a Sumo Wrestler. NICKY
               "THE RAKE", 30's, thin a rail. They make a strange pair but they
               both have one thing in common: They are stone cold killers.
               Standing in front of the them is FRANKIE ZAMMITO, 30's, a wise
               guy, tough as they come. He wears a well tailored suit, black
               leather gloves and polished shoes.

                                       VINNY
                               (frightened)
                          I'm sorry, Frankie.     Really.

               Vinny gets off his knees and moves towards Zammito.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          You bleed on me, I'll kill ya.

               Vinny takes a step back.

                                        ZAMMITO
                          What'd I tell you? Huh, Vinny? What'd
                          I tell you when you came to me for money?
                          Didn't I ask you not to do it? Did I
                          not say that?
                               (to Joey)
                          What'd I say to him?

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          You said don't do it, boss.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          That's right. I said don't do it. Did
                          you listen to me? No. You wanted the
                          money. So, I lent you twenty large.
                          Now it's been three weeks and you ain't
                          paid a dime. What do you think that
                          makes me look like on the street? I
                          don't do something to you and everyone
                          will think they can skate.

                                          VINNY
                          Frankie, I --

                                       ZAMMITO
                          -- Shut up! Don't you try to make me
                          feel bad about this. You knew what would
                          happen to you if you didn't pay. This
                          is on your head, not mine.
                               (to Joey and Nicky)
                          Break his arm.

               Vinny looks up at Zammito through pleading eyes.

                                       VINNY
                          Jesus, Frankie, I'm your brother!

               

                                                                          19.

               

                                       ZAMMITO
                          That's why we're only breaking one arm.

               

               INT. COFFEE SHOP -- LATER -- AFTERNOON

               The table is littered with plates.   Sophie has sketched out a
               diagram of a house on her napkin.

                                       SOPHIE
                          There's an exterior alarm system. There's
                          also another one in the hall that leads
                          to the bedroom with a motion detector.
                          The control panel is in the bedroom.

                                       JULIEN
                          I can handle the exterior alarm, but the
                          one in the bedroom is a problem.

                                       SAMI
                          After the outside alarm is off we go in
                          through the bedroom window.

                                       DANIEL
                               (impressed)
                          Good. Zero and Julien will go in through
                          the window and disable the motion
                          detector. The rest of us will come in
                          through the front door.

                                       JULIEN
                          What about transportation?

                                       SOPHIE
                          You can use my car.

                                       DANIEL
                          Not a good idea. Someone gets a license
                          number and it all leads back to you.
                          Raymond, you'll steal one.

                                        RAYMOND
                          No problem.

                                       SAMI
                          When do we go?

                                        SOPHIE
                          Tonight.

                                        DANIEL
                          Tonight?

                                       SOPHIE
                          I know they won't be home tonight.

                                       SAMI
                          You ever hear of jet lag?

               

                                                                         20.

               

                                           SOPHIE
                          Take a nap.

               

               EXT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- AFTERNOON

               As they crew and Sophie approach the door we hear the muted roar
               of loud MUSIC.

               

               INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- AFTERNOON

               As the enter the music is even louder. The bass pounds through
               the walls. Wayne seems oblivious to it as he sits on the couch
               smoking a joint.

                                       JULIEN
                          What the hell is that?

                                         WAYNE
                          Neighbors.    They do this all the time.

                                       SAMI
                          I can't even hear myself think.

                                       ZERO
                          How are we supposed to sleep with this
                          noise?

                                       SOPHIE
                          I've asked them a hundred times to keep
                          in down. They don't listen.

                                       RAYMOND
                          I will talk to them.

               Sophie and Wayne both find his offer amusing.

                                           WAYNE
                          Yeah.   Right.

                                       SOPHIE
                          Not a good idea.

                                       RAYMOND
                          It's just a matter of communication.

               Raymond leaves.

               

               EXT. SIDE OF WAREHOUSE -- AFTERNOON

               Raymond walks towards a door at the end of the building. The MUSIC
               grows louder. He KNOCKS on the door and waits. It is opened by a
               very large man... a biker type, leather jacket, full beard, several
               long earrings hanging from his ear. He is holding a BEER BOTTLE.
               Behind him are two other rough-looking men.

               

                                                                         21.

               

                                       RAYMOND
                               (cheerfully; loudly
                                over the music)
                          Hello. My name is Raymond. I am visiting
                          next door and I was wondering if you
                          could make your music a little less loud.

               The Biker takes a sip of his beer.

                                       BIKER
                          No.

                                       RAYMOND
                          But the music is very--

               Before Raymond can finish his sentence the Biker pours his beer
               over Raymond's head.

                                       BIKER
                          Fuck off!

               He slams the door in Raymond's face.

               

               INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER -- AFTERNOON

               The music continues to pound through the walls. A soggy Raymond
               steps into the room. He walks over to a chair and sits down, his
               head hung down, embarrassed. Marcel is angered by this. He glances
               over to Daniel who subtly nods to him. Marcel leaves the room.

               

               EXT. SIDE OF WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER -- AFTERNOON

               Marcel walks purposefully along the side of the building. He
               reaches into his jacket pocket and removes two black leather gloves.
               He slips them on as he approaches the door, then knocks. A beat.
               The Biker opens the door.

                                       BIKER
                          Listen asshole, I told you --

               Marcel head butts him, slamming his forehead into the bridge of
               his nose. The Biker clasps his hands over his bleeding nose.
               Marcel grabs him by the hair and rapidly punches him in face several
               times -- each punch backing the Biker into the room.

               

               INT. BIKER'S WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

               On the last punch the Biker falls backwards crashing through a
               large glass coffee table.

               BIKER #2 moves in behind Marcel and throws a hard punch as Marcel
               turns around. Marcel bends his head down, so that his attackers
               fists slams into the hard crown of his skull.

               BIKER #2 painfully grabs his broken knuckles. Marcel knees him
               hard in the groin. BIKER #2 turns to his side and doubles over.
               Marcel kicks the man into the back of his knee spinning him around
               and down on his knees.

               

                                                                          22.

               
               In a fluid movement he elbows the man in the back of head . BIKER
               #2 falls face forwards and is out cold.
               Marcel turns to the third BIKER who is standing by the stereo. He
               is smaller than the others and has seen enough. He quickly turns
               off the power. DEAD QUIET.

               

               INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER -- AFTERNOON

               Marcel enters.   Wayne is on the couch with Raymond.

                                       WAYNE
                               (impressed)
                          What'd you say to them?

                                          MARCEL
                               (dryly)
                          Nothing.

               

               EXT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- AFTERNOON

               A plain looking building in an old neighborhood of the city.

               

               INT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB - ZAMMITO'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

               Zammito sits at his desk. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake"
               sit on the couch. Bobby Beans balding, stocky enters.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Hey, Bobby beans... How you doin'?

               He walks up to Zammito and they kiss each other on the cheek.

                                      BOBBY BEANS
                          Good. I'm doing good. How you doin',
                          Frankie?

                                        ZAMMITO
                          Good.   I'm good.

                                       BOBBY BEANS
                          Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          When you return please extend my regards
                          to Mr. Maranzano and his family.

               Zammito motions for Bobby to sit down.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Can I offer you something.    A drink?
                          Coffee?

                                          BOBBY BEANS
                          No thank you.

               

                                                            23.

               

                            ZAMMITO
               You sure? I just got a shipment of
               espresso from Sicily. Special blend.
               Can't find anything like it in the States.

                             BOBBY BEANS
               I'm good.   Really.

                            ZAMMITO
               Okay. I understand you're interested in
               one of our properties?

                            BOBBY BEANS
               Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant
               Street. The volume on our import business
               has risen dramatically. The proceeds
               this quarter will be supernumerary due
               to the --

                            ZAMMITO
                    (overlapping)
               -- Super what?

                            BOBBY BEANS
               Supernumerary. It means better than
               expected.

                            ZAMMITO
               Then why not just fuckin' say better
               than expected? Everybody knows what
               better than expected means.

                            BOBBY BEANS
               I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance
               my communication skills.

                             ZAMMITO
               Okay.   How much?

                            BOBBY BEANS
               I'm not here to negotiate.

                            ZAMMITO
               Why are you here?

                            BOBBY BEANS
               To tell you that we're interested in the
               property.

                            ZAMMITO
               You told me that on the phone. What the
               hell are you doing here? Showing off
               your communication skills? Go back to
               your people and tell them when they're
               serious to put a number on the table.

                            BOBBY BEANS
               I will relay the particulars of our
               conversation to Mr. Maranzano.

               

                                                                         24.

               

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Yeah -- you do that.

               Bobby Beans leaves.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Jerk-wad!

               Zammito looks over at Joey and Nicky.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          How's my brother?

                                       NICKY "THE RAKE"
                          He's over at St. James. They had to put
                          two pins in his arm.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          I said a clean break.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Hey boss, it's not a science.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Send some flowers. Something nice.
                          Roses or carnations. And one of those
                          get well soon cards.

               Nicky gets up to carry out his instructions.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Oh and uh, send a case of steaks over to
                          his house. I don't want the kids to go
                          hungry while he's recuperating.

               

               INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- LATER -- AFTERNOON

               Julien and Zero are playing cards at the back of the room. Sami
               sitting by himself sorting through a BLACK CANVAS BAG filled with
               shoes. Sophie joins him. Sami pulls another pair of shoes out of
               the canvas bag.

                                       SOPHIE
                          You like shoes?

                                       SAMI
                          No, I like the bag. It would be good
                          for the job tonight.

                                       SOPHIE
                          It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left
                          it last time he was here. I'm sure he
                          wouldn't mind if you used it.

               Sami dumps the rest of the shoes out of the bag.

                                       SOPHIE
                          So, how did you get hooked up with these
                          guys?

               

                                                                           25.

               

                                       SAMI
                          Just lucky I guess. How'd you start
                          working for the Bastaldi's?

                                       SOPHIE
                          The art world doesn't fully appreciate
                          my talent yet. I needed some way to pay
                          the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well
                          for information.

                                       SAMI
                          So you arranged to have the people you
                          worked for robbed?

                                       SOPHIE
                          They're not nice people.

               She sees a TATTOO on Sami's arm.    It's a heart with someone's faded
               name.

                                       SOPHIE
                          I like your tattoo.

               Sami is suddenly self-conscious of it.    She traces along the letters
               with her finger.

                                       SOPHIE
                               (reading the name)
                          Casandra. Old girlfriend?

                                       SAMI
                          Something like that.

                                       SOPHIE
                          Did she break your heart?

                                       SAMI
                          Something like that.

                                          SOPHIE
                          It looks old.     Did you get it a long
                          time ago?

                                       SAMI
                          You ask a lot of questions.

                                       SOPHIE
                          That's how you get to know someone.       Did
                          it hurt when you got it?

                                       SAMI
                          I don't remember.    I was drunk.

                                       SOPHIE
                          You got it in a bar?

                                       SAMI
                          No. I got it in prison. I went in for
                          three years. When I came out she was
                          married to my best friend. Happy?

               

                                                                           26.

               

                                        SOPHIE
                          Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.

                                        SAMI
                          It's okay.   It was a long time ago.

                                       SOPHIE
                          I've been thinking about getting tattoo.
                          You know, a flower or something. On my
                          ass.

               Sami looks at her quizzically.

                                       SAMI
                          Who's gonna see it there?

                                       SOPHIE
                          The lucky ones.

               She smiles flirtatiously and walks away.

               

               EXT. LIQUOR STORE -- EVENING

               A car drives up. We can only see the outline of an old Chevy
               Impala. Two men get out of the car, leaving the engine running as
               they head for the liquor store.
               Across the street Raymond is checking out a Buick LaSabre, but
               stops when he sees the flashing alarm light on the dashboard. He
               looks across the street and sees the Impala.

               

               INT. LIQUOR STORE -- EVENING

               An OLD MAN is behind the counter.   Two masked men enter with guns
               and rush up to the counter.

                                       RAPHAEL
                          Gimme the money!

               The old man opens the cash register and hands him all the bills.

                                       RAPHAEL
                          Open the safe!

                                       OLD MAN
                          I don't have the combination.

               Raphael pistol whips him with his gun and drags him half way over
               the counter, then presses his gun to the old man's head.

                                        OLD MAN
                          I swear!   I don't have it!

               Raphael pushes him to the floor.    He runs out of the store with
               the others.

               

                                                                         27.

               

               EXT. LIQUOR STORE -- EVENING

               They run out and remove their masks. RAPHAEL RUIZ, 20's, Latin,
               tough, shaved head, neck covered with tattoos. HECTOR, Latin,
               small, cubby, stops and stares at something with confusion.

                                       HECTOR
                          Hey, Vato, where's your car?

               Raphael stops as he sees the street is empty.

                                          RAPHAEL
                          My car!

               Hector has to grab Raphael who is too stunned to move and drag him
               down the street.

               

               INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- EVENING

               The crew gets ready. On the table a variety of gear is laid out.
               Cells phones, electronic devices, all the tools of the trade.
               Sami throws some items into the black canvas bag. A cell phone
               rings. Julien answers it.

                                          JULIEN
                          It's Raymond.     He's outside with the
                          car.

               They grab their gear and head for the door. Sophie leans over and
               kisses Sami on the cheek. He stares at her, half surprised, half
               embarrassed.

                                          SOPHIE
                          For luck.

               

               EXT. STREET, SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT

               The crew steps out to find Raymond in the IMPALA. We can see it
               clearer now. It's a low rider car. Bright orange flames are
               painted on the side, wire wheels and chrome exhaust pipes.

                                       SAMI
                          I'm glad you didn't get something flashy.

                                          RAYMOND
                          Watch this.

               Raymond pushes a button and the hydraulics make the car bounce up
               and down. Sami rolls his eyes as the others get into the car.
               ACROSS THE STREET -- Lamar is standing in the shadows with one of
               his friends, watching.

               

               INT. IMPALA -- MOVING -- EVENING

               The six of them are crammed into the car as it moves down the
               street. Julien studies a map.

               

                                                                               28.

               

               INT.   RAPHAEL'S HOUSE -- EVENING

               Raphael sits on the couch. He can barely contain his anger. He
               looks up slowly, his jaw clenched. Hector sits across from him
               with a few other GANG BANGERS.

                                        HECTOR
                           Maybe you should call the police.

                                        RAPHAEL
                           Hey, idiot -- I've got stolen wheels and
                           a stolen radio in the car.

                                        HECTOR
                           I just thought that--

                                        RAPHAEL
                                (overlapping)
                           -- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good
                           at it.

               The other Gang Bangers laugh at Hector.

                                        RAPHAEL
                           Go do something -- get some beers for
                           the guys.

               Hector slinks out of the room.        Raphael's face hardens.

                                        RAPHAEL
                           When I find out who did this I'm going
                           to mount their head on my dashboard!

               

               INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT -- EVENING

               A family operation. Checkerboard table clothes. Candles burning
               in Chianti bottles. On the stereo VIC DAMONE sings "Angela Mia".
               Zammito waits at a table. His cell phone rings.

                                           ZAMMITO
                                   (into phone)
                           Yeah?

                                        HALF TOOTH TONY (V.O.)
                           Mr. B. wants to see you.

                                       ZAMMITO
                           Now? I've got a date with a drop dead
                           major babe.

                                        HALF TOOTH TONY (V.O.)
                           I'll tell him that.

               Zammito thinks it over.

                                          ZAMMITO
                           Okay.    I'm coming.

               He walks over to the MARIO, the OWNER of the restaurant.

               

                                                                         29.

               

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Mario, I gotta go. When my date arrives
                          tell her I had an emergency.

                                       MARIO
                          Of course, Mr. Zammito.

               

               EXT. WRIGLEY FIELD STADIUM -- NIGHT

               The Impala is stopped in the parking lot.

                                       RAYMOND (V.O.)
                          I think we went the wrong way.

                                       SAMI (V.O.)
                          Oh, you think?

                                       MARCEL (V.O.)
                          The map said to go left.

                                       JULIEN (V.O.)
                          Yeah and if you turned it around it would
                          say to go right.

                                          MARCEL (V.O.)
                               (amused)
                          Oh yeah.

               

               INT. BONANNO'S HOUSE, STUDY -- EVENING

               Zammito enters to find ANGELO BONANNO, 60's, powerful, head of the
               Chicago Mob. He is smoking a cigar with a glass of brandy.

                                       BONANNO
                          Frankie, come in. Good to see you.      You
                          want something?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          No, I'm good, Angelo.

               Bonanno motions to the couch.    Zammito sits down.

                                       BONANNO
                          I understand Bobby Beans came to see you
                          today.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Yeah. Seems Maranzano wants to talk
                          about buying the Merchant Street
                          warehouse.

                                          BONANNO
                          And?

                                          ZAMMITO
                          And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.

               

                                                                         30.

               

                                       BONANNO
                          He's trying to get a foot hold in our
                          territory.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          He sticks his toes in the water again,
                          we'll cut 'em off.

                                       BONANNO
                          Business must be good if he can afford
                          to buy up useless property.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          I heard this quarter his profits are
                          gonna be supernumerary.

               Bonanno stares at him.

                                       BONANNO
                          They're gonna be what?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Supernumerary. It means better than
                          expected.

                                         BONANNO
                          Good word.

               Half Tooth Tony, 30's, built like a tank step into the room. He
               has the face of a boxer, several of his teeth are chipped or broken.

                                       HALF TOOTH TONY
                          Mr. Bonanno, I just wanted to remind you
                          that you have an appointment in ten
                          minutes.

               Half Tooth Tony leaves.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Someone else coming?

                                       BONANNO
                          Nah, that's just Tony's way of telling
                          me Judge Judy starts in ten minutes.
                          You ever watch it?

                                         ZAMMITO
                          Uh, no --

                                       BONANNO
                          You should. You can learn a lot about
                          the criminal justice system on a program
                          like that. Very informative. Stay and
                          watch it with me.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          You know, I'm kind of tired. I'm just
                          gonna go home if it's all the same to
                          you.

               

                                                                         31.

               
               Bonanno affectionately slaps Zammito's cheeks.

                                        BONANNO
                          Go.   Rest.

               Bonanno takes a sip of his brandy, but his eyes stay on Zammito.

                                        BONANNO
                          Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about
                          your brother?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          He missed three weeks.

                                       BONANNO
                          Your own brother? You couldn't send
                          someone else to do it?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The
                          Rake" did the deed.

                                       BONANNO
                          But you were there?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Angelo, we live and die by the rules we
                          make. We are men of honor, but honor
                          without respect is a... horse-less
                          carriage.

               A long beat. Bonanno thinks about what he said, not sure what to
               make of it, then...

                                       BONANNO
                          What the fuck does that mean?

               

               EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

               The Impala is by the pumps. Sami leans out the window holding the
               map as he speaks with the station attendant.

               

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET -- NIGHT

               An upscale neighborhood. Expensive homes line the wooded street.
               The Impala stops and the crew gets out.

                                       DANIEL
                               (to Raymond)
                          Park on the next street over.   We'll
                          meet you when we're done.

               

               EXT. ZAMMITO'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Julien attaches a device to the alarm panel. A series of numbers
               flash by as the computer cracks the code. One by one, the numbers
               stop until the entry code is displayed on the screen. He enters
               the numbers on the alarm and nods to the others.

               

                                                                           32.

               
               Julien and Zero move around to the side of the house as Daniel,
               Sami and Marcel wait in the shadows.

               

               EXT. ZAMMITO'S HOUSE, SIDE OF HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Julien places a retractable ladder against the wall and climbs up.
               He pries open the window and climbs in. Zero follows.

               

               INT. ZAMMITO'S HOUSE, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               Dark. Julien makes his way to the door and repeats the process
               with another alarm panel. Zero sits on the corner of the bed and
               waits patiently. Julien turns off the hall alarm and nods to Zero.
               Zero speed dials a number on his cell phone.

                                       ZERO
                          We're in.

               

               EXT. ZAMMITO'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Daniel uses a locksmith tool and quickly pries the lock out of the
               door. They go inside.

               

               INT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               Julien and Zero wait for them. We hear a toilet flush. The door
               to the bathroom opens and a man steps out. In an instant Julien
               and Zero jump him. The others enter and quickly join in to subdue
               the man.

               

               EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

               Raymond waits in the Impala.    He can't resist using the hydraulics,
               raising the car up and down.

               

               INT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               The lights are on. The room is an interior designers nightmare.
               Clashing colors, zebra skin bedspread. We move along Daniel, Sami,
               Marcel, Julien and Zero as they stare at something.
               THEIR POV -- Tied to a chair, his mouth taped shut, is a very angry
               Frankie Zammito. He yells, his voice muffled by the tape, but
               it's not hard to understand what he's saying.

                                       DANIEL
                          So much for no one being home.

               Julien goes to a bookcase and finds the safe.

                                       JULIEN
                          At least they got this right.

               He removes his tools and goes to work. Sami stares at Zammito
               with vague recognition, then turns to the others.

               

                                                                            33.

               

                                       SAMI
                          We've got to be careful not to use our
                          real names while we're in here.

                                          DANIEL
                          Good idea.

                                       SAMI
                          I'll be Elvis and you--

                                       MARCEL
                               (overlapping)
                          -- I want to be Elvis.

                                          SAMI
                          It's my idea.

                                       MARCEL
                               (whining)
                          C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you
                          do.

                                        SAMI
                          Okay.   You can be Elvis.

               Marcel smiles happily.

                                       SAMI
                          And the rest of us are...    John, Paul,
                          George and Ringo.

               Marcel sees an autographed baseball on the book shelf.

                                       MARCEL
                          Hey, Barry Bonds. The home run king.

               Marcel tosses the ball into the black canvas bag.     Daniel stares
               at him.

                                       MARCEL
                          It's for my nephew.

               

               INT. HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET -- NIGHT

               A surveillance operation. Two FBI agents sit near the window.       A
               small card table is littered with coffee cups. SPECIAL AGENT
               AGENT HADLEY, 40's, a hardened field agent, picks up a pair of
               binoculars and looks out the window.

               HIS POV - THROUGH THE BINOCULARS:    of Zammito tied to the chair
               and surrounded by the others.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Looks like Zammito's being robbed.

                                       FBI AGENT
                          Should I call C.P.D.?

               

                                                                         34.

               

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Yeah, but tell them not to move until
                          these morons come out of the house.

               

               INT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               BLACK SCREEN. From inside the safe we see Julien open the door.
               Daniel and Julien look inside. There are a several stacks of cash,
               envelopes and a small cardboard box. Julien starts removing
               everything and puts it into the bag canvas bag.

                                       JULIEN
                          Where are the jewels?   There aren't any
                          jewels.

               Marcel looks as surprised as they are.

                                       MARCEL
                          There has to be.

                                       JULIEN
                          I'm telling you I've pulled out everything
                          in the safe. There aren't any jewels.

                                       MARCEL
                          There must be half a million dollars
                          here though.

                                       DANIEL
                          Marcel, we came here for jewels, remember?
               Sami moves closer to Zammito, studying his face. He moves over to
               the dresser where there are several photographs of Zammito with
               various famous people. Next to the photographs is a plaque that
               reads: TO FRANCIS ZAMMITO...

               We can see the color drain from Sami's face. He glances over at
               Zammito whose eyes are locked on his. Sami grabs Daniel and Marcel
               and pulls them aside.

                                        SAMI
                               (babbling nervously)
                          We have a problem. Problem isn't the
                          right word. Dilemma. No that really
                          doesn't describe --
                               (flatly)
                          Do you know who that is?

                                        MARCEL
                          Mr. Taylor?

                                       SAMI
                          No, that's not Mr. Taylor.

                                       DANIEL
                               (sensing something
                                bad is coming)
                          It's not?

               

                                                                             35.

               

                                       SAMI
                          That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss
                          of the Chicago Mafia.

                                       MARCEL
                               (confused)
                          Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?

                                       SAMI
                               (screaming)

                          WE'RE IN THE WRONG HOUSE, YOU FUCKIN'

                          IDIOT!

               A beat. The three of them turn and look at Zammito. The
               seriousness of the situation finally dawns on Marcel. He moves
               over to Zammito and rips the tape off his mouth.

                                       MARCEL
                          Mr. Zammito, there seems to have been a
                          big mistake here. May I use your phone?

                                         ZAMMITO
                          Feel free.

               Marcel picks up the cordless phone and dials.

               

                                                                  QUICK CUT TO:

               

               INT. BASTALDI'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

               Bastaldi removes a sleep mask and answers the phone.

                                         BASTALDI
                          Hello?

                               (in French)
                          It's Elvis...

                                         BASTALDI
                          Who?

                                       MARCEL (V.O.)
                               (in French)
                          It's me...

                                         BASTALDI
                          Marcel?

               

                                                                     CUT BACK TO:

               

               INT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               Marcel continues his conversation.

                                         MARCEL
                                 (in French)
                          Yes.

                                                                       36.

               
                                       MARCEL (Cont'd)
                          We went to the address we were given and
                          had to tie up the owner of the house who
                          turns out to be some Mafia guy.

                                       BASTALDI (V.O.)
                               (in French)
                          You're there now?

                                         MARCEL
                          Oui.

                                       BASTALDI
                               (in French)
                          You're calling me on your cell phone,
                          right?

                                         MARCEL
                          No.

                                       BASTALDI (V.O.)
                               (in French)
                          You're calling me on is phone?

                                         MARCEL
                          Oui.

                                       BASTALDI (V.O.)
                               (in French)
                          My number's going to show up on his bill!

                                       MARCEL
                               (In French)
                          Should I call you back?

               We can hear Bastaldi sigh over the line.

                                       BASTALDI (V.O.)
                               (in French)
                          You've already robbed the safe?

                                         MARCEL
                          Oui.

                          Take what you've got and get out of there.

               Bastaldi hangs up.   The line goes dead.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Walk out of here with nothing and I'll
                          forget this ever happened.

                                         SAMI
                          Yeah. Right.     You're not a vendetta
                          kind of guy.

               

                                                                            37.

                          I'll find you. No matter where you go
                          I'll find you.

                                       DANIEL
                          You don't carry the same weight in France
                          as you do here.

               Marcel whispers into Daniel's ear.

                                       MARCEL
                          You think it's smart to tell him we're
                          French?

                                       DANIEL
                          I think he's already figured that out.

               Zero who has been standing quietly by the window sees something
               across the street. A flash. Light reflecting off glass. He takes
               a pair of night vision binoculars out of one of the bags and looks
               out the window.
               ZERO'S POV -- of Agent Hadley and the other FBI Agent watching
               him.

                                       ZERO
                          We are being watched.
               Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.

                                          DANIEL
                          Cops?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          FBI. They've been there for months.
                          Think I don't know. Morons.

               Daniel closes the curtains. He tries to think. The crew huddles
               together in the corner, speaking softly so Zammito can't hear them.

                                       JULIEN
                          What do we do?

                                       MARCEL
                          I was told to take what we have and go.

                                        JULIEN
                          Go where?   The police are outside.

               Daniel looks at the others.

                                       DANIEL
                          If we do this we all have to agree.

               Marcel and Zero nod.   Daniel looks to Julien who appears indecisive.

                                          JULIEN
                          I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --

               

                                                                          38.

               

                                       SAMI
                          C'mon, get real, will you. You think
                          he's just going to forget about this?
                          These guys are all about respect. All
                          about honor. He's coming after us, so
                          we might as well take the money.

               Julien nods.   Sami walks over and grabs the black canvas bag.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          You're all dead.

               Zero grins then tapes his mouth closed again.

               

               EXT. BACK OF HOUSE -- NIGHT

               The crew goes out the back door and climb over a fence.

               

               EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

               The crew arrives to find Raymond still playing with the hydraulics
               of the Impala. They get in.

               

               EXT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT

               The Impala pulls into a driveway and goes to the rear of the
               building, out of view from the street.

               

               EXT. SOPHIE'S FRONT DOOR -- NIGHT

               The crew waits as the door is unlocked.   Wayne opens the door in a
               stoned haze.

               

               INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT

               The crew places their equipment on the table.

                                       SOPHIE (V.O.)
                          Wayne, who is it?

               She enters and appears surprised to see them.

                                       SOPHIE
                          I wasn't expecting you guys back so fast.
                          How'd it go?

               She quickly notices their angry expressions.

                                       SAMI
                          How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how
                          would you say it went?

                                       DANIEL
                          I would have to say... pretty fuckin'
                          bad. You gave us the wrong address
                          Sophie.

               

                                                                         39.

               

                                          SOPHIE
                          No, I didn't.

                                       JULIEN
                          Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?

                                          SOPHIE
                          Yes.

                                       JULIEN
                          And he gave it to us.    145 Ridgeway Road.

                                         SOPHIE
                          No.    145 Ridgeroad Way.

                                          DANIEL
                          That moron.

                                       MARCEL
                          It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway...
                          Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.

                                       DANIEL
                          Everyone get some sleep.    We're leaving
                          in the morning.

               

               INT. SURVEILLANCE HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Agent Hadley checks his watch.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          What the hell are they doing in there?

                                       FBI AGENT
                          Chicago P.D. says they can't hold the
                          units here any longer. They want to
                          know if they should go in?

               Agent Hadley thinks a moment.

                                          AGENT HADLEY
                          Tell them no.     We'll advise if anything
                          changes.

               

               INT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               Zammito is still tied to his chair.
               HIS POV -- of the cordless phone of his bed.
               He pushes with his feet, sliding the chair over to the bed, then
               starts rocking back and forth until he tips over forward, his face
               pressed against the mattress. Using his nose he turns on the phone
               and presses a speed dial number.

               

                                                                          40.

               

               INT. JOEY TWO TONS BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               Joey "Two Tons" is asleep in a sleeveless tee shirt. Next to him
               is his wife, her hair in curlers, her eyes covered by a black sleep
               mask. The phone rings. Joey answers it.

                                         JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Yeah?

               We hear Zammito's muffled cries for help. It almost sounds like
               someone moaning during a sexual act. Joey is surprised at first,
               then glances over at his wife to make sure she is asleep. He slides
               his hand under the covers and closes his eyes.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                               (quietly)
                          Hmmm.... Oh yeah... Uh huh

               

               INT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

               Zammito stops as he begins to realize what Joey is doing on the
               other end of the line. He grimaces, then shouts louder.

               

               INT. JOEY TWO TONS BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

               Joey is really going to town now as his hand moves slowly under
               the covers. We hear a loud scream on the phone.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          That's right baby, give it to papa Joey.

               He is really deep into his fantasy world when...

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS" WIFE
                          Joey, who is that?

               Joey sits up quickly.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                               (loudly; for his wife's
                                sake)
                          -- And don't call here again, you pervert.

               He slams the phone down. A long beat. It rings again. This time
               he checks his caller ID and sees that call is coming from Zammito's
               house.

                                         JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Yeah boss?

               Again we hear the same muffled cries.

                                         JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Boss?

               

               INT. BODY SHOP -- NIGHT

               Raphael enters with Hector and two GANG-BANGERS.   The room is filled
               with low rider cars.

               

                                                                            41.

               
               Working under the hood of a car is FELIX, 30's, sleazy. Raphael
               walks over and slams the hood down, pinning Felix's upper body and
               squishing his face between the hood and engine.

                                       RAPHAEL
                          Someone stole my car tonight!

                                       FELIX
                          C'mon Raphael, you don't think that I
                          would steal your car?

                                       RAPHAEL
                          You run a chop shop for low riders.
                          Yes, I think you'd steal my car.

               Raphael lifts up the hood and slams it down on Felix again.

                                       FELIX
                          I swear I didn't. I wouldn't!

                                       RAPHAEL
                          And I should just believe--

                                       HECTOR
                               (overlapping; to Felix)
                          -- you stole my cousin Enrique's car.

                                       RAPHAEL
                               (to Hector)
                          Hector, don't interrupt me.

                                       HECTOR
                          He told Enrique he didn't know anything
                          about his car.

                                       RAPHAEL
                          I don't give a shit about your cousin's
                          car. We're here about my car. So, shut
                          your mouth! You think you can do that?
                          You think you can keep your big mouth
                          shut?

               Hector is embarrassed as Raphael once again berates him in front
               of the others. Raphael picks up a pair of pliers of the workbench.
               He clamps them down on the tip of Felix's nose and squeezes.
               Felix's face fills with pain.

                                       RAPHAEL
                          If I find out you're lying. If I find
                          out you know anything about this I'm
                          going to come back and cut off your nose.

               He gives the pliers one last squeeze, then releases Felix.

                                       RAPHAEL
                               (to the others)
                          Vamos.

               

                                                                            42.

               

               INT. SURVEILLANCE HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Agent Hadley sips a cup of warm coffee.     He looks very concerned.

                                       FBI AGENT
                          Sir, do you think we could have a hostage
                          situation in there?

               Agent Hadley is about to answer when he sees something.
               HIS POV -- of a Lincoln Town Car pull up.    Joey "Two Tons" gets
               out, goes to the front door and enters.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Hold on a second. Joey "Two Tons" just
                          pulled up.

               

               INT. ZAMMITO'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               Joey enters to find Zammito tied to the chair, face down on the
               bed.

                                         JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Jesus, Boss!

               

               INT. ZAMMITO'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

               Zammito stands behind the bar pouring himself a large scotch.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          They were all French guys.

                                         JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          French guys?    You mean like from France?

                                       ZAMMITO
                               (with strained patience)
                          Yeah, French guys from France.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          What'd they take?

                                         ZAMMITO
                          Everything.

                                         JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Everything?

                                         ZAMMITO
                          Everything.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Boy, you must be pissed.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Well, you know, when five guys break
                          into my house in the middle of the night,
                          stick guns in my face, tie me up and
                          steal from me... it does irritate me.

               

                                                                         43.

               

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Well, I must say you're handling it very
                          well.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          You know why I'm handling it very well?
                          Because you're going to get these guys
                          for me.

                                        JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Okay boss.   Where are they?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          If I knew where they were you wouldn't
                          have to find them, would you?

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          You didn't say find them. You said,
                          "get them."

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Just find them!

                                         JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Okay boss.

               Zammito stares at Joey for a long beat, then...

                                         ZAMMITO
                          Papa Joey?

               Joey looks away, embarrassed.

               

               INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT

               Sami can't sleep. He walks over to the table and sorts through
               the canvas bag containing the contents of Zammito's safe. Inside
               a small cardboard box he finds several cassette tapes. He removes
               the box and walks to the stereo system on the floor, then inserts
               a tape into the cassette deck. A moment later Sophie enters.

                                         SOPHIE
                          Can't sleep?

                                         SAMI
                          No.

                                       SOPHIE
                          I'm sorry things went so wrong today.

                                       SAMI
                          It's not your fault.

               She notices the box of tapes.

                                       SOPHIE
                          What are you doing?

               

                                                                              44.

               

                                         SAMI
                            I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes.
                            See what's so important that a mob guy
                            has to lock it away in his safe.

                                         SOPHIE
                            Sounds boring.

                                         SAMI
                            It's three in the morning.    Not much
                            else to do.

               She grins seductively, then leans in towards him.

                                         SOPHIE
                            I can think of something.
               They kiss.

               

               INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MORNING

               Sami is asleep on the floor, curled up under several blankets. He
               wakes up and looks to his side expecting to find Sophie. She is
               not there. Sami looks around for her.
               Wayne is sitting on the couch preparing his morning joint.

                                         WAYNE
                            She's not here, man.

                                            SAMI
                            Where is she?

                                         WAYNE
                            I think she went to do some laundry.
                            Threw some stuff in a bag and left.

               It takes a moment for Sami to connect the thoughts.

                                            SAMI
                            Bag?
               Sami runs to the table.      The black canvas bag is gone.
               CLOSE ON DANIEL:    Asleep.    Sami shakes him.   He opens his eyes.

                                          SAMI
                            Get up.   We've been ripped off!

               

               INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER

               Daniel and Sami are with the crew. They are not a happy bunch.
               Wayne is smoking his joint, his eyes locked on the television.

                                         JULIEN
                            Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't
                            trust anyone these days.

               

                                                                          45.

               

                                       RAYMOND
                          She took everything!    Didn't even leave
                          us cab fare.

               A thought occurs to Sami.

                                       SAMI
                          Not everything.

               He removes the tape he put in the cassette deck last night before
               Sophie entered.

                                       SAMI
                          I was going to listen to it last night
                          but I --

               He realizes it may not be the time to tell them what happened.

                                       SAMI
                          -- feel asleep.

               Wayne blurts out a sloppy laugh.

                                       WAYNE
                          No you didn't, dude. You were bangin'
                          Sophie. I saw you guys going at it.

                                       DANIEL
                          You slept with her?

                                       SAMI
                          Well, actually I would say she slept
                          with me.

               Daniel stares at him angrily.

                                       SAMI
                          What's the big deal? It's not like I
                          was on guard duty or something.

                                       DANIEL
                          You didn't think it was little suspicious
                          that someone you only knew for a few
                          hours wanted to sleep with you?

                                        SAMI
                          No.   Chicks dig me.

               Daniel grabs the cassette and puts it in the player.   On the tape
               we hear a phone ringing.

                                        MAN'S VOICE
                          Hello?

                                       ZAMMITO'S VOICE
                          It's me. I need an answer from you if
                          I'm going to move.

               

                                                                         46.

               

                                       MAN'S VOICE
                          We're not just talkin' about a 'piece of
                          work' here. We're talking about a boss.

               Sami is the first to realize what he is hearing.

                                         SAMI
                          Holy shit.

                                         RAYMOND
                          What?

               Sami holds his hand signaling them to be quiet so he can hear the
               rest.

                                       ZAMMITO'S VOICE
                          Bonanno's a dinosaur. Guy thinks he's
                          fuckin' Vito Corleone or something. The
                          old ways are gone. If we don't change
                          now we're going to get pushed out. I
                          need to know if I can count on your
                          support?

               A pause on the line.

                                         MAN'S VOICE
                          Yeah.

               The line goes dead.    Sami leans back.

                                       SAMI
                          No wonder Zammito didn't want us to walk
                          out with this stuff. He's planning on
                          killing Bonanno and taking over the
                          family.

                                       JULIEN
                          This wasn't the deal! The deal was to
                          steal a necklace, not get in the middle
                          of a Mafia war.

                                       MARCEL
                          The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says
                          it is.

                                       DANIEL
                          You know, if you could get your nose out
                          of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you
                          might see what's going on around you.

                                       JULIEN
                          I knew this was a mistake! I knew it
                          last night when you asked me to go along
                          with this. I could hear that little
                          voice in my head saying, "don't do it!
                          Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I
                          ever listen to myself?

               

                                                                         47.

               

                                       SAMI
                          Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal
                          with that.

                                       MARCEL
                          What are you guys so scared of? Zammito
                          doesn't know who we are. We just get
                          out of town and it's over.

                                       ZERO
                          Oh, you think it's that easy?

                                        RAYMOND
                          Yeah.   We just go home.

                                        DANIEL
                          We can't.

                                       RAYMOND
                          I agree with Marcel. I say we go to the
                          airport and get on a plane.

                                       SAMI
                          They'll be waiting for us at the airport.

                                       DANIEL
                          You steal some money from a man he gets
                          over it in time. But these tapes. He's
                          never going to stop looking for us.

                                       SAMI
                          We have to find Sophie.

                                       RAYMOND
                          How are we going to do that?

                                       WAYNE
                          I know where she went.

               They all look over at him as he takes a huge hit off his joint.

                                       WAYNE
                          I heard her talking on the phone. Bay
                          View Motel. It's about five blocks from
                          here.

               

               EXT. STREET -- MORNING

               A beat up Ford Pinto sputters down the street, black smoke spewing
               from the tail pipe.

               

               INT. PINTO -- MOVING -- MORNING

               Raphael is at the wheel, his eyes scanning the street for his car.
               In the passenger seat Hector sits calmly. They come to a red light
               and stop.
               RAPHAEL'S POV -- Across the street is low rider car.

               

                                                                             48.

               
               Raphael stares at it as he thinks about his own car.
               ON HECTOR. We see the Impala pull up beside them.       Raymond is
               driving. Daniel, Sami and Zero are with him.
               Hector glances over and sees the Impala. Raymond smiles at him
               and nods. Hector slowly nods back. He looks over at Raphael who
               is still looking out the window.
               The light turns green. The Impala turns right.     Raphael looks
               over at a confused Hector.

                                       RAPHAEL
                          Tell me the truth Hector... do you think
                          we'll find my car?

                                         HECTOR
                          Hard to say.

               

               EXT. BAY VIEW MOTEL -- MORNING

               A motel like any other.   Sami stands outside the office with Daniel,
               Raymond and Zero.

                                       RAYMOND
                          How do we know what room she's in?

                                         SAMI
                          Wait here.

               

               INT. OFFICE -- BAY VIEW MOTEL -- MORNING

               Sami enters.   Behind the counter is the MOTEL CLERK, middle-aged,
               balding.

                                       SAMI
                          Hi. Did a woman just check in? She's
                          about five six. Pretty. Dark hair.

                                       MOTEL CLERK
                          I can't give out information on our
                          guests.

                                       SAMI
                          C'mon man, I think she's having an affair.

                                       MOTEL CLERK
                          So are half the people in this place.    I
                          can't help you, pal.

               Sami nods and walks outside. Through the window we see him talking
               with the others. A beat. Sami steps back inside with Zero.

                                       MOTEL CLERK
                          Look, I can't tell you --
               Before he can finish the sentence Zero has his gun out and wedged
               under the clerks jaw.

               

                                                                         49.

               

                                       MOTEL CLERK
                          Room fourteen.

                                          ZERO
                          Thank you.

               

               EXT. MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING

               Sami knocks. The others stand off to the side of the door. Sophie
               opens the door and sees Sami. Before she can slam it he pushes it
               open.

               

               INT. MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING

               Sami pushes her onto the bed.

                                       SAMI
                          I really thought we had something special
                          going. I can't tell you what a
                          disappointment you've turned out to be.

                                       SOPHIE
                          After last night I could say the same
                          for you.

               Sami feigns a smile. Zero checks the bathroom to make sure she is
               alone. He looks at Daniel and shake his head. Raymond finds the
               black canvas bag on the dresser and checks the contents.

                                       RAYMOND
                          The money isn't here.

                                       SAMI
                          Where is it, Sophie?

                                          SOPHIE
                          I don't know.

                                       DANIEL
                          If you think because you're a women this
                          can't go hard on you, think again.

               She stares at them defiantly.

                                       SAMI
                          Who are you waiting for?

                                       SOPHIE
                          Stick around and find out.

               

               INT. MOTEL ROOM -- LATER -- MORNING

               A knock on the door. Sami clamps his hand over Sophie's mouth
               just in case she gets any stupid ideas. Daniel opens the door.
               Agent Hadley steps in, stares at Daniel, then feels the barrel of
               Zero's gun pressed against his head.

               

                                                                            50.

               
               Hadley steps into the room. Daniel closes the door. Zero searches
               him. Finds a gun which he gives to Daniel, then a wallet. He
               opens it and sees his FBI identification.

                                          ZERO
                          He's FBI.

               Zero knowingly bends down and removes Hadley's backup gun which is
               strapped to his ankle. He gives the gun to Sami.

                                       RAYMOND
                          What is she doing with an agent du FBI?

               Sami looks at her -- at Hadley -- at the black canvas bag.    Slowly
               it starts to come together in his mind.

                                       SAMI
                          We've been set up.

               He stares at Sophie angrily.

                                       SAMI
                          We didn't go to the wrong house. We
                          went to right one, didn't we Sophie?

               Her expression gives away nothing.

                                       SAMI
                          They send us to Zammito's house. The
                          FBI is right across the street watching
                          the whole thing, but they don't move. A
                          crime is going down and they don't move.
                          Why?
                               (beat)
                          Because they were waiting for us to come
                          out so they could arrest us.

                                       ZERO
                          What does arresting us get them?

                                       SAMI
                               (to Hadley)
                          You wanna tell him?

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          You're telling it fine.

               Daniel motions to Zero.

                                       DANIEL
                          You see my friend over there? I nod to
                          him and he's going to put a bullet in
                          your knee.

               Zero stares at Hadley, just waiting for Daniel to give him the go
               ahead.

                                          AGENT HADLEY
                          You wouldn't.

               

                                                                         51.

               
               Daniel nods.   Zero aims his gun at Hadley's knee cap.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          That's going to make a lot of noise.
                          Not much time for a conversation after
                          you pull the trigger.

               They know he's right.

                                       SAMI
                          He's got a point.

               Sami lifts up a heavy brass lamp from the nightstand. He pulls
               the electrical cord out of the base, then touches two wires
               together. They spark. Before Hadley can say a word Sami touches
               them to his hand. Hadley's body jerks violent as he screams.
               Sami removes the wires. Hadley winces in pain from the burn mark
               on his hand.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Okay! Okay! We've been investigating
                          Zammito for years, but we've never had
                          enough evidence for a warrant to search
                          his house. We got word through a snitch
                          that Zammito was planning on taking
                          Bonanno out.

                                       DANIEL
                          We know all this.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          You just don't take out a boss. You
                          need permission from the other families
                          to do something like that. Our informant
                          told us that Zammito was talking with
                          other bosses and recording their
                          conversations in case they later claimed
                          they weren't involved. Look at these
                          tapes. The guy has recorded every
                          conversation he's had for years.

                                       DANIEL
                          So we rob Zammito. You arrest us when
                          we come out and the contents of the safe
                          is now evidence which you can use against
                          him.

               Agent Hadley nods.

                                       SAMI
                               (to Sophie)
                          What are you getting out of this?

               There is no point in hiding anything now.

                                      SOPHIE
                          Money. It was supposed to simple.    In
                          and out.

                                       SOPHIE (Cont'd)
                          Zammito wasn't supposed to be there.

               

                                                                   QUICK CUT TO:

               

               INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT -- LAST NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

               We see Zammito walk over to Mario.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Mario, I gotta go. When my date arrives
                          will you explain to her I had an
                          emergency.

                                       MARIO
                          Of course, Mr. Zammito.

               Zammito leaves. Through the window we see Joey "Two Tons" open
               the door to the car. Zammito and Joey get in and drive away. A
               beat. A Taxi pulls up. The front door opens and Sophie enters,
               all dressed up and beautiful. She walks up to Mario.

                                         SOPHIE
                          Hi.    I'm meeting Frankie Zammito --

               

                                                                    CUT BACK TO:

               

               INT. MOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

               Sami stares at her with contempt.

                                         SAMI
                          Why?

                                       SOPHIE
                          Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.

                                         DANIEL
                          For what?

                                        SOPHIE
                          Laurant and Vincent were in business
                          with Zammito.

                                       DANIEL
                          What kind of business?

                                       SOPHIE
                          Black market art. Zammito got to a few
                          key security guards at the Metropolitan
                          Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the
                          artists to make copies of famous works.
                          They'd switch the paintings, send the
                          originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's
                          would sell them to private collectors.

               

                                                                      53.

               

                                        AGENT HADLEY
                          We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet.
                          We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's
                          "Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week
                          with a copy. It was on loan from the
                          London National Gallery and they're not
                          going to be very happy when they find
                          out about it.

                                       SAMI
                          So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds
                          to trade up for his brother?

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito.
                          If we got what we wanted we'd let his
                          brother go providing he tells us where
                          the Van Gogh and the other paintings
                          are.

                                       RAYMOND
                          No one has mentioned the part of the
                          plan about us getting caught and going
                          to prison.

                                       DANIEL
                          We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.

                                        AGENT HADLEY
                          You walk out with that bag and you won't
                          only have Zammito and his people after
                          you. You'll have the entire United States
                          justice department. How far do you think
                          you'll get? I know who you are Mr. Foray?
                          Mr. Zerhouni. Mr. Gayet.
                                (looks at Zero)
                          Mr...

               Agent Hadley looks to Sophie.

                                        SOPHIE
                          Zero.   That's all I know.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          You'll never get out of the city.

               They move to the door.

               

               EXT. BAY VIEW MOTEL -- MORNING

               Daniel, Sami, Raymond and Zero walk to the Impala.

                                       DANIEL
                          Bastaldi's dead. He is fuckin' dead!

                                       ZERO
                          You want Zero to kill him?

               

                                                                         54.

               

                                       DANIEL
                          I'm going to kill him myself!

                                       ZERO
                          What about the money?

                                       SAMI
                          It has to be at Sophie's. She didn't
                          have time to go anywhere else before she
                          came here.

                                       ZERO
                          We don't know that for sure.

                                       DANIEL
                          Forget the money! We've got bigger
                          problems than the money right now.

                                       RAYMOND
                          She probably hid it at her place.    The
                          six of us could find it in --

                                       SAMI
                               (overlapping)
                          -- We don't have time to look for it.
                          Hadley's first move is going to be to
                          look for us there.

               Daniel dials a number on his cell phone.

                                       DANIEL
                          We're moving. Pack up and be on the
                          street in five minutes.

               

               INT. MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING

               Agent Hadley steps out of the bathroom, a towel wrapped around the
               burn on his hand.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          This is turning to shit. If word gets
                          out of my involvement in this I'll go to
                          prison.

                                       SOPHIE
                          Listen, we know their names. They don't
                          know the city. You'll find them. You're
                          the FBI.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          I can't bring the Bureau into this.    If
                          I do the tapes become evidence.

                                       SOPHIE
                          They're supposed to be evidence.    That's
                          why Bastaldi set this up.

               

                                                                           55.

               

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Fuck Bastaldi and his brother. These
                          tapes are gold. Do you have any idea
                          what Zammito would pay to get them back?

                                       SOPHIE
                          I thought you wanted Zammito?

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          What for? The minute I get him some
                          other Gavone will take his place. I've
                          been doing this for twenty years. When
                          I retire it's not going to be to some
                          trailer park in the suburbs.

               She likes the idea.   Already she's thinking how she can work her
               way into this.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Too many people know about my involvement
                          in this.

                                       SOPHIE
                          Then we just have to make sure everyone
                          who knows can't say anything.

               His jaw tightens.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          You're right about that.

               Hadley is standing behind her. He lifts up the brass lamp with
               his towel and swings down hard towards Sophie's head.

               

               EXT. STREET, SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MORNING

               Marcel, Julien and Wayne are waiting as the Impala drives up.
               Raymond hops out of the car.

                                       RAYMOND
                          I would like to thank you for your
                          hospitality.
                               (hands him a card)
                          If you are ever in Paris here is my
                          number.

                                        WAYNE
                          Cool.

               Marcel grabs Raymond and leads him back to the car.    Daniel sees
               Lamar standing across the street.

                                       DANIEL
                               (to the others)
                          I'll be right back.
               He gets out of the car and walks over to him.

               

                                                                       56.

               

                                       LAMAR
                          What do you want now?

                                        DANIEL
                          Guns.   Can you get them?

                                       LAMAR
                          Man, I can get anything.

                                       DANIEL
                          Don't bullshit me.

                                       LAMAR
                          I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns.
                          I can get any kind of gun you want. But
                          they ain't gonna help your sorry ass.
                          You ain't been in town one day and already
                          you got two of the toughest people in
                          Chicago looking for you. How is that
                          possible?

                                       DANIEL
                          I've got a way with people.

                                       LAMAR
                          I can see that. The man's car you stole.
                          Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th
                          Street gang and one crazy motherfucker.
                          And Frankie Zammito's got the word out
                          he's looking for some French dudes.
                          You're French ain't ya?

                                       DANIEL
                          I'm from Belgium.

                                       LAMAR
                          Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was
                          you. You know Zammito just put his own
                          brother in the hospital? Broke his arm
                          cause he was late on a debt. I mention
                          this to illustrate the kind of people
                          who are lookin' for you.

                                       DANIEL
                          Why haven't you turned us in?

                                       LAMAR
                          I ain't no rat.
                               (beat)
                          You got money, right?

               Daniel nods.

                                       LAMAR
                          And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you
                          a commission... kind of like a brokerage
                          fee.

               

                                                                           57.

               

                                          DANIEL
                          How much?

                                       LAMAR
                          A thousand dollars?

                                          DANIEL
                          Fine.

               Daniel hands him his cell phone.

                                       DANIEL
                          Take this. I'll call you in a few hours.
                          You tell me where we meet.

               

               INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- DAY

               Wayne is on the couch watching TV. There is a loud knock on the
               door. He opens the door to find Agent Hadley.

                                          WAYNE
                          Yeah?

               Hadley pushes past Wayne and enters.

                                       WAYNE
                          Hey dude, what do you think you're doing?

               Hadley flashes his badge.

                                       WAYNE
                          Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a
                          warrant or something?

                                        AGENT HADLEY
                          Not today.   Where are your friends?

                                       WAYNE
                          They left about a half hour ago.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Where did they go?

                                          WAYNE
                          I dunno.

               Hadley punches Wayne in the face.    Wayne falls to the floor.

                                       WAYNE
                          Hey man, you can't do that!

                                          AGENT HADLEY
                          What?   This?

               Agent Hadley kicks Wayne in the chest.

                                          AGENT HADLEY
                          Or this?

               Agent Hadley kicks Wayne in the ribs.

               

                                                                          58.

               

                                         WAYNE
                           Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?

                                        AGENT HADLEY
                           I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now,
                           if you don't want me to keep on hurting
                           you, it's important that I believe you
                           and right now I don't. So tell me, where
                           did they go?

                                        WAYNE
                           I swear man, I don't know. They packed
                           up and left a half hour ago.
                                (points to coffee
                                 table)
                           All I got is one of their phone numbers
                           in Paris.

               Hadley sees the phone number Raymond gave Wayne on the coffee table.
               He puts it in his pocket and stares at Wayne, then just for the
               hell of it gives him one last kick in the ribs.

               A MAID stops her cart in front of room fourteen.   She KNOCKS.

                           Maid service.

               No answer. She uses her key and steps into the room.   A beat.   We
               hear a loud scream.

               

               EXT.   HOLIDAY HOTEL -- EVENING

               A large building near the freeway.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- EVENING

               Raymond is on the phone.

                                        RAYMOND
                                (in French)
                           I know Mama, but I couldn't call you
                           yesterday we were very busy.
                                (listens)
                           No, nothing's more important than you.
                                (listens)
                           I don't know. I think I'm going to have
                           to stay a few more days.

               Daniel, Sami and Julien sit at a table. Marcel stares out the
               window sadly. Zero is flipping through the television channels.

                                        DANIEL
                                (to Marcel)
                           Did you know about Bastaldi's deal with
                           Zammito?

               

                                                                      59.

               

                                         MARCEL
                          No.

                                         DANIEL
                          You're sure?

                                       MARCEL
                          I think if he told me he was going to
                          steal Van Gogh's "Sunflowers in a vase"
                          I would remember it.

                                       SAMI
                               (correcting him)
                          "Vase with twelve Sunflowers."

                                       MARCEL
                          Whatever! He never told me about the
                          Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.

               Raymond hangs up the phone and joins the others.

                                       SAMI
                          It makes sense. I mean, do you really
                          think he would come along if he knew we
                          were being set up?

                                       DANIEL
                          I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi
                          told him to.

                                       MARCEL
                          Fuck you! You know I'd never go along
                          with something like this.

                                         DANIEL
                          Do I?

                                       MARCEL
                          This ain't about that and you know it.
                          This is about you never forgiving me for
                          leaving the crew.

                                       SAMI
                               (surprised)
                          You guys used to work together?

                                       MARCEL
                          Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried
                          to do something to better myself.

                                       DANIEL
                               (in French)
                          You call being Bastaldi's lap dog better?

                                       MARCEL
                               (in French)
                          Better than spending my life crawling
                          through windows in the middle of the
                          night.

                          All right, knock it off.

                                       DANIEL
                               (in French)
                          All you are is a professional ass-kisser.

                                        MARCEL
                                (in French)
                          I'm not a guy who is known for his
                          patience and right now you're testing
                          mine.

                                       DANIEL
                               (in French)
                          What is that a threat? Are you fuckin'
                          threatening me, Marcel?

               They take a step towards each other.   Sami steps in between them.

                                       SAMI
                          I said knock it off! Now as far as I'm
                          concerned you two girls can bitch slap
                          yourselves silly when this is over, but
                          right now we've got to figure out what's
                          going on.

                                       RAYMOND
                          It's simple. Bastaldi's moving up.
                          He's closing down his operation and this
                          is his way of saying thanks to all of
                          us.

                                       JULIEN
                          Well, I say the whole deal is off. In
                          fact, if you ask me, there never was a
                          deal because we were screwed from the
                          start.

               Zero turns to another channel. A news broadcast.     We see a mug
               shot photo of SAMI on the screen.

                                       ZERO

                                       JULIEN
                          That's brilliant! Care to elaborate?

               Sami gets into Julien's face.

                                       SAMI
                          You're not helping.

                                       RAYMOND
                          Julien, what you're doing right now is a
                          very normal psychological reaction to
                          stress. You're projecting your anger
                          onto us.

                                         JULIEN
                          Oh, Jesus.    We're dead.

               

                                                                           63.

               
               Julien walks away.    Daniel picks up the phone and dials a number.

               

               INT. LAMAR'S APARTMENT -- SAME TIME

               The cell phone Daniel gave him rings.      He answers it.

                                          LAMAR
                          Yeah?

                                          DANIEL (V.O.)
                          It's me.

                                       LAMAR
                          Hey you guys are becoming famous.      I was
                          just watching the news and--

                                       DANIEL (V.O.)
                               (overlapping)
                          -- Did you set it up?

                                       LAMAR
                          Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten
                          o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on
                          River Street. Oh, and due to your recent
                          notoriety and the heat that comes with
                          it, I'm going to have to increase my
                          brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.

                                       DANIEL (V.O.)
                          We had a deal.

                                       LAMAR
                          We had a deal before you and your friends
                          became the new poster boys for crime.

                                          DANIEL (V.O.)
                          Fine.     Ten o'clock.

               The line goes dead.    Lamar grins, happy with the money he's going
               to make.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- EVENING

               The others are looking at Daniel.

                                       DANIEL
                          Sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from
                          someone who looks like one of us.

                                          JULIEN
                          What for?

                                       DANIEL
                          We need to rent a car and for that you
                          need a credit card.

                                       RAYMOND
                          Why not just steal another one?

               

                                                                         64.

               

                                       DANIEL
                          Too risky. We don't need to get pulled
                          over because of a stolen car.

                                       JULIEN
                          Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why
                          aren't we leaving town? Any place has
                          to be safer for us than Chicago.

                                       SAMI
                          It doesn't matter where we go. Between
                          Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We
                          have to end this here.

                                       ZERO
                          And how do we do that?

                                          SAMI
                          I don't know.

                                       JULIEN
                          That's an excellent plan.     Very
                          comforting.

                                       DANIEL
                          We'll think of something.

               

               EXT. BONANNO HOUSE -- MORNING

               A Lincoln Town Car drives up. Zammito gets out with Joey "Two
               Tons" and Nicky "The Rake. They wait outside. Zammito enters.

               

               INT. BONANNO'S HOUSE, STUDY -- MORNING

               Bonanno is behind his desk. Half Tooth Tony sits on the couch.
               Zammito enters. Bonanno walks around his desk and hugs Zammito.

                                       BONANNO
                          Why didn't you tell me about this?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          You have enough to worry about, Angelo.
                          You don't need my problems.

               Bonanno places his hands on Zammito's cheeks and presses them
               together.

                                          BONANNO
                          We're family.     An insult to you is an
                          insult to me.

               Bonanno releases him.

                                       BONANNO
                          They knew who you were when they broke
                          in your house?

                                          ZAMMITO
                          Yes.

               

                                                                         65.

               

                                       BONANNO
                          What is happening with the world? There
                          was a time no civilian would touch a
                          made man. Now every babbo in the world
                          thinks he can get away with something.
                          What did they take?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Some cash. Jewelry. The other stuff I
                          can replace, but there's a cardboard
                          box... photos of my mother. They're the
                          only ones I have of her.

                                       BONANNO
                          We're doing everything we can to find
                          these people. Right Tony?

                                       HALF TOOTH TONY
                          We've reached out to everyone we know.

                                       BONANNO
                          If they're still stupid enough to be in
                          this city, Tony will find them.

               

               EXT. BONANNO HOUSE -- MORNING

               Zammito steps out onto the street. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The
               Rake" are pitching pennies against the wall. They start arguing
               about something.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Frankie, come here a second.

               Zammito walks over.

                                       NICKY "THE RAKE"
                          Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?

                                       ZAMMITO
                               (impatiently)
                          Get in the car.

                                       NICKY "THE RAKE"
                          Just tell me who's closer to the wall?

               Zammito grabs him by the neck and smashes his face into the wall.

                                        ZAMMITO
                          You are!   Now get in the fuckin' car!

               Both men walk to the car. Zammito starts after them, then stops.
               He turns back, picks up the coins and puts them in his pocket.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL -- LOBBY -- MORNING

               Sami moves through a crowd of PEOPLE. He looks around until he
               sees a man who looks remarkably similar to Raymond. Sami bumps
               into him and lifts his wallet.

               

                                                                            66.

               

               INT. STEREO STORE -- MORNING

               Marcel waits as a SALESPERSON brings over several boxes of
               electronic equipment.

               

               EXT. LUGGAGE SHOP -- MORNING

               Sami passes the shop. He stops. In the window is BLACK CANVAS
               BAG that is identical to the one that they used on the job. He
               goes into the store.

               

               EXT. BARCLAY HOTEL -- MORNING

               An old building that has seen better days.   Daniel and Zero get
               out of a Taxi and go inside.

               

               INT. HALLWAY -- BARCLAY HOTEL -- MORNING

               Looks even worse on the inside. A dark corridor is lit by bare
               light bulbs hanging from the ceiling. An old PROSTITUTE walks
               past them, her smile signaling she is open for business. They
               arrive at room 211 and knock. The door is opened by a very large
               BLACK MAN. Behind him we can see Lamar with ELLWOOD, 20's, sun
               glasses, his neck draped in gold chains.

                                       BLACK GUY
                               (very loud)
                          I'm gonna have to search you.

                                       DANIEL
                          We'll save you the trouble.

               Daniel pulls back his jacket to reveal the gun he took from Hadley
               in his waistband.

                                        BLACK GUY
                               (loudly)
                          You can't come in here with that.

               Daniel looks past him to Ellwood.

                                       DANIEL
                          What's wrong with this guy?

                                       ELLWOOD
                          He's my cousin. He's deaf.

               Daniel removes an envelope full of cash.

                                        DANIEL
                          We're here to buy, not steal. If you
                          guys are straight there's not going to
                          be a problem.

               Ellwood stomps his foot several times on the floor.   The black guy
               feels the vibration and turns around.

                                         ELLWOOD
                          Let them in.

               

                                                                          67.

               
               The black guy steps aside.   Daniel and Zero enter.

               

               INT. BARCLAY HOTEL ROOM -- MORNING

               Ellwood is sitting on the bed behind several open suitcases
               displaying a variety of weapons.

                                       ELLWOOD
                          What can I do you for?

               Daniel looks over the merchandise.

                                       DANIEL
                          How much for the nines?

                                       ELLWOOD
                          A grand a piece.

                                       DANIEL
                          I'll need extra clips and ammo.

               Daniel starts counting out the money. Ellwood points a .357 magnum
               he's been holding behind the open suitcase at them.

                                       LAMAR
                          What the hell you doing, Ellwood?   I
                          gave them my word.

                                       ELLWOOD
                          Zammito's offering twenty grand a head
                          for these guys. You think I'm going to
                          settle for four G's when I can make forty?
                               (to Daniel)
                          All right. Reach in easy and put the
                          gun on the floor.

               Daniel slowly grabs his gun and places it on the floor, then kicks
               it under the bed.

                                       ELLWOOD
                          I said put it on the floor, not kick it
                          under the bed.

               Ellwood speaks to his cousin, speaking slowly and enunciating each
               word so he can read his lips.

                                       ELLWOOD
                          Get that and add it to my inventory.

               The black guy get on his hands and knees and starts looking for
               the gun under the bed. As he does Daniel glances over at Zero
               with a look. Ellwood aims his gun at Zero.

                                       ELLWOOD
                          I assume you're carrying too?

               Zero opens his coat and reveals his .9mm.

               

                                                                         68.

               

                                       ELLWOOD
                          Okay, put it on the floor... and do not
                          kick it under the fuckin' bed.

                                             ZERO
                                  (flatly)
                          No.

               He stares at Ellwood calmly through dead, flat eyes.

                                       ELLWOOD
                          No? Did you just say no? Listen cowboy,
                          if you're thinking about makin' a move,
                          don't. Nobody is that fast.

                                             ZERO
                          Zero is.

                                             ELLWOOD
                          Who's Zero?

                                             LAMAR
                          He is.

               Ellwood is confused. Daniel bolts to his left. Ellwood's eyes
               leave Lamar for a moment -- it's a moment too long. In a blur of
               movement Zero has his gun out and fires one shot into Ellwood's
               forehead.

               Ellwood slumps down on the bed, dead. The black guy who has heard
               nothing continues searching under the bed. Zero casually picks up
               the suitcase filled with guns and hands it to Daniel. They walk
               out of the room. Lamar stands there, stunned, then quickly runs
               after them.

               A beat. The black guy pops up with Daniel's gun oblivious to what
               has transpired in the room.

                                             BLACK GUY
                          Found it!

               

               EXT. BARCLAY HOTEL -- MORNING

               Daniel pushes Lamar out the door. Zero steps out behind him. He
               stares at Lamar for a long moment, then hands him the envelope.

                                       DANIEL
                          There's ten grand in here. It's yours.
                          I'm going to call you again. There's
                          one more thing I need you to do.

                                             LAMAR
                          What?

                                       DANIEL
                          I'll tell you when it's time.

               In the background we hear the loud, agonizing scream from the black
               guy as he finds Ellwood's body.

               

                                                                          69.

               

               INT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY -- DAY

               Raymond and Julien approach the counter.   Raymond is nervous.

                                       RAYMOND
                               (in French)
                          I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not
                          a good liar.

                                       JULIEN
                               (in French)
                          Relax. It will be fine.

               They arrive at the counter. The RENTAL AGENT, a man in his 30's
               looks up at them with a smile.

                                       CAR RENTAL AGENT
                          Hello.

                                       RAYMOND
                          Hello. I am Robert M. Carney from Dayton,
                          Ohio and I would like to rent a car with
                          my visa gold card.

               Raymond smiles, a big, friendly, completely over exaggerated smile.
               Julien looks at him and rolls his eyes. The Rental Agent walks
               down to the end of the counter and dials a number on the phone.

                                       CAR RENTAL AGENT
                               (into phone)
                          I got a couple French guys here trying
                          to rent a car.
                               (listens)
                          Sure. I can stall them.

               

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

               Vinny is in bed, his arm in a cast and sling. His wife ANGIE,
               30's, big hair, loud clothes. She sits on the bed feeding him.
               His two kids, RICHIE, 8, and TOMMY 10, sit off to the side. Zammito
               enters.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Angie, how you doin'?

               She kisses him. Vinny stares blankly at his brother. Zammito
               takes a step back, looks her up and down. He lays on the charm.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Hey, you're looking good. There's
                          something different about you. You get
                          a boob job or something?

                                       ANGIE
                          I've gained weight.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Yeah, well, it suits you.

               

                                                                          70.

               
               Zammito moves over to the kids and offers a quick hello.

                                         ZAMMITO
                          Hey Tommy.

                                         RICHIE
                          I'm Richie.    He's Tommy.

                                         ZAMMITO
                          Whatever.

               Zammito pulls out a roll of bills that could choke a horse and
               peels one off.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Angie, take the kids down to the gift
                          shop and buy 'em something. I need a
                          word with Vinny.

               Angie looks at the money.

                                        ANGIE
                               (flatly)
                          Gee, five bucks. What ever shall we
                          buy?

               She takes the kids and leaves.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          She seems pleasant enough.

                                       VINNY
                          She doesn't know. She thinks I fell
                          down the stairs.

                                         ZAMMITO
                          That's good.    That's what a stand-up guy
                          does.

               Zammito sits on the edge of the bed.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          So, I just come by to see how you're
                          doin'?

                                       VINNY
                          You broke my arm. How the hell do you
                          think I'm doin'?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Yeah. I mean besides that.    They treating
                          you all right? Food okay?

                                       VINNY
                          Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do
                          you want, Frankie?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          I don't want anything.

                                                                           71.

               
                                       ZAMMITO (Cont'd)
                          I just wanted to say... that I may have...
                          overreacted a little the other day.

                                          VINNY
                          A little?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Yeah. I mean, you are my brother and...
                          well I should have found another way of
                          expressing my disappointment. So, I've
                          decided to make it up to you.

                                       VINNY
                          You gonna forget about the money I owe
                          you?

                                       ZAMMITO
                          What are you nuts? A debt is a debt. I
                          was thinking I'd throw a little extra
                          work your way. You know, you come down
                          to the club, make espresso for the boys...
                          wash their cars... run some errands...
                          things like that.

               Zammito's cell phone rings.

                                          ZAMMITO
                                  (into phone)
                          Yeah?
                               (his face hardens)
                          I'm on my way.

               Zammito hangs up.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          I got something I gotta do. I'm glad we
                          had this talk. Heal. Get better. Let
                          me know when you're ready to start.

               Zammito leaves.    Vinny can only shake his head in bewilderment.

               

               EXT. TATTOO SHOP -- DAY

               Several low-rider cars are parked on the street.    Raphael and Hector
               are with several GANG MEMBERS.

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- DAY

               Sami is recording something on a tape deck Marcel bough. He sees
               Marcel outside on the balcony and removes a piece of paper from
               his pocket, then picks up the phone and dials.

                                          AGENT HADLEY (V.O.)
                          Agent Hadley.

                          Do you know who this is?

                                        AGENT HADLEY (V.O.)
                          Yeah.   I figured I'd be hearing from
                          you.

                                       SAMI

                          meet me in one hour at Grant Park near
                          the statue.

               

               INT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY -- DAY

               The Rental Agent walks back over to Raymond and Julien.

                                       CAR RENTAL AGENT
                          I'm sorry about the wait. There was a
                          problem with the equipment.

                                       JULIEN
                          Everything okay now?

               The Rental Agent's eyes drift to a black Lincoln Town Car parked
               across the street.

                                       CAR RENTAL AGENT
                          Everything's fine.

               

               EXT. STREET, ACROSS FROM CAR RENTAL AGENCY -- DAY

               A Lincoln pulls up. Zammito gets out and walks over to three
               WISEGUYS in another Town Car. One of the Wiseguys points to the
               window of the rental agency. Zammito looks at Raymond and Julien.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          I don't know the little one, but the
                          other guy is definitely one of them.
                          Follow them and call me when you find
                          out where they go.

               Zammito walks back to his car and drives off.

               

                                                                          73.

               

               EXT. CAR RENTAL LOT -- DAY

               An EMPLOYEE drives up in a CADILLAC DE VILLE.   He gets out and
               Julien grabs the keys from him.

                                       JULIEN
                               (in French)
                          I'll drive.

                                       RAYMOND
                               (in French)
                          I'm the driver.

                                       JULIEN
                               (in French)
                          I've never driven a Cadillac before.

               Raymond nods and gets in the passenger seat.

               

               EXT. STREET -- DAY

               The Cadillac moves down the street.   The Lincoln follows a few
               cars behind them.

               

               INT. CADILLAC -- MOVING -- DAY

               Julien drives the car.

                                       JULIEN
                               (in French)
                          This is a car. I think this is the best
                          American car I've ever driven.

                                       RAYMOND
                               (in French)
                          This is the only American car you've
                          ever driven.

               

               EXT. GRANT PARK -- DAY

               Agent Hadley walks towards the statue wearing a pair of sun glasses.
               As he approaches, Sami steps out.

                                       SAMI
                          You set me up, you piece of shit!

               Hadley pushes him up against the statue and starts frisking him.

                                       SAMI
                          What are you doing?

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          You think I'm going to talk to you until
                          I know if you're wired.

                                         SAMI
                          Wired?    I ain't wired.

               

                                                                          74.

               
               Sami lifts up his shirt showing Hadley his bare chest.   He drops
               his pants down to his ankles.

                                          AGENT HADLEY
                          Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.

                                       SAMI
                          You killed her!

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          No. You killed her. Manager remembers
                          you going into her room. Your
                          fingerprints were found all over the
                          place.

                                        SAMI
                          Bullshit! She was alive when we left
                          her with you.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's
                          why you're here.

                                       SAMI
                          Look, I just want out of this nightmare.
                          I don't know these guys. A few days ago
                          I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm
                          America's most wanted.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Where are the tapes?

                                       SAMI
                          I can get them -- but what do I get if I
                          do?

                                          AGENT HADLEY
                          A pass.

                                       SAMI
                          A pass? How you gonna give me a pass?
                          A witness can put me at the crime scene.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Witness' can be convinced they made a
                          mistake. Without the murder weapon the
                          D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.

                                       SAMI
                          They don't have a murder weapon?

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          No. I have it. The lamp? The one with
                          your fingerprints and her blood on it?
                               (holds up his burned
                                hand)
                          Remember?

               

                                                                            75.

               
               Sami is stunned, then his thoughts snap back to...

               

                                                                        CUT TO:

               

               INT. BAY VIEW MOTEL ROOM -- MORNING (FLASHBACK)

               Sami picking up the brass lamp off the nightstand and leaving his
               fingerprints all over it.

               

                                                                    CUT BACK TO:

               

               EXT. GRANT PARK -- DAY

               Sami stares angrily at Hadley who appears to be enjoying his
               frustration.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Of course they could always get an
                          anonymous tip. Find it in the dumpster
                          behind the motel.

               Sami stares at him a long moment.

                                       SAMI
                          You want the tapes for yourself.     You're
                          going to sell them.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          I'm going to retire with a shit-load of
                          money. Find me a small country that
                          doesn't have an extradition treaty with
                          the States and live the good life.

                                       SAMI
                          You didn't have to kill Sophie.

                                         AGENT HADLEY
                          Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.

                                       SAMI
                          What about me? Aren't I a loose end?

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          When this is over you can say whatever
                          the hell you want. I'll be long gone.
                          Besides, who's going to believe you?
                          You're just a two-bit crook.

                                       SAMI
                          And you're a dirty cop. At least I don't
                          pretend to be something different than
                          what I am.

               Hadley hands him a card.

               

                                                                           76.

               

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          When you've got the tapes call me on
                          this number. We'll make the exchange
                          and that'll be the end of it.

               Hadley leaves.

               

               EXT. GRAND AVENUE -- DAY

               Julien drives the Cadillac along the North River.   The Lincoln
               keeps pace with them several cars behind.

               

               INT. CADILLAC -- MOVING -- DAY

               Raymond clicks through a few Radio Stations.   Julien glances in
               his rear view mirror.
               HIS POV - IN THE MIRROR:   of the Lincoln several cars back.
               Julien seems concerned.    He turns the steering wheel hard to the
               right.

               

               EXT. GRAND AVENUE -- DAY

               The Cadillac cuts across the right lane almost hitting a car and
               turns onto another street. The Lincoln makes a sharp move to stay
               up with it.

               

               INT. CADILLAC -- DAY

               Raymond looks over at Julien.

                                       JULIEN
                               (in French)
                          We're being followed.

               Julien hits the gas.

               

               EXT. WELL STREET -- DAY

               The Cadillac speeds down the street, weaving in and out of traffic.
               The Lincoln does the same. The Cadillac reaches an intersection.
               The traffic ahead of them is stopped for a red light. The Cadillac
               veers onto the sidewalk. Pedestrians jump out of the way and the
               car streaks down the pavement. Behind the Lincoln follows.

               

               EXT. OHIO STREET -- DAY

               The Cadillac screeches around the corner, onto a ONE WAY STREET.

               

               INT. CADILLAC -- MOVING -- DAY

               Julien concentrates as he weaves the car in and out of the on coming
               traffic.

               

                                                                          77.

               

                                       RAYMOND
                               (in French)
                          I knew I should have driven.

                                       JULIEN
                               (in French)
                          Stop talking. I'm trying to concentrate.

               

               EXT. STREET -- DAY

               The oncoming traffic veers off. Cars collide. The Lincoln clips
               a car, loses control for a moment, then continues after them. At
               the corner the Cadillac turns onto another street and joins traffic
               in the right direction.

               

               EXT. FRANKLIN STREET -- DAY

               The Lincoln moves up along side the Cadillac. Two WISEGUYS lean
               out the window with guns in their hands. The Cadillac veers away
               just as they start shooting. Bullets riddle the car.

               

               INT. CADILLAC -- MOVING -- DAY

               Raymond removes Hadley's backup gun. The Lincoln pulls up beside
               them again. The sound of GUN FIRE fills the air as Raymond shoots
               from the Cadillac. The rear passenger window of the Lincoln
               shatters and Raymond fires. The Lincoln drops back.

               

               EXT. HUBBARD STREET -- DAY

               The Cadillac turns the corner. The Lincoln follows. The traffic
               is heavier here. The cars have to slow down. The Lincoln moves
               beside them again. Raymond fires his last shot. His gun his now
               empty. Several rounds of gun fire come from the Lincoln.

               

               INT. CADILLAC -- MOVING -- DAY

               Raymond looks over to Julien.

                                       RAYMOND
                               (in French)
                          What are we going to --
               His voice trails off as he sees Julien. A bullet has glanced his
               neck, not deep, but deep enough to sever an artery. Blood pours
               down his neck and covers his shirt. His face is pale. He glances
               at the wound in the rear view mirror.

               

               EXT. STREET -- DAY

               Julien steers the caddy onto another street.   The towncar follows.

               

               INT. CADILLAC -- MOVING -- DAY

               Julien looks at Raymond. He is paler now, his shirt completely
               covered with blood. He strains to stay conscious.

               

                                                                           78.

               

                                       JULIEN
                               (in French)
                          When we get to the next corner jump out.

                                       RAYMOND
                               (in French)
                          I'm not going to leave you.

                                       JULIEN
                               (in French)
                          We both know I'm already dead.

               Raymond knows he's right.   The car races into the next turn.

                                        JULIEN
                                (in French)
                          Go!
               Raymond opens the door.
               He jumps out.

               

               INT. LINCOLN - DRIVER'S POV -- DAY

               Of Raymond as he rolls towards the curb.    The Caddy skids around
               the corner.

               

               EXT. STREET -- DAY

               The Lincoln slams on it's brakes in the middle of an intersection.
               Raymond is dazed from his fall. He gets up slowly, his pants torn
               and sees..

               

               P.O.V. RAYMOND OF THE TOWNCAR -- DAY
               The driver is reaching out the window with his gun to take aim and
               is just about to shoot when...

               

               EXT. STREET -- DAY

               Julien comes racing into the intersection full speed and smashes
               into the Lincoln. The impact sends the Lincoln spinning around.
               When it stops the driver's window is facing the front of the caddy.
               The driver of the caddy takes aim and fires.   The bullet goes
               through the windshield and kills Julien.
               The driver looks over at the passenger just in time to see...

               

               P.O.V. A LARGE TRUCK -- DAY
               Speeds through the intersection and smashes head on into the
               Lincoln. It crumbles like a toy under the weight.

               

                                                                          79.

               

               EXT. STREET -- DAY

               Raymond limps into the street oblivious to the oncoming traffic.
               He stares sadly at Julien.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- AFTERNOON

               Zero and Marcel are checking over the guns. Daniel writes some
               notes on a pad of paper. Sami appears nervous as he sits off to
               the side.
               The door opens. Raymond limps into the room. His face is dirty,
               bruised, his pants torn, legs scraped. He stands there, staring
               at them through empty eyes.
               Daniel looks at the door expectantly.   He knows the answer before
               he asks the question.

                                         DANIEL
                          Julien?
               Raymond's face fills with sadness.   He shakes his.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE-- LATER -- DUSK

               There is a cold silence in the room. Daniel stares at the sliding
               glass door, staring out over the city.

                                       SAMI
                          It's not your fault, Daniel.

                                         DANIEL
                          No?

               He looks at them sadly.

                                       DANIEL
                          We had a chance to walk out of Zammito's
                          house.

                                       MARCEL
                          We all agreed to it. You had no way of
                          knowing Bastaldi was setting us up.

                                       DANIEL
                          I just want to live long enough to get
                          back to Paris. Just long enough to kill
                          Bastaldi.

                                       SAMI
                          I say we make him pay first. After that
                          you can do whatever you want to him.

                                       RAYMOND
                          He's right. Do you have any idea what
                          Van Gogh's "Vase with twelve Sunflowers"
                          is worth?

               

                                                                         80.

               

                                        MARCEL
                          No.   How much?

                                          RAYMOND
                          I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.

                                       DANIEL
                          We still have to get out of here.

                                       MARCEL
                          Maybe if we gave the tapes back --

                                        ZERO
                                (strongly)
                          No.

               Everyone looks to Zero.

                                       ZERO
                          They killed our friend. It's personal
                          now. Besides, if we do that, then Julien
                          died for nothing. The tapes are the
                          key.

                                       SAMI
                          He's right. The tapes give us leverage
                          with Bastaldi.

               

               INT. AGENT HADLEY'S APARTMENT -- EVENING

               Agent Hadley sits on his couch, deep in thought. He glances at
               the paper with Raymond's phone number on the coffee table. A beat.
               He gets an idea. He picks up his phone and dials.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Hello? Mrs. Gayet? Do you speak English?
                               (listens)
                          You do. Great.
                               (listens)
                          Oh, you taught Raymond English. You did
                          a wonderful job. I'm sorry to call so
                          late but I'm supposed to meet Raymond --
                               (listens)
                          No, I didn't know he was a difficult
                          child. Mrs. Gayet, I'm calling because --
                               (listens)
                          No, I don't have any children of my own.
                          I'm supposed to meet Raymond tonight at
                          his hotel and I forgot what Hotel he is
                          at. I wondering if you --
                               (listens)
                          The Holiday Hotel. Room 912. Thank you
                          very much.

               

               EXT. HUBBARD STREET -- EVENING

               Tow trucks and cleaning crews work around wreckage of the cars.
               Only a few POLICE CARS are there.

               

                                                                          81.

               
               A UNIFORMED COP looks over and sees Joey "Two Tons" on the sidewalk.
               Joey motions with his head to an alley.

               

               EXT. ALLEY -- EVENING

               The Uniformed Cop enters the alley and joins Joey.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          What'd you guys find?

                                       UNIFORMED COP
                          Dead bodies. The ones in the Lincoln
                          are your... associates.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          And the other car?

                                       UNIFORMED COP
                          Some French guy. At least that's what
                          his passport said. You know Joey, I
                          shouldn't be talking to you about this.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Are you forgetting who supplements your
                          income?

                                       UNIFORMED COP
                          No. It's just that the French guy had a
                          gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is
                          a homicide. Are you guys involved in
                          this?

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Yeah. I'll come down and make a full
                          confession later. Right now, tell me
                          what else you found?

                                         UNIFORMED COP
                          A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.

               This sparks Joey's interest.

                                          JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          What hotel?

                                       UNIFORMED COP
                          The Holiday Hotel.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          What room number?

                                          UNIFORMED COP
                          I don't know.     I didn't look.

                                          JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          Go look.

               

                                                                           82.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- EVENING

               The crew sits around a table trying to figure out how they can get
               out of town.

                                       DANIEL
                          Okay. Airports, train stations, bus
                          station are out. We know they're
                          connected to the car rental agencies
                          because that's where they picked up
                          Raymond.

                                       SAMI
                          Even if we get out of town and go to
                          another airport I'm sure the FBI and
                          Chicago P.D. has alerted customs.

                                       MARCEL
                          How about Canada?

                                       RAYMOND
                          What are we going to do, take a taxi?

               Sami opens a pack of cigarettes to find it's empty.

                                       SAMI
                          I'm going to get some cigarettes.

               

               INT. RESTAURANT -- EVENING

               Because of the early hour the room is empty. Raphael and Hector
               are with FREDDY O, 30's, hard-looking. He is wearing a bus boy
               uniform as he sets the tables.

                                       FREDDY O
                          I can't believe someone would have the
                          balls to rip off your ride.

                                       RAPHAEL
                          When I find them they won't have them
                          for much longer.

                                       FREDDY O
                          I'll ask around. If they try to move it
                          I can find out.

                                          RAPHAEL
                          Thanks.

               Raphael and Hector exit.    We move with them through the door into...

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL LOBBY -- EVENING

               Raphael and Hector head for the front door. The elevator doors
               opens and Sami exits. They walk past each other as Sami heads
               across the lobby and into the gift shop. As Raphael and Hector
               walk out the front door Agent Hadley steps in walks past them. He
               goes over to a WOMAN CLERK at the front desk.

               

                                                                          83.

               

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          I'd like to see the manager please.

               She walks over to the HOTEL MANAGER and points to Agent Hadley.
               The Manager walks over.

                                       HOTEL MANAGER
                          May I help you?

               Agent Hadley shows him his badge.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          I'm looking for several French men who
                          checked in within the last twenty four
                          hours.

                                       HOTEL MANAGER
                          They checked in last night.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          I need you to take me to their room.

               Agent Hadley follows the manager as they walks towards the elevators
               and pass... Sami who pretends to read a magazine, covering his
               face so Hadley will not see him. Sami walks quickly across the
               lobby and passes...

               Joey "Two Tons", Nicky "The Rake" and three other WISEGUYS enter
               the hotel. Agent Hadley gets in an elevator with the Hotel Manager.
               The doors close as the wiseguys approach.

               The moment the doors close Sami bolts into the lobby and over to
               the house phones. All of them are being used except one. A MAN
               is just about to lift the receiver when Sami pushes him aside.

                                        MAN
                          Excuse me.   I was here first.

               Sami ignores him as he waits for the hotel operator to answer.
               The phone just rings and rings.
               Behind him another elevator has arrived and the wiseguys enter.
               Sami's frustration is growing as the phone continues to ring.    The
               Man who Sami pushed away is still there.

                                       MAN
                          Hey buddy, you just can't push in here.

                                        SAMI
                          Go away.

                                       MAN
                          I most certainly will not go--

               Sami quickly smacks him on the head with the receiver.   The man
               slinks away.

                                        OPERATOR'S VOICE
                          Operator.

               

                                                                           84.

               

                                       SAMI
                               (into phone)
                          Room 912.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- EVENING

               The phone rings.

                                       DANIEL
                               (to Raymond)
                          Get that, will you?

                                       RAYMOND
                          Why do I always have to answer the phone?

                                       DANIEL
                          Because you're the closest.

                                       RAYMOND
                          I'm not any closer than you are.

               

               INT. ELEVATOR -- EVENING

               The wiseguys watch the floor indicator.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- EVENING

               The phone continues RINGING.

                                       DANIEL
                          Why is everything an argument with you?

                                       RAYMOND
                          I'm just setting my boundaries.

               Daniel looks at Raymond and sighs, then gets up and lifts he
               receiver.

                                          DANIEL
                          Hello?

                                       SAMI (V.O.)
                          Get out of the room! You've got company
                          coming up. I'll meet you at the Chevy.

               Daniel slams down the phone.    The others can see the urgency on
               his face.

                                       DANIEL
                          Raymond, grab the tapes.    We're leaving!

                                       RAYMOND
                          Why do I have to pick up the tapes.

                                          DANIEL
                          Jesus!

               Daniel grabs the canvas bag.

               

                                                                           85.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL -- HALLWAY -- EVENING

               The manager is about to open the door with his key.   Agent Hadley
               takes it and removes a gun.

                                         AGENT HADLEY
                            You should go now.

               The manager runs away. Agent Hadley inserts the key and opens the
               door. His face fills with fear as he sees...
               AGENT HADLEY'S POV -- Daniel, Marcel, Raymond and Zero are on the
               other side, their guns pointed at Hadley's head.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE - BATHROOM -- EVENING

               Daniel uses Hadley's handcuffs and handcuffs him to a pipe under
               the sink.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL -- HALLWAY -- EVENING

               Daniel, Raymond, Marcel and Zero step into the hall. The moment
               they do the elevator doors at the end of the hall open. The
               Wiseguys step out and see them.
               The door to the room next to theirs opens and a LITTLE GIRL, 8,
               dressed in a pink dress steps out.

                                          LITTLE GIRL
                                 (calling into her
                                  room)
                            C'mon, Mommy.

               Everything seems to move in slow motion.
               --   The Wiseguys go for their guns.
               --   The crew goes for theirs.
               --   The little girl is caught between both groups.
               --   Marcel lunges forward, tackling the girl to ground.
               --   The Wiseguys begin to shoot.
               --   The hallway fills with gunfire.
               --   Marcel pulls the little girl into her room.
               --   Plaster explodes off the walls as bullets rip through them.
               --   The Crew rushes back into their suite.

               

               INT. LITTLE GIRL'S ROOM -- EVENING

               Marcel hands the frightened girl to her mother, then moves over to
               the door that joins with the crews. He shoots the lock and moves
               through the door.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- EVENING

               As Marcel steps through he sees the crew all aiming their guns at
               him. Daniel gets an idea. As Zero holds off the Wiseguys from
               the doorway, Daniel goes to the adjoining door on the other side
               of the suite. He shoots off the lock.

               

                                                                          86.

               

                                       DANIEL
                          Let's go!
               The Crew moves through the door.

               

               INT. ADJOINING MOTEL ROOM -- EVENING

               Empty. The crew runs across to the door. Because the room is
               built at the intersection of two hallways the crew step out into a
               corridor out of the Wiseguys line of sight.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL -- BACK HALLWAY -- EVENING

               The Crew exits and heads for the staircase.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL -- FRONT HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

               Silence. The Wiseguys move down the hall and stop outside the
               door of the Crew's suite. A beat. They rush in.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL SUITE -- CONTINUOUS

               Empty. Nicky "The Rake" sees the open adjoining door and motions
               for them to follow him.

               

               INT. HOLIDAY HOTEL -- BACK HALLWAY -- EVENING

               The Wiseguys step out just as the Crew are going through the door
               to the stairwell. The Wiseguys run after them. Joey "Two Tons"
               lags behind.

               

               INT. STAIRWELL -- EVENING

               The Crew runs down the stairs. Above them the Wiseguys follow.
               Joey "Two Tons" is breathing heavily as he runs down the stairs.

               

               INT. UNDER GROUND PARKING LOT -- EVENING

               The door flies open as the Crew runs across the lot.   Sami has
               already started the Impala and is waiting for them.
               A moment later the stairwell door opens and the Wiseguys run out,
               guns blazing.

               The Crew heads for the Impala, shooting behind them as they run.
               Nicky "The Rake"" shoots.

               Zero is hit in the leg. He falls to the ground, then rolls on his
               side behind a parked car. He fights through the pain, props himself
               up and begins to shoot back.

               Two Wiseguys step out to flank Zero. Zero takes aim and shoots
               one. He lines up on the other Wiseguy and pulls the trigger again.
               Click! His gun his empty.

               

                                                                             87.

               
               Daniel and Marcel run towards Zero, firing their guns as fast as
               they can pull the trigger. Marcel takes aim and fires.
               The Wiseguy's dive for cover as Marcel blazes away until his gun
               is empty.

               We hear tires screeching as the Impala backs up.
               The Wiseguys shoot, blowing out the back window.     They move in on
               Marcel and Zero.

               Daniel runs forward with two guns firing at the wiseguys.     As he
               nears Marcel he throws the extra gun to him.
               SLOW MOTION :on the gun as it flies through the air.
               SLOW MOTION: One of the WISEGUYS has almost circle around the car.
               SLOW MOTION: on the gun has it flies through the air.
               REAL TIME -- ON MARCEL: He looks to his left just as the gun
               arrives. It hits him on the forehead and knocks him down.

               Daniel fires a few SHOTS driving the Wiseguy back. He runs over
               and with Marcel's help they grab Zero and help him to the car.
               They dive into the back seat. The car screeches forward and races
               out of the garage.

               Silence. The staircase door opens and an exhausted Joey "Two Tons"
               steps out, gasping for air.

               

               INT. IMPALA -- MOVING -- EVENING

               Daniel attends to the wound on Zero's leg.

                                       DANIEL
                          The bullet went clean through.

               Daniel stares at him.   A beat.     Zero grins, saying thank you.

               

               INT. COFFEE SHOP -- EVENING

               A distraught Raphael sits across from Hector in a booth near the
               window. Hector has almost finished eating. Raphael hasn't touched
               his food. He pushes his plate away.

                                         RAPHAEL
                          I can't eat.

               Raphael lowers his head sadly.      Hector looks out the window.
               HIS POV -- of the Impala driving by -- rear window missing, bumper
               about to fall off.
               Hector watches it go by, then turns back.     Raphael looks up.

                                       HECTOR
                          So, can I have your fries?

               

                                                                            88.

               

               EXT. COZY COURT COTTAGES -- EVENING

               A group of small bungalows built adjacent to the interstate.

               

               INT. COTTAGE -- EVENING

               Small. Filled with cheap furniture. A small kitchenette is off
               to the side of the room. Zero lays on the bed. Daniel uses his
               belt as tourniquet to slow the bleeding. Raymond sits at the table
               staring at the black canvas bag containing the cash and tapes.
               Marcel is in the kitchenette.

                                       DANIEL
                               (to Zero)
                          When we get back to Paris I'll take you
                          dancing.

               Zero smiles. Sami enters carrying a shopping bag.      He places it
               on the counter.

                                       DANIEL
                          Bring me the scissors.

                                       ZERO
                          And the Vodka.

               Sami removes the items from the bag. He opens the bottle and hands
               it to Zero who quickly gulps down a few mouthfuls.

                                       DANIEL
                          Cut his pants up the leg to the groin.

                                       ZERO
                          And be careful when you get near the
                          top. Zero has a very long one.

               He winks at Sami.

                                       SAMI
                          What's he joking around for?    He's been
                          shot.

                                       DANIEL
                          He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.

               Raymond cuts the pant leg away. Daniel walks over to Marcel who
               is standing over the gas range. Over the flame is a tire wrench,
               the metal tip glowing red hot. Sami opens the bag and removes
               some white bread.

                                       SAMI
                          Anybody hungry?

                                       DANIEL
                          What'd you get?

                                       SAMI
                          Some bread and...

               

                                                                         89.

               
               He removes a can of cheese whiz and sprays the cheese onto the
               bread.

                                        SAMI
                          Cheese.

               All the French guys look at him as though he is from another planet.

                                        DANIEL
                          Cheese?   In a can?

               Sami stuffs his mouth with a big bite.

                                        SAMI
                          It's good.

                                       MARCEL
                          God, I want to go home.

                                       SAMI
                          Hey, you know you can't this in France.

                                        DANIEL
                          Thank God.

               Daniel uses a towel to pick up the tire wrench and walks over to
               the bed. Sami and Raymond grimace as they think about what's about
               to happen.

                                       DANIEL
                               (to Zero)
                          Ready?

               Zero nods. Daniel takes the bottle of Vodka and pours some over
               the wound. Zero flinches. Daniel looks at Marcel, then releases
               the belt. Blood flows from the wound. Marcel presses the hot
               poker against the wound. Zero grunts, but does not scream. His
               face contorts violently from the pain.

               

               INT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- EVENING

               Zammito sits at a table in the back eating an assortment of pasta.
               DEAN MARTIN "Innamaraia" plays on the stereo. EDDIE, 60's,
               arthritic, finishes making an espresso. He starts carrying it
               over to Zammito, moving incredibly slow, shuffling one foot in
               front of the other. Zammito watches him with strained patience.
               Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" enter. Their faces tell the
               story.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          What happened?

                                       NICKY "THE RAKE"
                          They sort of got away.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          I see. Well, get back out on the street
                          and find them before I "sort of" kill
                          you.

               

                                                                              90.

               

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                          But we ain't had nothing to eat all day
                          boss.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Oh, I'm sorry.

               Zammito scoops up a handful of pasta out of his plate and throws
               it at him.

                                          ZAMMITO
                          Had enough?

               Joey "Two Tons" looks down sheepishly, several pieces of pasta are
               stuck to his face. Zammito walks over to him.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Try to get this through that fat, stupid
                          fuckin' head of yours. If Half Tooth
                          Tony finds these guys before we do and
                          Bonanno knows what was in my safe we are
                          all dead.

               They turn around and leave.       Zammito stares after them angrily.

                                          ZAMMITO
                          Cafones!

               He looks over at Eddie who is only half way to the table.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          You gonna bring that over here today, or
                          what?

               

               INT. COTTAGE -- MORNING

               Zero is passed out, a half empty Vodka bottle on the nightstand.
               The others have been up all night. Raymond is across the table
               from Sami.

                                       RAYMOND
                          The new Beaujolais' come out in France
                          next week. You like wine?

                                       SAMI
                          I'm more of a whiskey drinker myself.

                                          RAYMOND

                          J&B?

                                          SAMI
                          Glenmorangie.

                                       RAYMOND
                          Glenmorangie is very good.

               Sami realizes that Raymond wants to talk about something...
               anything... that will get his mind of the events that have lead
               them here.

               

                                                                           91.

               

                                       SAMI
                          But I'll have a glass of Beaujolais with
                          you when we get back.

               Raymond forces a weak smile. Daniel who has been watching them
               grabs a few things off the table.

                                       DANIEL
                          I'll be back in an hour.

               Daniel looks at Sami and motions for him to come outside.

               

               EXT. COTTAGE -- MORNING

               Sami steps outside.   Daniel is staring at him.

                                         SAMI
                          What?

                                       DANIEL
                          Can I trust you, Sami?

                                       SAMI
                          Hey, who warned you that they were coming
                          up to the room?

                                       DANIEL
                          If they had taken us by surprise they
                          would have gotten the tapes back. That
                          would have left us with nothing.

                                       SAMI
                          No, that would have left me with nothing
                          because all of you would be dead.

                                       DANIEL
                          You haven't answered my question.

                                       SAMI
                          Does it really matter what I say?

                                       DANIEL
                          I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm
                          trusting you to do the right thing today.

                                         SAMI
                          I will.

                                         DANIEL
                          You better.

               

               EXT. BONANNO'S HOUSE -- MORNING

               Daniel walks up to the front door and rings the bell.   Half Tooth
               Tony opens the door and looks him up and down.

                                         HALF TOOTH TONY
                          Yeah?

               

                                                                          92.

               

                                       DANIEL
                          I would like to see Mr. Bonanno please.

                                       HALF TOOTH TONY
                          Who the hell are you?

                                       DANIEL
                          Tell him I'm the guy who robbed Frankie
                          Zammito.

               

               INT. BONANNO'S FOYER -- MORNING

               Half Tooth Tony searches Daniel. He finds a small cassette player,
               glances at it and sticks it back in Daniel's pocket.

                                       HALF TOOTH TONY
                               (points to a door)
                          In there.

               

               INT. BONANNO'S LIVING ROOM -- MORNING

               Daniel enters. Half Tooth Tony stands behind him, his eyes locked
               on Daniel's every move. Bonanno is sitting in an armchair.

                                       BONANNO
                          Either you are incredibly brave, or
                          incredibly stupid. Which one is it?

                                       DANIEL
                          I guess we're going to find out.

                                       BONANNO
                          You rob an associate of mine... a friend
                          and--

                                       DANIEL
                               (overlapping)
                          Not such a good friend.   May I reach in
                          my pocket?

               Bonanno looks to Half Tooth Tony.

                                        HALF TOOTH TONY
                          He's clean.

               Bonanno nods.   Daniel removes the cassette player and turns it on.

                                       ZAMMITO'S VOICE
                          Of course. I need an answer from you if
                          I'm going to move.

                                       MAN'S VOICE
                          We're not just talkin' about a 'piece of
                          work' here Frankie. We're talking about
                          a boss.

                                       ZAMMITO'S VOICE
                          Bonanno's a dinosaur.
                                       (More)

               

                                                                          93.

               
                                       ZAMMITO'S VOICE (Cont'd)
                          Guy thinks he's fuckin' Vito Corleone or
                          something. The old ways are gone. If
                          we don't change now we're going to get
                          pushed out. I need to know if I can
                          count on your support?

               Daniel turns off the tape.   Bonanno's anger is visible.

                                       DANIEL
                          I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This
                          guy's an idiot. How he's lived this
                          long is a mystery.

                                       BONANNO
                               (seething)
                          I don't think it will be a mystery much
                          longer.

                                       DANIEL
                          He's recorded every conversation he's
                          had with you for years.

                                       BONANNO
                          I assume you want something?

                                       DANIEL
                          We've got a lot of people looking for
                          us. We'd just like to go home.

                                       BONANNO
                          You want me to help you get out of the
                          country?

               Daniel nods.

                                       BONANNO
                          And for my help I would get what?

                                       DANIEL
                          Half the tapes.

                                       BONANNO
                          And the other half?

                                       DANIEL
                          I'll destroy them when we get back to
                          Paris.

                                       BONANNO
                          I only have your word for that.

                                       DANIEL
                          I just want to get my people home. I
                          know who you are and what you could do
                          to me if I don't honor my word.

                                       BONANNO
                          Where are you staying?

               

                                                                             94.

               
               Daniel grins.   He isn't going to tell him.

                                       BONANNO
                          I only ask so I can call you when the
                          arrangements are made.

                                       DANIEL
                          How about if I call you?

               

               INT. COTTAGE -- MORNING

               Zero and Raymond are sleeping. We hear the shower running in the
               bathroom. Sami is at the table. The black canvas bag containing
               the tapes is on the table. Sami removes the identical canvas bag
               he bought at the store from under the bed and places it on the
               table. He takes the original and leaves.

               

               EXT. COZY COURTS -- MORNING

               Sami removes the card Hadley gave him, takes out his cell phone
               and dials. A taxi pulls up.

                                         SAMI
                          Same place.    One hour.

               Sami gets in the taxi and it drives away.     A beat.   A moment later
               another taxi pulls up. Daniel gets out.

               

               INT. COTTAGE -- MORNING

               Daniel enters to find Zero and Raymond still sleeping. He looks
               at the black canvas bag on the table. Marcel steps out of the
               bathroom wrapped in a towel.

               

               EXT. GRANT PARK -- MORNING

               Hadley is waiting by the statue holding a cardboard box.     Sami
               walks towards him holding the black canvas bag.

                                       SAMI
                          What the fuck was all that about at the
                          hotel last night? I thought we had a
                          deal?

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Hey, you're not exactly the most
                          trustworthy guy in the world. I took a
                          shot. It didn't work. Did you bring
                          the tapes?

               Sami holds up the canvas bag.

                                         SAMI
                          The lamp?

               Hadley opens the cardboard box to reveal the bloody lamp base.
               Sami hands him the canvas bag.

               

                                                                             95.

               

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Just a second. You must think I'm a
                          real moron.

               Hadley removes a small cassette player from his jacket.    He picks
               a tape and inserts it into the player.

                                       ZAMMITO'S VOICE
                          I just came by to tell that "piece of
                          work" you asked for on Johnny Wicks --
                          It's done.

                                        BONANNO'S VOICE
                          Good.   How'd he go?

                                       ZAMMITO'S VOICE
                          Like the crying rat bastard that he was.

               Hadley stops the tape.   He inserts another one.

                                       ZAMMITO'S VOICE
                          Angelo, we can't lean too hard on this
                          guy. He's a congressman.

                                       BONANNO'S VOICE
                          I made Peter Dimiano a congressman. We
                          pay him each month to look after our
                          interests.

               Hadley grins.   This is great stuff.   He looks up at Sami.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          Here you go, sport.

               Sami grabs the box and leaves. Hadley starts whistling a tune and
               walks off the other way. As he reaches the tree line Lamar pops
               out with two of his friends. All of them have guns.

                                       LAMAR
                          I'll take the bag.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          You don't think I see through this?     You
                          tell Sami he's dead.

               One of Lamar's guys searches through Hadley's pockets, finds his
               gun, then takes his wallet.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          You're making a big mistake.    I'm an FBI
                          agent.

               Hadley stares at Lamar defiantly. Lamar cocks the hammer back on
               his gun and presses the barrel to Hadley's forehead. Hadley drops
               the canvas bag.

               Lamar picks up the canvas bag and runs away. Hadley stands there
               fuming. Lamar runs towards the statue and disappears behind it.

               ANGLE -- BEHIND THE STATUE

               

                                                                           96.

               
               Daniel is waiting, holding the other black canvas bag.   As Lamar
               passes they quickly exchange bags.

               From Hadley's point of view Lamar has merely run behind the statue
               as he heads for the street. Lamar runs a few more steps, then
               stumbles and falls... several cassette tapes spill out of it.
               Lamar's buddies are already at the street.

                                        LAMAR'S BUDDIES
                          C'mon, man!   Let's get out of here.

               Lamar gets up, looks at the bag, pretends to be panicked.   He runs
               off leaving the bag laying on the grass.

               ON HADLEY: He can't believe his luck. He runs over, picks up the
               loose cassettes and puts them back in the bag, then leaves.

               ON DANIEL: he peers out from behind the fountain, watching as
               Hadley walks off in the other direction.

               

               EXT. STREET CORNER -- MORNING

               Daniel arrives to find Sami and Lamar.

                                       SAMI
                          See, I told you that you could trust me.

               Daniel grins and pats him on the back.

                                       LAMAR
                          Okay, we're square now, right?

                                       DANIEL
                          There's just one more thing I need you
                          to do.

               Lamar is about to protest when Daniel takes out a roll of bills.

                                       LAMAR
                          I'm listening.

               

               INT. TAXI -- MOVING -- DAY

               Daniel and Sami sit in the back.   Daniel is on his cell phone.

                                       DANIEL
                               (into phone)
                          Mr. Bonanno, I was wondering if you--
                               (listens)
                          That would be fine. Thank you.

               

               INT. FBI HEADQUARTERS -- DAY

               Hadley enters with the black canvas bag.    The RECEPTIONIST hands
               him a package.

                                       RECEPTIONIST
                          This came for you.

               

                                                                          97.

               

               INT. HADLEY'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Hadley opens the package and finds a video cassette. Hadley pops
               the cassette into the VCR. On the screen we see Sami speaking
               into a video camera.

                                       SAMI
                          Since we're such good pals I thought I'd
                          sneak you an advanced copy of my latest
                          work. I call it, "I am a scum-sucking
                          FBI agent".

               On the television screen we see Hadley and Sami in the park on
               their first meeting.

                                       SAMI
                          You want the tapes for yourself.     You're
                          going to sell them.

                                       AGENT HADLEY
                          I'm going to retire with a shit-load of
                          money. Find me a small country that
                          doesn't have an extradition treaty with
                          the States and live the good life.

                                       SAMI
                          You didn't have to kill Sophie.

                                         AGENT HADLEY
                          Yes I did.    Lose ends are messy.

               The color drains from Hadley's face.   Sami reappears, talking into
               the camera again.

                                       SAMI
                          It's a little arty I know, but it has
                          great content, don't you think? You
                          were so busy looking for a wire you
                          probably didn't even think about a video
                          camera. It was on the statue. Anyway,
                          I've sent a copy of the whole tape to
                          the Chicago P.D. and the FBI. They'll
                          get it tomorrow. If I were you I'd take
                          the day off.

               The tape turns to static. Hadley tries to think. He takes the
               VHS tape from the machine, then picks up his phone and starts to
               dial a number. A beat. He thinks better of it, hangs up and uses
               his cell phone.

               

               INT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- DAY

               Eddie is on the phone.   Zammito is at his usual table.

                                       EDDIE
                          Hey boss, some guy named Hadley.     Says
                          he's got some tapes you want?

               Zammito springs out of his seat and grabs the phone.

               

                                                                          98.

               

                                         ZAMMITO
                          Yeah?
                               (listens)
                          How much? Are you nuts?
                               (listens)
                          Okay. Okay. There's an old warehouse
                          on Merchant Street...

               

               EXT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- DAY

               Zammito and Joey "Two Tons" rush to the car carrying a briefcase.

               

               EXT. VINNY ZAMMITO'S HOUSE -- DAY

               Raymond knocks on the door.   Vinny answers it, his arm in sling.

                                         RAYMOND
                          Mr. Zammito?

                                         VINNY
                          Uh huh.

                                       RAYMOND
                          I represent a person who wishes to remain
                          anonymous, but is aware of your current
                          financial problems with your brother.

                                       VINNY
                          I don't know what you're talking about.

                                       RAYMOND
                          I understand. The person who sent me
                          wishes to help you.

                                         VINNY
                          How?

                                       RAYMOND
                          You see that car?

               Vinny looks on the street and sees the Impala.

                                         VINNY
                          Yeah.

                                       RAYMOND
                          It's yours. A gift. A gift you could
                          give to your brother... or anyone you
                          owe money to as partial payment.

                                         VINNY
                          No shit?

                                       RAYMOND
                          The papers for the car will arrive
                          tomorrow.

               

                                                                              99.

               

               EXT.   MERCHANT STREET WAREHOUSE -- DAY

               An old building, dirty windows and peeling paint.       The main door
               is open.

               

               INT. MERCHANT STREET WAREHOUSE -- DAY

               Zammito and Joey "Two Tons" are standing next to Zammito's Lincoln.
               Hadley parks ten yards away and gets out with the black canvas
               bag.

                                        ZAMMITO
                           Those the tapes?

               Hadley starts to place the canvas bag on the hood of Zammito's
               car.

                                        ZAMMITO
                           Watch the paint.

               Hadley opens the bag.     It is filled with cassette tapes.

                                          AGENT HADLEY
                           The money?

               Zammito nods to Joey "Two Tons" who opens another briefcase filled
               with cash.

                                        ZAMMITO
                           How'd you get these?

                                          AGENT HADLEY
                           I got 'em.    That's all you need to know.

               Hadley starts to go.     Zammito motions him to stop.

                                        ZAMMITO
                           Just a second.

               Zammito picks a tape and tosses it to Joey "Two Tons." Who puts
               the cassette into the cars cassette player. Suddenly we hear Wayne
               Newton singing "Danke Schoen."

                                        WAYNE NEWTON'S VOICE
                           Danke Schoen, darling Danke Schoen.
                           Thank you for all the joy and pain...

               Hadley's face turns white.     He produces an audible gulp as he looks
               at Zammito weakly.

               The music continues as we hold on a wide shot of the building.

                                        WAYNE NEWTON'S VOICE
                           Pictures show, second balcony, was the
                           place we'd meet...

               Through the dirty windows we see several flashes as the air fills
               with gunfire.

               

                                                                         100.

                          ... second seat, go Dutch treat, you
                          were so sweet...

               Zammito's Lincoln pulls out of the warehouse and drives down the
               street.

               

               INT. LINCOLN -- MOVING -- AFTERNOON

               Music continues in the cassette deck.   Joey "Two Tons" drives.
               Zammito sits in the passenger seat.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Can you believe that guy?    What a moron.

                                       JOEY "TWO TONS"
                               (referring to cassette)
                          Good song though.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Great fuckin' song.

               

               EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT -- AFTERNOON

               Sami, Marcel and Raymond help Zero out of the taxi and towards a
               small plane. Off to the side Bonanno is standing with Half Tooth
               Tony. Daniel walks over to him.

                                       BONANNO
                          This plane will take you to Canada.
                          From there you can fly back to Paris.

                                         DANIEL
                          Thank you.

                                       BONANNO
                          You have something for me?

               Daniel hands him the cassette case with half the tapes. Bonanno
               hands it to Half Tooth Tony who takes them into the car and listens
               to a tape.

                                       HALF TOOTH TONY
                          They're good, boss.

                                       BONANNO
                          And the other half of the tapes?

                                       DANIEL
                          You have my word. I'll destroy them.

               

               EXT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- AFTERNOON

               The Lincoln pulls up. Zammito and Joey "Two Tons" get out.   Vinny
               is waiting beside the Impala.

                                         ZAMMITO
                          What's this?

               

                                                                           101.

                          A car.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a
                          sewing machine. What the hell is it
                          doing here?

                                           VINNY
                          It's for you.

                                       ZAMMITO
                          For me? What am I going to do with a
                          piece of shit like this?

                                       VINNY
                          I don't know. Sell it. It's gotta be
                          worth something. Someone gave it to me.
                          C'mon Frankie, I'm trying to make good
                          here.

                                           ZAMMITO
                          Okay.    Okay.

                                       VINNY
                          I'll get you the papers tomorrow.

               Vinny starts to walk away.

                                        ZAMMITO
                                (yelling after him)
                          Hey, if you're well enough to be walking
                          around you're well enough to start working
                          here.

               

               EXT. MEXICAN RESTAURANT -- AFTERNOON

               A gang hang out. Raphael is with several hard-looking gang-bangers.
               Lamar arrives with two of his friends.

                                           RAPHAEL
                          You lost?

                                       LAMAR
                          Don't come off like a hard-on with me.
                          I'm about to make you a very happy man.

               

               EXT. GANG HANGOUT -- AFTERNOON

               Several Gang Bangers stand around their low rider cars. Sananta's
               "Oye Como Va" plays loudly on one of the radios. Raphael talks
               heatedly with several of the gang bangers.

               

               A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS
               Music continues as several gang members check their guns.

               

                                                                         102.

               

               EXT. STREET -- AFTERNOON

               The Santana song continues as several car loads of Gang Bangers
               drive down the street.

               

               INT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- AFTERNOON

               The air is thick with cigar smoke. Several GUMBAS hang around the
               bar. Zammito is at his table with Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The
               Rake." DEAN MARTIN "Return To me" plays on the jukebox.
               Outside we hear the sound of cars pulling up and screeching to a
               stop. The door opens and Raphael and ten other very tough-looking
               GANG MEMBERS step inside. The room falls silent, except for Dino
               on the jukebox. Zammito stands up.

                                         RAPHAEL
                            Anybody know about that car outside?

                                          ZAMMITO
                            Yeah.   It's mine.

                                          RAPHAEL
                            No.   It's mine.

                                         ZAMMITO
                            The hell it is.

                                         RAPHAEL
                            I'm telling you that's my car!   And
                            someone's gonna pay for it!

                                         ZAMMITO
                            And I'm tellin' you it ain't! Now, turn
                            your taco-eating ass around and get the
                            hell out of here.

                                         RAPHAEL
                            Fuck you, grease-ball!

                                          ZAMMITO
                            Fuck me?   Fuck you!

               They are right on the edge of having a major disaster. The Dean
               Martin song ends. Dead quiet. Each group watches the other to
               see who's going to make the first move.
               The jukebox selects another record. The needle scratches against
               the vinyl intro. We hear the intro to JERRY VALE singing "Amore
               Scusami".

               

               SERIES OF QUICK CUTS
               --   Raphael's eyes burn into Zammito's
               --   A Gang-Bangers eyes dart from side to side.
               --   A Wiseguy bites his lip.
               --   Nicky "The Rake" twitches his fingers nervously.
               --   Sweat glistens on the forehead of Joey "Two Tons".

               

                                                                         103.

               
               At the bar Eddie reaches behind for something without looking. He
               knocks over a bottle. It falls to the floor and breaks. The noise
               is enough to push things over the edge.

                                       JERRY VALE'S VOICE
                          My love, forgive me...

               Raphael goes for his gun.   All hell breaks loose! People dive for
               cover as shots rings out.   In the close quarters it's like shooting
               fish in a barrel.

                                       JERRY VALE'S VOICE
                          I didn't mean to have it end like this...

               Eddie lifts a shotgun from behind the bar and blows away a gang
               member. Another gang member kills him.
               It's a massacre! Bodies drop like flies. The room is so thick
               with smoke you can't see two feet in front of you. Finally it is
               quiet.

                                       JERRY VALE'S VOICE
                          I didn't mean to have you fall in love,
                          in love with me...

               We move through the room, past the carnage. Smoke swirls, blood
               covers the floor. Raphael is dead. Along with Joey "Two Tons"
               and Nicky "The Rake" On the floor, Zammito is against the bar.
               He sits up, amazed that he is untouched. He gets to his feet and
               makes his way to the front door.

               

               EXT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- AFTERNOON

               Music continues. Zammito staggers outside and into the street.
               He laughs, a nervous laugh at his good fortune.

                                       JERRY VALE'S VOICE
                          My love, please kiss me...

               Zammito turns around to see
               ZAMMITO'S POV -- A Lincoln Town car speeding towards him. Through
               the windshield he can see the smiling face of Half Tooth Tony.
               The front of the car slams into Zammito, lifting him into the air.
               He flips head over heals then smashes into the windshield and over
               the car. He lays in the middle of the street, dead.
               The Lincoln speeds off down the street.

                                       JERRY VALE'S VOICE

               INT. BONANNO'S HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

               Music continues. Bonanno sits on his couch, eating a cannoli as
               he watches Judge Judy on television..

               

                                                                          104.

               Music continues. Agent Hadley is leaning against his car, his
               eyes open, a large bullet hole in his head.

                                       JERRY VALE'S VOICE

               Music continues. Wayne is sitting on the couch, an open package
               on the coffee table. He smiles as he stares at the stacks of cash
               the crew took from Zammito.

               Jerry Vale continues singing as the plane glides through a clear
               blue sky. Music fades.

               

                                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

               

               EXT. BASTALDI'S'S WAREHOUSE -- PARIS -- MORNING

               Bastaldi steps outside into the crisp morning air.    He takes a few
               steps, then stops.

               BASTALDI POV -- across the street, standing side by side are Daniel,
               Sami, Raymond, Marcel and Zero. They look like a ragged bunch,
               tired, dirty. We PAN across the faces of each one of them as they
               stare at Bastaldi.

               A BUS goes by blocking Bastaldi's view of the boys.   When it passes
               the crew it gone!

               Bastaldi bites his lip nervously.    Bastaldi looks around, but there
               is no sign of them.

               

               A DIFFERENT ANGLE
               We can see the five of them crouched behind a parked car. Marcel
               peers through the window at Bastaldi who is still trying to figure
               out where they went. They are all amused with Bastaldi's
               bewilderment.

                                       RAYMOND
                          What's he doing?

               

                                                                        105.

               

                                       MARCEL
                          He's looking around for us.

                                       ZERO
                          Zero can't stay like this much longer.
                          His leg is hurting.

               Finally, Bastaldi turns around and goes back into his apartment.

               

               INT. BASTALDI'S WAREHOUSE -- DAY

               Bastaldi is at his desk, nervously tapping his fingers on the
               surface. The phone rings. He knows who is calling. He stares at
               the phone for a long moment, then he slowly lifts the receiver.

                          Hello?

                                       DANIEL (V.O.)
                               (in French)
                          It's Daniel.

                                       BASTALDI
                               (in French)
                          Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has
                          been a big--

                                       DANIEL (V.O.)
                               (overlapping; in French)
                          -- I've got the tapes. If you ever want
                          to see your brother out of jail do exactly
                          what I say. Bring one million euros to
                          your boat at six o'clock.

                                       BASTALDI
                               (in French)
                          A million! I don't have that kind of
                          money.

                                        DANIEL (V.O.)
                               (in French)
                          Don't bullshit me, Laurant!   I know about
                          the Van Gogh.

                                       BASTALDI
                               (In French)
                          I don't have it. That's why Vincent
                          went to Chicago. They arrested him before
                          he could bring it back.

                                       DANIEL (V.O.)
                               (in French)
                          Well, you better get the money somehow.
                          Six o'clock and come alone. If you don't
                          we'll destroy the tapes.

               The line goes dead.

               

                                                                          106.

               

               EXT. HOUSEBOAT -- AFTERNOON

               Bastaldi drives up.    He gets out carrying a suitcase and nervously
               walks to the boat.

               

               INT. HOUSEBOAT -- AFTERNOON

               Bastaldi enters. No one appears to be there.    Bastaldi's cell
               phone rings. He answers it.

                                       DANIEL (V.O.)
                               (in French)
                          Go back on deck. There's a small rowboat
                          in the water --

               

               EXT. OTHER SIDE OF RIVER -- CONTINUOUS

               Daniel, Sami and Zero watch the houseboat.   Daniel continues his
               conversation on the cell phone.

                                       DANIEL
                               (in French)
                          Put the money in the rowboat and untie
                          it. The current will carry it down river.
                          When we see that the money is there I'll
                          call back and tell you where the tapes
                          are.

               DANIEL'S POV: Bastaldi appears on deck. He puts the suitcase in
               the rowboat and unties it. It drifts slowly into the current.

               

               EXT. DOWN RIVER -- AFTERNOON

               The rowboat hugs the shore, moving slowly down the river. Marcel
               is on the shore with Raymond. Raymond reaches out with a long
               pole and pulls the boat to shore. Marcel opens the case. Inside
               are several stacks of five hundred franc notes. Marcel looks to
               Raymond with a grin and nods. Raymond opens his cell phone.

               

               EXT. OTHER SIDE OF RIVER -- CONTINUOUS

               Daniel, Sami and Zero continue to watch the houseboat.   Sami's
               cell phone rings. He answers it and listens.

                                       RAYMOND (V.O.)
                          We're in business.

               Sami nods to Daniel.

               

               EXT. HOUSEBOAT -- AFTERNOON

               Bastaldi's cell phone rings.   He answers it.

                                       DANIEL (V.O.)
                               (in French)
                          Go down into the main cabin.   The tapes
                          are in the wooden chest.

               

                                                                        107.

               
               The line goes dead.

               

               INT. HOUSEBOAT -- AFTERNOON

               Bastaldi enters, looks around the room until he sees the wooden
               chest. He walks over and opens it. Inside there are several
               cassette tapes in the cardboard box.
               Bastaldi grins and lifts the cardboard box out of the chest. He
               hears a CLICK. He notices something is attached to the bottom of
               the cardboard box. It's a long thin wire that has pulled the pin
               on an electronic device.

               

               EXT. ACROSS THE RIVER -- CONTINUOUS

               Daniel is now holding small, black device. A yellow light starts
               flashing. He puts his finger on a red button.

                                       DANIEL
                          This is for Julien.

               He presses the button.

               

               INT. HOUSEBOAT -- CONTINUOUS

               A digital counter begins counting backwards. Bastaldi realizes
               that the device is a BOMB. He stares at the numbers quickly speed
               by 8... 7... 6... 5...

                                        BASTALDI
                          Oh, Merde!

               

               EXT. HOUSEBOAT -- FIVE SECONDS LATER

               The houseboat explodes in a brilliant fireball, sending pieces of
               wood and metal flying into the air. A thick plume of black smoke
               swirls in the wind.

               

               EXT. ACROSS THE RIVER -- AFTERNOON

               Daniel, Raymond, Sami, Raymond, Marcel and Zero watch the smoldering
               wreckage. Their blank faces show no emotion -- just a sense that
               justice has been done.

                                       SAMI
                          Did you have to use that much explosive?

                                       DANIEL
                          I promised Bonanno I'd destroy the tapes.

               Raymond opens the suitcase and looks inside. As he peels through
               the stacks of money we see that only the top bill of each stack is
               real -- underneath them all is white paper, cut to the same size
               as the bills. Everyone turns to Marcel.

                                       DANIEL
                          You didn't check it?

               

                                                                           108.

               

               EXT. BRIDGE -- AFTERNOON

               The five of them walk across the bridge.

                                       MARCEL
                          I'm sorry! I was caught up in the
                          excitement of the moment. I should have
                          checked. I made a mistake. I suppose
                          that none of you have ever made a mistake
                          before?

               No one answers him. Sami reaches inside the black canvas bag and
               removes the autographed baseball Marcel took from Zammito.

                                       SAMI
                          This is great. After everything we've
                          been through we've got eight hundred
                          euros and an autographed baseball.

                                       MARCEL
                          The baseball is mine.

                                       SAMI
                          No! You can't have the baseball! You're
                          not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!

               Sami throws the baseball back in the canvas bag.

                                       MARCEL
                          I'm the one who took it.   It's my
                          baseball!

                                       ZERO
                          If you say baseball one more time Zero
                          will shoot you.

                                       MARCEL
                          Raymond, don't you think they're over
                          reacting a little?

                                       RAYMOND
                          No. I think they have a right to express
                          their anger with you in light of the
                          fact that you're...
                               (something in him
                                snaps)

                          A FUCKIN' MORON! HOW COULD YOU NOT CHECK

                          THE MONEY, YOU GOD DAMN STUPID SHIT-HEAD!

               Raymond's anger takes everyone by surprise.     Even Raymond is
               surprised by his outburst.

                                       MARCEL
                          Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be
                          angry... but I'm the one who took the
                          ball and that makes it mine.

                                          SAMI
                          No.

               

                                                                          109.

               

                                       MARCEL
                          Give it to me, Sami.

                                        SAMI
                          No!

               Marcel tries to take the ball out of the bag. Sami pulls it away.
               Marcel grabs the bag. Both of them tug on it. Marcel pulls hard
               and the bag rips down the seam. The baseball falls out and rolls
               off the bridge into the river.

                                        SAMI
                          Perfect.

               Marcel stands there holding the inside liner of the bag.
               Sami throws the canvas bag to the ground in frustration.
               Something catches Daniel's attention.

               DANIEL'S POV -- of the black canvas. The lining has been ripped
               away. A light breeze blows lifting the underside of the black
               canvas. There is a flash of color. Another gust of wind turns
               the black canvas over. On the other side is Van Gogh's "Vase with
               twelve sunflowers".

               Daniel's jaw drops.   The others notice his stunned expression and
               follow his stare.

               THEIR POV -- of the priceless painting.
               They stand there, too shocked to move at first, then rush forward.
               They have almost reached the painting when a truck passes them.
               The wind kicks up the painting, blowing it over the railing. They
               reach out to grab it, but it is too far away. They stand there,
               watching as it slowly floats down to the river below.

               

               EXT. BRIDGE -- WIDE SHOT -- AFTERNOON

               They look at one an other, then without speaking a word they all
               jump off the bridge. As they fall towards the water we...

               

                                                                  FREEZE FRAME
