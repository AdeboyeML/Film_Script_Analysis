           Borden must have put it under the

          OWENS, 50's a lawyer, stands at the entry gate. The CAPTAIN
          of the guard walks out to greet him.

                          CAPTAIN (CONT'D)
           Not my idea, sir. The Warden saw
           his show in Manchester last year
           where he vanished into thin air-
           he's convinced he'll try an escape.

                         
          Owens smiles as he hands over his pocket watch ans wallet.
          They walk along a hall wrought iron fence. The PRISON looms
          over them.
          A door in the prison opens and Borden emerges, trussed
          absurdly in chains held by two WARDERS. The other INMATES
          begin cattle-calling and whistling as BOrden is paraded up
          to a WOODEN SECTION of the fence.

           out with the others immates.

                         
          At the fence, the Warders lock the ends of their chains to a
          thick eye hook set into the ground.

           The audience doesn't seem to be
           responding much, Cutter.

           This is a grand theatre with a
           sophisticated audience- They've
           seen most of these tricks before.
           But not this next one. You'll see.
          Cutter checks the SPRINGS of the harness and replaces Angier's
          coat. He spots a STAGEHAND poking his head around the flies.

          Angier steps to the table center stage. Pulls out the bird
          cage. There are one or two groans from the audience. Angier
          SMILES as he produces a DOVE with a FLOURISH.

          Red beard's other hand appears on the top of the cage- it is
          MUTILATED, missing fingers.

          Lady who is still SCREAMING as Angier tries to free her

           It was the greatest magic trick I
           have ever seen.
          Borden walks to one side of the stage and OPENS the door to
          one of the cabinets. It's empty. He CLOSES it again and
          crosses the stage, BOUNCING the ball the whole way.
          At the far cabinet, Borden repeats the process, OPENING the
          door to the empty cabinet. This time, however, he leaves
          the door open.
          He steps forwards and GENTLY BOUNCES the ball SIDEWAYS, across
          the stage...
          Borden STEPS into the CABINET behind him, CLOSING the door.
          With no one on stage, the audience watches as the ball
          continues to BOUNCE across the stage. BOUNCE. BOUNCE.
          BOUNCE. The ball loses seep and height...
          Just as reaches the second cabinet, something IMPOSSIBLE
          happens.

          Angier gracefully TURNS and heads upstage to the right-hand
          door, opens it, SLAPS it to show that is sold.

                         
          Then strolls through crossing the stage-

                         
          -to the other door, which he opens, SLAPPING to show its
          solidity, then walking trough the frame.

                         
          Angier removes his TOP HAT and THROWS it high into the air.
          It sails back down to him and he catches it.

                         
          Angier THROWS the HAT again, even harder this time, and it
          disappears uo into the rafters. After a beat, it is clear
          it's not coming back down.

                         
          LAUGHTER. Angier snaps his fingers and the hat is dropped
          back down to him. He catches it.

                         
          Angier movies to the first door and THROWS HIS HAT in a HIGH
          ARC across the stage. He OPENS the door- steps behind it...

                         
          The second DOOR, FAR ACROSS THE STAGE, IMMEDIATELY opens and

          ANGIER/ROOT EMERGES, REACHING UP TO CATCH THE HAT.

                         
          BOTH DOORS SLAMS SHUT behind him. He puts on the hat.

                         
          The AUDIENCE ERUPTS- A STANDING OVATION, Fallon the only one
          in his seat as Angier/Root takes his BOWS.

          Angier, hearing the MASSIVE APPLAUSE, climbs off the straw
          mattress, PEERING up through the cracks in the floorboards.

                         
          Smiling, Angier turns to the unseen audience and BOWS.

           The manager said he's never seen a
           reaction like it.
          Angier smiles, rueful.

                          ANGIER
           At least he got to see it. I spent
           the ovation hidden under the stage.
           No one cares about the man who
           disappears, the man who goes into
           the box. They care about the man
           who comes out the other side.

                          OLIVIA
           I care about the man in the box.
          Angier turns to Olivia, raises his glass.

                          (TO CUTTER)
           Maybe we could switch before the
           trick. That way I could be the
           Prestige and Root ends up below stage.

           The antecipation of the trick is
           everything- it needs your showmanship
           to built suspense. If Root opens
           his mouth, it's all over- he can't
           introduce the trick.

           ROOT (O.S.)
           of course I can. I'm the Great
           Danton.
          They turn. Root is lying behind a trunk, still in costume.

                          CUTTER
           Root, you bloody fool, get that
           costume and makeup off right now,
           anyone could walk in here!

                         
          Cutter is SLAPPING Root to his feet. He grabs his collar
          and turns to Angier and Olivia.

          Angier looks up at her with a gentle smile. She pulls him
          in closer and they KISS. She wraps her legs around him.
          They kiss again.

          Tesla RISES. Leads Angier to a back corner at the room and
          pulls a SHEET from a ten-foot tall apparatus- the ELECTRICAL

          Alley FIRES a GENERATOR connected by thick cables to the

          Angier takes off his hat and tries to hand it to Tesla.
          Alley intercepts the hat and lays it on a chalk hasmark
          directly underneath the machine. He returns to the controls.

          Without further ceremony, Alley FIRES the machine.

                         
          Nothing happens. Then, as they watch, the GLOBE on top of
          the tripped FLASHES whits hot. BOLTS shooting out of it,
          wrapping themselves around the legs of the tripod. The CHARGE
          reaches a FREEZY and then emits a loud BANG, as if it has
          broken the sound barrier.

                         
          Suddenly the room is still.

          Alley joins him at the edge of the pit. Angier, limping,
          is the last to arrive, locking into the pit-

                         
          -at the TOP HAT, which hasn't moved an inch.

           My point, Robert, is that you've
           climbed too high to get away with
           any kind of professional

           No. It's killing him. He's obssessed
           with discovering your method. he
           thinks of nothing else, and takes no
           pleasure in our success. I've had
           enough. There is no future with

           The truth is that I loved him. And

           Science is just a name for the art

          animal bu its collar to a eye-hook sunk into the ground.

          BOLTS spew from the head of the machine, down towards the

          Alley breathes a sigh of relief and starts to free the car.

          Two IDENTICAL CATS are fighting viciously in front of Angier.

          Borden walks along a disused strecth of industrial canal

           Well, of course, sir...But I'm afraid
           I'm booked. The Moscow Ballet.

           Get rid of them. This is a magical
           act. An excellent one. I believe
           you booked his first engagement
           several years ago. The Great Danton.

          Borden inches forward in his seat. Angier stands in front
          of the machine, silhouetted by the FRENZY of electricity
          behind him. He TOSSES his cane to his assistant and steps
          into the machine.
          The audience SCREAMS as large bolts BLAST from the machine
          and wrap themselves around ANGIER'S ARMS and legs.
          Borden is watching very carefully. Angier is almost
          impossible to see as the machine builds to a climax, but,
          just before it does; Borden catches a glimpse of ANGIER'S

          BODY FALLING THROUGH A TRAP DOOR.

          sparks through gaps in the boards of the stage above. He
          GASPS as a flash illuminates a STAGEHAND with SOLID WHITE
