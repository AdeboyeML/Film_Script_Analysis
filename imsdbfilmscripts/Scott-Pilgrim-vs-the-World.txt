          hockey puck, but actually it comes
          from the Japanese phrase paku-paku

          out of the library. Pensive guitar underscores his thoughts.

          Ohh...kay.
          They look into each others eyes...camera circles Scott and
          Ramona as they begin an awesome make out session. Scott
          imagines himself soundtracking the kiss with a slinky bassline.
          Ramona breaks off, smiling. Scott is in heaven.

          I can...not have tea.
          The slinky bassline continues as Ramona takes her skirt off,
          revealing black panties to complement black bra. Scott takes
          his shirt off. They tumble onto the bed and make out. Then-

                         RAMONA
          I changed my mind.

                         SCOTT

          Patel. Consider our fight...begun!

          What did I do?
          Matthew Patel leaps in the air and sails toward Scott.

          What do I do?!

          FIGHT!
          Scott throws his bass to Young Neil and BLOCKS Patel with his
          left arm, then PUNCHES him across the floor with his right.
          Patel LANDS like a cat, FLIPS his fringe and GLARES at Scott.

                         MATTHEW PATEL
          Alright. Alright.

          Thank you, Wallace!
          Patel RUNS at Scott. Scott SPIN KICKS Patel in the chin and
          sends him flying into the air. They land in THE PIT, knocking
          hipsters down and squaring off in the resulting circle.

          Patel attacks again. They exchange furious blows, until Patel
          puts Scott in a choke hold. Scott looks up to Ramona.

          It was football season and for some
          reason, all the little jocks wanted
          me. Matthew was the only non-white,
          non-jock boy in school, probably in
          the entire state, so we joined
          forces and took 'em all out. We
          were one hell of a team. Nothing
          could beat Matthew's mystical
          powers. Nothing but pre-teen
          capriciousness. We only kissed
          once. After a week and a half, I
          told him to hit the showers.

          Ha. No, sorry. It's just that I
          got... I got a bad haircut right
          before me and my big ex broke up. But
          it's so long ago, I can barely
          remember it...
          A deep voiced NARRATOR chimes in. Earl Jones deep.

                         NARRATOR
          Scott is acutely aware that his last
          salon haircut took place exactly 431
          days ago, three hours before his big
          breakup. He blames this largely on the
          haircut and has been cutting his own
          hair ever since.

                         RAMONA
          Sounds like a bad time.

          I mean, she told me it was mutual.

          She dumped him. It was brutal.

          Yeah. I don't know. I just, when I'm
          with you I feel like I'm on drugs. Not
          that I do drugs, unless you do, in

          percent of your brain? Well, it's
          because the other 90% is filled up
          with curds and whey.

          As Roxy's leg descends, Scott reaches up with one finger and
          lightly TICKLES the back of Roxy's knee.

          GIDEON GRAVES (O.S)
          Sure you did. Well as you know, I'm
          opening a new Chaos Theatre in
          Toronto and The Sex Bobs are
          playing our grand opening tonight,
          and it would feel really weird for
          all of us if you weren't there.
          They just did a sound check and the
          acoustics in here are amazing.

          92 EXT. STREETS OF TORONTO - NIGHT 92

          Snow blows around a steely eyed Scott as he stomps towards a
          group of desolate WAREHOUSES near the water. A lone HIPSTER
          KID smokes a cigarette, leaning against a warehouse wall.

          The warehouse is empty. Scott follows the sound of music to a
          GATED ELEVATOR. Two Hipster Kids guard the elevator.

                         HIPSTER KID

          Scott gives the slightest shrug.

          Scott exits the elevator and steps into GIDEON'S UNDERGROUND
          LAIR OF COOL SHIT...the CHAOS THEATRE.
          All HIPSTER KIDS have gathered in one spot of ultimate
          snobbery. They are legion, wearing identical outfits; Chuck
          Taylors, skinny jeans. COMEAU holds court among them.

                         COMEAU
          Yeah, their first album is so much
          better than their first album.
          Scott pushes through the idiot hordes. SEX BOB-OMB are
          playing onstage, now using SWEET BRAND amps, YOUNG NEIL on
          bass. Stills sees Scott walking by as they finish a song.

                         STEPHEN STILLS

          Scott pauses, looking up at his former bandmates.

          GIDEON GRAVES (O.S.)
          Scott Pilgrim!
          Scott turns to see GIDEON sitting on a throne of cool atop a
          BLACK VELVET VIP PYRAMID. Ramona kneels at his side.

                         GIDEON GRAVES
          Hey buddy, welcome to the Chaos
          Theatre. Somebody get this man a
          drink! Coke Zero right?
          A COCKTAIL WAITRESS with a fringe appears with a Coke Zero.
          Scott takes the beverage and THROWS THE CUP TO THE FLOOR!

                         SCOTT
          I'm not here to drink.

          Scott gets into a fighting stance. Gideon loses his cool.

          Sex Bob-Omb shake their heads. Gideon stands up, flexes.

          Because, I'm in love with her.
          Ramona and Scott lock eyes. A new power comes over Scott. He
          reaches for the HEART DESIGN printed on his ratty vintage T-
          shirt and pulls a FLAMING BLUE SWORD from his own chest.

          Wallace, when my journey began, I
          was living in an ordinary world.
          Ramona skated through my dreams and
          it was like a call to adventure, a
          call I considered refusing. But my
          Mentor, that's you, told me if I
          want something bad enough I have to
          fight for it. So I did. There were
          tests, allies, enemies. I
          approached a deep cave and went
          through a crazy ordeal, during
          which I totally seized the sword.
          Sadly, I died. Then I resurrected!
          Now I realize what I should have
          been fighting for all along. But
          before I do that, I need to ask one
          final favor of you.

          UP - his glasses glow, his HEALTH BAR increases. He makes an
          'X' with his fingers and a draws a NEW POWER UP SWORD.
          He cuts big arcs at Scott, Knives and Ramona. They barely
          dodge him. Scott SPIES his sword and picks it up just in time
          to BLOCK Gideon's attack. The swords create an 'X'.
          Ramona KICKS. Gideon BLOCKS, knocking her down.
          Gideon swings at Scott. Scott ducks. Knives attacks and
          scores a hit. Gideon hits her back, dropping her.
          SCOTT ATTACKS. They fence. Gideon spins low. Scott leaps in
          the air. Gideon spins again and swings upward. Scott blocks
          with his sword and is sent UP into the air. Gideon jumps
          after him. They CLASH in the air. Scott's sword SHATTERS.

          Scott lands hard. Gideon lands in front of him and raises his
          sword for the kill. Ramona swings Gideon's VELVET ROPE,
          cancelling out Gideon's digital sword.
          Gideon SLAPS Ramona in the face and sends her painfully
          tumbling down the pyramid. She lands painfully at the bottom.
          Knives and Scott share a look. They Get up and circle Gideon.
          COMBO ATTACK! FREEZE FRAME PUNCHES: Knives kicks and Scott
          punches, sending Gideon back and forth like a pinball: KICK
          PUNCH KICK PUNCH KICK! Gideon's face smashes with each
          impact.
          Ramona rises to see Scott and Knives kicking ass.
          Scott slides Knives through Gideon's legs. From the floor,
          she kicks him in the back of the head, then upends him like a
          wheelbarrow and KICKS HIM IN THE FACE, sending him spinning.
          Gideon lands HARD on his knees, defeated. One lens of his
          glasses cracks. He looks up at the steely eyed Scott.

          Scott spins and BACK HEELS Gideon in the face.
          Gideon's head EXPLODES, his glasses SAILING down the steps of
          the pyramid. Then his body follows suit in an almighty-

          SHIMMERING COINS rain down. Scott and Knives kiss.

          The coin rain continues, silhouetting Scott and Knives in

          The trio walk down the pyramid steps. Scott picks up Gideon's

          Scott peers into the glimmering lenses, spotting his EVIL

          NEGASCOTT walks towards Scott, Knives and Ramona. Fringed
          hair. Dark clothes. Evil face.
          Knives and Ramona flank Scott in a fighting stance.

          No. This is something I have to

          The girls reluctantly exit stage left as Scott walks forward

          Scott strolls out with Negascott. They chat amiably, shake

          Scott smiles, then realizes Ramona has gone. He turns to see
          her, pulling her hood up and walking into the darkness.
          Scott calls after her. Steps tentatively away from Knives.
