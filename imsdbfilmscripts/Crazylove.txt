          FADE IN:
          
          INT. BEDROOM - APARTMENT - DAY
          
          The sweet silence of slumber. Suddenly, an alarm clock on a
          nightstand SHRIEKS the operatic tones of Maria Callas.
          
          A well-manicured hand, nails painted pink, slaps the snooze
          button and mutes Maria. A few seconds reprieve.
          
          Then, another clock, stationed on a dresser, broadcasts the
          FORTISSIMO POUNDING of the "William Tell Overture." Toes,
          also painted pink, swing out of bed and run to the dresser.
          
          LETTY MAYER, late 20s and beautiful, turns off the music.
          She opens a dresser drawer and surveys panties that are
          arranged by color, from white to beige to black. Behind the
          panties are rows of bras, also organized by color. Letty
          pulls out some taupe undergarments, checks them against her
          nails and replaces them in favor of a pink bra and panties.
          
          Letty goes to her closet and removes a tailored, pink linen
          suit. She lays it on the bed. Beast, her cat, jumps on the
          bed and settles into the jacket. Letty swoops the animal off
          her clothes and brushes cat hair from the suit.
          
                               LETTY
                     Listen, Beast. What have I told
                     you about linen?
          
          The scolding is cut short by an "Urge Overkill" song that
          SCREAMS OUT from another room. On cue, Letty heads down the
          hall, dressing as she goes. She CLUCKS for Beast to follow.
          
          INT. KITCHEN - SAME
          
          Letty turns off the alarm clock that BLASTS "Urge Overkill"
          from the counter and checks the time against her watch.
          
          She swings open a cupboard to look at cans of cat food
          arranged by type. Seafood on the left, chicken in the
          middle, then, naturally, beef. Letty reaches for a can.
          
                               LETTY
                         (looking at Beast)
                     It's liver saute.
          
          Letty considers the cat a moment, and chooses another can.
          
                               LETTY
          
                     Fine, then, chicken in gravy. But
                     you're going to have to eat the
                     liver tomorrow.
          
                                                                      2.
          
          
          
          INT. BATHROOM - SAME
          
          Letty puts the finishing touches on her make-up and pulls
          back her hair, plastering an errant curl into place with hair
          spray. Yet another alarm clock sounds, this time BLARING the
          voice of shock jocks MARK AND BRIAN.
          
          INT. ENTRY HALL - SAME
          
          Letty hurries down the hall and turns off the clock, which is
          mounted near the front door. She bends down to kiss the cat
          good-bye, grabs a briefcase and leaves.
          
          EXT. HALLWAY - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
          
          A school bell BUZZES. Grade-schoolers, clutching lunch
          pails, scurry past Letty, who stands outside an office door.
          She straightens her jacket, takes a deep breath and starts to
          turn the handle.
          
          Letty is stopped cold when CHANDRA, 7, the victim of a bloody
          nose, runs up to her, bawling.
          
                              CHANDRA
                    Miss Mayer. Miss Mayer.
          
          Letty looks quickly at Chandra, her watch, the door.
          
                              LETTY
                        (to Chandra)
                    Goodness, this is a bad one.   Tip
                    your head back.
          
          She bends down and pushes back Chandra's head. Chandra, off
          balance, places one very bloody hand on Letty's jacket lapel,
          staining it for all eternity.
          
          Letty, grimacing, takes the bloody hand firmly in her own and
          guides Chandra down the hall, coaxing the child as she goes.
          
                              LETTY
                    Come on. Pinch it, Chandra. Pinch
                    it.
          
          INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER
          
          PRINCIPAL GAIL LAUER, 40s, sits in uncomfortable silence with
          BILL JOHANSEN, the 50-something school Superintendent. Also
          present are MRS. MONTES, who is a School Board Member, and
          two other BOARD MEMBERS.
          
          Principal Gail glances at the clock. Mrs. Montes taps her
          foot. Johansen clears his throat.
          
                                                                     3.
          
          
          
                              JOHANSEN
                    Well, I have a full calendar today,
                    and I'm afraid...
          
          The door bursts open. Letty stumbles into the room. She
          clutches her briefcase to her chest, trying to cover her
          blood-smeared lapel.
          
                              LETTY
                    Mr. Johansen, hello. I'm so sorry
                    I'm late. It's very nice to meet
                    you.
          
          Letty continues to hug the briefcase while awkwardly bending
          down to shake hands with Johansen and the others.
          
                              PRINCIPAL GAIL
                    The Superintendent was just getting
                    ready to leave.
          
                              LETTY
                    I do apologize.    A student had a
                    crisis.
          
                              MRS. MONTES
                    A crisis, you say?
          
                              LETTY
                    A bloody nose...
          
          There is no response. Letty reluctantly lowers the briefcase
          and reveals the stain.
          
                              LETTY
                    A bloody nose of epic proportions.
          
          Johansen smiles.
          
                              JOHANSEN
                    OK, Miss Mayer. Ten minutes.     Wow
                    us.
          
          EXT. PLAYGROUND - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - LATER
          
          A bunch of BOYS play kickball in a haze of sawdust. Chandra
          sits on a bench, clamping an ice pack to her nose. JENNY, a
          limber 8-year-old, hangs upside down from the jungle gym.
          
          Letty talks on her CELL PHONE. She glances around to monitor
          her wards, eyes darting like a hawk's toward the kickball
          game.
          
                                                                   4.
          
          
          
                               LETTY
                    No cherry drops, Jenny.
                        (into the phone)
                    Yes, hi. I'm calling for Paul
                    Lascher.
                        (beat)
                    Could you tell him it's Letty?
                        (beat)
                    He can't? Um, well, tell him, tell
                    him that they went for my math
                    idea. Thanks.
          
          Letty dials again. She sees two boys fighting over the ball
          and moves in to break them up.
          
                               LETTY
                        (to boys)
                    Not so rough, guys.
                        (into phone)
                    Mom? Hi. You'll never guess
                    what...I've got the best news.
                        (beat)
                    No, about work. How about dinner?
          
          Brawl averted, out of the corner of her eye, Letty catches
          Jenny make the daring Cherry Drop back flip off the bar. She
          blows a series of ANGRY, STACCATO NOTES on her whistle.
          
                               LETTY
                        (to Jenny)
                    You're in trouble, young lady.
                        (into the phone)
                    I know, Mom. But it's the only
                    place I can call from.
                        (beat)
                    Can you tell Ruth about dinner?
                        (beat)
                    Paul's fine, just fine.
          
          The class bell BUZZES.
          
                              LETTY
                    Got to go, Mom.   The monsters call.
          
          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          Tuxedoed waiters glide through the tony restaurant, where the
          patrons dare speak only in hushed tones. Letty sits sipping
          wine with her mother, MRS. MARTHA MAYER, immaculate in a
          cream suit, young looking for her 50-odd years.
          
                                                                   5.
          
          
          
          Letty's sister RUTH--early 20s and pretty, with flyaway hair
          and an ever-present smile--bounds into the restaurant, oozing
          happiness. Letty discretely waves her over.
          
                              RUTH
                    Sorry I'm late.
          
          Letty pours her a glass of wine.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Letty was just getting ready to
                    tell me her good news.
          
                              RUTH
                        (to Letty)
                    Tell, tell.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                        (leaning toward Letty)
                    Letty, dear, is that a cat hair on
                    your blouse?
          
          Letty removes the nasty hair from her blouse.
          
                              LETTY
                    So, I got the district to approve
                    my after-school math program.
          
          Ruth smiles at her, but vacantly.
          
                               MRS. MAYER
                    How wonderful, darling.
                        (beat)
                    What does that mean for you?
          
                              LETTY
                    I'll be running it three days a
                    week, and...
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Will you get time off to do that?
          
                              LETTY
                    Not now, but maybe later, if they
                    like the program.
          
          Ruth stares around the restaurant, a shit-eating grin
          plastered across her face.
          
                              LETTY
                        (to Ruth)
                    What's up with you?
          
                                                                 6.
          
          
          
                             RUTH
                    Me? Nothing. Tell me more about
                    the job.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                        (to Ruth)
                    Not a job, a promotion.
          
                              LETTY
                    No, Mom, it's more of a prestige
                    thing.
          
                               RUTH
                    Mmmmmmm.
          
          Letty passes her hand in front of Ruth's eyes.
          
                               LETTY
                    Ruth.   Calling Ruth.
          
                              RUTH
                        (laughing)
                    Sorry.
          
                              LETTY
                    Just go ahead and tell us.
          
                              RUTH
                    There's nothing to tell.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                        (to Ruth)
                    Are you sure, Dear?
          
                               LETTY
                    Come on.
          
                               RUTH
                    No, really. Tell me about the
                    promotion.
          
                              LETTY
                    Well, my theory is that people can
                    really enjoy math, but they lose
                    interest...
          
          Ruth can't hold it a moment longer without bursting.
          
                              RUTH
                        (almost screaming)
                    I'm getting married.
          
                                                                   7.
          
          
          
          Mrs. Mayer's eyes immediately fill with tears. Ruth leaps up
          and hugs her mother. Other diners glance toward the table.
          
          One WOMAN IN THE RESTAURANT taps the side of her glass with
          her fork and raises a silent toast to Ruth. Other DINERS
          follow suit. Ruth grins back and starts to giggle.
          
                               MRS. MAYER
                    I'm so happy for you.     It's just
                    wonderful.
          
          Mrs. Mayer dabs her eyes with her napkin.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    My goodness. A wedding.      My
                    goodness.
          
                               LETTY
                    Wow.   Congratulations.
          
          Ruth dashes around the table to embrace the stunned Letty.
          
                              RUTH
                        (to Letty)
                    Can you believe it?
          
          Ruth sits back down and pulls a gorgeous ring from her purse.
          She slips it on and wiggles her finger in front of Letty and
          her mother, who peers at it with approval.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Tell us every detail.
          
                              LETTY
                    You've only known Jake a few
                    months.
          
                              RUTH
                    Three and a week.
                        (screaming again)
                    Isn't it great?
          
                               MRS. MAYER
                    My goodness. What about an
                    engagement party? We must start
                    planning.
                        (signaling a waiter)
                    Champagne. Girls, we need some
                    champagne.
          
          Off Letty's frozen smile, we
          
                                                      CUT TO:

          INT. BEDROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Letty's in bed, drawing a giant multiplication chart. PAUL
          LASCHER, early 30s, handsome in a corporate way, shrugs off
          his expensive suit.
          
          He opens a drawer of Letty's dresser, and removes a neatly
          pressed T-shirt. He smooths out another shirt he has
          accidently rumpled in the process.
          
                              PAUL
                    So, another one bites the dust.
          
                               LETTY
                    It's not another one. It's my
                    sister.
                        (beat)
                    Aren't you happy for her?
          
                              PAUL
                    She's only known the guy a few
                    months.
          
          Paul lays his folded trousers across Letty's desk.
          
                              PAUL
                    Can I put these here for tonight?
          
                               LETTY
                        (pointing to the closet)
                    In there's better.
                        (beat)
                    It's kind of romantic, don't you
                    think?
          
                              PAUL
                    I really think if you're going to
                    spend your life with someone you
                    want to know them pretty damn well.
          
          Paul sits on the bed, and leans against a pillow.
          
                              LETTY
                    Believe me, I know your feelings on
                    the matter.
          
                              PAUL
                    The receptionist said you called
                    earlier about something.
          
          Letty holds up her multiplication chart and shows it to Paul.
          
                                                        9.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    My math program. The
                    Superintendent said he'd fund it.
          
                              PAUL
                    Good going. I knew you could do
                    it.
          
          Paul kisses Letty on the cheek.
          
                              PAUL
                    It looks like we're both bucking
                    for advancement.
          
                               LETTY
                    Yeah?
          
                              PAUL
                    Huntley told me today that if I
                    come through on the Benton
                    deposition, they may consider me
                    for senior associate.
          
          Letty hugs Paul.
          
                               LETTY
                    Congratulations.    We should
                    celebrate.
          
                              PAUL
                    I was thinking dinner on Friday
                    with James and Meg at the Saint
                    Mark.
          
                              LETTY
                    I mean tonight.
          
          Letty sensually caresses his shoulders.
          
                              LETTY
                    Like right now...
          
                              PAUL
                    Actually, I need to review the
                    deposition questions tonight.
                    Maybe tomorrow?
          
                               LETTY
                    Oh, ok.   Maybe.
          
                                                                    10.
          
          
          
                              PAUL
                    But I thought if you don't mind,
                    you could listen and see how I come
                    across?
          
                               LETTY
                        (beat)
                    Sure. Of course.
          
          Letty continues coloring her multiplication chart.
          
                               PAUL
                    Letty, please, I need your full
                    attention.
          
          Letty puts the chart down and sits up straighter.
          
                              LETTY
                    Let me have it.
          
          INT. CLASSROOM - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
          
          Letty rubs her eyes with fatigue.    Bobby stands next to her
          holding a crumpled paper bag.
          
                              BOBBY
                    My dog ate my turtle, and the shell
                    went crunch. I brought it for show-
                    and-tell.
          
          The children perk up at this news.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm sorry about your turtle Bobby,
                    but you know we only have show-and-
                    tell on Mondays. Today, we're
                    scheduled for grammar.
          
                              BOBBY
                    But my mom says I have to throw it
                    away tonight.
          
          Bobby opens the bag. He reaches in to remove the turtle. The
          children TITTER. Letty's on him in a second.
          
                              LETTY
                    Don't even think about it.
          
          She grabs the bag. From outside, there is a KNOCK.     Letty
          and the students look toward the window.
          
          It's Ruth. She's been crying.   She waves to Letty.    Chandra
          waves back at Ruth.
          
                                                                     11.
          
          
          
          Letty puts up her finger to signal "just a minute" to Ruth.
          She sets the turtle bag on Bobby's desk.
          
                              LETTY
                    Class, why don't you...
          
          Ruth knocks on the glass again. Letty glances at her
          distraught sister and walks quickly toward the door.
          
                              LETTY
                        (to class)
                    You guys pull out your verb sheets
                    and review them.
          
          Letty leaves the room. The class watches through the window
          as Ruth throws her sobbing self into Letty's arms.
          
          EXT. HALLWAY - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - SAME
          
                              RUTH
                    She says she won't even come if Dad
                    brings Monica.
          
                              LETTY
                    Mom won't miss your wedding.
                    She'll come around. I promise she
                    will.
          
          Letty glances through the window at her classroom, where
          Bobby waves the turtle over his head.
          
                              RUTH
                    How?
          
                               LETTY
                    I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.
                        (beat)
                    A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics
                    and they'll be ours.
          
                              RUTH
                    Maybe if we had them both to dinner
                    or something.
          
          Letty looks again at the classroom, where the students are
          lobbing the turtle back and forth.
          
                              LETTY
                    Maybe.
          
                              RUTH
                    You always throw the best dinner
                    parties, Letty.
          
                                                                   12.
          
          
          
          Letty's attention snaps back to Ruth.
          
                              LETTY
                    Oh, wait a minute, now I see where
                    you're going.
          
                              RUTH
                    Please, Letty.
          
                              LETTY
                    Mom and Dad? At dinner together?
                    Are you crazy?
          
          Ruth starts to sob--big, loud, air-gulping sobs.   Letty pats
          her shoulder.
          
                              LETTY
                    Maybe, though. Maybe it would
                    work. I could throw you an
                    engagement party maybe.
          
                              RUTH
                    Really?
          
          Principal Gail, trolling the halls, spies Letty with Ruth.
          She dispatches a stern look in Letty's direction.
          
                              LETTY
                        (nodding toward Gail)
                    You know what, Ruthie? I better get
                    back to my class, OK?
          
                              RUTH
                    And the party?
          
                              LETTY
                    Yeah, it'll be fun.
          
          Ruth grabs Letty in another hug.
          
                              RUTH
                    Thank you so much.
          
          INT. CLASSROOM - SAME
          
          Letty strides into the classroom, pulls the turtle away from
          Bobby and drops it in the trash.
          
                              LETTY
                    Who can come up here and give me a
                    sentence with a "to be" verb in it?
          
                                                                     13.
          
          
          
                              ZACH
                    Who was that girl?
          
                              LETTY
                    Come on up, Zach.
          
          Zach approaches the board and begins to write, "I am..."    He
          doesn't get any further before Letty cuts him off.
          
                              LETTY
                    Neater, Zach.
          
          Zach begins again, but Letty stops him when he reaches "am."
          
                              LETTY
                    Zach, you know the line by the "a"
                    has to come straight down or it
                    looks like an "o."
          
          Zach looks back toward his classmates for help.
          
                              LETTY
                    What's wrong, Zach?
          
          Letty picks up a piece of chalk and writes an "a." She
          erases it furiously and works at it until the "a" is perfect.
                               L
                              LETTY
                    Try again, Zach.    Like that.
          
          Letty jabs at the board with a piece of chalk. Zach freezes.
          He sees Letty's shoes, her arm, her contorted face, and,
          above all else, that perfect "a" staring right back down at
          him.
          
          Letty grips Zach's arm, guiding the chalk to form what looks
          like a pretty good "a."
          
                              LETTY
                    I don't believe it.    You still
                    can't do it.
          
                              ZACH
                    I'm sorry, OK, Miss Mayer?
          
                              LETTY
                    No, it's not OK. You'll never get
                    to college on OK.
          
          Letty's fingers press into Zach's arm. A tear slides
          ominously down his cheek.
          
                                                                   14.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    It has to be good, Zach.   Do you
                    understand me?
          
          Zach wrests free of Letty. He's in full cry now. He backs
          away, stumbles, then makes a run for his seat. Bobby
          SNICKERS at Zach's misfortune. Other children glance around,
          unsure, confused.
          
          Letty looks vacantly at the children, stares at the board and
          looks at the children again.
          
          She sits down at her desk and buries her face in her hands.
          Letty's fists, clenched at first, slowly relax. She takes a
          deep breath and raises her head.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm very, very sorry, Zach.
          
          Zach continues to cry. Letty looks down at her desk. She
          grabs a piece of construction paper and a jar of paste.
          
                              LETTY
                    You know what, guys? Wednesday's
                    not a grammar day. It's a collage
                    day. It's a collage ON THE WALL
                    day.
          
          Letty jumps up. She slaps the paper on the wall with some
          paste. She motions for the students to join her.
          
          The children slowly approach her. Zach lags behind.
          
                              LETTY
                    And, Zach? Zach, I want you to be
                    in charge of paste.
          
          INT. BEDROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - DAY
          
          Letty lies in bed. The alarm clock BLASTS opera. Letty
          fumbles for the switch. She can't turn it off. She yanks
          out the cord.
          L
          Letty gets out of bed, walks to the dresser and turns off the
          second clock before it rings. She goes to the KITCHEN and
          snaps off the alarm, then heads down the HALLWAY and shuts
          that alarm off, as well.
          
          Letty hurries back to her BEDROOM and crawls into bed.   Paul,
          toweling his hair dry, walks in.
          
                                                                  15.
          
          
          
                              PAUL
                    What are you doing?    You're going
                    to be late.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm calling in sick.
          
          Paul sits on the bed and puts his hand to Letty's forehead.
          
                              PAUL
                    You don't have a fever.
          
                              LETTY
                    I don't feel like going to work
                    today.
          
                              PAUL
                    Won't it be hard for them to get a
                    substitute this late?
          
                              LETTY
                    It'll be OK.
          
                              PAUL
                    But what about that math project?
          
                              LETTY
                    Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK
                    with you or am I committing some
                    horrible crime?
          
                              PAUL
                    Forget I asked.
          
                               LETTY
                    I'm sorry.
                        (beat)
                    I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
          
                              PAUL
                    Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
          
                              LETTY
                    No, it's not like that.
          
          Letty starts to cry.
          
                              LETTY
                    It's just I've got those parent
                    conferences, and I'm supposed to
                    set up the math program by next
                    week.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                     16.
                              LETTY(cont'd)
                    And shopping for Ruth's dress and
                    that, that engagement dinner.
          
                              PAUL
                    You can get out of the dinner.
          
                              LETTY
                    No, I can't. I've already
                    convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
          
                              PAUL
                    Come on, Letty.   It'll get done.
          
          Paul touches Letty's shoulder. She pulls away from him.
          
                              LETTY
                    I don't think so.
          
                              PAUL
                    Of course it will. Remember the
                    big talent show you planned last
                    year? And what about the Christmas
                    benefit when Santa canceled at the
                    last minute? But you still pulled
                    it off.
          
                              LETTY
                    Yeah.
          
                               PAUL
                    You just need to get more
                    organized. L
          
                              LETTY
                    Maybe.
          
                              PAUL
                    Let's make a list of the things you
                    need to do, OK?
          
          Letty nods her head, and Paul grabs a legal pad from his
          briefcase.
          
          INT. CLASSROOM - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT
          
          MR. and MRS. ANDERSON, over-eager parents, sit across the
          desk from Letty, who stares at the legal pad in her lap. As
          the Andersons talk, Letty twists a lock of hair tighter and
          tighter.
          
                              MRS. ANDERSON
                    So at home, we've started our own
                    little library for Chandra.
          
                                                                  17.
          
          
          
                              MR. ANDERSON
                    We thought it would be a good
                    project for her to set up her own
                    card-catalogue.
          
                              LETTY
                    I see.
          
          Letty tries unsuccessfully to extricate her hand from her
          hair.
          
                              MRS. ANDERSON
                    But what I'm wondering is whether
                    we should also be spending more
                    time on her computer skills at
                    home. What do you think?
          
                              LETTY
                    Well...
          
                              MR. ANDERSON
                    Because we don't want her to get
                    behind her classmates.
          
                              MRS. ANDERSON
                    And we trust your opinion.
                    Chandra's always talking about Miss
                    Mayer.
          
                              LETTY
                    Oh.
          
                              MR. ANDERSON
                    Just the other day she came home
                    and told us about you taking care
                    of her bloody nose.
          
                              MRS. ANDERSON
                    And she went on and on about the
                    collage. That seems very
                    inventive, Miss Mayer.
          
          Letty stares blankly at the couple.
          
                              MR. ANDERSON
                    Miss Mayer?
          
                              LETTY
                    What the fuck. It's my job.
          
          Off Mr. Anderson's raised eyebrow, we
          
                                                   CUT TO:
          
                                                                   18.
          
          
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          The room is a mess of scattered papers and the math Twister
          game. Letty sits on the ground crying. She makes a pyramid
          out of the wadded-up tissues that surround her.
          
          
          INT. BRIDAL SHOP - DAY
          
          The upscale shop is festooned with pastels and lace and lots
          of signs announcing "Sale Day." Frenzied women pick through
          dresses as "Pachelbel's Canon" plays in the background.
          
          Letty is wedged into a corner, sipping coffee. A CLERK
          approaches her with a coffee pot and tray of pastries.
          
                              CLERK
                    More coffee?
          
                              LETTY
                    Hit me.
          
                              CLERK
                    Danish?
          
                              LETTY
                        (rooting through the tray)
                    No more bear claws left?
          
          Ruth bounces into the shop.
          
                              CLERK
                        (to Ruth)
                    Danish?
          
                              RUTH
                    Oh, no thanks, I'm too excited to
                    eat.
          
          The clerk gives Ruth an approving smile as Letty rips into a
          sweet roll. Ruth looks through a nearby rack of gowns.
          
                              RUTH
                        (to Letty)
                    Where's Mommy?
          
                              LETTY
                    Do you have to call her Mommy?
          
                              RUTH
                    Where's the old bag I sometimes
                    call Mommy?
          
                                                                   19.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    She said she'd be here at 10.
          
          Ruth pulls a dress from the rack and holds it up.
          
                              RUTH
                    What do you think of this one?
          
                              LETTY
                    I'd have to see it on.
          
          Ruth looks closer at Letty.
          
                              RUTH
                    Have you been crying?    Your eyes
                    are all puffy.
          
          Letty self-consciously touches her eyes.
          
                              LETTY
                    Things have been kind of stressful
                    lately.
          
                              RUTH
                    But everything's OK?
          
          Ruth is trying on a veil at this point.
          
                              LETTY
                    Yeah, everything's under control.
          
                              RUTH
                    What about the engagement party?
          
                              LETTY
                    Everything's ready for tomorrow
                    night--except the artillery.
          
                              RUTH
                    Thanks so much for planning it,
                    Letty. Jake's really looking
                    forward to it.
          
          Letty sighs, moves to the racks and pulls out a dress.
          
                              LETTY
                    You better start trying on before
                    the vultures get all the good ones.

          R
           uth twirls around in a taffeta gown as Letty picks up
          discarded dresses from the floor and hangs them up.
          
                                                                  20.
          
          
          
                              RUTH
                    What about this one?
          
                              LETTY
                        (with sisterly pride)
                    You look beautiful.
          
                               RUTH
                    Really?
          
                               LETTY
                    Truly.
          
          Martha Mayer is led in by the clerk.
          
                               LETTY
                    Hi, Mom.
          
                              RUTH
                    Look, Mom, I think I've found the
                    dress.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    You look just wonderful, Ruthie.
                    But I really think you should try
                    on a few more, don't you?
          
          Letty and Ruth shoot each other a look of doom.
          
          INT. BRIDAL SHOP - LATER
          
          A bedraggled Letty and her mother fight the crowds to look at
          dresses. They are bumped and jostled from all sides.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Has Paul heard about his promotion?
          
                              LETTY
                    No, not yet. But you know Paul.
                    He's sure to get it.
          
          Ruth comes out of the dressing room in another gown.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    I don't like the bias cut on that
                    one.
          
          Mrs. Mayer holds up an ornate dress.
          
                              RUTH
                    No more. I can't stand to try on
                    one more dress.
          
                                                                  21.
          
          
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Letty, I think this would be
                    beautiful on you.
          
                                LETTY
                    Oh no.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Paul could pop the question at any
                    time.
          
                              LETTY
                    Mom, please.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Especially with a promotion in the
                    offing.
          
                              RUTH
                    Go on, Letty. I want to see it on
                    you.
          
                              LETTY
                        (to Ruth)
                    Do you think I should?
          
                                RUTH
                    Yes, yes.    It'll be fun.
          
          Letty takes the gown and disappears into the dressing room.
          
          INT. BRIDAL SHOP - LATER
          
          Letty emerges from the dressing room.
          
                               LETTY
                    Mom?   Mom? Ruth?
          
          Letty peers around the corner, becoming a tad frantic. But
          neither her mother nor Ruth is to be found. It's just Letty,
          resplendent in ecru satin.
          
                              CLERK
                    I think they went over to the next
                    shop to take a peek at shoes.
          
          Letty pushes back her veil, sits down on the floor and takes
          a sip of her now-cold coffee.
          
                                                                     22.
          
          
          
          INT. LETTY'S LIVING/DINING ROOM - EVENING
          
          A "House and Garden" picture of elegance. Letty, Paul, Ruth
          and Jake stand at nervous attention, decked out in their
          Sunday best.
          
          A KNOCK marks the first arrival. Letty opens the door to her
          mother, who does a quick reconnaissance of the room.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    I gather he's late as usual.
          
                              LETTY
                        (to her mother)
                    Can I get you a glass of champagne?
          
          The doorbell RINGS. Letty greets her father, a mid 50s
          business type, and his wife MONICA, a younger version of
          Letty's mother.
          
                              LETTY
                    Hi, Dad, Monica.   I'm so glad you
                    could come.
          
          Suddenly, the parents are face-to-face, Letty standing
          between them.
          
                              LETTY
                    Mom, this is Monica.   Monica, my
                    mother, Martha.
          
          The two Mrs. Mayers make appropriate MURMURS. Letty's
          parents stare each other down. Ruth shifts from foot to foot.
          Silence falls in the room with a thump.
          
                              LETTY
                    Dad, Mother, you've met before,
                    right?
          
          Ruth takes a dramatic gulp of air. The evening hangs in the
          balance. Finally,
          
                              MR. MAYER
                    How've you been, Martha?
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Mr. Mayer and Monica cozy up to each other on the love seat
          while Mrs. Mayer, Ruth and Paul sit on the opposite couch.
          
          Letty passes hors d'oeuvres, and Jake doles out napkins.
          
                                                                 23.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    It's mushroom-time, folks.
          
                              MR. MAYER
                        (biting into one)
                    I like the touch of cilantro. It is
                    cilantro, isn't it?
          
                              LETTY
                    You can always call it, Dad.
                              M
                               ONICA
                    You must get your cooking skills
                    from your father, Letty.
          
          Uncomfortable silence falls on the party. Monica wipes the
          edge of Mr. Mayer's mouth with her napkin.
          
                              LETTY
                    Ruth's narrowed the dress hunt down
                    to two, Dad.
          
                              MR. MAYER
                    Tell me about them.
          
                              RUTH
                    One's a silk...
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Not in front of Jake, Ruthie.    It's
                    bad luck.
          
          Ruth looks at Letty nervously.
          
                              MONICA
                    I remember how hard it was looking
                    for my dress. I must have been to
                    100 stores.
          
          Mrs. Mayer clears her throat.    More silence.
          
                               LETTY
                    You know what I think we need?
                    Martinis. How about martinis to
                    celebrate?
          
                              PAUL
                    Yes.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    That might be nice.
          
                                                                  24.
          
          
          
                              MR. MAYER
                    As long as you have...
          
                               LETTY
                    Puglia olives. Would I forget?
                        (beat)
                    A round of martinis coming right
                    up.
          
          Letty leaves with Paul hot on her heels.
          
          INT. KITCHEN - SAME
          
          Letty shakes the martinis while Paul gets out the glasses.
          Ruth enters the kitchen and sidles up to Letty.
          
                              RUTH
                    How can I help?
          
                              LETTY
                    Paul, can you hand me the olives?
                    Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
          
                              RUTH
                    What about the souffle?    Has that
                    gone in?
          
                              LETTY
                    Yeah, I just put it in. But the
                    squab, I think that needs to be
                    basted.
          
          Paul hands Letty the olive bottle.
          
                              PAUL
                        (to Ruth)
                    Kind of icy in there.
          
                              RUTH
                        (to Paul)
                    Thank God we have alcohol.
          
          Letty skewers olives and puts them in the martinis. Bits of
          fleck rise from the olives, then swim to the tops of the
          glasses.
          
                                LETTY
                    Fuck me.
          
                              RUTH
                    What's the matter?
          
          Letty grabs the olive bottle.
          
                                                                  25.
          
          
          
                               PAUL
                    Letty?
          
          Letty stands still, fixated on the olive bottle.
          
                               PAUL
                    Let?       L
                              LETTY
                    Olives Aux Herbes De Provence.    I
                    got the wrong kind of olives.
          
          Ruth holds up a glass.
          
                              RUTH
                    What's all the dreck?
          
                              LETTY
                    Sage, rosemary...
                        (in a sarcastic French
                         accent)
                    Les Herbes.
          
                              RUTH
                    It'll be fine.
          
                              LETTY
                    No, no. They've got to be Puglia
                    olives, packed in a light brine
                    with a flavor that doesn't
                    overpower the palate.
          
          Jake enters.   The three turn on him.
          
                              LETTY/PAUL/RUTH
                    You can't leave them alone./Get
                    back in there./Are you nuts?
          
          Jake whirls around and exits.
          
          Letty looks for olives, banging open the cupboards one after
          the other. Quicker and quicker. More and more frantic.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME
          
          Jake, Mr. Mayer, Monica and Mrs. Mayer stare at each other,
          listening with alarm to the wild slamming of cupboards in the
          kitchen.
          
                              JAKE
                    What do you think of those Lakers?
          
                                                                     26.
          
          
          
          INT. KITCHEN - SAME
          
          Letty paws through her purse.
          
                              PAUL
                    What are you doing?
          
                              LETTY
                        (wild-eyed)
                    Can you loan me a 20?
          
                                 PAUL
                    Sure. Why?
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm going to the store.
          
                              PAUL
                    I think you're overreacting.
          
          Letty turns her best school marm look on Paul. He hands over
          a crisp bill.
          
                               RUTH
                    Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The
                    souffle...
          
                              LETTY
                    I'll be back before you can say
                    souffle.
          
          Letty leaves from the kitchen's back door. Ruth heads to the
          living room. Paul leans wearily against the counter,
          savoring one of the herb-filled martinis.
          
          INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT
          
          Fluorescent lights beat down on Letty. She races through the
          aisles. She clutches her keys in one hand, a $20 bill in the
          other. Letty careens around a corner. At the last second,
          she avoids smacking into another shopper. She stops.
          L
          LETTY'S POV:
          
          Shelf after shelf of olives...black olives...all black.
          
          BACK TO SCENE:
          
          Letty darts up and down the aisle, searching, searching.
          Nothing.
          
                                                                       27.
          
          
          
          Letty scurries to the front of the store. She taps a STORE
          CLERK on the shoulder. Six people waiting in line mutter,
          annoyed.
          
                              LETTY
                    I can't find martini olives.     All
                    you have are black.
          
                              STORE CLERK
                        (without looking up)
                    Aisle 2A.
          
          Letty whips down an aisle.    She starts to sweat.
          
          An OLD LADY blocks her path.
          
                              OLD LADY
                    Excuse me, Miss. I can't reach the
                    cat food.
          
          Letty pauses.    She reaches up and hands the woman a can of
          food.
          
                              OLD LADY
                    And a turkey and giblets, too,
                    please. She does like her turkey.
          
          Letty grabs another can, throws it in the Old Lady's cart and
          darts away while the Old Lady continues to talk.
          
          LETTY'S POV:
          
          The sign for Aisle 2A.    Olives.   Lots of them.   Green.   All
          shapes. All sizes.
          
          BACK TO SCENE:
          
          Letty's shoulders relax.    She scans the shelf.
          
          LETTY's POV:
          
          Labels of olives: big, small, with pimentos, without.        None
          from Puglia, Italy.
          
          BACK TO SCENE:
          
          Letty zooms back to the front of the store.      To the clerk.
          
                              LETTY
                    They're not there. I need the ones
                    from Puglia.
          
                                                                     28.
          
          
          
          She gets no response from the clerk, who counts change for a
          customer. Letty gestures wildly with her hands.
          
                              LETTY
                    They're the ones that are packed in
                    brine, but they don't overpower
                    the, you know, the palate.
          
                              STORE CLERK
                        (without looking up)
                    Specialty foods. 7B.
          
          Letty's off again. To the land of pink peppercorns,
          dehydrated mushrooms and Chinese 5-Spice. But no olives.
          Not a single bottle.
          L
          Letty paws through the shelves, knocking things over as she
          scours the aisle. She is oblivious to the mess that
          surrounds her.
          
          An EMPLOYEE with a price checker walks half-way down the
          aisle. He spots Letty and rushes away.
          
                              LETTY
                    Where are they?   Where are they?
          
          More and more items crash to the ground.   Letty is beyond
          frenzied.
          
                              EMPLOYEE (OS FILTERED)
                    Manager to 7B. Manager please.
          
                              LETTY
                    Where are they?
          
          Letty pounds her fist against the shelf. More goods fall.
          Shoppers stare. The Manager rushes toward Letty.
          
                              MANAGER
                    What's wrong, Miss?
          
                              LETTY
                    Tell me where they are.
          
          She gestures. She knocks over a bottle of fat-free
          Lingonberry preserves. It crashes to the floor, spewing jam.
          
                              MANAGER
                    I think you should go now.
          
                              LETTY
                    I need my olives.
          
                                                                     29.
          
          
          
                              MANAGER
                    It's time to leave.
          
          The Manager places his hand on the small of Letty's back as
          if to guide her out of the store. Letty backs away. The
          manager grabs hold of her wrist.
          
          Letty whacks him in the shoulder with her free hand. She
          pushes him away. Hard. He staggers against the opposite
          shelf.
          
          Customers and employees gather at both ends of the aisle,
          riveted by the spectacle.
          
                              MANAGER
                    Call security. Where's security,
                    please?
          
          Letty takes her arm and slides a shelf-full of products onto
          the floor. They crash and break. She screams.
          
                              LETTY
                    Fucking olives. Fucking, fucking
                    olives.
          
          Two SECURITY GUARDS turn the corner.   Letty spots them.   One
          creeps closer.
          
                              LETTY
                    No, no, no. Go away.
          
          Guard One continues to approach, cooing encouragingly. Letty
          throws a jar at him. It clips him in the head. He turns
          away, bleeding. Guard Two pulls out a billy club.
          
                              MANAGER
                        (yelling)
                    Call police. Now.
          
          Letty stops. Dazed. She turns around. Guard Two walks toward
          her. His stance suggests he's stalking a wild animal.
          
          Letty tries to brush off the jam that dribbles down her
          skirt. She looks to both ends of the aisle.
          
          LETTY'S POV:
          
          Faces, dozens and dozens of faces, stare down at her.   People
          point. One boy LAUGHS.
          
          BACK TO SCENE:
          
                                                                    30.
          
          
          
          Letty backs against the shelf. She slides down it until she
          is sitting on the floor. She buries her head in her knees,
          sobbing.
          
                                                           FADE OUT:
          
          FADE IN:
          
          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          The room is furnished like a Hyatt Hotel minus anything you
          might use to kill yourself. Letty sleeps.
          
          MICHAEL, mid 30's, in jeans and T-shirt, sits in a chair next
          to the bed. He looks intently at Letty, checks his watch and
          taps her on the shoulder. She stirs.
          
                               MICHAEL
                     Miss Mayer? Miss Mayer?
          
          LETTY'S POV:
          
          Everything's a morning blur. Gradually, items come into
          focus -- the intercom for the nurse, the door with a window
          in it, the three tissue boxes on the bedside table. It's a
          hospital, all right. Letty's vision is filled suddenly by
          Michael's concerned face peering into hers.
          
          BACK TO SCENE:
          
                               MICHAEL
                     I know you've had a rough night,
                     but I have a few questions for you,
                     Miss Mayer, or Letitia.
          
          Letty pulls herself up to a sitting position.
          
                               MICHAEL
                     Do you mind if I call you Letitia?
          
                               LETTY
                     Letty.
          
                               MICHAEL
                         (consulting his notes)
                     First off, Letty, can you tell me
                     where you are?
          
                               LETTY
                     I answered these questions last
                     night.
          
                                                          31.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I know this can be a real drag, but
                    the attending physician on day
                    shift is required to do his own
                    prelim exam when a patient is
                    admitted during the night.
          
                              LETTY
                    Hillview Psychiatric Hospital.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Great. Now, Letty, I'd like you to
                    remember three items. I'm going to
                    ask you to repeat them in just a
                    few minutes. They are chair, cup
                    and ball. Did you get that?
          
          Letty nods.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    OK, let's subtract 6 from a
                    succession of numbers starting with
                    91.
          
                              LETTY
                    85.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    And 85 minus 6?
          
                              LETTY
                    59.
          
          Michael waits.
          
                             LETTY
                    No, 79. Sorry, this makes me
                    nervous.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind
                    of thing.
          L
          Letty smiles uncomfortably.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Now the three things I asked you to
                    remember.
          
                              LETTY
                    Chair, cup and ball.
          
                                                          32.
          
          
          
                                MICHAEL
                    Terrific.
          
          Letty smiles, a real smile this time.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    Let me shift gears here a minute...
                        (beat)
                    Do you ever hear voices that other
                    people don't hear or see things
                    they don't?
          
                                LETTY
                    No.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    What about patterns? Do you find
                    yourself checking and re-checking
                    locks? Or washing your hands over
                    and over again?
          
          Letty shakes her head "no."
          
                              MICHAEL
                    How about arranging your
                    possessions in a certain way?
          
          Letty pauses.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    Yes?   Go right ahead.
          
                              LETTY
                    Sometimes my food, and my clothes,
                    and my underwear.
          
          Michael leans closer.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    How do you sort it--by lace and
                    cotton?
          
                                LETTY
                    By color.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    What if it's got a pattern?
          
                              LETTY
                    Is this really important? Because
                    I don't think it's a problem.
          
                                                                   33.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I see.
                        (looking at his notes)
                    How long has it been since you've
                    done something you've enjoyed,
                    Letty?
          
                               LETTY
                        (beat)
                    A while, I guess.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    That must be really difficult.
          
          Letty tears up.   Michael puts his hand lightly on her arm.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Hey, it'll be OK.   We'll make sure
                    of that.
          
          Letty gives him an appreciative look.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    For now, why don't you just take it
                    easy while I confer with my
                    colleagues. A nurse should be in
                    shortly.
          
          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - LATER
          
          Letty, dressed and made up, sits rigidly on the bed. She
          writes in her organizer. DR. ROBERT EMLEE, early 40s and in
          jeans, enters with his own organizer.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and
                    I have some questions to ask you...
          
                              LETTY
                    I did this already.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    It's hospital policy...
          
                              LETTY
                    To be interviewed every hour?
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    I'm the only doctor making rounds
                    this morning.
          
                                                          34.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    Well, I don't have hallucinations.
                    Honest.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    This doctor, was he tall, with dark
                    hair?
          
                              LETTY
                    Yeah, and a dimple.
          
          Dr. Emlee shifts uncomfortably.
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                    I'm afraid Lhe's not a doctor.
          
                              LETTY
                    Psychologist, therapist, whatever.
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                    Patient.
          
                               LETTY
                    What?
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    Michael, the man who came to see
                    you, is a patient.
          
                              LETTY
                    What kind of place is this?
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    I apologize for the inconvenience,
                    but I must ask you some...
          
                              LETTY
                    I want to see my mother
                    immediately.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    We discourage family visits for the
                    first 48 hours after an emotional
                    trauma like the kind you've
                    experienced.
          
                              LETTY
                    I don't think you understand.    I
                    won't wait.
          
                                                                    35.
          
          
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                    You'll have to. Your family agreed
                    to the conditions not to see you
                    when they admitted you to Hillview,
                    Letitia.
                        (beat)
                    We can talk about how that makes
                    you feel, but we can't change the
                    rules.
          
          Letty sinks back on her pillows, the wind knocked out of her.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    Dr. Stone's evaluation from last
                    night indicates you're experiencing
                    a great deal of anxiety, probably
                    related to depression...
          
          LETTY'S POV:
          
          Dr. Emlee continues to talk. His words become more and more
          distant as the RINGING in Letty's head grows louder.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    We need to talk about starting you
                    on drug therapy. Most depressive
                    personalities benefit from a drug
                    like Prozac or maybe Zoloft...
          
          CUT TO:
          
          INT. REC ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - SAME
          
          It's a bigger version of a waiting room you'd find in a
          doctor's office. And it has more games.
          
          Some patients watch television. Others play pool. Several
          form a group around Michael, who holds the same notebook he
          used in his session with Letty. JOHN, unkempt in a bathrobe,
          hands him a few ratty dollar bills.
          
                              JOHN
                    I'm in for 5 for manic depressive.
          
          THOMAS, late 40s and in a suit, waves a $5 bill at Michael.
          
                              THOMAS
                    I'll go with that as well.
          
          Michael takes the money, and turns to MARIE, late 30s.
          
                                                                  36.
          
          
          
                               MARIE
                        (to John and Thomas)
                    You two always bet manic
                    depressive.
                        (
                          to Michael)
                    Tell me more about the guard she
                    strangled.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    No, just hit in the head.
          
                              JOHN
                    What about voices?    Does she hear
                    voices?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Not that she admits to.
          
                              MARIE
                    Is she a washer?
          
                               MICHAEL
                    No, but she is exceptionally
                    organized.
          
                              THOMAS
                    How organized?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    She arranges her underwear by
                    color.
          
          Michael motions to MRS. HALLSTROM, mid 50s, who shuffles by.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Mrs. Hallstrom, you want in?
          
                              MRS. HALLSTROM
                    All tapped out.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'll float you.
          
          Mrs. Hallstrom keeps walking.
          
                              MARIE
                        (to Michael)
                    It's been weeks since she played.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    What about you, Marie?
          
                                                                     37.
          
          
          
                               MARIE
                        (handing Michael a $20
                         bill)
                    I'll say major depression
                    complicated by obsessive compulsive
                    disorder.
                        (beat)
                    And could I get my change in ones?
          
          INT. HALLWAY - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT
          
          Letty lags behind NURSE GATES, early 30s and in civilian
          clothes, as they walk down the hall.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    Treatment schedules are posted on
                    the bulletin board. Dinner at 6,
                    lights out at 10 and no
                    fraternizing between patients.
          
          Letty nods.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                        (pointing as she goes)
                    That's the rec room. We show
                    movies there on Wednesdays and
                    Fridays...And this is the dining
                    hall.
          
          Letty stops in her tracks at the sight of the room, an
          upscale version of a college cafeteria. Groups of people eat
          and talk. A paper airplane sails from one table to another.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm really not that hungry.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    Just eat whatever you want. This
                    will give you a chance to meet some
                    people.
          
                              LETTY
                    You know, my mom's coming to get me
                    tomorrow. I'll be leaving.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    It's OK, Letty. I'll be right here
                    with you.
          
          INT. DINING HALL - SAME
          
          Nurse Gates guides Letty to a table where John, Mrs.
          Hallstrom, Marie and Thomas sit.
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
          
                              THOMAS
                    So I said to my publisher this
                    afternoon, I said, don't you even--
          
                              NURSE GATES
                        (interrupts)
                    Hi, gang. I want to introduce you
                    to Letty.
                        (to Letty)
                    Letty, this is Mrs. Hallstrom and
                    Marie, and John and Thomas.
          
                              THOMAS
                        (to Letty)
                    Just discussing my pesky publisher.
                    May I ask what you do when you're
                    not vacationing?
          
                              MARIE
                        (to Thomas)
                    Let the poor girl get some food,
                    for Heaven's sake.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm a teacher.
          
                              THOMAS
                    As you may have gathered, I'm a
                    writer.
          
          John snorts. Thomas ignores him.   Mrs. Hallstrom stares down
          at her plate.
          
                              THOMAS
                    I don't like to say novelist. That
                    sounds a little grandiose, but I am
                    on my third novel and...
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    Excuse me for interrupting, Thomas,
                    but we really should get some
                    food...
          
          Nurse Gates leads Letty to a table, and hands her a plate.
          Letty looks up to see Michael at the other end of the table,
          doing a card trick for two OTHER PATIENTS.
          
                              MICHAEL
                        (to patients)
                    Now I'm going to say that the card
                    you picked was the Ace of Spades.
          
                                                                       39.
          
          
          
          He flips the top card up and it's the Ace of Spades.       The
          patients chortle.
          
                                 NURSE GATES
                    Michael.
          
          Michael turns toward the nurse.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    Michael, this is Letty.      She just
                    arrived yesterday.
          
          Letty stares at Michael coldly.
          
                               LETTY
                    We've met.
                        (to Michael)
                    I missed you during rounds this
                    morning.
          
          Letty turns and leaves, carrying her empty plate with her.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                        (to Michael)
                    This doctor thing has got to stop.
          
          Nurses Gates hurries after Letty.
          
          EXT. HALLWAY - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Letty stands outside the waiting room door.       She tucks her
          blouse into her jeans and enters.
          
          INT. WAITING ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Letty's mother sits on the edge of a couch in a room that
          looks much like the library of an English country manor. She
          springs up as soon as she spots Letty. They rush to each
          other. Letty's mother strokes her hair.
                               M
                               RS. MAYER
                    I'm here, Sweetheart.      I'm here.
                    It's going to be OK.
          
                                 LETTY
                    I'm sorry.     I'm so sorry.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Oh, Letty, what happened?
          
                              LETTY
                    Mom, I was there, and I just, I was
                    so...
                              (MORE)
          
                                                          40.
                              LETTY(cont'd)
                    They didn't have the olives, and I,
                    I got so upset. I don't know how it
                    happened.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    I've talked to Doctor Emlee, and he
                    says...
          
                               LETTY
                    I'm so glad to see you. You can't
                    believe the people in here.
                    They've got patients posing as
                    doctors...
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Everyone says it's the best
                    facility in the area for this sort
                    of thing.
          
                              LETTY
                    I just want to go home.   Can we go
                    home now?
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    I think the best thing for you
                    right now is to stay here and get
                    well.
          
                              LETTY
                    Maybe I should talk about this with
                    Ruth, or Paul.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    We all agree with the doctor, Dear.
                    He thinks it's safer for you to
                    stay here for a while.
          
          Letty listens, waits, can't absorb it.
          
                              LETTY
                    You all really think I need to be
                    here?
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Yes.
          
                              LETTY
                    But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Ruth's already taken him home.
          
                                                                    41.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    And my class. It'll be hard to
                    find a good substitute. And what
                    about my math program?
          
                               MRS. MAYER
                    Paul said he'd call the school.
                        (beat)
                    And your father thinks he's
                    convinced the guard not to press
                    charges as long as you get help.
          
                                LETTY
                    Charges?
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    For his injuries. I guess you...I
                    guess he got hit in the head.
          
          Mrs. Mayer holds out a duffel bag to Letty.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    I packed up some of your clothes,
                    and I can bring whatever else you
                    need.
          
          Letty refuses to accept the duffel bag. Her mother sets it
          on the floor and stands. Letty is five again.
          
                              LETTY
                    Mom, no, please don't go.    Please.
          
          Letty's mother holds her. Mrs. Mayer, crying, pulls away
          from Letty. She kisses her daughter on the cheek.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    I'll see you soon.
          
                                LETTY
                    Tomorrow?
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    As soon as Dr. Emlee says.
          
          Letty's mother walks out the door.    Letty stares after her.
          
          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Letty, crying, unpacks her duffel bag, laboriously smoothing
          and refolding every item she puts in the drawer.
          
          Finishing her task, Letty goes to the mirror and stares at
          her reflection. Finally, she fixes her makeup.
          
                                                                    42.
          
          
          
          Letty leaves her room. We follow her FOOTSTEPS down the
          hallway. In the distance, Letty sees the Rec Room. She
          hears the CLAMOR of voices. Every step is agony.
          
          Letty stops herself just before entering, trying to collect
          herself.
          
                              MICHAEL (O.S.)
                    Four people bet OCD and clinical
                    depression so I split the pool.
          
                              JOHN (O.S.)
                    Yeah, her diagnosis was no mystery.
          
                              MARIE
                    Especially the OCD.
          
          Sick realization spreads over Letty's face.
          
                              JOHN (O.S.)
                    Fuck, I mean, anyone who color-
                    codes her panties has big problems.
          
          Letty freezes. Michael rounds the corner. He stops when he
          sees her, falters, recovers his composure.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Hey there. They're showing
                    "Groundhog Day" if you...
          
                              LETTY
                    You took bets on my diagnosis?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It's no big deal.   We all compare.
          
                              LETTY
                        (voice rising)
                    W
                     ho do you think you are?
          
          INT. REC ROOM - SAME
          
          Patients are grouped in front of the TV, watching Bill
          Murray. Heads turn as they hear shouting in the hallway.
          Not even a moment's hesitation before, one by one, they get
          up and hurry to the hall. Only Mrs. Hallstrom remains.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - SAME
          
          John, Marie and others gather around the fighters.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Don't take it personally.
          
                                                                    43.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    You have no right, no right to take
                    the worst thing that's ever
                    happened to me and make it into
                    some kind of game.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Stop acting like you're someone
                    special. You're just like the rest
                    of us.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm not the one who's masquerading
                    as a doctor. I'm not the one
                    who's, who's...
          
                              JOHN
                        (to Letty)
                    He's schizophrenic.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm not the one who's
                    schizophrenic. I don't see people
                    who aren't there or run around
                    acting crazy.
          
          Letty pounds her fist against the wall.
          
                              PATIENTS
                    Go, Girl!/ Come on, Michael.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Oh, no, you're perfectly sane.
                    That's why you're here.
          
          Letty looks like she's been slapped. She thinks for a
          moment. The patients wait, breathless, for her retort.
          
                              LETTY
                    Go fuck yourself.
          
          Michael grins at Letty. She turns, and strides down the
          hall. There's a smattering of applause. It grows stronger.
          
          We see Letty's eyes fill with tears as, behind her, the
          patients yell.

          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Letty, unable to sleep, tosses and turns. She gets out of
          bed and paces the room nervously, trying to hold herself
          together. She slumps to the floor and starts to cry.
          
          INT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          D
           r. Emlee and seven patients sit in a circle of metal folding
          chairs. Michael, who sits next to Emlee, practices rolling a
          quarter back and forth across his fingers.
          
          Letty sits across from Michael and Emlee, her legs and arms
          crossed tightly. The group concentrates on Mrs. Hallstrom.
          
                              MRS. HALLSTROM
                    I can't stop thinking about the
                    things I did wrong when my daughter
                    was little.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    And how's that make you feel?
          
                              MRS. HALLSTROM
                    I just feel like sleeping.    All the
                    time.
          
                              THOMAS
                    Hell's bells, you can count me in
                    on that. I haven't had enough Z's
                    since I ran those sleep disorder
                    experiments at Stanford back in the
                    70s.
          
                              MARIE
                    We really miss doing things with
                    you, Mrs. Hallstrom.
          
          Michael, sitting next to Mrs. Hallstrom, squeezes her arm.
          
                              MRS. HALLSTROM
                    Maybe when I hit my manic phase
                    again.
          
          Group members smile.
          
                              JOHN
                    I've noticed Letty doesn't much
                    like to do things with us.
          
          The group looks expectantly at Letty.
          
                                                                   45.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    Oh, no. Of course I do.
          
                              JOHN
                    Then why are you so defensive?
          
                              MICHAEL
                        (to John)
                    I don't think we need to sacrifice
                    Letty to pep up a slow session.
          
                              JOHN
                        (to Michael)
                    You're the one who told everyone
                    about her panties.
          
          Michael grimaces at John.   Letty's head is bent down.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    Maybe you'd like to share some of
                    your feelings about OCD or
                    depression with us, Letty.
          
          Letty eyes the doctor.   She's dangerously close to tears.
          
                              LETTY
                    Do we have to talk about this?
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    I think in the spirit of group
                    therapy, it's beneficial for each
                    of us to open ourselves up to the
                    others.
          
          Michael reaches his hand behind Dr. Emlee's head, catching
          Letty's eye in the process. Michael pulls a silver dollar out
          of Emlee's ear.
          
          Letty looks but doesn't respond. The other patients ignore
          Michael. Emlee is oblivious.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    You never know, Letty, how the
                    person sitting next to you may be
                    able to shed light on one of your
                    problems...
          
          Michael goes for a bigger trick. Reaching again behind the
          doctor's head, he produces a small bouquet of paper flowers.
          Letty, almost against her will, smiles.
          
                                                                  46.
          
          
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    ...by revealing something that's
                    going on in his or her own life.
          
          Michael waves the flowers back and forth behind the doctor's
          head. Letty's smile broadens.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                        (responding to her smile)
                    There, now, I knew you'd feel
                    better once we discussed group
                    process. Let's talk a little about
                    your OCD.
          
          INT. LIBRARY - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Letty ponders a shelf of ratty paperbacks. Michael turns the
          corner, thumbing through a dog-eared book. Letty spots him
          and moves away. Michael sidles up next to her.
                               M
                               ICHAEL
                    Looking for a romance?
          
                                 LETTY
                    Excuse me?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    What are you looking to read?
          
                              LETTY
                    Anything interesting.
          
          Michael holds out his book to her.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    This is good.
          
          Letty glances at the title, "101 MAGIC TRICKS."
          
                              LETTY
                    But you're checking it out.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I've already checked it out 17
                    times.
          
          Michael reaches behind Letty. She pulls away. He produces a
          scarf from behind her back, and presents it to her. She
          doesn't take it.
          
                              LETTY
                    You keep the book.   I'm looking for
                    Emily Dickinson.
          
                                                                   47.
          
          
          
          Letty walks away.   Michael follows.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Hey, if you take the magic book,
                    I'll feel like maybe you accept my
                    apology and don't hate me anymore.
          
          Letty hesitates.
          
                              LETTY
                    I haven't heard an apology.
          
          Michael drops to one knee.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'm really sorry I hurt your
                    feelings. I got a little carried
                    away. Can you ever forgive me?
          
          Letty takes the book from him and walks away.
          
          INT. REC ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Letty sits in an arm chair staring out at the garden. Her
          attention is drawn to a nearby couch where Michael sits
          opposite Mrs. Hallstrom, apparently playing cards.
          
          Michael lays a card down.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Mrs. Hallstrom, I'm pretty sure you
                    could use that.
          
          She shakes her head slowly back and forth.   Michael places it
          in her hand of cards.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    Now, don't you have a gin rummy,
                    Mrs. Hallstrom?
                        (beat)
                    Go ahead, now, just lay those cards
                    down.
          
          Mrs. Hallstrom slowly spreads her hand of cards on the couch.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Hot damn. Gin rummy. I told you
                    so. You're three games up on me.
          
          Mrs. Hallstrom smiles. Michael catches Letty watching them,
          and Letty quickly looks away.
          
                                                                  48.
          
          
          
          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT
          
          Letty opens her drawer to pull out a T-shirt. Several are
          rumpled. She starts refolding them when she spots it.
          
          There, nestled among her clothes, is a book of Emily
          Dickinson's poetry. Letty picks it up, runs her hand over
          the cover and starts reading.
          
          EXT. COURTYARD - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Paul and Letty walk onto a postcard-perfect stone terrace
          overlooking the garden. Paul pulls up a chair for Letty and
          stares out at the scenery.
          
                              PAUL
                    It's prettier here than I thought
                    it would be.
          
                              LETTY
                    Yeah, I guess it's all right.
          
                              PAUL
                    Are you all right?
          
                              LETTY
                    That's a big question.
          
                              PAUL
                    I hope it wasn't something I did.
          
                              LETTY
                    Something you did?
          
                              PAUL
                    That put you in here.
          
                               LETTY
                    Of course not, no.
                        (beat)
                    Is that why you're here?
          
                              PAUL
                    I think we need to talk about some
                    things.
          
                              LETTY
                    Yes, I suppose so.
          
                              PAUL
                    This has been really difficult,
                    this whole thing.
                              (MORE)
          
                                                                     49.
                               PAUL(cont'd)
                    These past few weeks, it's made me
                    really go back and examine our
                    whole relationship.
                        (beat)
                    I mean, we've been going out for
                    four years, and it hasn't always
                    been so easy.
          
                              LETTY
                    No.
          
                              PAUL
                    Especially this last year.
          
                              LETTY
                        (softly)
                    Especially now.
          
                              PAUL
                    So, I've been thinking a lot...
          
                              LETTY
                    I have too, Paul.
          
                              PAUL
                    I talked to Ruth a little bit, and
                    I think it's about time...
          
                              LETTY
                    I know. We can't just keep going
                    through the motions.
          
                               PAUL
                    Exactly. It's time to make
                    decisions.
          
                              LETTY
                    You don't have to say anything
                    else. I've known for a while that
                    this was coming.
          
                              PAUL
                    I just wish we'd done it sooner.
          
          Paul takes Letty's hand in his.
          
                              PAUL
                    Will you marry me?
          
          Paul pulls a diamond ring from his pocket and puts it on
          Letty's finger. She stares at it, mesmerized.
          
                                                            50.
          
          
          
                              PAUL
                    I had to smuggle it in here. I
                    guess you're not really supposed to
                    have jewelry.
          
                              LETTY
                        (by rote)
                    Or be up past ten or fraternize
                    with other patients.
          
                                PAUL
                    I hope you like it. It's a Marquis
                    cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with
                    emeralds around it, but this was
                    simpler, more classic in its lines.
                         (beat)
                    L
                     Letty?
          
                              LETTY
                    It's, it's really nice, Paul.
          
                              PAUL
                    You can take it back and we can
                    have one custom made if you want.
          
                              LETTY
                    No, you've done a perfect job.
          
                              PAUL
                    So, what do you say, Let?
          
          Letty looks him in the eyes for the first time.
          
                              LETTY
                    Do you think, really, that it's OK
                    to get engaged when I'm in here?
          
                              PAUL
                    Sure. We'll save the formal
                    announcement for when you're out. I
                    already told your mother. I hope
                    you don't mind.
          
                              LETTY
                    No, no.
          
                              PAUL
                    So will you?
          
                              LETTY
                        (working up a smile)
                    Of course. Yes. I will.     I do.
          
                                                                   51.
          
          
          
          Paul and Letty kiss, then hug.
          
          EXT. COURTYARD - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - LATER
          
          It's completely dark. Letty sits in the same position we saw
          her in hours ago. Michael walks up to her.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You missed out on some great
                    broccoli florets at dinner.
          
                              LETTY
                    I wasn't hungry.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    John even managed to lob a load of
                    mashed potatoes into Mrs.
                    Hallstrom's milk.
          
                              LETTY
                        (smiling)
                    Finally. I was getting tired of
                    watching him try every night.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Was it bad news--the visit from
                    Peter?
          
                              LETTY
                    Paul.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    He looked pretty serious.
          
                              LETTY
                    He asked me to marry him.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Very romantic setting.
          
                              LETTY
                    It was romantic.   He's very
                    romantic.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    So are you engaged, or what?
          
          Letty holds out her hand, where the diamond glistens. Michael
          bends forward to look at the ring, caressing her hand as he
          does so.
          
          Letty pulls away. The ring is gone.
          
                                                                    52.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    What have you done with the ring?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It's magic.
          
          Letty stands up.
          
                              LETTY
                    This isn't funny.   Paul would kill
                    me.
          
          Michael holds his hands in fists toward Letty.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Guess which hand.
          
                              LETTY
                    Enough with the abracadabra.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Guess.
          
                              LETTY
                    T
                     he left one.
          
          Michael opens his hand.   It's empty.   Michael addresses an
          imaginary audience.
          
                              MICHAEL
                        (to audience)
                    The fair maiden guesses
                    incorrectly. Should we give her
                    one more try?
                        (to Letty)
                    The audience says one more try.
                    What guess you now?
          
                              LETTY
                    The right one.
          
          Michael opens his right hand. A plastic, Cracker-jack ring
          rests in it.
          
                              LETTY
                    Come on, Michael.
          
          Michael grabs Letty's hand and slides the ring onto her
          finger.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    With this ring, I thee...
          
                                                                 53.
          
          
          
          Letty pulls her hand away.
          
                              LETTY
                    Really, this isn't funny.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    OK, OK, I'll give it back.
          
          Letty holds out her hand.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    For a price.
          
                                 LETTY
                    Good God.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    A small price.
          
                              LETTY
                    I won't do your portion of kitchen
                    cleanup.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    No.
          
                              LETTY
                    And I'm not covering for you when
                    you sneak out to call Dominos.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I want a kiss.
          
          Letty stares at him.    She laughs.
          
                              LETTY
                    Get serious.
          
          Michael moves close to her.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'm serious.
          
          Letty looks into his eyes.
          
                              LETTY
                        (softly)
                    Everything's a joke with you.
          
          Michael and Letty kiss, long and deep. Letty pulls back.
          She gazes at Michael. She steps closer to him.
          
          They kiss again, longer and deeper.
          
                                                                   54.
          
          
          
          They separate. Letty looks ready for another kiss.   Michael
          caresses her cheek.
          
          He walks back toward the hospital door. He stops, comes back
          to Letty. He hands her the diamond ring.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    Here.
          
          He walks inside.   Letty watches him go.
          
          INT. DR. EMLEE'S OFFICE - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Dr. Emlee and Letty sit across from each other.
          
                              LETTY
                    The medicine's still bothering me.
                    It feels like I have cotton wrapped
                    around my brain.
          
                                DR. EMLEE
                    We'll see about adjusting the
                    dosage if that doesn't clear in the
                    next (week.
                          beat)
                    How are other things going?
          
                              LETTY
                    I think I've told you all the news.
                    Let's see--the engagement. Oh, and
                    my sister's coming to visit me, and
                    they say my cat misses me.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    The question, Letty, is how are you
                    feeling?
          
                              LETTY
                    I miss Beast a lot, too.
          
          INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT
          
          Darkness. Michael sleeps. A Christmas Carol BLASTS through
          the intercom system.
          
                              INTERCOM
                    Hark the Herald Angels sing...
          
          Michael bolts awake. He stumbles out of bed, in wildly
          striped boxers, and races toward the hall.
          
                                                                     55.
          
          
          
          INT.   HALLWAY - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - SAME
          
          Doors open like kernels of popcorn exploding.   Michael,
          Marie, Thomas, John, then Letty.
          
          The music BLARES on. Nurse Gates runs down the hall and
          shouts to Michael.
          
                               NURSE GATES
                     What are you doing?
          
                               MICHAEL
                         (yelling)
                     Not me.
          
          The music lowers. Mrs. Hallstrom, in a Santa cap, appears.
          She distributes erasers as she threads through the patients.
          
                                MRS. HALLSTROM
                     Sorry, sorry. Candy canes are out
                     of season.
          
                               NURSE GATES
                     Mrs. Hallstrom?
          
          Mrs. Hallstrom gives an eraser to the nurse.
          
                                NURSE GATES
                     Come on. Come with me, Mrs.
                     Hallstrom.
          
          Nurse Gates leads Mrs. Hallstrom away as the older woman
          continues tossing erasers down the hall.
          
          Marie stares at Michael's shorts.
          
                               MARIE
                     Hot boxers.
          
          Michael smiles awkwardly at Letty. She returns to her room.
          
          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - SAME
          
          Letty climbs into bed. She opens the bedside drawer, and
          pulls out a Tiffany's ring box. There, cradled in the satin
          lining, is the diamond from Paul. Right beside it is
          Michael's Cracker Jack special.
          L
          Letty puts on Paul's ring. She studies her hand. With an air
          of secrecy, she slips on Michael's ring. She quickly takes
          it off. Wearing Paul's ring, she turns off the light and
          snuggles into bed.
          
                                                                  56.
          
          
          
          EXT. GARDEN, HILLV IEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Afternoon light casts long shadows in the garden of pruned
          hedges and tea roses. Letty and Ruth power-walk down a
          cobblestone path, heading away from the English Tudor
          hospital that looms large in the background.
          
          Letty wears a sweatshirt emblazoned with the logo for the
          University of South Carolina Cocks.
          
                               LETTY
                    I can't believe you finally gave me
                    the shirt.
          
                              RUTH
                    Loaned you. And it's only 'til you
                    get out of here.
          
                              LETTY
                    That settles it. I'm never leaving.
          
                              RUTH
                    I can hardly wait 'til you're free.
                    Planning the wedding without you
                    has been a disaster.
          
                              LETTY
                    You're slowing.
          
                              RUTH
                        (picking up the pace)
                    Mom and I fought for 20 minutes
                    over whether we should go with ecru
                    invitations or brilliant white.
          
          Letty checks her stop watch.
          
                              RUTH
                    What do you think?
          
                              LETTY
                    Ecru.

                    And then the gold scroll or the
                    black Romanesque print?
          
          Letty completely stops and faces Ruth.
          
                              LETTY
                    Do we have to talk wedding details?
          
                                                                   57.
          
          
          
                              RUTH
                    Oh, no, of course not.
          
                              LETTY
                    I mean, you can always send me
                    fabric samples to look at or
                    pictures of dresses. But, it's
                    been so long since we've seen each
                    other.
          
                              RUTH
                    Of course. You're right. Besides,
                    we should be talking about your
                    engagement.
          
          They start walking again.
          
                              LETTY
                    Tell me more about Beast beating up
                    that other cat.
          
                                RUTH
                    Bloody furry mess, like I said.

                    Aren't you so excited about Paul?

                    Letty?
          
          Ruth stops this time.
          
                              RUTH
                    What's going on with you, Letty?
          
                              LETTY
                    Ruthie, do you ever wonder if
                    you'll meet someone else...someone
                    besides Jake?
          
          Power walking's forgotten.   Ruth and Letty start to amble.
          
                              RUTH
                    What's his name, Letty?

                    I didn't say...
          
                              RUTH
                    Don't even try.    What's his name?
          
          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT
          
          Nurse Gates passes by the open door, and pokes her head in.
          
                                                                   58.
          
          
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    Lights out, Letty.
          
          Letty closes the door. She pulls a nightshirt from a drawer,
          disrupting a perfectly-folded T-shirt. Letty bends down to
          straighten it, but changes her mind. She shuts the drawer.
          
          Letty puts on the nightshirt, crawls into bed and snaps off
          the light. She fluffs her pillow, and turns over. She rolls
          back.
          
          Letty turns on the light. She goes to the drawer, opens it,
          pulls out the T-shirt and refolds it. She shuts the drawer.
          Letty yanks open the drawer again and looks at her handiwork.
          
          It's a fight with the drawer. Opened and closed. Until Letty
          takes a deep breath, pulls it open a final time, hesitantly
          ruffles the T-shirt and slams the drawer shut.
          
          She runs to bed and hops in, turning off the light and
          burying her head under the pillow.
          
          A few moments pass.
          
          A KNOCK on the door. Letty opens it to find Michael.
          
                              LETTY
                    We're supposed to be asleep.
          
                                MICHAEL
                    Exactly.
          
          Michael takes Letty's hand and pulls her toward the door.
          
                              LETTY
                    We'll get caught.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    No rounds for another three hours.
          
          Michael checks the hallway and pulls Letty into it.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Nervous? Scared? Worried you're
                    not fit for a caper of epic
                    proportions?

                    Rendezvous at the closet in 30.

          Letty forges ahead to the nurses' station, while Michael
          turns a corner in the hall, peeking out so he can watch Letty
          approach Nurse Gates.

                    There's a spider in my room.

                              LETTY
                    It's got a green dot on its back.
                    I can't go to sleep with it
                    watching me.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    Sounds awful. I guess we better
                    check it out.
          
          Letty and Nurse Gates walk down the hall to Letty's room,
          passing the alcove where Michael lurks in the shadows. He
          sneaks into the main hall and pads up to the nurses' station.

          Michael wanders around the desk, crouches on the floor so he
          can't be seen from the hallway and pulls the phone down to
          his level. He dials.

                    Extra large pepperoni and

          Michael reaches up to a hook and grabs a white lab coat. He
          puts on the coat, which identifies him as "Val Williams."

                    I'm afraid I can't let you take

                    It's a pizza.

                    very important, very special,
                    morale-boosting pizza.

                    station all night, Val.
          
          Reluctantly, Michael opens the pizza box, and Jim helps
          himself to two slices. Michael starts to shut the box. Jim
          reaches in for a third slice.

                    Yes, of course. Whenever you want.
          
                                                                     63.

          TAPS on the door. Michael looks up. He jumps to his feet
          and lets Letty in, gesturing for her to sit. They lean
          against a stack of pillows.
          
                              LETTY
                    Sorry I'm late...
          
          Michael puts his finger to Letty's lips.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Shhh.
          
          A SERIES OF SHOTS THAT FADE INTO EACH OTHER:
          
          A.) The two munch on pizza. Michael picks off black olives
          and hands them to Letty, who plops them on top of her pizza.
          
          B.) Michael hands Letty a cigarette. She gestures no.       He
          lights one for himself and begins blowing smoke rings.
          
          C.) Michael offers Letty pizza.     She clutches her stomach to
          show that she's full.
          
          D.) Letty indicates she wants a cigarette. Michael
          demonstrates how to smoke, affecting the style of a 1930s
          movie star. Letty follows suit.
          E
           .) Letty grabs a pillow and hits Michael over the head. He
          pulls the pillow away from her. Letty stands up, grabs
          another pillow and hits Michael again. He whacks her in the
          back of the knees and she falls on top of him.
          
          Enough of the fighting.    They kiss.   Michael strokes the back
          of Letty's neck.
          
          FOOTSTEPS approach the door and stop. Michael and Letty stop
          kissing and look at the door. The FOOTSTEPS continue on.
          
          Michael pulls Letty's shirt up. She starts to pull it over
          her head, but can't get it all the way off in the cramped
          space. Michael kisses Letty's mouth through the shirt. She
          GIGGLES. Michael helps Letty off with the shirt.
          
          He kisses her chest.    Letty bites him lightly on the
          shoulder.
          
          Michael pulls away in surprise, grinning. Letty reaches up
          and bites him again. Michael bites her back.
          
                                                                      64.
          
          
          
          Letty reaches her hands behind her head, searching for
          something to hold onto. She grabs a stack of sheets, which
          topple onto Michael.
          
          Michael sits up, trying to clear the sheets off himself and
          Letty. Letty pushes him down and crawls on top of him.
          
          CLOSE ON her hands as they unbutton Michael's Levis, and we

          Mrs. Hallstrom sits close to the television, watching Joan
          Rivers hawk jewelry on the Home Shopping Network. Michael
          drapes the room with streamers, and surveys his work.
          
                               MICHAEL
                     How's it look?
          
                                MRS. HALLSTROM
                     Shhh. They're coming to the cubic
                     zirconium.
          
                               MICHAEL
                     I like those sapphire earrings
                     myself.

          GIGGLES come from the stall. She looks closer, sees two
          pairs of feet and one familiar pair of boxers.

          Letty sits on the couch.   Emlee leans forward in his chair.
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                     I think it's a problem that you
                     never told me about Michael. I had
                     to hear it from another patient.
          
                               LETTY
                     I couldn't really say anything
                     because of that fraternizing rule.
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                     Well, Letty, this does present a
                     liability issue for the hospital.
          
                               LETTY
                     I'm a grown woman, Dr. Emlee.   I
                     can take care of myself.
                               D
                                R. EMLEE
                     What about Michael? Do you know
                     the extent of his...
          
                               LETTY
                     I know Michael's a schizophrenic,
                     and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic-
                     depressive, and John Lockyer has
                     episodes of psychosis, and I heard
                     a rumor that you suffer from
                     delusions of grandeur.
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                     Go ahead and put the guard back up,
                     Letty. But you need to know what
                     you're dealing with.
          
                               LETTY
                     I don't need a lecture.   I care
                     about Michael.
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                     Then that's even more reason to
                     listen. Look, schizophrenics tend
                     to withdraw from reality. They
                     experience emotional disturbances
                     that result in personality changes.

                    You could be lying next to Michael
                    in bed one night, and he could have
                    a hallucination, or a delusion. It
                    might happen when you're driving
                    or...
          
                              LETTY
                    Look, I know he's almost through
                    with treatment here. And, he's on
                    medication.
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                    Drugs can help suppress symptoms.
                    But lots of patients stop taking
                    them when they're on their own
                    because the side effects are so
                    harsh.

                    And, Michael's condition is often
                    worsened by periods of stress. He's
                    been in and out of...
          
                              LETTY
                    I don't want to hear anymore.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    I'd like you to promise you won't
                    carry on a relationship with
                    Michael. Otherwise, I'll consider
                    moving one of you to another ward.
          
                              LETTY
                    First you tell me to do what I want
                    to, then you tell me to stop.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    All I want you to do is think about
                    what's best for you. Really think
                    about it.

                    I had to sneak by the guards to get
                    here. They say you're highly
                    unstable, have a depressive
                    personality, and may hold back my

                    Really, though. My thoughts go
                    haywire sometimes.
          
                              LETTY

                    trees get planted in rich top soil,
                    and they grow right up to the sun,
                    tall and straight. Other trees,
                    they start as seeds in the crevices
                    between rocks so they have to twist
                    and bend to reach the light.

          Michael and Letty hug.
          
          INT. NURSES' STATION - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Nurse Gates pours tablets from a potpourri of pill bottles
          into little paper cups. A Federal Express delivery man with
          a bunch of boxes stops at the station.
          
                                                                  69.
          
          
          
                              DELIVERY MAN
                    I need a signature, please.
          
          Nurse Gates looks at the form.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    What is all this stuff?
          
                              DELIVERY MAN
                    I just deliver it, Ma'am.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    Well, who exactly is it for?
          
                              DELIVERY MAN
                    A Mrs. Eunice Hallstrom.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    I see. Can you wait a moment?
          
          Nurse Gates locks the medication in a cupboard, and hurries
          down the hallway.
          
          INT. GROUP THERAPY ROOM - SAME
          
          Our usual cast of characters.
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                    But how does that make you feel,
                    John, what Letty said about your
                    hostility?
          
                              JOHN
                    She doesn't know what the hell
                    she's talking about.
          
          Nurse Gates barrels in.   The group looks up.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    I'm sorry, Doctor. I just need a
                    moment with Mrs. Hallstrom.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    What seems to be the problem?
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    They say she ordered...Mrs.
                    Hallstrom, did you order a bunch of
                    stuff, because Federal Express...
          M
           rs. Hallstrom's face glows.
          
                                                                    70.
          
          
          
                               MRS. HALLSTROM
                    It's here, everyone. Come along.
                    It's here.
          
          She runs out. Nurse Gates follows her. A moment passes.    The
          patients look expectantly at Dr. Emlee.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    Oh, fine, let's see.
          
          They storm the door.
          
          INT. NURSES' STATION - SAME
          
          By the time the patients round the corner, the Federal
          Express man is leaving, and Mrs. Hallstrom has ripped open
          one of the boxes. She clutches a handful of jewelry.
          
                              MRS. HALLSTROM
                    For you, John. And, Letty. And,
                    Michael, I know you'll love these.
          
          She hands Michael a pair of faux sapphire earrings. He clips
          them on. Letty and several others carry necklaces. Thomas
          sports a rhinestone tiara. The patients compare jewelry.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    Mrs. Hallstrom, you ordered all
                    this?
          
                              JOHN
                        (to Mrs. Hallstrom)
                    Thomas got a crown and all I got
                    was a lousy bracelet?
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    You must have spent thousands of
                    dollars.
          
                              MRS. HALLSTROM
                    Don't worry, Doctor, I didn't
                    forget you.
          
          Mrs. Hallstrom hands Dr. Emlee a fake ruby hair comb.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    Mrs. Hallstrom, you can't possibly
                    afford to pay for this. It must go
                    back.
          
          Chatter in the hallway stops.
          
                                                                   71.
          
          
          
                               MRS. HALLSTROM
                    Why, no, Doctor. It can't. Most
                    of it's for my daughter, Lily.
                    She's coming to family day
                    tomorrow...all the way from
                    Cleveland with my grandson.
                        (beat)
                    You can't be taking away their
                    "Welcome to California" presents.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    It's going back. We'll contact the
                    company this afternoon.
                        (to patients)
                    Take the jewelry off, please.
          
                               M
          The patients reluctantly remove their gifts.
          
                               RS. HALLSTROM
                    But I have to keep something for my
                    daughter.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    Let's go back to group, and discuss
                    it there. Back to group, everyone.
          
          The patients head back to group.   Dr. Emlee turns to Nurse
          Gates.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                        (to Nurse Gates)
                    Increase her lithium to 600
                    milligrams, three times a day. Oh,
                    and Nurse, let's see about
                    canceling the cable.
          
          EXT. PATIO - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          The place buzzes with festivity. A "WELCOME FAMILIES" sign
          hangs from a patio beam. A table is laden with cookies and
          lemonade and platter after platter of carrot curls.
          
          Letty takes a cookie and looks toward the lawn where Michael
          plays frisbee with his family, even his grandmother, ROSA.
          Nurse Gates walks up to Letty.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    Your mother's in the rec room,
                    Letty.
          
                                                                  72.
          
          
          
          INT. REC ROOM - SAME
          
          Letty passes Mrs. Hallstrom, who sits by herself, holding one
          small gift on her lap.
          
          Letty spots her Mom across the room, and walks up to her.
          Her mother has covered a table with swatches of fabric.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    It's so good to see you,
                    Sweetheart.
          
                              LETTY
                    You too, Mom.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    You're looking good.    A little
                    thin, but good.
          
          Letty examines a fabric sample.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Thanks so much for doing this.
                    Ruthie and Jake are up to a million
                    things. And I just can't decide.
          
          Letty rearranges the fabric samples on the table by color.
          
                              LETTY
                    Which flowers did you order?
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    We haven't. I wanted to talk that
                    over with you, too.
          
                              LETTY
                    Oh, OK, well, better to choose the
                    table cloths first anyway.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    I
                      was thinking either the peach
                    moire or cream damask.
          
          Letty holds up a swatch of bright yellow.
          
                              LETTY
                    This would complement the blue in
                    the bride's maids' dresses. Look.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Where's your ring, Sweetheart?
          
                                                                    73.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    We aren't allowed to wear jewelry
                    in here, Mom.
          
                               MRS. MAYER
                    Just think, pretty soon, we'll be
                    doing all these wedding
                    preparations for you.
                        (beat)
                    Of course, if that's what you still
                    want. Ruthie told me some silly
                    story about a crush on some boy
                    here.
          
          Letty pulls out a cigarette, lights it and starts smoking.
          
                              LETTY
                    I haven't had a crush since I was
                    12.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    When did you start smoking?
          
                              LETTY
                    I'll put it out if it bothers you.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    The puckering, dear. It doesn't
                    seem so now, but in time, it will
                    cause wrinkles around the mouth.
          
          Letty grinds the cigarette beneath her heel.    She bends over
          the fabrics.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    You know, your life isn't about
                    being in a mental hospital.
          
                              LETTY
                    What?
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    I hear this Michael fellow is
                    schizophrenic.
          
                              LETTY
                    Mom, please.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Don't forget that Paul's a
                    promising young attorney who loves
                    you very much...
          
                                                                  74.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul,
                    I'll dump him. If I want to screw
                    Michael or live with him or marry
                    him, then I'll do that.
          
          Thomas, who sits across the room, looks up from his book.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                        (whispering)
                    I'm only looking out for you.
          
                              LETTY
                        (yelling)
                    And if I want to smoke, I'll
                    fucking smoke.
          
          Letty races out the door and into the garden. In the
          distance, Michael spots her and jogs over. Letty's mother
          watches them. Thomas approaches Mrs. Mayer.
          
                              THOMAS
                    Mrs. Mayer, I'm sorry but I
                    couldn't help overhearing. I just
                    wanted to say, not that it's any of
                    my business...
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Yes?
          
                              THOMAS
                    I think, really, I think I'd go
                    with the cream damask.
          I
           NT. REC ROOM - LATER
          
          Letty and Michael walk through the rec room toward the dining
          hall. Nurse Gates bends down in front of Mrs. Hallstrom, who
          sits where we last saw her.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    It's OK to be upset.
          
                              MRS. HALLSTROM
                        (gaily)
                    Upset? Why of course not. My
                    goodness, no. I'm sure she just
                    got hung up.
          
          Letty and Michael stop.
          
                                                                  75.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Mrs. Hallstrom, why don't you join
                    my family for dinner. You'll love
                    my Grandma Rosa.
          
                              MRS. HALLSTROM
                    That's so sweet, Michael. But,
                    really, I've so many things to do.
          
                              LETTY
                    If you change your mind, we'll be
                    in the dining hall.
          
          Michael and Letty walk on, exchanging a sad look.
          
          INT. DINING HALL - LATER
          
          Mr. Santucci and Mrs. Santucci sit at the heads of the table.
          Letty sits between Rosa and Michael.
          
                              ROSA
                        (to Letty)
                    What do you need now?
                        (to Mr. Santucci)
                    Send down the lamb. This girl's as
                    thin as a stick.
          
                               LETTY
                    Oh, no.   I'm stuffed.
          
                              ROSA
                    Tell her to eat, Frank.
          
                               MR. SANTUCCI
                    Mangia.   Mangia.
          
                              MICHAEL
                        (whispering to Letty)
                    You can't turn down Grandma Rosa's
                    lamb.
          
                              ROSA
                    Or my eggplant. I make the best
                    eggplant in L.A. The mozzarella I
                    use, it's so fresh it sweats.
          
          Letty heaps more food on her plate.
          
                              MRS. SANTUCCI
                    Michael says you're a teacher.
          
                                                                      76.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    I was. I'm hoping I'll still have
                    a job when I get out.
          
          Mrs. Hallstrom walks into the room, wearing her Christmas
          stocking cap. She starts to dispense erasers.
          
                              LETTY
                    What's she doing?
          
          Mrs. Hallstrom, practically skipping, zeros in on Grandma
          Rosa. She hands Rosa the gift meant for her daughter.
          
                              MRS. HALLSTROM
                    Rosa, Rosa, you must have this,
                    Rosa.
          
                              ROSA
                    Grazie.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Mrs. Hallstrom, join us. Please.
          
          But, by this point, Mrs. Hallstrom's already bounded away,
          divesting herself of more and more erasers to bewildered
          parents and delighted children.
          
          She clambers onto a table in the middle of the room. Marie
          gets up from another table and leaves the room to get help.
          
                              MRS. HALLSTROM
                    Merry Christmas to all. Ho, ho,
                    ho, ho.
          
                              LETTY
                    Michael, we've got to stop her.
          
          Michael pushes back his chair.   He's trapped between the
          table and the wall.
          
                              MRS. HALLSTROM
                    My goodness, it's so very warm in
                    here. So warm.
          
          She takes off her cap and tosses it to a surprised looking
          man. But she doesn't stop there. With haphazard abandon, she
          begins to disrobe, first her blouse, then her skirt.
          
                              MRS. HALLSTROM
                    Way, way, way too warm for
                    December. Now, let's sing Jingle
                    Bells, Jingle Bells, Jingle all the
                    way...
          
                                                                  77.
          
          
          
          The group looks on in horror, mesmerized by her behavior.
          Then, almost as one, the patients spring into action.
          
          Michael bolts over his dining table and runs to Mrs.
          Hallstrom. He jumps onto her table, trying to restrain the
          dancing woman so he can wrap his sweater around her.
          
          By this time, John, Thomas and Letty have surrounded her in a
          protective enclave. Michael sets Mrs. Hallstrom on the
          ground. She looks up at the group, and continues belting out
          I
          "Jingle Bells."
          
           NT. LINEN CLOSET - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT
          
          Letty and Michael lie on the floor next to each other,
          trading puffs on a cigarette. The glowing ember is the only
          light in the room.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You must have thought about it.
                    Everyone does.
          
                               LETTY
                    I just want to see Beast.
                        (beat)
                    Where would you go?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    The mission up in Santa Barbara.
          
                              LETTY
                    No way.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    That's where I always go when I get
                    out.
          
                              LETTY
                    Why?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    My dad used to take me there when I
                    was little. It's totally quiet.
                    And you can see the ocean for
                    miles.
          
          They smoke for a while.
          
                              LETTY
                    What else would you do?
          
                                                          78.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'd like to drink a bottle of red
                    wine with you and then make love to
                    you and spend the whole night
                    together. And we'd get up in the
                    morning and spend hours lounging
                    around and reading the paper.
          
                              LETTY
                    And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed
                    from the can.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    How can you even mention Spaghetti-
                    O's after eating Grandma Rosa's
                    dinner tonight?
          
                              LETTY
                    I have a terrible confession.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Tell the doctor.
          
                              LETTY
                    I don't like lamb.
          
          Michael sits up.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Then it's over.
          
                                LETTY
                    Lie down.
          
          Michael lies down.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It's a good thing my family loves
                    you.
          
                              LETTY
                    Your family just met me.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You're right. I guess I was
                    projecting. What I should have
                    said is, "It's a good thing I love
                    you."
          
                                LETTY
                    Do you?
          
                                                                       79.
          
          
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I do.
          
                              LETTY
                    Michael, I...
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It's OK. You don't have to say
                    anything.
          
                                 LETTY
                    But I do.     I love you, too.
          
          Michael and Letty lie still, looking into each others eyes.
          
          INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          P
           osters of Harry Houdini and Doug Henning.       Handcuffs and
          card decks all over.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Your Honor, I feel I should be
                    released. I'm sufficiently able to
                    look after...
          
          Michael stops. His eyes glaze over.        His head darts toward
          the corner of the room.
          
                              MICHAEL
                        (to the corner)
                    What? What?
          
          Nothing's there.   Nothing at all.    But Michael keeps staring.
          
          A KNOCK on the door. Michael's eyes refocus.       He opens the
          door to find Letty.
          
                              LETTY
                    John and Nurse Gates are waiting
                    for you.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I
                    look?
          
                               LETTY
                        (straightening his tie)
                    Great. I came to tell you to break
                    a leg, and to give you this for
                    good luck.
          
          Letty hands him the Cracker Jack ring.
          
                                                                     80.
          
          
          
          INT. COMMITMENT COURT - DAY
          
          Michael sits near the front of the courtroom with half a
          dozen other patients from various institutions.
          
          Nurse Gates sits a few rows back near JOHN'S MOTHER and
          Michael's family--Mr. and Mrs. Santucci and Grandma Rosa.
          
          JUDGE MILTON, 60s, questions John, who's on the stand.
          
                              JUDGE MILTON
                    Why have you petitioned to leave
                    the institution?
          
                              JOHN
                    I haven't had an episode in more
                    than a month, Sir.
          
                              JUDGE MILTON
                    How do you plan to support
                    yourself?
          
                              JOHN
                    My family's helping me out, Your
                    Honor.
          
                              JUDGE MILTON
                    Where will you live upon release?
          
                                JOHN
                    Live?
          
          John's mother nods encouragingly at him.
          
                              JUDGE MILTON
                    Where do you plan to reside, Mr.
                    Lockyer?
          
                              JOHN
                    With my mother.
          
                              JUDGE MILTON
                    Is your mother here today?
          
          John points to her.   John's mother waves at the judge.
          
                              JOHN
                    That's the bitch. That cock-
                    sucking bitch. She put me here.
                    She did. She's the Satan that did
                    this all.
          
                                                                  81.
          
          
          
          As bailiffs remove John from the stand, Michael offers a wan
          smile to his family.

          Michael, outwardly poised and collected, sits on the stand.
          His hands are clenched in tight fists.
          
                              JUDGE MILTON
                    The records indicate no major
                    episodes in the past four months.
                    And it seems you have the support
                    of the staff.
          
                                MICHAEL
                    Yes, Sir.
          
                              JUDGE MILTON
                    But I see you've been in and out of
                    the hospital more than ten times.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Eleven, Your Honor.   But I'm on a
                    new medication now.
          
                              JUDGE MILTON
                    Do you feel ready to re-enter the
                    world?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Yes, Sir. My family is    prepared to
                    support me until I find   a job.
                    They've already located   an
                    apartment for me that's   very near
                    them.
          
                              JUDGE MILTON
                    Very well, then. By order of the
                    court, you are released. I wish
                    you good luck.
          
          Michael's shoulders relax. He opens his fist. Inside is the
          Cracker Jack ring, and the magenta circle it has imprinted on
          his palm.
          
          EXT. COMMITMENT COURT - LATER
          
          Michael walks to the car with his mother, father and
          grandmother, who keeps tousling his hair with pride.
          
                                                                     82.
          
          
          
          INT. VISITING ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Letty stands awkwardly in front of Paul, who sits in a
          wingback chair.
          
                              PAUL
                    What's so urgent?   You've got me
                    worried.
          
                              LETTY
                    I need to tell you something, and
                    I'm not sure how.
          
          Paul stands.
          
                               PAUL
                    You can tell me anything.
                        (beat)
                    Do you want to postpone the
                    wedding? Is it too much pressure?
          
                                LETTY
                    No...
          
                              PAUL
                    That's a load off my mind.
          
                              LETTY
                    Paul, I want to break off the
                    engagement.
                              P
                                 AUL
                    You what?
          
                              LETTY
                    I don't mean to hurt you.    I know
                    this is a terrible thing.    And I
                    have really loved you.
          
                              PAUL
                    Whoa. Whoa. Have really loved me?
                    Letty, it's natural to be nervous.
                    But we're going to work through our
                    problems.
          
                              LETTY
                    I've met someone else.
          
                                PAUL
                    Who?
          
                              LETTY
                    It doesn't matter who.
          
                                                                  83.
          
          
          
                              PAUL
                    Have you been seeing another
                    teacher?
          
                              LETTY
                    No.
          
                              PAUL
                    It's a doctor, isn't it? That's
                    unethical. I'll have him rung up
                    on malpractice charges so fast his
                    head will spin.
          
                              LETTY
                    He's a patient here.
          
          Paul considers this a moment.
          
                              PAUL
                    Of all the crazy things. I
                    understood when you dropped out of
                    law school. And during this whole
                    mess, I've tried to be supportive.
                    But, really, Letty, what can you be
                    thinking?
          
                              LETTY
                    I love him.
          
                              PAUL
                    You're going to throw away our life
                    together for some shared experience
                    with a looney-tune that you
                    misguidedly think is love?
          
                              LETTY
                    Here's the ring.
          
                              PAUL
                    No way. You keep the ring.     You'll
                    come to your senses.
          
                              LETTY
                    I've made my decision, Paul.
          
                              PAUL
                    You keep it, Letty. This is not
                    over. Our life is not over.
          
          EXT. FRONT STEPS - SAME
          
          Paul walks out the door and down the steps past Michael, who
          runs up them two at a time.
          
                                                                   84.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    How's it hanging, Paul?
          
          Paul turns to watch Michael as Michael swings open the door
          and sails into the institute.
          
          INT. VISITING ROOM - SAME
          
          Letty waits as a NURSE opens the door to the ward.   Letty is
          about to step through, when Michael enters.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Visitor for Ms. Mayer.
          
          Letty whirls around.
          
                                 LETTY
                    Well?        M
                                  ICHAEL
                    Home free.
          
          Letty and Michael hug.
          
                              NURSE
                    Letty, Michael, you have about five
                    minutes until visiting hours end.
          
          The nurse retreats.
          
                              LETTY
                    Tell me all.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I was brilliant, or at least
                    boringly sane.
          
                              LETTY
                    So there were no problems?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Not a one.
          
                              LETTY
                    And did you go to the mission?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    No, you goof, I came to see you.
          
                              LETTY
                    Just checking.
          
                                                                   85.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I saw Paul leaving.    Did you do the
                    dirty deed?
          
                                 LETTY
                    Yeah.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    So, it's over?
          
                               LETTY
                    All over.
                        (beat)
                    Did you see your new apartment?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    One bedroom, second floor, no view.
          
                                 LETTY
                    Furnished?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    No, I need some serious household
                    advice.
          
                              LETTY
                    First off, you'll need to go to
                    Target. And, let's see, what
                    should you buy?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I better make a list.
          
                              LETTY
                    List schmist. You'll remember.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - NIGHT
          
          Letty sits in the corridor opposite Marie and Thomas.   They
          are playing BLACKJACK. Letty deals.
          
                                 THOMAS
                    Hit me.
          
          Letty hands one over.    Thomas flips over his cards.
          
                                 THOMAS
                    I'm over.
          
          Letty looks to Marie, who waves her off. Marie is fine with
          her cards. They look down the hall. Nurse Gates walks beside
          JAMIE, a man in his late 20s, who wears the same dazed
          expression Letty did the morning after she was admitted.
          
                                                                     86.
          
          
          
                              NURSE GATES
                        (to Jamie)
                    Dr. Stone will ask you some
                    questions, and then we'll get you
                    settled.
          
          Nurse Gates and Jamie come upon the gang.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                        (to Letty/Bill)
                    Lights out in 15, Guys.
          
          Nurse Gates continues down the hall, hand firmly planted
                               M
          under Jamie's elbow as he weaves unsteadily beside her.
          
                               ARIE
                    Wow, that first night is hard.
          
                              LETTY
                    It's going to be a difficult few
                    weeks for him.
          
                              THOMAS
                    It really makes you think.
          
                              LETTY
                    It really does.
          
          They look down the hall at the retreating figures.   They look
          at each other.
          
                              MARIE
                    I'll put in 5 that it's a straight
                    diagnosis of depressive
                    personality.
          
                              LETTY
                    Are you kidding? With those glazed
                    eyes? I'm willing to bet 10 there
                    was some break with reality going
                    on there. Psychosis. Without a
                    doubt, psychosis.
          
          INT. DR. EMLEE'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Letty is curled up in a chair opposite Dr. Emlee.
          
                              LETTY
                    But what I really can't believe is
                    that I'm starting to actually miss
                    work.
          
                                                                  87.
          
          
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    Have you been in contact with the
                    principal about your job?
          
                              LETTY
                    I thought about calling, but I want
                    to wait until I know when I'll be
                    out.
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    Then, you should call.
          
                              LETTY
                    What?
          
                              DR. EMLEE
                    I think it's about that time,
                    Letty. The charges against you
                    have been dropped, the drugs have
                    evened out and you seem to be
                    dealing with your life quite well.
          
                              LETTY
                    Are you saying I'm through with
                    therapy?
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                    Let's not be hasty.
                        (beat)
                    I'm saying we should plan a release
                    date for early next week.
          
          Off Letty's excited face, we
          
                                                   CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. TARGET - DAY
          
          Crowds, crowds and more crowds. Michael pulls unsuccessfully
          at a shopping cart that is stuck to another.
          
          A MATRONLY WOMAN walks up, nudges Michael out of the way and
          yanks the cart out of its row. She rolls it toward Michael,
          grabs one for herself and is on her way into the store.
          M
           ichael takes several deep breaths. With trepidation in his
          step, he heads into the great unknown of the crowded store...
          
          
          EXT. TARGET - 30 MINUTES LATER
          
                                                                   88.
          
          
          
          Michael emerges from the store, quite pleased with himself
          that he made it out alive. He commands a cart heaped full of
          useless gadgets and trinkets, a half dozen picture frames and
          about 20 decorative pillows.
          
          EXT. GROUNDS - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Letty and her mother walk briskly through the gardens.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Must you walk so quickly?
          
                              LETTY
                    It's good exercise, Mom.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    I've got 26 years on you. If we
                    could just slow down, we could talk
                    so much easier.
          
          Letty slackens her pace.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    I'm so thankful you'll be leaving
                    next week. If you want me to pick
                    you up, I will.
          
                              LETTY
                    I've already made arrangements.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Ruthie mentioned that Michael might
                    be coming for you.
          
          Letty stops and wags her finger at her mother.
          
                              LETTY
                    Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but
                    you're not allowed to mention
                    Michael.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Not even if it's something
                    positive?
          
                               LETTY
                    Nyet.   That's the condition.
          
          Mother and daughter keep walking in silence.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Have you spoken to Paul at all?
          
                                                                     89.
          
          
          
                               LETTY
                     One more and you're out.
          
                               MRS. MAYER
                     Honestly, Letty.
          
                               LETTY
                     A deal's a deal.
          
          The two walk on in silence.
          
          Silence.
          
          More silence.
          
                               MRS. MAYER
                     Have you heard the figure on how
                     much Queen Elizabeth's going to pay
                     in taxes this year?
          
          Letty stops walking. She turns a sunny smile on her mother,
          then hugs her.      L
                               LETTY
                     I knew you had it in you.
          
          INT. LETTY'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Letty neatly folds garments and lays them in a suitcase.    Dr.
          Emlee looks on.
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                     So, we'll meet every Tuesday and
                     Friday. And if you have any kind
                     of emergency, you can page me.
          
                               LETTY
                     OK, good. That's good. Thanks an
                     awful lot for everything, and for
                     coming down here to see me off.
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                     It was just a little going-away
                     gesture.
          
                               LETTY
                     I have a going-away gesture for
                     you, too.
          
                               DR. EMLEE
                     Oh?
          
                                                                    90.
          
          
          
          Letty puts her hand in her suitcase and rummages through the
          clothes, creating a jumbled mess. She snaps the luggage
          closed. Bits of clothing hang out. They LAUGH.
          
          INT. NURSES' STATION - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Letty sets her duffel bag down next to two suitcases. She
          hugs Marie, John, Thomas, then walks over to Mrs. Hallstrom,
          who hangs back from the group. Letty embraces her.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'll miss you, Mrs. Hallstrom.
          
          There's no response.    Letty goes to Nurse Gates and hugs her.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    Take care, Letty. And, let me know
                    if you need help with any spiders.
          
                              LETTY
                    You know I will.       Thanks for
                    everything.
          
          Letty walks toward Michael, who gathers up her bags.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    See you later, guys.
          
          Michael and Letty walk through the VISITING ROOM...
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Aren't you supposed to throw a
                    bouquet or something?
          
                              LETTY
                    Aren't you ever quiet?
          
          They walk out the doors onto the FRONT STEPS OF THE HOSPITAL.
          Michael grabs Letty's hand as they hurry down the steps.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Where to?
          
                              LETTY
                    I've heard the mission in Santa
                    Barbara is the place to go.
          
          EXT. SANTA BARBARA MISSION - MAGIC HOUR
          
          In the background, the Spanish-style mission blends into the
          hillside. Letty and Michael sit on a bluff, holding hands.
          They look out at the ocean, where the sun heads toward the
          waves in a fiery red glow.
          
                                                                    91.
          
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Michael and Letty walk down the hall. Michael stops at a door
          and showcases it. He jingles the keys.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    This is it -- 3B.     Check it out.
          
                                LETTY
                    Open up.    I want to see.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Close your eyes.
          
          Letty claps her hands over her eyes.    Michael opens the door
          and guides her into his castle.
          
          INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - SAME
          
                                MICHAEL
                    OK.    Open them.
          
          Letty surveys the territory. Forget tables, chairs and
          couches. Throw pillows are strewn everywhere.
          
                                LETTY
                    Wow.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You like it?
          
          Letty picks up a pillow and runs her hand over the fabric.
          She pauses a moment before speaking.
          
                              LETTY
                    I love the pillows.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Throw pillows, Letty. The sales
                    lady said they're the latest thing.
          
                              LETTY
                    Very trendy. Let's see the rest.
          
          Michael leads Letty to the bedroom.
          
          INT. BEDROOM - SAME
          
          A futon bed, draped with a mosquito net, rests in the corner.
          Two TVs take center stage.
          
                              LETTY
                    It's TV heaven.
          
                                                                  92.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I was tired of watching what
                    everyone else wants to watch. Now
                    we can watch two shows at once.
          
                              LETTY
                    Let's try out the bed.
          
          Michael grabs her hand and pulls her toward the door.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You've got to see the kitchen
                    first.
          
          INT. KITCHEN - SAME
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Do you like it?
          
                              LETTY
                    I love your apartment.
          
                                MICHAEL
                    Really?
          
                              LETTY
                    You'll never get rid of me.
          
          Michael kisses Letty on the lips.
          
                              LETTY
                    What do you say we go out to dinner
                    to celebrate?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Out? Are you kidding?     I've got
                    all the fixings here.
          
          Off Letty's look of surprise, we watch Michael open a
          cupboard door. The shelves are filled from top to bottom
          with cans of Spaghetti-O's.
          
          Letty squeezes Michael in a bear hug.
          
          INT. BEDROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Letty, in a T-shirt, and Michael, in boxers, lounge on the
          futon. They watch both TVs -- one tuned-in to Jay Leno, the
          other to David Letterman.
          
          Michael eats from a can of Spaghetti-O's. Letty reaches over
          with her fork and snags a mouthful from Michael's can.
          
                                                                       93.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    How can you not like the Top 10
                    List?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I like it.     But Headlines are
                    better.
          
                              LETTY
                    You're so wrong.
          
          Letty takes her remote and increases the volume on her TV.
          As Letterman gets louder, Michael zaps his volume.
          
          It's a war. Letterman then Leno get LOUDER and LOUDER and
          LOUDER until Letty makes a might lunge. She wrests Michael's
          remote from him. Letty MUTES both TVs.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Hey.
          
                              LETTY
                    It's sex time.
          
          Michael mockingly checks his watch.    Letty climbs on top of
          him. Michael rolls on top of her.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I think it's my turn.
          
          CLOSE on their faces as Michael gently licks the side of
          Letty's mouth.
          
                              LETTY
                    Did I get spaghetti sauce on my
                    face?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    No.
          
          Michael licks Letty's nose.
          
                                 LETTY
                    Michael.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Shhhh.
          
          Michael and Letty look into each other's eyes, bathed in the
          blue light thrown off by the twin televisions.
          
          Michael places a pillow gently beneath Letty's head.    He
          caresses her face.
          
                                                                     94.
          
          
          
          Letty's eyes are alive to every look, every touch. Michael
          kisses her slowly on the forehead, the nose, and the lips.
          
          CLOSE on Letty's hands as she reaches up to stroke Michael's
          forehead and caress his temple.
          
          CLOSER on her hands as Letty runs them through Michael's
          hair, then twists a curly lock around her finger.
          
          SOFT MOANS as we
          
                                                         DISSOLVE TO:
          
          INT. BEDROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - DAY
          
          CLOSE on Letty's hand, resting on the comforter on Michael's
          bed. The alarm clock RINGS. Letty's hand slaps it into
          submission.
          
          INT. BEDROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Letty's still in bed, a look of bliss across her face.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    Letty?   Rise and shine.
          
                                                         LETTY'S POV:
          
          Michael's face fills her vision.
          
                                                       BACK TO SCENE:
          
          Letty's eyes close.
          
                                 LETTY
                    Not yet.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'll be forced to tickle you.
          
          Letty opens one eye and glares at him.
                               L
                                 LETTY
                    Go away.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    How about this? It's 10:30.
          
          Letty bolts upright.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm supposed to meet the principal
                    in half an hour.
          
                                                                     95.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I'll see you tonight.
          
          Michael gives her a kiss and walks into the LIVING ROOM.
          
          Michael adjusts his tie. Letty, naked, runs into the room
          and throws her arms around his neck.
          
                                 LETTY
                    Good luck.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You, too. Kick ass today.
          
          Michael walks out the door. Letty thinks for a minute. She
          flings open the door and yells to Michael's retreating back.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - SAME
          
                              LETTY
                    My apartment tonight.   You can meet
                    Beast.
          
          Michael swings around.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Sounds good. Oh, and Letty?
          
                                 LETTY
                    Yeah?
          
                              MICHAEL
                        (yelling)
                    You've got one hell of a great
                    body.
          
          The door across the hall opens. A LITTLE OLD MAN stares at
          Letty's naked figure. She slams Michael's apartment door.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - SAME
          
          Letty collapses in GIGGLES.
          
          INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
          
          Letty sits across from the principal.
          
                               PRINCIPAL GAIL
                    I didn't have any choice but to
                    include the parents' letters in
                    your file.
          
                                                          96.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    Well, I understand.     I know my
                    behavior was poor.
          
                              PRINCIPAL GAIL
                    So, in light of how the parents
                    feel, and the fact the students are
                    doing so well with the substitute,
                    I don't think I can put you back in
                    the classroom just yet.
          
                              LETTY
                    Look, Gail, I've been a good
                    teacher.
          
                               PRINCIPAL GAIL
                    I know, Letty. But the incident
                    with Zach was frightening for the
                    children.
                        (beat)
                    Now if you'd come to me, explained
                    what was going on...
          
                              LETTY
                    Believe me, I wish I'd understood
                    what was going on. I've worked
                    really hard to get better.
                              P
                               RINCIPAL GAIL
                    I'm glad you're doing well.
          
                              LETTY
                    I've already thought about how to
                    tell the kids where I was.
          
          Letty hands the principal a letter.
          
                               LETTY
                    And I'd like to send the parents
                    this letter of explanation. With
                    your support, I think they can
                    accept me.
          
          The principal reads the letter.
          
                              PRINCIPAL GAIL
                    It's a very nice letter. But I
                    have to go with what's best for the
                    students.
          
                              LETTY
                    What does that mean?
          
                                                                  97.
          
          
          
                              PRINCIPAL GAIL
                    I need someone to work on budget
                    projections.
          
                              LETTY
                    Office work?
          
                              PRINCIPAL GAIL
                    Or, of course, you could take a
                    sabbatical the rest of the year.
          
          INT. BANK - DAY
          
          Michael sits at a back desk with MR. SMYTHE, who wears a
          three-piece pin-striped suit and taps a pencil on his knee.
          
                              MR. SMYTHE
                    It's not that we're doubting your
                    intelligence, Mr. Santucci. But
                    your work history shows so many
                    interruptions.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I know, but as I said...
          
                               MR. SMYTHE
                    I appreciate your candor about your
                    illness, but my bosses are
                    concerned.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I can do the job.
          
                              MR. SMYTHE
                    Between you and me, my uncle, he
                    has some mental problems, and I
                    know what you're going through. If
                    it were up to me, I'd hire you.
          
          Michael's already standing.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    Right.   Thanks for your help.
          
          He shakes Mr. Smythe's hand, and, downcast, gets out of the
          bank as quickly as he can.
          
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - LETTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Letty sits on the floor. She gulps down some aspirin, then
          hauls Beast into her lap. The doorbell RINGS.
          
                                                                  98.
          
          
          
                                 LETTY
                    It's open.
          
          Michael walks in, and looks around.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Gosh, Letty, this is a great place.
          
                                 LETTY
                    Thanks.
          
          He kisses her, and lies down on the floor to stroke the cat.
                               M
                               ICHAEL
                    This must be Beast.
          
                              LETTY
                    That's Mr. Beast to you.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    How was your day?
          
                              LETTY
                    I bombed. It's either work in the
                    office or nothing.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Sounds grim.
          
                                LETTY
                    Yeah.    How was the job search?
          
          Michael makes a thumbs-down gesture.
          
                              LETTY
                    Who ever said sanity was fun?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
          
                                 LETTY
                    Promise?
          
                               MICHAEL
                    Promise.
                        (beat)
                    As long as we have steak.
          
                                 LETTY
                    Steak?
          
                                                                     99.
          
          
          
                               MICHAEL
                    It's a well-known fact that a red-
                    meat dinner can cure the blues.
                        (beat)
                    You and Beast wait here. I'll be
                    back in a jiff.
          
          Letty gives Michael a tired smile. Michael jumps up and
          leaves. A moment passes. The door opens again.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    While I'm gone why don't you slip
                    into something a little more naked?
          
          EXT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT
          
          Michael walks out of the grocery store, loaded down with
          bags. He carries a bottle of wine and a bunch of flowers.
          
          He passes two ladies who gossip outside the store.
          
                              LADY ONE
                    I can't believe he did that.
          
                              LADY TWO
                    What a weirdo.
          
          Michael stops abruptly.   He turns back and looks at the
          women. They LAUGH.
          
          Michael starts toward the car. He hears more LAUGHTER from
          the women. He turns back and walks up to them.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Don't ever talk about me again, you
                    hear me?
          
          The women pull back in fright.
          
          INT. KITCHEN - LETTY'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Letty, in a skimpy negligee, lights candles on the table.
          Michael enters with the groceries and wine.
          
                              LETTY
                    I thought maybe you got lost.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    The store was busy.
          
                              LETTY
                    You got wine. That's great.
          
          M
          
          
          
          
                                                                   100.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Would you mind if we just called it
                    an early night?
          
                              LETTY
                    You go ahead and relax. I'll cook.
                              M
                               ICHAEL
                    I think I should go home.
          
                              LETTY
                    Are you OK?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Big restaurant interview tomorrow.
          
                              LETTY
                    But what about the red meat-blues
                    thing?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You know, we've got that dinner
                    with my parents tomorrow, too. I
                    should really get some rest
                    tonight.
          
          Michael gives Letty a kiss good night. He leaves. She
          stares after him. Reluctantly, she blows out the candles and
          starts putting the groceries away.
          
                              LETTY
                        (to Beast)
                    How's filet sound?
          
          INT. RESTAURANT - DAY
          
          The coffee shop hasn't opened for business yet. Michael and
          six people in their early 20s fill out applications.
          
           ichael stares blankly at his application.    He fills out his
          name. He can't get any further.
          
          TWO OTHER APPLICANTS glance toward him.   Michael tries to
          write. He can't.
          
                              MICHAEL
                        (under his breath)
                    No, no, no. Not now. No.
          
          The other applicants look toward Michael and quickly avert
          their eyes. The RESTAURANT MANAGER walks up to the group.
          
                                                                  101.
          
          
          
          Michael grabs his briefcase and walks out of the restaurant.
          His application, incomplete, remains on the table.
          
          INT. KITCHEN - SANTUCCI HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          This kitchen is the heart of the home--copper pots, two pasta
          makers and every size wooden spoon made.
          
          Letty, lightly dusted with flour, mixes fresh pasta with her
          hands. Mrs. Santucci peers into the bowl.
          
                              MRS. SANTUCCI
                    More water. It's too pasty.
          
          Letty pours in more water.
          
                               LETTY
                    I'll never Mget the hang of this.
          
                               RS. SANTUCCI
                    All the Santucci women go through
                    this.
          
          Letty smiles at her and kneads harder.   Mr. Santucci enters
          and kisses his wife.
          
                              MR. SANTUCCI
                    Hi there, Letty.
          
                                 LETTY
                    Hi, Frank.
          
          Mr. Santucci looks in the pasta bowl.
          
                              MR. SANTUCCI
                    It needs more water.
          
          He dumps some in.   Letty looks sadly at the gloppy mess.
          
                              LETTY
                        (to Mrs. Santucci)
                    Maybe we should make lamb next
                    week.
          
          Michael walks in.
          
                              MRS. SANTUCCI
                    Hi, Sweetheart.
          
                              LETTY
                    How'd it go?
          
                                                                 102.
          
          
          
          Michael takes his tie, holds it up like a noose and lets his
          tongue loll out of his mouth.
          
                              LETTY
                    What happened?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Four interviews. Four no-gos.
          
                              LETTY
                    The restaurant, too?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I couldn't even face that one.
          
          Mr. and Mrs. Santucci look at each other.
          
                              LETTY
                    That's OK. We can call and
                    reschedule in the morning.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You don't have to take care of me,
                    you know.
          
          An uneasy silence falls in the room.
          
                              MRS. SANTUCCI
                    Maybe we should save the job talk
                    for after dinner.
          
          Michael looks in the bowl of pasta dough that Letty continues
          to labor over. He reaches in to help with the mixing.
          
                              MICHAEL
                        (to Letty)
                    Just promise you'll love me even if
                    I end up in a job where I have to
                    wear a blue polyester cap.
          
                              LETTY
                    I think you know I'd love you even
                    more in a blue polyester cap.
          
          INT. BATHROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Michael finishes brushing his teeth. He opens the medicine
          cabinet, pulls out a prescription bottle and pours a pill
          into his hand.
          
                              LETTY (OS)
                    You're going to miss the Top Ten.
          
                                                                 103.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Coming.
          
          He raises the pill to his mouth, then opens his hand and lets
          it drop in the sink. Michael runs the water and watches the
          pill swirl slowly down the drain.
          
                              LETTY (OS)
                    Michael, hurry.
          
          Michael stuffs the pill bottle in a bottom drawer. He opens
          the door, sprints into the bedroom and leaps onto Letty, who
          lies on the futon. Letty SCREAMS and LAUGHS.
          
          INT. MCDONALD'S RESTAURANT - DAY
          
          Michael sits in a booth drinking coffee. He bows over an
          application, pen in hand. About a third is filled out.
          
          INT. SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Letty and Superintendent Johansen sit on the floor, which is
          covered with math games, posters and charts.
          
                              LETTY
                    I think I could get the program up
                    and running in the next two weeks.
          
                              JOHANSEN
                    From what I understand the
                    principal has removed you from
                    student activities.
          
                              LETTY
                    She's worried that I'm unstable.
          
          Johansen studies her.
          
                              LETTY
                    But I wouldn't push for the program
                    if I wasn't ready.
          
                              JOHANSEN
                    What about the office work?
          
                              LETTY
                    I'd have to do that, too. But I've
                    gotten better at pacing myself.
          
                              JOHANSEN
                    Are you sure?
          
                                                                  104.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    I'll call you if I have problems.
                    Scout's honor.
          
                              JOHANSEN
                    I have to say I'm inclined to give
                    it another try.
          
          Letty hugs Johansen.
          
                               JOHANSEN
                    But, Letty, why don't you give
                    yourself three weeks to set it up
                    this time?
          
          INT. MCDONALD'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          Michael sits in the same booth, eating a hamburger.   About
          half of the application is now completed.
          
          
          INT. TUXEDO SHOP - NIGHT
          
          Letty and her mother sit in silence. Letty smiles at her
          mother. Her mother gives her a very tiny smile back.
          
          Michael hurries in.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Hey, Letty. Mrs. Mayer.
          
                              LETTY
                    I got worried. Are you OK?
          
          Michael pulls a blue polyester hat out of his pocket and puts
          it on.               M
                               ICHAEL
                    How may I help you?
          
                              LETTY
                    Congratulations.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Michael, the shop's about to close.
                    Maybe you could try on your tux.
          
          Michael heads to the dressing room in the back of the store.
          
                              LETTY
                        (to Mrs. Mayer)
                    Michael just got a job.    Couldn't
                    you congratulate him?
          
                                                                   105.
          
          
          
                               MRS. MAYER
                    I will, Dear. I promise.
                        (beat)
                    Why McDonald's?
          
                              LETTY
                    He's been looking everywhere for
                    weeks, Mom.   It's not that easy
                    after you've been locked away.
          
          Letty looks toward the back of the store.    Her mother looks
          at her. Letty ignores her mother.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    I've read that lots of people my
                    age are supplementing their incomes
                    these days by working at McDonald's
                    and Burger King.
          
          Letty looks at her mother, tries to read her.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm going to take that as an honest
                    effort at being open minded.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                    Don't be fresh.
          
                              LETTY
                    Just remember that I love him.
          
          Michael walks out of the dressing room and advances toward
          the two women, bowing in Cary Grant fashion as he nears.
          
          Letty's mother turns to her daughter, who beams brightly at
          the dashing Michael.
          
                              MRS. MAYER
                        (to Letty)
                    I'll say this, Dear.   He looks damn
                    good in a tuxedo.

                    Aunt Lily is the one who married
                    your father's cousin?
          
                              LETTY
                    No, that's Aunt Connie. Lily is
                    the one who looks like a hooker.
          
                                                                    106.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Oh. And, Harry, he's the one who
                    likes magic?
          
                              LETTY
                    You don't have to know all this by
                    Saturday. It took me years.
          
          INT. CHURCH - DAY
          
          Every inch of every pew in the Baroque church is stuffed with
          guests. Michael sits in the second row. He cranes his head
          around as "Pachelbel's Canon" RINGS OUT and the FLOWER GIRL
          L
          advances.
          
          Letty, in the first part of the bride's maids' procession,
          heads down the aisle next. The bride is nowhere in sight.
          
          But even so, as soon as Michael spots Letty, he stands.
          Everyone else remains seated. They look at him. Michael
          doesn't notice. He has eyes only for Letty.
          
          Letty's mother looks at Michael with more than annoyance.
          Begrudgingly, she also stands.
          
          Following the lead, the entire church stands for Letty.    She
          smiles at Michael.
          
          INT. BALLROOM - COUNTRY CLUB - LATER
          
          A parade of guests pass through the receiving line to greet
          Mr. Mayer, Monica, Letty, Mrs. Mayer, Ruth and Jake.
          
          Michael hovers close to Letty. AUNT LILY, with fluorescent
          red hair and a silver lame miniskirt, spots him.
          
                              AUNT LILY
                        (to Michael)
                    What a beautiful wedding.
          
          As she passes out of earshot,
          
                               MICHAEL
                        (to Letty)
                    Aunt Lily?
          
                              LETTY
                    Bingo.
          
          Mrs. Mayer talks to her brother CORT.
          
                                                                 107.
          
          
          
                               MRS. MAYER
                     Oh, and have you met Michael?    He's
                     Letty's boyfriend.
          
          Letty and Ruth overhear this. They make eye contact.   Ruth
          raises her eyebrows toward Letty. Letty smiles back.
          
          INT.   BALLROOM - LATER
          
          Ruth and Letty talk while Michael twirls across the dance
          floor with Monica.
          
                               RUTH
                     The worst was when I stammered
                     Jake's name.
          
                               LETTY
                     I don't think people even noticed.
                     I thought the ceremony was perfect.
          
                               RUTH
                     That's thanks to all your help.
          
          Cort, overweight and red from drink, approaches Ruth and
          Letty.
          
                               LETTY
                     Uh oh, Uncle Cort at 6 o'clock.
          
                                RUTH
                     Sorry to do this to you. But I am
                     the bride.
          
          Ruth turns and flees. CORT pounces on Letty and plants the
          wettest kiss ever on her mouth.
          
                               CORT
                         (to Letty)
                     I don't think I've seen you in two
                     or three years.
          
                               LETTY
                     Has it been that long?
          
                               CORT
                     You were with that lawyer.
          
                               LETTY
                     I'm dating Michael now.
          
                               CORT
                     Met him in the receiving line. What
                     is it that he does for a living?
          
                                                              108.
          
          
          
          Michael walks up to Letty and Cort as they speak.
          
                              LETTY
                    Well, he just got a job...
                              M
                               ICHAEL
                    In the restaurant business.
          
          Letty looks at Michael, surprised.
          
                               CORT
                    Speak of the devil.
                        (beat)
                    How did you guys meet again?
          
                              LETTY
                    At the psych hospital.
          
                              CORT
                    I would've sent a card, but your
                    aunt and I, we weren't sure if that
                    was the thing to do.
          
                              LETTY
                    That's fine, Uncle Cort.
          
                              CORT
                        (to Michael)
                    So you were a volunteer over at the
                    hospital?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Something like that.
          
                              LETTY
                    When he could get time off from the
                    restaurant business.
          
                              MICHAEL
                        (to Letty)
                    How about a dance?
          
                              CORT
                    You two go ahead. I'm going to go
                    bother that pretty sister of yours
                    for a dance.
          
          Cort gives Letty another big, wet kiss.
          
                              LETTY
                    Bye, Uncle Cort.
                        (to Michael)
                    What's with the lie?
          
                                                                     109.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    It wasn't exactly a lie.
          
                              LETTY
                    Pretty close.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    People at weddings don't want the
                    truth.
          
          Michael grabs a glass of champagne from a passing waiter.
          
                              LETTY
                    It's not good to drink so much with
                    the medication you're on.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    What's with this music? I'll go
                    talk to the D.J. and see if we
                    can't get something good going.
          
          Michael heads toward the D.J. and confers with him.    Mr.
          Mayer walks up to Letty.
          
                              MR. MAYER
                    It's good to see you so happy.
          
                              LETTY
                    Thanks, dad.
          
          Michael then walks back to Letty and pulls her out onto the
          dance floor as "Twist and Shout" BOOMS OUT from the speakers.
          
          Letty's mother departs the dance floor, grimacing. Ruth
          shoots Michael a look of pure pleasure. And everyone begins
          twisting, as we
          
                                                              CUT TO:
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
          
          Completely dark.   Silent.
          
          Letty, in a nightshirt, wanders in, and stumbles through the
          room. She fumbles for the switch on the floor lamp.
          
          The light comes on, illuminating a small circle.    Just
          outside of it sits Michael.
          H
           e stares straight ahead.    Letty kneels down in front of him.
          
                                                                    110.
          
          
          
                               LETTY
                    Michael?
                        (beat)
                    Michael? You should come to bed.
          
          Michael remains focused on the space directly in front of
          him.
          
                               LETTY
                    Did you take the aspirin and water?
                    You don't want to feel awful in the
                    morning.
                        (beat)
                    I'll get you some.
          
          Letty begins to stand up. The movement breaks Michael's
          trance. He pulls her back down.
          
                              LETTY
                    What is it? Are you OK?
          
                              MICHAEL
                        (strangely calm)
                    Always the drugs.
          
                              LETTY
                    What?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I saw you talking to my Mom.
          
                              LETTY
                    We both talked to her, Michael.
                    And your dad.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Why'd you tell her I wasn't taking
                    my meds?
          
                              LETTY
                    What do you mean not taking your
                    meds?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Why'd you tell?
          
                              LETTY
                    I didn't talk to her about
                    medications, Michael. Don't be
                    silly.
          
          Michael beats his hand on the floor.
          
                                                                     111.
          
          
          
                               MICHAEL
                    Silly?   Silly am I?
          
                              LETTY
                    Michael, take it easy.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Silly, silly, silly.
          
                              LETTY
                    I think I should call someone.
          
          Michael reaches out, grabs the floor lamp, and pushes it
          over. He lurches to his feet and pulls Letty to a standing
          position.
          
                              MICHAEL
                        (screaming)
                    Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you
                    upset my Mom.
          
                              LETTY
                    Michael, calm down. Please. It's
                    OK.
          
          Michael knocks some flowers over, then rips apart a pillow.
          
          Letty hovers in back of him.     He pauses.   She puts her hand
          on his back.
          
          Michael whirls around.   He slaps Letty's hand away. She
          stumbles backward.
          
                              LETTY
                    Michael, stop.
          
          He stares in her direction, but he doesn't respond.      Letty
          can't make a connection.
          
          Michael shoves his fist through a window.
          
          Letty grabs the phone.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Not my Mom. Not my silly silly
                    Mom.
          
          Letty runs with the phone. Michael follows her. Letty
          trips. She rights herself. She locks herself in the bathroom.
          
          INT. BATHROOM, MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - SAME
          M
           ichael POUNDS on the bathroom door.     Letty dials 9-1-1.
          
                                                                    112.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    I've got an emergency.    I'm at...
          
          Michael HOWLS -- a long, piercing inhuman sound.
          
                              LETTY
                    1450 North Jenkins. Apartment 2.
                    My boyfriend's out of control.
          
          On the other side of the door, Michael SCREAMS.    Another
          window SHATTERS.
          
                              NEIGHBOR (OS)
                    What's going on in there?
          
                               LETTY
                        (into phone)
                    Please, please, send someone.
                        (beat)
                    No, he's having an attack. He's
                    schizophrenic...
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - MICHAEL'S APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Letty, wearing Michael's tux jacket, is curled up on the
          floor in a fetal position.
          
          She stares...at the upset flowers, at the ripped-up pillows,
          at a fist-sized hole ripped through an unsturdy wall. Her
          gaze stops on a Spaghetti-O's can, lying empty on the floor.
          
          KNOCKS on the door.   Letty rises slowly, padding to the door
          like an old woman.
          
          The KNOCKS grow urgent.   Letty opens the door to Ruth.
          
          Letty throws herself into Ruth's waiting embrace.
          Immediately, Letty cries.
          
          After a moment, Letty steps back.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm sorry, so sorry.   I never
                    should have called.
          
          Ruth looks into Letty's eyes.
          
                              RUTH
                    You did the right thing.
          
                              LETTY
                    I ruined your wedding night.
          
                                                                  113.
          
          
          
                              RUTH
                    I'm glad you called. Now, not
                    another word about it.
          
          Ruth pulls Letty into the apartment and shuts the door behind
          them. It is only then that she sees the destruction in the
          living room. Horror flashes across her face.
          
                                 RUTH
                    Oh my God.
          
          Tears stream down Letty's face.   Ruth starts to cry.
          
                              RUTH
                    Did he hurt you?
          
          Letty shakes her head "no." Her sobbing intensifies. Ruth
          puts her arm around Letty, and together, they sit on the
          floor.
          
          Ruth holds Letty until the crying eases.
          
                              LETTY
                    Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
                              R
                               UTH
                    You don't have to make any
                    decisions tonight.
          
                              LETTY
                    But what am I going to do?
          
                              RUTH
                    Do you want to go see him? I'll
                    take you if you want to go.
          
                                LETTY
                    I can't.    I can't see him there.
          
          Ruth holds her close again.
          
                               LETTY
                    I was so sure. I really thought it
                    would work.
                        (beat)
                    We have plans, Ruth.
          
                                RUTH
                    I know.    I know.
          
                                                                 114.
          
          
          
          EXT. SANTA BARBARA MISSION - DAY
          
          Letty sits on the same bluff she once shared with Michael.
          She smokes a cigarette, and stares out at the ocean.
          
          EXT. SANTA BARBARA MISSION - LATER
          
          Letty remains on the bluff, crying. A priest, passing in the
          background looks over at her, and continues on his way.
          
          EXT. SANTA BARBARA MISSION - NIGHT
          
          In the darkness, Letty lies on her back. She stares up at
          the moon and stars, bright against the night sky.
          
          EXT. BOTANICAL GARDENS - DAY
          
          Letty walks along a pathway with Paul.
          
                              PAUL
                    I'm glad you agreed to see me.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm just glad there aren't any hard
                    feelings.
          
                              PAUL
                    Oh, none. None. I completely
                    understand what was going on.
          
                              LETTY
                    Oh.
          
                              PAUL
                    How's work going?    Are you back at
                    school?
          
                              LETTY
                    I start on Monday.
          
                              PAUL
                    So things are back on track?
          
                              LETTY
                    Getting back.
          
                              PAUL
                    I heard about your friend.
          
                              LETTY
                    What?
          
                                                                   115.
          
          
          
                              PAUL
                    I heard your friend was back in the
                    hospital.
          
                               LETTY
                    Michael.   Yes.
          
                              PAUL
                    I just wondered, well, if this
                    meant there was a chance for us.
                    Because I think about you a lot,
                    and I still feel...
          
                               LETTY
                    Our relationship meant a lot to me,
                    too, Paul. But it's over.
                        (beat)
                    And Michael being in the hospital
                    doesn't really change things.
          
                              PAUL
                    I think I've heard this speech
                    before.
          
                              LETTY
                    I'm really sorry.
          
          Letty reaches up to hug him.    He quickly disengages himself.
                               P
                               AUL
                    I've got a deposition that I really
                    need to get cracking on, so if you
                    don't mind...
          
                              LETTY
                    Sure, I understand.
          
          Paul starts down the path.
          
                              LETTY
                    Wait. Wait.
          
          Letty runs up to Paul.
          
                              LETTY
                    I need to give you this.
          
          Letty hands Paul the engagement ring. He takes it and
          continues walking as she stares after him.
          
                                                                 116.
          
          
          
          EXT. HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY
          
          Letty walks up the steps to the imposing facility. We follow
          her journey through the VISITING ROOM, past families
          conversing with patients, to the NURSES' STATION.
          
          Letty walks up to Nurse Gates, who gives her a quick hug.
          John and Bill watch as Letty signs the visitors' register.
          
                              NURSE GATES
                    He's in Jamie's old room.
          
          Letty walks down the HALLWAY and pauses outside Michael's
          door. She KNOCKS.
          
                               MICHAEL (OS)
                    Come in.
          
          INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - SAME
          
          Michael is in the middle of taping up the same Houdini poster
          we saw in his last room when Letty enters.
          
                               LETTY
                    Hi.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    Hey.
          
          Letty and Michael kiss awkwardly.    Dead silence.
          
                              LETTY/MICHAEL (TOGETHER)
                    How are you?
          
          They smile nervously.
          
                              LETTY
                    I guess we need to talk.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I guess so.
          
                              LETTY
                    It's hard to know where to start.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Pretend like I'm your shrink.
          
          Letty rolls her eyes.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    Sorry.   I'll be quiet.
          
                                                                   117.
          
          
          
                              LETTY
                    I think about you all the time.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I sure know what that feels like.
          
                              LETTY
                    And all the plans we have.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Yeah, the plans.
          
          Letty looks out the window.
          
                              LETTY
                    I've been thinking I could try to
                    visit you at night after work, and
                    then there'd be more time on
                    weekends to see...
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Letty, please.
                              L
                                 LETTY
                    What?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Like I've told you before I don't
                    want you taking care of me.
          
                              LETTY
                    Someone has to take care of you
                    right now, Michael. You tore up
                    the apartment. You stopped taking
                    your medications.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean
                    to do that.
          
                              LETTY
                    Well then why'd it happen?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I don't know. I don't fucking
                    know.
          
          Letty and Michael glare at each other.    Letty looks away.
          
                                 LETTY
                    I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to
                    blame you.
          
                                                                    118.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I didn't mean for any of this to
                    happen.
          
                              LETTY
                    Oh, God, Michael, I know.
                        (softly)
                    Why does everything have to be so
                    hard?
          
          Michael shakes his head.
          
                              LETTY
                    What are we going to do?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    What do you want to do?
          
                              LETTY
                    I know I don't want to lose you.     I
                    don't think I could stand it.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Yeah, but can you stand to be with
                    me like this?
          
          Letty waits. She looks away. She turns back and stares into
          Michael's eyes. Finally, she says it.
          
                               LETTY
                    No. I can't, Michael. I'm so sorry,
                    but I just can't handle all this
                    right now.
          
          Letty starts to cry.   Tears well up in Michael's eyes.
          
                               MICHAEL
                    I know.   I can't either.
          
          Michael sits down on the bed and they hold each other.
          
                              LETTY
                    I love you so much.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I love you too, Letty.     I love you,
                    too.
          
          Letty and Michael grip each other.    Finally, they pull apart.
          
                              LETTY
                    Maybe we could just run away to
                    Tahiti and live on the beach.
          
                                                                 119.
          
          
          
                              MICHAEL
                    That's the best idea I've heard in
                    a long time.
          
          Letty wipes a tear from Michael's cheek.
          
                              LETTY
                    Don't you have a magic trick or
                    something to make this easier?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    How about something better?   Like a
                    kiss.
          T
           he couple kisses more tenderly than ever before.
          
                              LETTY
                    I can still come visit you, you
                    know.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Would that really be such a good
                    idea for either of us?
          
                              LETTY
                    Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
          
                              MICHAEL
                    I will. And you make sure you take
                    care of yourself.
          
          Michael puts his hand under Letty's chin and draws her head
          up so he can look into her eyes.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    Promise you won't fall for any guys
                    pretending to be doctors.
          
          Letty shakes her head "no" as tears stream down her face.
          
                              LETTY
                    I guess I should go now.
          
                              MICHAEL
                    You should go.
          
          Letty stands up and walks toward the door. She comes back
          and embraces Michael again. Slowly, they separate, and Letty
          leaves the room. Michael stares out the window.
          
                                                                 120.
          
          
          
          EXT. HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - SAME
          
          Letty walks out the door, down the steps and along the front
          walkway -- until, finally, the hospital recedes in the
          distance.
          
          INT. CLASSROOM - CHASEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY
          
          Letty sits on top of a desk. Children of all ages stare her
          down. A few familiar faces--Bobby and Jenny--grace the room.
          Principal Gail passes outside the window and glances in.
          
                               LETTY
                    First of all, I want to welcome you
                    to MathShop. I have lots of fun
                    games planned for us.
                        (beat)
                    Let's see, Bobby, can you help me
                    pass out these cards?
          
          Bobby doesn't move.
          
                              LETTY
                    Is something wrong, Bobby?
          
                              BOBBY
                    Why were you gone so long?
          
                              JENNY
                    My mom said you went crazy.
          
                              LETTY
                    I had what some people call a
                    nervous breakdown. I wasn't
                    dealing with life so well so I
                    went...
          
                              BOBBY
                    To a place for psychos.
          
                              LETTY
                    To a psychiatric institution.
                              J
                               ENNY
                    What's that?
          
                               LETTY
                    It's a place where you figure out
                    what you want, and what things in
                    your life aren't working. You
                    learn to look out for yourself and
                    not get...
          
                                                                 121.
          
          
          
          Letty trails off. She sees that she's lost the class. Bobby
          launches a spit wad that hits the boy in front of him.
          
                              LETTY
                    Let me show you the best thing I
                    learned.
          
          She walks up to Bobby. He twists around in his seat, trying
          to hide the rest of his supply of spit wads.
          
          Letty waves her hand around Bobby's head. The children,
          stare, delighted. She pulls a bright coin out of his ear,
          and hands it to him.
          
                              CHILDREN (TOGETHER)
                    Wow./ Neat./ Do it again, Miss
                    Mayer.
          
          Letty puts her hands behind her back and produces a bouquet
          of paper flowers. Now, she's got the class hooked.
          
                                                           FADE OUT
          
                                     THE END
