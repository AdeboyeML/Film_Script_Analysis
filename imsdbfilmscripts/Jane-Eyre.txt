          EXT. A MIDSUMMER DAWN. THORNFIELD - THE GROUNDS.
                         
          First light. Jane Eyre is running across a meadow, flushed
          and breathless; the hem of her plain, black dress soaked
          with dew. She carries a shawl and has a small bag of
          belongings over her shoulder.
                         
          She trips, falls to her knees; looks back. Expressive eyes,
          open features. She is desperate. We see the house she is
          running from; a Jacobean battlemented mansion.
                         
          Her need to escape is so great that she crawls forward
          until she is able to raise herself to her feet. She runs.
                         
          She reaches an antique stile by a brook. She lifts herself
          on to it. She lands on the road. And runs.
                         
                         
          I/E. DAY. A ROADSIDE/COACH.
                         
          The sun is higher in the sky. Jane exhausted, now running
          down a main road. Her spirts lift at the sight of an
          approaching coach. She flags it down.
                         
          Jane empties her purse into the driver's hand. He looks at
          her money then suspiciously back at her. A terse nod
          indicates she can get in.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Jane sinks into a dark corner. Her fellow passengers look
          shocked by her dishevelled appearance at such an early
          hour. She undertakes a tremendous effort not to betray her
          emotional state. She doesn't sob, she doesn't howl -
          although her breathing threatens to. Slowly, unable to bear
          the day, she closes her eyes.
                         
                         
          EXT. EVENING. WHITCROSS.
                         
          Sunset. A whitewashed, stone pillar set up where four roads
          meet on a barren moor. The coach driver opens the door.
          With a curt nod he indicates that Jane must get out.
                         
          She looks around, dismayed. In each direction there is open
          moorland for as far as the eye can see. The driver sets off
          at a good pace - glad to be rid of such a passenger. Jane
          puts her hand to her side for her bag of belongings. It is
          not there.
                         
          She runs as fast as she can after the coach. It is receding
          towards the horizon. She comes to a halt, objectless, lost,
          alone. She pulls her knitted shawl around her.
                         
          She leaves the road and sets off across the moor, into the
          gathering dark.

          EXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR.
                         
          Jane is on her knees by a strange overhanging rock. The
          night sky is awesome; the universe is all around her. She
          is trying to calm herself with a prayer.
                         
                         
          EXT. DAY. THE MOOR.
                         
          Jane lies on a great rock, soaking up the heat of the sun.
          She is like someone numb with pain. She watches a lizard
          crawl over the rock. She is mesmerised.
                         
                         
          EXT. TWILIGHT. THE MOOR.
                         
          Jane squats in the heather and eats bilberries as the light
          fades. She hungrily licks the juice from her hand.
                         
                         
          EXT. DAWN. THE MOOR.
                         
          Jane is asleep in the heather, her shawl wrapped around
          her. A red-haired child in a white nightgown lies by her
          side, watching her. It is Helen Burns.
                         
          Helen reaches out. She touches Jane's hand. Jane wakes. She
          sits up. She is alone.
                         
                         
          EXT. DAY. BY A RIVER.
                         
          Jane is crouched on a rock watching the waters go by. The
          sky is overcast. The first big drops of rain land on the
          stones. Jane makes no movement.
                         
          A raven lands on a rock nearby. Jane is suddenly filled
          with a wild rage. She picks up a stone and hurls it at the
          bird with a raw cry. The gesture exhausts her. She watches
          the bird wheel away, as the rain starts to pour.
                         
                         
          EXT. TWILIGHT. A FARM BY A WOOD.
                         
          It is raining hard. Jane sees a small girl come out of the
          farm with some leftovers. She drops them into a pigpen.

          Jane leaning into the pigpen. She picks a stiffened mould
          of porridge out of the mud. She lets the rain wash it. She
          eats it ravenously.

          It has stopped raining. Jane is huddled under a tree. She
          is shaking, shuddering. The life has gone out of her eyes.

          EXT. DAY. THE EDGE OF THE WOOD.
                         
          The moors rise away above her to the horizon. Jane looks up
          at the sun starting to set. The clouds are red and gold.
                         
          She sees a small red-haired girl in a white nightgown
          walking barefoot on the moors ahead of her. The girl turns,
          looks back at Jane. With her last strength, Jane follows.
                         
                         
          EXT. EVENING. THE MOOR.
                         
          Dark clouds are banking up; the rain starts again. Jane is
          struggling through a marsh. Her boots are stuck.
                         
          She falls. Her hand disappears into mud; her face pressed
          against the earth. She doesn't move. She has reached the
          point of despair.
                         
          The girl's bare feet walk close by, as if waiting for her.
          Jane looks up. Where the child should be, she sees a light
          shining across the moor. Jane starts crawling.
                         
                         
          EXT. NIGHT. THE MOOR/MOOR HOUSE.
                         
          Jane is toiling on through the lashing rain towards the
          light. It has become a window. A brief flash of lightning
          shows her a low stone cottage. Helen Burns is sitting on
          the gate.

          Jane is crawling through the narrow garden. On her knees,
          she peers through a window.
                         
          On either side of a bright little fire sit two young women.
          They look exactly like Jane; slight, neat, dressed in
          black. One, Diana, has her hair slightly curled and hides
          her gentle eyes behind spectacles. The other, Mary, is very
          young; no more than seventeen. Each has a book on her knee.
          They are talking intimately.
                         
          They look so close, so loving and the room looks so cosy
          that it pains Jane considerably.

          She turns away, her hope gone. As she collapses, she finds

          Jane is lifted up. She finds herself looking into the face

          Rain hammers against the windows. Jane aged ten, looking
          hunted, runs in looking for somewhere to hide.
                         
          She springs behind a curtain. John Reed enters; a fourteen
          year old, his stomach bursting out of his fancy clothes. He
          is holding a riding crop as if it is a sword.

          Jane has her eyes closed. A great Atlantic wave hits the
          sash window behind her, drenching it with foam and brine.
          Suddenly the curtain is pulled back. John Reed stands in
          front of her. Jane shrinks back.

          Jane stares him out. John can sense her contempt. He belts
          her with the book. Jane hits her head on the window clasp,
          drawing blood. She is shocked.

          Jane snaps. She throws herself upon him, the rage in her
          released; pummelling, scratching, hurting him in any way
          she can. She is barely coherent.

          Dinah and Mary are gently taking Jane's soaking clothes

          The fight goes out of Jane. She sits, defeated. Bessie,
          young and plump, quickly wipes her bleeding forehead. She
          has some compassion. Miss Abbot has none.

          The door slams. They are gone. Jane slowly grips the edge
          of the stool. The room is chill, silent. Red walls and
          curtains, murky in the fading light.
                         
          In front of Jane, a stone fireplace gapes like a mouth.
          Beside it, a full length looking-glass in which her pale
          reflection stares out. Behind her, a bed supported on
          pillars of mahogany, hung with red.

          A sudden gust sends rain pelting against the windows like
          fingernails. A distant moan of wind seems to breathe out of
          the black hearth. Jane reverts her nervous gaze to the
          pitted mirror. Her eyes lock on the small figure trapped in
          the mirror's visionary hollow; her white, bleeding face,
          her eyes glittering with fear.
                         
          It is a phantom. The eyes are black, the skin a deathly
          grey. Blood. Jane's breathing becomes choked with terror.
          She can't get her breath. We hear blood rushing through her
          ears. It sounds like the beating of great wings.
                         
          Slowly, a light appears over her. It may be something
          shining in from outside. But to Jane it seems as if it is
          surrounding her, enveloping her. The figure in the looking
          glass opens its mouth. The scream, held in so long, finally
          rips from Jane's throat.

          Jane, aged ten, looks up. She is wearing a brown stuff
          frock with a puritanical cap like all the other girls.

          A red haired girl of about thirteen stands up; Helen Burns.
          Miss Scatcherd holds up an apron in which a hole has been
          mistakenly cut.

          given; a dozen sharp, stinging whacks with the birch twigs.
                         
          Jane is appalled. But to her astonishment and awe, Helen
          Burns doesn't cry; she barely changes her expression. As
          the strokes go on - seven, eight, nine - Helen seems like
          one in a trance. Jane is deeply affected.
                         
          On the eleventh stroke, the door bursts open and a visiting
          party walks in: the Brocklehurst family. Miss Temple
          escorts two young girls dressed in peacock finery and two
          smart, bombastic ladies. Mr Brocklehurst follows. Helen's
          punishment is forgotten as the students rush to their feet.
                         
          Jane, in a panic, drops her slate and breaks it.

          is the slightly bigger figure of Helen, hunched, the back
          of her dress still open, the skin on her neck raw. The sun
          is setting. At last Jane starts to sob.

          Jane's first home is like a doll's house. She walks through
          it from the whitewashed bedroom with its little single bed,
          through the parlour with its tiny fireplace into the
          scullery kitchen. She retraces her steps back into the
          parlour. She turns round and surveys it.

          voice warbles with pretended emotion. The effect is rather
          weird. Jane and Mrs Fairfax watch, open-mouthed.

          Adele's song continues as a voiceover. Mrs Fairfax is
          finishing a shawl. Jane is showing Adele pictures of little

          Jane holds a candle, the shawl around her; the moaning

          portrait of the voluptuous woman.
                         
          She stares at it curious, both as a girl and as an artist.
          She brings the candle close, to see how the brushwork has
          achieved the effect of flesh. She hears a low, knowing
          laugh in the darkness behind her. She is startled.

          the laugh again. She follows it through the darkness, alert
          with fear. A door clicks shut at the end of the corridor.

          A brook runs close to the path; half frozen. Its slow
          trickle is the only sound to be heard. Jane moves slowly,
          acutely aware of everything around her.
                         
          Further into the wood, the brook has frozen right across
          the path. Jane slips on it as she passes. The noise of her
          feet echoes. She steadies herself.
                         
          She gazes at a huddle of snowdrops, their heads bowed. A
          crystal drop of water runs to the end of a snowdrop and
          begins to freeze as she watches. It is held suspended as if
          the whole winter is contained in it.
                         
          The moon is mounting the sky. Jane hears a sound like the
          beating of wings. The blood is rushing through her ears.
                         
          Her trance is broken by the figure of a great dog - which
          glides past her so close it almost knocks her off her feet.
          The beating is loud; not wings she realises, but the rush
          of an approaching horse. It is almost on top of her before
          she can move. Her shocked, pale face, her black garments
          startle both horse and rider.

          to have his horse slip on the ice. Both man and horse fall
          with a crash. The dog begins to bark, until the hills echo
          with the sound. The horse is on one side; the man is lying,
          trapped beneath it on the ice; Edward Fairfax Rochester.

           her with her handsome, charmless

           mercenary, heartless, senseless.
           The whole intoxication fell away

          notices something else - a curling wreath of grey smoke.

           Fell asleep with his candle lit
           and the curtains got on fire.
           Managed to put it out with the

           It's hardly likely the master
           would laugh when he was in such
           danger. Perhaps you were dreaming.

           Why, he's gone away. Were you not

           I saw her two years ago when Mr
           Rochester had a party here. Oh,
           she was a beauty; I daresay the
           most elegant girl I've ever seen.
           So tall, with raven hair cascading
           down her back; I don't know how
           she'd had it done. She sang a duet
           with Mr Rochester. They made a
           lovely harmony.

          Jane finds herself in front of her class. They are looking
          at her expectantly. She looks back at them curiously. Eager
          faces, plain rural clothes. She has quite lost her place.

          Jane is tidying up at the end of the day. The classroom is
          empty. Her life is bare. It shows on her face. She looks

           We can overcome every kind of human
           weakness. A year ago I was myself
           intensely miserable. I considered
           my life was so wretched that it
           must be changed - or I would die.
           After a season of darkness and
           struggling, light broke. I heard my
           call from God. Put your trust in

           future.

           A year ago, I was weak enough to

          Jane moves involuntarily towards him.
                         
           ST JOHN (CONT'D)
           Don't pity me; I have no compassion
           whatsoever for you. I regarded this
           love as a fever of the flesh; not a
           thing that would ever touch my
           soul. I scorned the weakness,
           fought hard against it - and won.
                         
          Jane is incredulous. St John is at her desk. It is covered

           squandered my future upon it.

          her gaze; glances at her. Jane looks down, pulling her work
          on to her lap; a beaded purse. She does not lift her eyes
          from the beads, fully feeling the humiliation of her class -

          The figure by the door steps out of the shadows. It is
          Richard Mason. Rochester flies down the aisle, a groan of
          rage escapes him. He lifts his arm.

          A grim smile contorts Rochester's lips. He turns towards
          Jane. She remains where she was abandoned - at the altar -
          tiny, under he vaulted arch. The bouquet falls from her
          hand. Rochester walks to her.
                         
                          ROCHESTER
           This girl knew nothing. She
           thought all was fair and legal.
           She never dreamt she was going to
           be entrapped into a feigned union
           with a defrauded wretch.
                         
          A tiny breath is the only noise Jane utters. Rochester
          pulls her from the altar to his side.

          Rochester enters pulling Jane after him, her hand still in
          his iron grip. Wood, Mason and Briggs follow.
                         
          Mrs Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Martha and Leah are waiting.
          Adele runs forward. Rochester stops her in her tracks.

          Adele has crumpled into frightened tears. Mrs Fairfax has
          her hand over her mouth, pale with shock. Jane meets her
          eye as Rochester pulls her up the stairs. A revelation.

          The tapestried room. Rochester glances at Mason. He unlocks
          the inner door with one hand; the other won't let go of
          Jane. Grace Poole sits by a strongly guarded fire, stirring
          something in a pot.
                         
          Rochester leads Jane and the men into the room. There is no
          window, no furniture except for Grace's chair; only a
          mattress on the floor.

          Bertha Antoinetta Mason stands, amazed at the sight of her
          visitors. She wears a white shift. There are black rook
          feathers twined in her hair; her only ornament.

          Bertha's pose is dignified, her expression grows
          triumphant. She approaches Rochester - her eyes locked with
          Jane's. Jane gazes: fear, disgust, compassion.

          Bertha puts her arm through Rochester's; lays her head on

          With shocking speed and strength Bertha lays her nails into
          Rochester's cheek. He struggles with her.
                         
          Grace assists Rochester. They do not hit; they subdue.
          Bertha's attack is effectively contained. They have her on
          her knees, her arms behind her.
                         
          Bertha lifts her head and screams. If a scream could
          express the agony of a whole soul then this would. Jane
          turns on her heels. She stumbles, finds the door, exits.

           made. I hardly spoke with her. I

           those bound to the intemperate and
           unchaste. Her excesses developed
           germs of madness and the doctors
           shut her up. One night, unable to
           bear her screaming hate and knowing
           I could never be rid of her, I put
           a gun to my head to kill myself.

           to my senses. Bertha Antoinetta
           Mason had abused my long suffering,
           sullied my name, outraged my honour

           Twenty years ago, a poor curate
           fell in love with a rich man's
           daughter and married her. She was
           disowned by her family and two
           years later the rash pair were both
           dead. They left a daughter which
           charity received into her lap - as
           cold as that snow drift I almost
           stuck fast in. Charity carried the
           friendless thing to the house of
           its rich maternal relations. It was
           reared by an aunt-in-law; I come to
           names now - Mrs Reed of Gateshead.

           and at the end of that time she was
           sent to Lowood school.

           It seems her career there was very
           honourable. She became a teacher
           like yourself, and left it, like

           I can guess your feelings but hear
           me to the end. Of Mr Rochester's
           character I know nothing but he
           professed to offer honourable
           marriage to this young girl and at
           the very altar she discovered that
           he had a wife yet alive. His
           subsequent conduct is a matter of
           pure conjecture but when the
           governess was enquired after it was
           discovered that she had fled
           Thornfield Hall and no trace of her
           has since been found. Now isn't

          Jane closes the door. She puts her hand across her lips.
          The icy kiss has agonised her with the full force of her
          loneliness. She curls up in a ball, desperate.

          A glorious summer sunset. Jane is digging at a flower bed,
          putting all her passion into the task. She is flushed with
          exertion. St John watches.

                          ST JOHN
           Don't be afraid. You are diligent,
           faithful, docile, courageous,
           gentle and heroic. Cease to
           mistrust yourself. I trust you
           unreservedly. Let me give you time
           to think. But know this; in you, I
           recognise a fellow soul, a soul
           that would revel in the flame and
           excitement of sacrifice.
                         
          Jane is chilled to the bone by his words. St John leaves
          the garden and walks away over the moors.

          Jane carrying a candle, opens the door. St John is at the
          table working by lamp light. The moon shines brightly in.
                         
                          JANE
           I used to long for a life of
           action, to overleap the horizon, to
           move in the world of men. Maybe God
           is giving me this. And what is
           there for me here? Pain and longing
           for what can't be. I don't know how
           long I would survive in India. My
           frame isn't strong. But I'll go
           with you, if I may go free.

           Jane, I don't need a curate; I
           need a wife.
                         
                          JANE
           I must have my heart and mind
           free, my own self to turn to. I
           couldn't become part of you -
                         
                          ST JOHN
           A part of me you must become or the
           whole bargain is void. How can I, a
           man not yet thirty take out to
           India a girl of nineteen, unless
           she is my wife? Don't offer God
           half a sacrifice. He must have all.
           And undoubtedly enough of love
           would follow to make the union
           right, even in your eyes.

           Yes, quite enough.
                         
                          JANE
           St John, I scorn your idea of
           love. I scorn the counterfeit
           sentiment you offer and I scorn
           you when you offer it!
                         
          St John is mortified. A slow rage begins to boil in him.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           I've uttered nothing that
           deserves scorn.
                         
                          JANE
           Forgive me but the very name of
           love is an apple of discord
           between us. My dear cousin,
           please abandon your scheme of
           marriage.
                         
                          ST JOHN
           No; and if you reject it, it's
           not me you deny but God.
                         
          Jane is stung. St John has turned from her. His face is icy
          in the moonlight.
                         
                          JANE
           Do not be angry with me please.
           It makes me wretched. I want us

           If I were to marry you, you'd

                          JANE
           Because I would inevitably come to
           conceive love for you, because you
           are so talented and good, because
           there is such grandeur in your
           look. You wouldn't want this
           strange and torturing love; if I
           showed it you would find it
           unbecoming. And my lot would be
           wretched.

                          ST JOHN
           I wouldn't trample you. You'd

          round to the front. What she sees takes her breath away.
                         
          The great walls and battlements are blackened with fire.
          Windows gape on a hollow shell. The inside of the house has
          collapsed. Through the hanging door, only its charred
          remains can be seen. Weeds grow through utter devastation.

          Jane is walking through forest, along a grass grown track.
          Her pace is fast; her journey almost at an end. She comes
          to a pair of rusting iron gates hanging open between
          granite pillars. She walks through them.
                         
          She finds herself in front of a decrepit Elizabethan manor
          house; no garden, just a sweeping semi circle of meadow
          grass, which someone has cut at with a scythe. Jane stops.
                         
          Standing on the threshold is Edward Fairfax Rochester. He
          is in his shirtsleeves. He stands strong, stalwart,
          brooding. His hair is still raven black. He is looking
          sightlessly around his domain, with the concentration of a
          hawk. His strength is undiminished.
                         
          He walks fifteen paces from the house. It brings him into
          the middle of the semicircle of grass. He is close enough
          for Jane to see his scarred eyes. She walks towards him,
          silent.
                         
          A few drops of rain begin to fall. Rochester puts out his
          right hand to feel them. He raises his face up to the sky
          as if he is looking for something from there. He is
          absolutely still; his expression, serene.
                         
          Jane is very close. She steps on a twig. It breaks with a
          loud crack, shattering the silence. Rochester is
          immediately on guard, his expression turning wary.

          it passing an inch from her face. Jane steps back.
          Rochester swipes again. She holds her breath.
                         
          He seems satisfied at last that nothing is there. He turns
          and walks fifteen paces back to the house. He disappears

          tail, madly. Jane spills half the water. She cannot help
