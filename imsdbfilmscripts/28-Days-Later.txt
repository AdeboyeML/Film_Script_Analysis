          Images of stunning violence. Looped.
                         
          Soldiers in a foreign war shoot an unarmed civilian at point-
          blank range; a man is set on by a frenzied crowd wielding
          clubs and machetes; a woman is necklaced while her killers
          cheer and howl.

          A group of black-clad ALF Activists, all wearing balaclavas,

          cutters.

          The Chief Activist takes his camera off his shoulder and
          starts taking photos.
                         
          The room is huge and long, and darkened except for specific
          pools of light. Partially illuminated are rows of cages with
          clear perspex doors. They run down either side of the room.
          In the cages are chimpanzees.

          Most are in a state of rabid agitation, banging and clawing
          against the perspex, baring teeth through foam-flecked
          mouths.
                         
          They reach the far end of the lab, where on a huge steel
          operating table they see the dissected chimp.

          The dissected chimp's eyes flick to the Activists. Blood
          wells from around the exposed brain tissue.
                         
          Tears starts to roll down the Female Activist's cheeks.

          the edge of one of the doors - about to prise it open.
                         
          At the moment, the doors to the laboratory bang open.
                         
          The Activists all turn. Standing at the entrance is the
          Scientist.
                         
          A pause. The Scientist jumps to a telephone handset on the
          wall and shouts into the receiver.

          INT. COMA WARD - LATE AFTERNOON
                         
          The door to Jim's hospital room is locked. The key is on the
          floor. He picks it up and opens the door.
                         
          Jim exits into a corridor.
                         
          At the far end, a sign read: COMA WARD. There is no sign of
          life or movement.
                         
          Jim walks down the corridor. One of the doors is half-open.
          From inside, there is the sound of buzzing flies.
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL WARDS - LATE AFTERNOON
                         
          Jim moves as quickly as he can through the hospital, still
          weak, but now driven by adrenaline.
                         
          All the wards and corridors are deserted. Medical notes and
          equipment lie strewn over the floors, trolleys are upended,
          glass partition doors are smashed. In a couple of places,
          splashes of dried blood arc up the walls.
                         
          He reaches A&E. On one wall is a row of public pay phones.
                         
          He lifts a receiver, and the line is dead. He goes down the
          line, trying them all.
                         
          In the corner of the A&E reception is a smashed soft-drinks
          machine, with a few cans collected at the base.
                         
          Jim grabs one, rips off the ring-pull and downs it in one go.
          Then he grabs another, and heads for the main doors.

          Jim exits and walks out into the bright daylight of the
          forecourt. The camera begins to pull away from him.
                         
                          JIM
           Hello?
                         
          Aside from a quiet rush of wind, there is silence. No
          traffic, no engines, no movement. Not even birdsong.
                         
                         
          EXT. LONDON - SUNDOWN
                         
          Jim walks through the empty city, from St. Thomas's Hospital,
          over Westminster Bridge, past the Houses of Parliament, down
          Whitehall, to Trafalgar Square.
           8.
                         
                         
          A bright overhead sun bleaches the streets. A light drifts
          litter and refuse. Cars lie abandoned, shops looted.
                         
          Jim is still wearing his hospital pyjamas, and carries a
          plastic bag full of soft-drink cans.

          Jim walks. Night has fallen. He needs to find a place to
          rest...
                         
          He pauses. Down a narrow side street is a church. He walks
          towards it. The front doors are open.
                         
                         
          INT. CHURCH - NIGHT
                         
          Jim walks inside, moving with the respectful quietness that
          people adopt when entering a church.
                         
          The doors ahead to the main chamber are closed. Pushing them,
          gently trying the handle, it is obvious they are locked. But
          another open door is to his left. He goes through it.
                         
                         
          INT. CHURCH - STAIRWELL - NIGHT
                         
          Jim moves up a stairwell.
                         
          Written large on the wall is a single line of graffiti:
          REPENT. THE END IS EXTREMELY FUCKING NIGH
                         
                         
          INT. CHURCH - GALLERY LEVEL - NIGHT
                         
          Jim moves into the gallery level, and sees, through the dust
          and rot, ornate but faded splendor. At the far end, a stained-
          glass window is illuminated by the moonlight.
                         
          Jim pads in, stands at the gallery, facing the stained-glass
          window for a moment before looking down...
                         
          Beneath are hundreds of dead bodies. Layered over the floor,
          jammed into the pews, spilling over the altar. The scene of
          an unimaginable massacre.
                         
          Jim stands, stunned. Then sees, standing motionless at
          different positions facing away from him, four people.
                         
          Their postures and stillness make their status unclear. Jim
          hesitates before speaking.
           9.
                         
                         
                          JIM
           ...Hello?
                         
          Immediately, the four heads flick around. Infected.
                         
          And the next moment, there is the powerful thump of a door at
          the far end of the gallery.
                         
          Jim whirls to the source as the Infected below start to move.
                         
          The door thumps again - another stunningly powerful blow, the
          noise echoing around the chamber.
                         
          Confused, fist closing around his bag of soft drinks, Jim
          steps onto the gallery, facing the door...
                         
          ...and it smashes open.
                         
          Revealing an Infected Priest - who locks sight on Jim, and
          starts to sprint.
                         
                          JIM
           Father?
                         
          The Priest is half way across the gallery
                         
                          JIM
           Father, what are you...
                         
          And now the moonlight catches the Priest's face. Showing
          clearly: the eyes. The blood smeared and collected around his
          nose, ears, and mouth. Darkened and crusted, accumulated over
          days and weeks. Fresh blood glistening.
                         
                          JIM
           Jesus!
                         
          In a movement of pure instinct, Jim swings the bag just as
          the Priest is about to reach him - and connects squarely with
          the man's head.
                         
                          JIM
           Oh, that, was bad, that was bad...

          Jim sprints down the stone steps.
                         
          As he reaches the bottom the doors are broken open, and the
          Infected give chase.

          Jim runs - the Infected have almost reached him.
                         
          A hand fires up a Zippo lighter, and lights the rag of a
          Molotov cocktail.
                         
          As Jim runs, something flies past his head, and the Infected
          closest to him explodes in a ball of flame.
                         
          Jim turns, and sees as another Molotov cocktail explodes,
          engulfing two in the fireball.
                         
          He whirls, now completely bewildered.

          Another Molotov cocktail explodes. The Infected stagger from
          the blaze, on fire.

          ...Selena, a black woman, also in her twenties. She wears a
          small backpack, a machete is stuck into her belt - and she
          holds a lit Molotov cocktail in her hand.
                         
          ...Mark, a tall, good-looking man - throwing another bottle.
                         
          It smashes on the head of the last Infected, bathing it in
          flame...
                         
          The burning Infected bumps blindly into a car. Falls. Gets up
          again.

          windows are covered with a metal security grill, but the
          grill over the door lock has been prised away enough for
          Selena to slip her hand through to the latch.

          become instant anachronisms.
                         
          At the back of the shop, a makeshift bed of sheets and

          both go tumbling to the floor. At the same moment, the figure
          behind the kitchen window smashes the glass, and an Infected
          Teenage Girl starts to clamber through the jagged frame.
                         
          The Man gets on top of Jim, while Jim uses his arms to hold
          back the ferocious assault. A single strand of saliva flies
          from the Man's lips, and contacts Jim's cheek.

          Selena looks at Mark's body for a couple of beats, then
          lowers the blade. She picks up a dishcloth from the sink

          dried blood. The lift doors are jammed open, and inside is a
          dense bundle of rags - perhaps an old corpse, but impossible
          to tell, because the interior of the lift has been torched.

          down the building. Jim and Selena both make a grab for their
          weapons.

          The scream comes again. The noise is chilling, echoing up the
          empty stairwell.
                         
          But there is something strange about it. The noise is human,
          but oddly autistic. It is held for slightly too long, and
          stops abruptly.

          the Infected, giving chase, howling.

          an amazing burst of energy and speed.
                         
          They round another bend in the stairwell...
                         
          ...then both Jim and Selena scream. Standing directly in
          front of them is a Man In Riot Cop Gear - helmet with full
          visor, gloves, a riot shield in one hand, and a length of
          lead pipe in the other.
                         
          The Man lunges past both of them, barging past, where the
          Infected White Man has appeared at the stairwell.
                         
          The Riot Gear Man swings his lead pipe and connects viciously
          with the White Man's head. The White Man falls backwards
          against the Asian Man. Both fall back down the stairs.
                         
          The Riot Gear Man turns back to Jim and Selena.

          Jim and Selena are stunned, but start to run down the
          corridor.
                         
          The Asian Man is coming back up the stairs. Jim looks back
          over his shoulder in time to see the Riot Gear Man deliver a
          massive blow to the Asian Man's head.

          they approach, it suddenly slams shut.

          The door opens a fraction, on the chain. The face of a girl
          appears. She is fourteen, pale, solemn-faced.

          Jim looks back down the corridor.
                         
          At the far end, the Man appears. He is holding the limp body
          of one of the Infected - and he tips it over the balcony,
          where it drops down the middle of the stairwell.

          opens again.
                         
                         
          INT. FLAT - NIGHT
                         
          Jim and Selena enter past the pale-faced girl. The flat is
          council, three-bed, sixteenth floor of the block. It has
          patterned wallpaper, and nice but boring furnishings. It is
          lit by candles.
                         
          The entrance hall leads straight to the living room, which
          has French windows and a small balcony outside.
                         
          On one wall, a framed photograph hangs, which shows the Man
          standing beside a black taxi cab. Next to him is a middle
          aged woman - presumably the Man's wife. Hannah sits at the
          cab's steering wheel, beaming.
                         
          Another photo, beside, show Hannah sat in the seat of a go-
          kart.

          They follow the Man through to the living room, and Hannah
          recloses the front door, which has an impressive arrangement
          of locks and dead-bolts.
                         
                         
          INT. FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          In the living room, the fairy lights hang in the window,
          powered by a car battery. Lit by their glow, the Man goes
          through a careful ritual of shedding his gear, helped by
          Hannah.
                         
          First, he lays down the riot shield. Then he puts the
          bloodsmeared lead pipe on a small white towel. Next, he
          removes his gloves - and places them beside the bar on the
          towel. Then he folds the towel over the weapon and gloves,
          and puts it beside the riot shield. Finally he removes the
          visored helmet.
                         
          Jim and Selena watch him. They look pretty rattled, not
          really knowing what to expect.
                         
          After the Man has finished shedding his gear, he turns.

          He extends his hand to Jim and Selena. Jim hesitates very
          briefly, then shakes it.

          Frank beams, and suddenly he seems much less frightening and
          imposing. If anything, he is just as nervous as Jim and
          Selena.

          Another short, uncomfortable pause. Hannah looks at Jim and
          Selena from her position near the doorway. Her expression is
          blank and unreadable.

          London is spectacular - low clouds catching the sunrise, and
          a plume of smoke still drifting up from the petrol station

          Jim, Selena and Hannah sit in the back. Behind is the cab,
          driven by the Sergeant. A little way ahead of them, the

          From a cast-iron gated entrance, a gravel driveway leads up
          to the impressive country mansion, surrounded by a high
          perimeter wall. The grounds show acres of lawn and flower
          beds. These have obviously had many years of very careful
          cultivation and attention, but now are just starting to look
          unkempt and overgrown.
                         
          The jeep pulls up by the front steps. Waiting there is
          another soldier, a major. Like the other soldiers, he is
          unshaven, but has the authority of command about him, even in
          the relaxed way that he stands.

           before that, and before that, as

           81.
                         
                         
          Both men immediately set off, diving back into the foliage...
                         
          A beat passes. Then, in the pile of bodies, one of them sits
          up...
                         
          ...Jim. We have been looking right at him. But in the tangle
          of bodies, and the bloodstained clothes, his camouflage was
          complete.
                         
                         
          EXT. TREES - DAY - LIGHT RAIN
                         
          Mitchell and Jones move fast, scanning, pushing through the
          undergrowth. Mitchell is absolutely furious. And as they run,
          they startle a couple of birds, which fly up from the ground,
          making a suspiciously familiar noise...
                         
          They both have the same realization at the same moment.

          Mitchell and Jones burst back into the clearing, and they
          start firing into the bodies, emptying a full clip into the
          corpses...
                         
          ....Silence.
                         
          Then Jones looks up to the ivy-colored wall...following the
          path of the ivy upwards, to the coiled razor wire, where a
          scrap of torn and bloody clothing hangs.
                         
                          JONES

          Jim runs through the woods, away from the mansion. His hands
          are still tied.
                         
          He is out of breath, frightened, jumping at every sound.
                         
          Then he trips, rolls down a short slope, and when he comes to
          rest, he is looking upwards.
                         
          Above him, there is a parting in the clouds, and through the
          parting is blue sky.

          And across the sky, bisecting the blue, is a single vapor
          trail.
                         
          A pin-prick of silver plane. Followed by a sonic boom. As
          much in Jim's head as anywhere else.

          the other side.
                         
          Then, suddenly, Selena's voice: hard, desperate:

          Hannah and Selena are cornered by Clifton, Bedford, Bell and
          Davis. The soldiers are hyped. Bedford pulls clothes out of a
          wardrobe, yanking out dresses, underwear - throwing them at
          the girls.
                         
          Bell stands by the closed door - frightened, caught like a
          rabbit in the headlights between testosterone madness and the
          horror.
                         
          And Clifton is laughing, animal-like, tearing at Selena's
          clothes, while Hannah is kicking and screaming - held by
          Davis.
                         
          Close-up on Selena: suddenly transfixed by Hannah the young
          girl's fight, the hopelessness.
                         
          Abruptly, Selena turns, grabs Clifton's arm, and to his
          amazement, yanks him around.
                         
          Then she kisses him on the lips. Simply, but unambiguously.
                         
          Bell, Davis and Bedford watch in amazement.
                         
          Selena breaks off.
                         
          The frenzy has been broken by her extraordinary action - and
          bizarrely, so has the balance of power.

          A moment - maybe a single moment of tenderness, a strand of
          hair brushed from Hannah's face.

          Henry scream - and we see it's Mailer's face behind him.
                         
          Hannah floors the accelerator again, but this time in forward
          gear. Henry is sucked out of the back window.

          Selena bundles Jim in, and the cab is off in a spray of

          The cab races towards the cast-iron front gates of the
          mansion - and we see they are locked with a chain and
          padlock.

          They hit the gates, hard. Jim and Selena fly towards the

          Waking from a nightmare, Jim's eyes snap open with a sharp
          intake of breath.
                         
          An echo of when we first saw him lying in the hospital. But
          this time, when we pull away, we see he is lying on a double
          bed, in the bedroom of a small farmhouse.
                         
          Alone. But Selena's clothes are scattered.
                         
          Jim rises.
                         
          He looks around. Bright daylight is flooding into the room

          where he sees the sofa, with its cover removed.

          material on the grass.
                         
          From our ground-level angle, there is no sense to be made of

          A quiet moment with the starving emaciated Infected. It is so
          weak it can hardly move. Only blink.
                         
          Then, in the background, a distant rush of noise, the low
          roar of a jet engine.
                         
          Slowly, the Infected turns its head upwards, where, in the
          clear blue sky, it sees:
