          YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN -- about 2/3 men and 1/3 women, some
          with flak jackets; about half the young women wear full
          chador. Many wear plastic bibs with photographs of
          Ayatollah Khomeini.

          2 EXT. EMBASSY GROUNDS - MORNING 2

          From INSIDE THE EMBASSY GATES we can hear the noise of
          the protest. There are three primary buildings on
          campus: the CHANCERY, the embassy's main building, THE
          AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, and the CONSULATE.
          We can see that the compound is securitized: sand-filled
          traps and steel bars on the windows of the consulate.

          3 INT. U.S. EMBASSY - CONSULATE OFFICE - MORNING 3

          Now, we see the POV THROUGH those steel bars.
          Standing on a chair looking at the protest outside the
          gate, is BOB ANDERS, late 40s-50s, a consular officer.

          Then, in a famous piece of archive footage, something
          simple happens. A YOUNG MAN IN A SWEATER climbs the gate
          and makes it to the other side.
          And now, we see the REVERSE of that famous shot. This
          isn't archive footage anymore.
          We're looking at the POV of TOM AHERN, 48, the CIA

          A group of STUDENTS -- these more brisk, organized, all
          bearded and dressed in flak jackets -- push their way to
          the front of the protest --
          WOMEN raise a banner. It's a signal.
          As if on cue, the IRANIAN POLICE move from the gates. A
          WOMAN removes a large pair of bolt cutters from
          underneath her chador -- hands them to a BEARDED STUDENT

          nothing sleek or sexy about the interior. An open area
          of desks where Woodward and Bernstein might be spilling
          coffee on their thick 70s ties. Papers and files
          everywhere. Trash emptying happens only once a week.
          Cigarette and cigar butts in ashtrays. Everything is
          perpetually a mess. And typewriters. The constant
          percussive sound of telexes and typing is the metronome
          that beats out the day here.

          And suddenly it's dead-quiet. We're in a vault inside a
          vault in the basement of the main building.
          Mendez's suitcase is laying on a low counter, an ARCHIVES
          OFFICER t-tagging and cataloging various items.
          Separating Mendez's personal things from material related
          to the operation.
          Mendez empties his briefcase and the officer puts a
          sticker on the VARIETY featuring the ARGO ad. Another on
          the ARGO script. He's putting things into a box that
          reads: USCIA CLASSIFIED MATERIAL.
          Mendez opens his accordion folder -- flips through it --
          it's empty -- no. There's something inside.
          In one of the compartments is a STORYBOARD FROM ARGO.
          One that the Komiteh missed. While the Archives Officer
          is turned around, Mendez slips the storyboard back into
          the accordion folder and puts it back with his personal
          things.

           O'Donnell is on his way out, heading toward Tony who is
           heading in. Seeing Mendez, he stops dead.

           And I left my autograph book at 
           home. His Eminence called me. He 
          wants to see you.

          He wants to fire me himself.

          Clandestine Services of these

          Mendez stops walking. A beat.

                         MENDEZ
          If they push it a week, I can 
          bring Ian. That's his winter 
          break.

                         O'DONNELL
          The op was classified so the
          ceremony's classified. He can't
          know about it. Nobody can know
          about it.

                         MENDEZ
          They're gonna hand me an award,

          It's something in between romantic and fraternal. Not
          reconciliation, necessarily, but warmth. She
          reciprocates. It feels right, and good.
