          INT. MUSEUM - DAY
          
          A perfect rainbow is trapped inside two flawless DIAMONDS,
          glinting in the morning sun.
          
          Tounted on crushed velvet, the identical diamonds are on a glass
          covered pedal stool in the middle of a vast, marble MUSEUM HALL.
          
          The stunning beauty of the stones is matched only by the
          breathtaking beauty of the young woman who's admiring them. MARIE
          CLIFFORD's creamy seventeen year old skin is dappled in the
          cornucopia of colors emanating from the diamonds...
          
          She reaches out tentatively towards the glass case. Not to touch
          the diamonds, but to run her fingers over a picture that's mounted
          in the case below the priceless jewels. It's of a MOTHER cradling
          her BABY DAUGHTER...
          
                              MARIE
                    Today's the day, Mom...
          
                              CURATOR (O.S.)
                    You here again, Marie?
          
          Marie spins round, sees the bespectacled CURATOR, 60's, standing
          behind her.
          
                              MARIE
                    Just leaving.
          
          Marie carefully adjusts the sign atop the glass case...
          
          'THE MOTHER DAUGHTER DIAMONDS...'
          
          EXT. MUSEUM - DAY
          
          Marie fires up her powerful BMW, parked right outside the austere
          Museum building. The powerful stereo blasts, sending the birds
          fluttering skywards...
          
          CREDITS appear over...
          
          ARIEL FOOTAGE of a narrow highway, Marie's BMW streaking through
          the endless tract of Florida wetlands. In the water, GATORS, warm
          themselves in the early morning sun...
          
           MOVING over the vast tracts of swampland, flocks of tropical BIRDS
          stretch their majestic wings, locals speed across the stagnant
          waters in their deafening AIRBOATS...
          
           Through thick trees and foliage to trailer homes and tract housing
          and into the town of Blue Bay, where the nip/tucked denizens sip
          three martini lunches and tee off at the local country club.
          
                                                             03/22/2004   2.
          
          
          
          Marie steers her BMW into the showroom-like parking lot of Blue
          Bay High School.
          
          INT. MARIE'S BMW - MORNING
          
          Marie guides her powerful car towards her parking spot, when...
          
          SCCCREEEECCCHHHH!
          
          She SLAMS on the brakes as a figure darts in front of her car.
          Almost gives her a heart attack, throwing her forward, flailing
          arms crashing into the stereo, then snapped back by her seatbelt.
          
          She sits stock still for a second, then looks up, out of her
          windshield at the young woman scouring at her, only inches from
          the front bumper of the BMW.
          
          The sudden jolt has changed the radio station. A newscaster
          rambles on...
          
                              RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                    ... operation, aimed at finally capturing
                    the Black Widow suspect after a six month
                    trail of embezzlement and fraud, once
                    again failed to snare its subject.
          
          ELENA SANDOVAL, 17, stands defiantly in front of the BMW, her
          don't-fuck-with-me stare in direct contrast with her come-fuck-me
          clothes.
          
                                 RADIO NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                    Blue Bay Police Detective Michael
                    Morrison was able to recover over
                    $400,000 in stolen money, but the
                    suspect, described as Female, between
                    eighteen and thirty, remains at large...
          
          Marie reaches out with a trembling hand, turns off the stereo,
          then leans out of the car window.
          
                              MARIE
                    I'm... so... sorry...
          
          Elena smiles wryly.
          
                              ELENA
                    You will be.
          
          And she means it...
          
                                                          03/22/2004   3.
          
          
          
          INT. BLUE BAY HIGH AUDITORIUM - MORNING
          
          The auditorium is packed with the Blue Bay High student body. The
          natural order is clear, the pastel flock at the front, the meat
          headed jocks in the center, and the rejects at the back.
          
          Marie is amongst her sweater monkey friends, but she's still
          shocked by what happened out in the parking lot...
          
                              JENNY
                        (handing over a present)
                    Happy birthday, babe. They ain't
                    diamonds, but you're just gonna have to
                    wait for those...
          
          Marie tentatively opens the gift, sees a pair of OPAL EARRINGS.
          
                              MARIE
                        (unconvincing)
                    Thank you. Thank you so much...
          
                              JENNY
                    Are you OK, hon?
          
          Marie looks back, to the far reaches of the auditorium where the
          freaks and geeks crowd round Elena, worshipping her like the
          Goddess she is...
          
                              MARIE
                    I...yeah...I'll be fine...It's
                    just...that new girl...I almost hit her
                    in the parking lot...
          
                              JENNY
                    You mean the towel girl, the one who
                    transferred in? Jesus, she's trouble. You
                    know the only reason she's slinging
                    towels is 'cos it's court ordered...
          
          Marie and Elena make brief, electric eye contact, across the sea
          of hormonally challenged students as Principal LIONEL MOSSTER, his
          ill-fitting sports jacket coffee-stained, steps onstage.
          
                              MOSSTER
                    We're here today to address a growing
                    epidemic that affects all of you.
          
          He pauses, waits for the student body to quiet down...
          
                              MOSSTER
                    National studies report sexual activity
                    among students at an all-time high.
          
                                                          03/22/2004   4.
          
          
          
          The students all cheer, naturally.
          
                              MOSSTER
                    We'll see who's cheering when you've got
                    an unwanted pregnancy on your hands, or
                    get slapped with a paternity suit...Or
                    arrested for date rape. But don't take my
                    word for it...
          
          He motions behind him to KRISTEN RICHARDS, early 30's, a natural
          beauty who's doing her best to hide behind a bland gray suit and
          glasses, and CHAD BORMAN, late 20s, devilishly handsome...
          
                              PRINCIPAL MOSSTER
                    Miss Richards and Dr. Borman are here to
                    tell you about the pitfalls first hand...
          
          Kristen steps up to the lectern.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Good morning, my name is Kristen
                    Richards. I'm an officer for the Miami
                    juvenile parole board, as some of you
                    already know...
          
          Quick glance at Elena who rolls her eyes...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    But that's not what brings me here today.
                    When I heard about Principal Mosster's
                    sex education program I thought I'd
                    volunteer my own personal story, in hopes
                    that you might learn from the mistakes I
                    made. Back in High school all I wanted to
                    do was get drunk, stoned and laid...
          
          The students roar their approval.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    By my junior year, my life was a blur of
                    cheap beer, anonymous sex, partying every
                    night of the week...
          
          Elena covers her mouth, as if to cough...
          
                              ELENA
                        (through fake coughs)
                    ...whore...
          
          Kristen ignores the slur.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   5.
          
          
          
                              KRISTEN
                    And then, one night at some pathetic frat
                    party, someone slipped a roofie in my
                    drink...and raped me.
          
          This quiets the auditorium.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    There isn't a day goes by my skin doesn't
                    crawl when I think of the violation and
                    humiliation I endured. I can promise you
                    that if you make the same kind of wrong-
                    headed choices I did, you'll be seeing
                    Dr. Borman...
          
          Chad steps to the podium.
          
                              CHAD
                    Thank you, Miss Richards. My name's Dr.
                    Chad Borman. I run the forensics lab at
                    the police department, where my work has
                    helped convict hundreds of sex offenders.
                    Most teens like Ms. Richards never get
                    their lives together. The physical scars
                    may go away, but the emotional damage
                    stays forever.
          
          While Chad drones on, MUDDY, a Gremlin-eyed drooler, sitting in
          front of Elena, looks back at her shapely legs as she puts them up
          on the back of the chair. He spots the ugly plastic bracelet
          locked around one of her ankles.
          
                              MUDDY
                    That's not...what I think it is, is it?
          
                              ELENA
                    Whattchya think it is, bitch?
          
          The words catch in his throat.
          
                              MUDDY
                    One of them...Parole leashes...
          
                              ELENA
                    Bingo.
          
                              MUDDY
                    So you can't, like, go more than ten
                    miles from the cop shop?
          
          Elena taps the flashing red light on the plastic bracelet.
          
                                                             03/22/2004   6.
          
          
          
                              ELENA
                    Five. I got someone's panties in a bunch.
          
          Back at the podium, Chad leans forward, making sure his words
          resonate with the student body.
          
                              CHAD
                    And as for the perpetrators of this
                    heinous act, even if you are still a
                    minor, you will be tried as an adult,
                    and, if convicted, you will do hard time.
          
          He pauses to let the impact of this wash over the students.
          
                              CHAD
                    Are there any questions?
          
                              ELENA
                        (calling out)
                    Yeah, I got one for Miss Richards.
          
                                KRISTEN
                    Ask away.
          
                              ELENA
                    When they found the scumbag who took your
                    precious flower of virginity, you sued
                    his sorry ass, right?
          
          Kristen is taken aback by Elena's insensitivity, stumbles over her
          words, finally spitting out the sad, sorry truth...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Uh, no, actually, I was never able to
                    make a positive ID. All I remember was
                    his alcohol-soaked breath whispering in
                    my ear, "You won't remember, but you'll
                    never forget..."
          
          Elena cracks a sideways grin...
          
                              ELENA
                    So what you're really saying is you
                    fucked for free...
          
          Kristen has no answer to that. Principal Mosster does his best to
          control the situation...
          
                              PRINCIPAL MOSSTER
                    Miss Sandoval. You're on thin ice, young
                    lady!
          
          Like Elena cares.   She leans back, nods. Job done.
          
                                                                        7.
          
          
          
          EXT. BLUE BAY HIGH DIVING POOL - DAY
          
          The bright Florida sunshine washes down on packed bleachers by the
          side of the massive diving pool, where a diving meet is in full
          swing...
          
                              ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    Blue Bay High School would like to
                    welcome all participating diving teams
                    from the tri-county region...
          
          Breathtaking beauties from teams all over the region, in their
          school colored bikinis, are scattered around the pool area.
          
          But all eyes are on the home team. Masturbatory fantasies abound
          as the Blue Bay Girls' Diving Team runs through stretches...
          
          And as exquisite as these girls are, they pale in comparison to
          absolutely sweet Marie, stunning in her nearly see-through white
          bathing suit.
          
                              ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    First up, district champion Marie
                    Clifford...
          
          The crowd cheers, watching Marie edge out to the diving platform
          twenty feet above. Jenny right behind, waits on the ladder...
          
          JAY CLIFFORD, Marie's chisel-jawed stepfather in his late
          thirties, focuses a DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA on Marie from the front
          row of the bleachers...
          
                              JAY
                    C'mon now baby, you can do it...
          
          Marie just rolls her eyes.
          
                              JENNY
                    Your stepfather's just got a lot invested
                    in the team.
          
          Marie looks at her stepfather, nods tentatively, but then notices
          the incongruous figure of Elena, sidling up to him...
          
                              JAY
                        (to Marie)
                    Just try to keep those legs together.
          
                              ELENA (O.S.)
                    Shouldn't be a problem for Miss teen
                    Virgin.
          
          
          
                                                           03/22/2004   8.
          
          
          
          Jay looks round, lowers the camera when he comes face to face with
          the world's hottest towel girl...
          
                                 JAY
                    Excuse me?
          
                              ELENA
                    You're Mr. Clifford, right? As in
                    Clifford construction?
          
                              JAY
                    I am, yes, but...
          
                              ELENA
                    I'd love to see one of your erections...
          
          Whoa. Jay's lost for words as he diverts his attention to the
          platform where Marie stands perfectly still before stepping into
          the air.
          
          It's a spectacular sight as the beautiful Marie completes a double
          back flip, entering the water with near-perfect form. She quickly
          resurfaces, climbs out of the pool and exchanges high fives with
          her teammates before crossing to Jay.
          
                               JAY
                    Nice take off, gotta work on the
                    landing...
          
                              MARIE
                    I can't do any better...
          
          Jay shakes a finger at her, silences her immediately.
          
                              JAY
                    No such word as 'can't. Now do it again.
                    Only better...
          
          Marie takes a deep breath, approaches the ladder once more. As
          she's about to start the arduous climb, Elena hands her a towel...
          
                              ELENA
                    Bet you choke.
          
          Stops Marie in her tracks.
          
                              MARIE
                    What's your major malfunction?
          
                              ELENA
                    Just wanted to make a wager. Between best
                    friends.
          
                                                                        9.
          
          
          
          Marie just starts to climb the ladder to the high dive platform.
          
                              ELENA
                    You blow this dive, I get those diamonds
                    of yours.
          
          Marie stops, looks down on Elena from the fifth rung of the
          ladder, shakes her head...
          
                              MARIE
                    How'd you know about my inheritance?
          
                              ELENA
                    Talk of the town, birthday girl. Today's
                    the day, right?
          
                              MARIE
                    And what, pray tell, are you willing to
                    wager when I win?
          
          Elena thinks for a second, glances back at Jay with a big smile.
          
                              ELENA
                    I'll stay away from your stepfather. You
                    make it, I won't be your new stepmom
                    anytime soon. Whattya say?
          
          Marie just stands there incredulous for a moment.
          
                              MARIE
                    Take your sorry ass back to the swamps.
          
          She ascends the ladder, leaving Elena behind...
          
                              ELENA
                    Choke!
          
          Marie clambers up onto the high dive platform, tries to focus on
          the task at hand. But can't help but notice her nemesis below,
          walking slowly, seductively, up to Jay, intoxicating him...
          
          Marie blocks out the distraction, concentrates at the task at
          hand, stepping to the edge of the platform and the 20 foot drop
          looming beyond...
          
          She slides a ring off her finger, kisses it for luck. It's an odd
          design. Four curved gold ridges, just ready to hold a Diamond...
          
          She throws the ring into the pool ahead of her, the gold glinting
          in the afternoon sunlight as it drops into the water, and a split
          second before it breaks the surface, Marie is airborne...
          
          
          
                                                         03/22/2004   10.
          
          
          
          She twists magnificently through the air, a sight of breathtaking
          beauty. Thank God this is in slow motion.
          
          And as she gets ever closer to the water's surface, she tucks,
          does one last back flip, straightening out at the last possible
          instant, slicing through the water with nary a splash.
          
          Marie surfaces to roaring APPLAUSE. Treading water, she can't help
          but watch her Jay's smiling face in the bleachers...
          
          EXT. CLIFFORD MANSION - AFTERNOON
          
          Sickeningly expensive POWERBOATS and de-rigged SCHOONERS line the
          inlet leading to the verdant lawns of the Clifford Mansion...
          
          Banners and streamers wishing Marie a happy birthday decorate the
          grounds. Partygoers soak in the blazing Florida sun, sip at non-
          alcoholic punch, and stare out gratefully across the thin stretch
          of water that separates them from the riff-raff on the mainland...
          
          Marie sits away from it all, lost in thought, as Jenny, in cutoffs
          and a bikini top, sidles up beside her.
                               J
                               ENNY
                    What's the matter, sweetie, pissed that
                    one judge only gave you a 9.7?
          
          Marie forces a smile.
          
                              MARIE
                    Nah. I'm cool.
          
                              JENNY
                    Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, babe.
                    You got diamonds on the mind.
          
                              JAY (O.S.)
                    Have either of you seen my video camera?
          
          Marie looks round to her stepfather, shakes her head, bringing a
          bemused look to Jay's face.
          
                              JAY
                    I had it at the dive meet, I'm sure...
          
          He shrugs, picks up a crystal glass, hits a fork sharply against
          it, drawing the attention of the assembled partygoers...
          
                              JAY
                    Ladies, Gentlemen, friends, raise a glass
                    to Marie, on her eighteenth birthday.
          
          Everyone raises their fine crystal.
          
          H

                              JAY
                    She's become every inch of the woman her
                    Mother hoped she'd be. Wherever she is
                    now, Julie's looking down and smiling.
          
          Tears well in Marie's eyes...
          
                              JAY
                    And that's why, on your eighteenth
                    birthday, Marie, I know your mother
                    wanted you to have...
          
          He notices, out of the corner of his eyes, two well-dressed MEN
          standing at the entrance to his house. Whoever they are, Jay's
          instantly unnerved. He stumbles over his words...
          
                              JAY
                    ... she wanted you to have... a wonderful
                    birthday party surrounded by all your
                    friends.
          
           e glances back toward the house, watching the two men enter...
          
                              JAY
                    Please excuse me.
          
          ... and hurries after them.   Marie is left dumbfounded. So close,
          but so far...
          
                              MARIE
                    Jay! What about my present?
          
          She chases after him...
          
          INT. CLIFFORD MANSION HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Marie makes her way down the sleek white corridors inside the
          opulent Clifford Mansion, past framed family photos, of Jay, Marie
          and the late Julie...
          
                              MARIE
                    Jay?
          H
           e's nowhere to be found. Frustrated, Marie finds herself alone in
          the kitchen. She angrily selects a bottle of Champagne, pops the
          cork. Before she can swig any alcohol she hears raised voices.
          
                              JAY (O.S.)
                    It simply can't be done...
          
          Marie tentatively edges out of the kitchen, back into the hallway,
          and down towards Jay's study...
          
                                                                       12.
          
          
          
                              JAY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    In all construction there's delays.
          
          Marie sidles up to the door jam, peaks through the crack. What she
          sees makes the blood run cold in her veins...
          
          An imposing Cuban businessman, MR. BARAJAS, stands threateningly
          over a visibly frightened Jay. Another man, CICATRIZ, dressed in
          designer silks, stands menacingly in the corner, clearly the brawn
          of this little operation.
          
                              MR. BARAJAS
                    Four months is not a delay. It's a
                    disaster.
          
                              JAY
                    You have my word, Mr. Barajas, the
                    building is almost finished. Just give me
                    a week, two tops.
          
          Barajas nods to Cicatriz, who moves in on Jay with lightning
          quickness, holds a Razor sharp KNIFE against his thumb.
          
                              MR. BARAJAS
                    We are long past the negotiation stage.
          
          Cicatriz runs the steel blade across Jay's thumb. Marie has to
          cover her mouth from screaming as she sees a trickle of blood
          stain the spotless white carpet.
          
                              MR. BARAJAS (CONT'D)
                    For every day the building goes
                    unfinished, we'll take a finger...
          
          A sinister grin stretches across Cicatriz's lips.
          
                              CICATRIZ
                    Pray, Mr. Clifford, you finish before the
                    eleventh day...
          
          And with that the Cuban men head to the door. Marie scrambles
          away, her heart pounding...
          
          She's halfway down the hallway when Mr. Barajas and Cicatriz exit
          Jay's study. She turns, tries to look innocent as the Cuban
          'businessmen' stare her down.
          J
           ay appears in the doorway, sweat cascading from his brow.
          
                              JAY
                    Marie! Shouldn't you be with your
                    friends?
          
          A
          
          
          
          
                                                         03/22/2004   13.
          
          
          
                              MARIE
                    I was just...
          
          Cicatriz takes a step towards her.
          
                              JAY
                        (to Marie)
                    I'll be right there. With your gift...
                    just... wait outside, OK?
          
          Marie backs away, never taking her eyes off the intimidating Cuban
          men...
          
          EXT. CLIFFORD MANSION - AFTERNOON
          
          Marie stumbles down the lawns, past the semi-clad partygoers, in a
          daze, as she takes hits from the bottle of champagne.
          
          Jenny and the dive team wait by the dock, and welcome their lost
          sheep with open arms.
          
                              JENNY
                    So? Did you get the key? Are you Blue
                    Bay's richest bitch?
          
          Marie's thoughts are drowned out by the ROAR of a powerful engine.
          All attention turns to a rusted MOTORCYCLE as it streaks across
          the verdant lawns, leaving a spray of MUD in its wake.
          
           nd atop the bike... Elena, in skintight leathers.
          
                              JENNY
                    Holy shit, who invited her?
          
          Marie's slightly drunken eyes narrow. Elena brings the bike to a
          screeching halt inches from the surprised guests. The ultimate
          partycrasher...
          
                              MARIE
                    This is a private party...
          
                              ELENA
                    Don't mind me. I ain't here for your
                    stupid party.
          
          She's striding towards the Mansion, towards Jay who's standing at
          the patio doors, an exquisitely wrapped present in his hands.
          
                              MARIE
                    Get the hell outta here! NOW!
          
          Marie stumbles after Elena, grabbing her from behind, holding her
          back. There's a tense moment before...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   14.
          
          
          
                              ELENA
                    Damn girl, whattcha been drinking?
          
                              MARIE
                    Stay away from my stepfather!
          
                                 ELENA
                    Make me...
          
          And that's it. Marie lashes out with a haymaker punch. Connects on
          Elena's jaw and she goes reeling back. But it's ignited the street
          fighter in her, and she comes roaring back into the fray, ramming
          into Marie and together they tumble to the ground...
          T
           he crowds gather to watch the cat-fight, in equal parts appalled
          and aroused. It's a hair pulling, teeth gnashing, make up smearing
          wrestling match, no holds barred. The drunken Marie has the upper
          hand, the alcohol fueling her rage.
          
                              JAY (O.S.)
                    What the hell's going on here?
          
          And that stops the fight right there and then. Marie looks up to
          see a red faced Jay standing over her.
          
                              MARIE
                    This...trash is just looking for a meal
                    ticket...
          
          Elena gets to her feet, licks the blood from her split lip.
          
                              ELENA
                    Mr. Clifford. Betcha proud of little
                    Marie now, huh?
          
          He hauls Marie to her feet, thrusts her towards the mansion.
          
                              JAY
                    Party's over.
          
          Groans from the crowd, but Jay's mind is made up.
          
                              MARIE
                    But...what about...my present...
          
          Jay's already walking away.
          
                              JAY
                    I'm going to the condos. Sleep it off,
                    whydontcha?
          
          Elena watches Jay stride away, like a lioness stalking her prey...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   15.
          
          
          
          EXT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING SITE - NIGHT
          
          Work lights illuminate the half finished condo building site, on
          prime beachfront real estate. These places would sell for
          millions, if they were ever finished...
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING OFFICE - NIGHT
          
          In a concrete makeshift office, on the top floor of the condo
          building, Jay clicks open the lock on his large metal safe and the
          steel door swings open.
          
          Inside are stacks of CASH, piled high, along with a shiny new
          HANDGUN. Jay flicks through the money, shaking his head...
          
                              JAY
                        (sotto)
                    Not enough. Just not enough...
          
          A clanking noise from outside has him quickly snatching the gun
          from the safe, before closing it once more, spinning the lock...
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
          
          Jay walks out of his office, into the half-finished top floor of
          the condos. Exposed beams and drying cement reveal how far behind
          schedule Jay really is...
                               J
                               AY
                    Hello? Anyone there?
          
          He swings the gun round impotently, seeing nothing in the
          flickering florescent light...
          
          Finally Jay lowers the weapon. It looks like he might collapse,
          until he catches himself, palms flat against the wall, head down.
          
                                 JAY (CONT'D)
                    Fuck me...
          
                              ELENA (O.S.)
                    Any time. Any place...
          
          He reels around, sees Elena moving toward him, brushing aside the
          thick plastic sheeting. She has a bottle of beer in one hand, a
          video camera in the other. Jay's video camera to be precise...
          
                              JAY
                    What are you doing here?
          
                              ELENA
                    You promised to show me your erection...
          
                                                          03/22/2004   16.
          
          
          
          Elena focuses the video camera on Jay's crotch. Makes him
          incredibly uncomfortable, obviously.
          
                              JAY
                    Is that my...camera?
          
          Elena thrusts the bottle of beer at Jay.
          
                              ELENA
                    Lighten up, Jay.
          
          Jay takes the bottle from her, sets it down on the concrete floor.
          
                              JAY
                    Enough's enough. I think it's time you
                    left.
          
          This brings a teasing pout to Elena's lips.
          
                              ELENA
                    Is that any way to treat Marie's new best
                    friend?
          
          Jay's taken aback.
          
                              JAY
                    You're best friends are you?
          
                              ELENA
                    Sure. We've been having sleepovers.
                    Talking about boys, swapping tips. She's
                    been teaching me about shopping, I've
                    been teaching her about giving mind
                    blowing head...
          
          Jay's taken aback once more. How much more aback can he be taken?
          He reaches out and blocks the video camera lens.
          
                              JAY
                    Gimme the camera back...
          
          Elena saunters slowly past, brushing up against him. Keeps the
          camera trained on his worried face...
          
                              ELENA
                    Come get it.
          
          Jay's reaching his elastic limit. He reaches for the camera, but
          Elena won't let go. They wrestle for control of the video camera.
          And finally the camera slips from both their grasps, flies across
          the room and SHATTERS on the concrete floor...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   17.
          
          
          
                              ELENA
                        (slyly)
                    Ooopppps.
          
          Elena runs her finger under Jay's chin, then turns and walks away,
          leaving Jay standing there, all taken aback.
          
          EXT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING    - NIGHT
          
          A drunken Marie brings her BMW to a swerving halt outside the
          construction site. She takes a swig from the Champagne bottle on
          the passenger seat for dutch courage...
          
                              MARIE
                        (sotto)
                    It's present time.
          
          She reaches for the car door handle, but comes up short. When she
          looks back up she's in for some taking aback of her own...
          
          Elena comes walking out of the building site, and the two girls
          lock eyes. There's an uncomfortable moment before Elena flashes a
          satisfied smile and walks away...
          
                              MARIE
                    What the hell...
          
          Marie's about to get out of her car when Jay comes walking out of
          the site, looks around the lot, sees Marie's car.
          
                              JAY
                    What are you doing here at this time of
                    night?
          
          Marie stammers to find the words...
          
                              MARIE
                    I just...wanted to apologize for my
                    behavior earlier. I was out of line.
          
          Jay's mood lightens.
          
                              JAY
                    When we admit our mistakes we grow.
                    You've made an important step.
          
                              MARIE
                    So...what about my present?
          
                              JAY
                    Meet me at the Museum. Before school
                    tomorrow. Now go home, get some sleep,
                    I'm gonna finish up here...
          
                                                          03/22/2004    18.
          
          
          
          He walks away and a smile creeps across Marie's face.
          
                                                      FADE TO BLACK:
          
          INT. MUSEUM - MORNING
          
          A perfect rainbow is trapped inside the two flawless Mother
          Daughter DIAMONDS, glinting in the morning sun.
          
          Marie can barely contain her excitement as she paces frantically
          in the dark marble museum hall, reaching out a trembling hand
          towards the glass case containing the priceless jewels...
          
                              JAY (O.S.)
                    You really think you're ready for your
                    inheritance?
          
          Marie looks round to see Jay striding into the Museum, still in
          the same clothes as yesterday...
          
                              MARIE
                    It was...it was what Mom wanted...
          
          Jay looks at her sternly.
          
                              JAY
                    You're the only one who can open that
                    lock, but I'm the one with the key. She
                    wanted you to have the diamonds when you
                    were responsible enough to know what to
                    do with them...
                              M
                              MARIE
                    I'm...responsible...
          
          Jay shakes his head slowly, deliberately.
          
                              JAY
                    Really? Underage drinking, prying into my
                    personal affairs, fighting...
          
                              MARIE
                    But they're mine. Mom left them to me.
          
                              JAY
                    They're yours when I say they're yours.
                    For the time being, I've got some major
                    problems at the construction site.
                    Deadlines have to be met. We'll talk
                    again when you've done some growing up.
          
          Jay puts an arm around his stepdaughter, starts walking her back
          towards the massive wooden doors.
          
                              M
          
          
          
          
                                                         03/22/2004    19.
          
          
          
                              JAY
                    Please, don't fight me on this.   We're
                    Team Clifford, remember?
          
                              MARIE
                        (without conviction)
                    Team Clifford...
          
          She's stuck in an awkward embrace with her Step Father...
          
          EXT. MUSEUM - MORNING
          
          Jay leads Marie down the stone steps outside the quaint Museum
          building. But as they approach his car they're hit by...BLUE and
          RED FLASHING LIGHTS.
          
          The whine of sirens has Jay spinning around in surprise, looking
          over to see four Police Cruisers come to a screeching halt...
          
                              MARIE
                    What the hell?
          
          Half a dozen of Blue Bay's finest, lead by the dashing young
          OFFICER ENTWISTLE, draw their badges, approach Jay.
          
                              OFFICER ENTWISTLE
                    Mr. Clifford?
          
                              JAY
                    Can I help you, Officer?
          
                              OFFICER ENTWISTLE
                    You're under arrest on suspicion of rape.
          
          Jay's jaw drops to the ground.
          
                              JAY
                    There must be some mistake, this isn't
                    possible...
          
                              MARIE
                    Jay, what's going on?
          
          Entwistle puts a powerful hand on Jay, leads him to the first
          Police cruiser.      J
                               AY
                    Call my lawyer, tell him to meet me down
                    the station. This is outrageous...
          
          Entwistle gets into the Police car's passenger seat.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   20.
          
          
          
                              JAY
                    I didn't do anything, I swear.
          
                              OFFICER ENTWISTLE
                    I'm afraid she's got a different story.
          
                              JAY
                    Who's 'she'?
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
          
          Elena paces the sterile interview room like a caged tiger. She
          stops in front of the two way mirror, examines her reflection...
          
          Tentatively she reaches out a trembling finger touching the scab
          on her lip, covering the wound Marie inflicted at the party. And
          slowly Elena starts to press on the cut, until the blood starts to
          flow once more...
          
          There's a quiet knock on the door and Elena quickly lowers her
          hand, looks round...
          
          Kristen Richards, the young Parole Officer who so heart
          wrenchingly told her story at Blue Bay High earlier, comes quietly
          into the gray room.
          
                               KRISTEN
                    Elena.
          
          Elena just looks up at her pitifully.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Could you tell me what happened?
          
          Through stifled sobs, Elena states...
          
                              ELENA
                    It was Jay Clifford. He raped me...
          
          The interview room door swings open and DETECTIVE MICHAEL
          MORRISON, 30's, enters. He's the personification of the term
          "overworked, underpaid."
          
                              MORRISON
                    You understand the seriousness of this
                    allegation, young lady?
          
          Elena nods weakly.
          
                              MORRISON
                    And you know that we'll leave no stone un-
                    turned in the investigation.
          
                                                                       21.
                              MORRISON(CONT'D)
                    There'll be a battery of forensics tests
                    you'll have to take, humiliating stuff.
                    And background checks, digging up all
                    kinds of dirt. And you'll have to testify
                    in court, face the man you're accusing...
          
          Crocodile tears roll down Elena's cheeks.
          
                              MORRISON
                    You sure you want to go through with
                    this? No harm, no foul, you can just walk
                    away right now....
          
          Kristen interjects...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Please, Detective, this isn't the right
                    time...
          
                              ELENA
                    I ain't lying. You think I'm lying?
          
          Kristen turns to her young ward...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    If you're telling the truth, you won't
                    find a more sympathetic ear...
          
                              ELENA
                    'If' I'm telling the truth...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    And if you're not, there's gonna be
                    trouble, you understand?
          
                              MORRISON
                    This is already trouble. The man you're
                    accusing happens to be a friend of mine,
                    and when the DNA tests prove you're lying
                    I'm gonna come down on you like a ton of
                    bricks, mark my words...
          
          Elena withers under his glare...
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
          
          Jay huddles in the small interview room along with Marie and THEO
          BLOOM, his sharp suited attorney.
          
                              THEO
                    We're gonna sue their asses til time runs

                              JAY
                        (to Marie)
                    You've gotta believe me, I would never,
                    could never do anything like this, you
                    know that don't you?
          
          Marie takes his hand, squeezes it.
          
                              MARIE
                    We're team Clifford.
          
          Jay forces a tired smile...
          
                              JAY
                    That's my girl.
          
          The door swings open and Morrison enters...
          
                              MORRISON
                    Jay. Marie. Mr. Bloom...
          
          Jay stands, shakes Morrison's hand.
          
                              MORRISON
                        (to Marie)
                    Would you mind waiting outside while me
                    and your stepdad have a little chat...
          
          Marie looks to Jay, doesn't want to leave.
          
                              JAY
                    It's OK honey. Michael and I are old
                    pals...
          
          Reluctantly she leaves, letting the door swing closed after her.
          Jay sits back down. Morrison takes a chair opposite.
          
                              JAY
                    How's the divorce treating you?
          
                              MORRISON
                    She's taken me for everything I'm worth.
                    I swear to God, I'm never trusting
                    another woman as long as I live.

                    This is most egregious, Detective, my
                    client has pressing matters at his
                    construction site. He can't afford to
                    waste time with this frivolous
                    nonsense...

                    Look, we're taking her statement right
                    now, gonna run every forensic test in the
                    book. Guarantee the case'll come apart
                    like a $2 watch...
          
          Jay nods, certain he can beat this rap...
          
                              JAY
                    She had my camcorder. Recorded what
                    happened. It should still be at the
                    construction site. It'll clear my name...
          
          Morrison nods.
          
                              MORRISON
                    You'll be outta here by tonight.
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Marie waits out in the anonymous hallway, talking a mile-a-minute
          on her cell phone...
          
                              MARIE (ON PHONE)
                    I can't believe it, Jenny...It just
                    doesn't make sense...I mean, I know
                    Jay...I know he'd never...
          
          When a door down the hall opens she looks up expectantly, only to
          see Kristen come out, walk towards her, followed by someone.
          Marie's view is blocked by Kristen until the Parole Officer passes
          her and reveals...Elena.
          
                              MARIE
                    This can't be...
          
          A look somewhere between horror and shock is etched on Marie's
          beautiful face. Elena just smiles, blows her a kiss.
          
                              ELENA
                    No such word as 'can't'...
          
          EXT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - DAY
          
          Police cars line the driveway outside the beach front building
          site. Officers cordon off the road as Forensics teams photograph
          every inch of the building...
          
          Standing amidst the crowd of onlookers is an irate Mr. Barajas,
          accompanied, as ever, by Cicatriz. They are both on CELLPHONES,
          both talking angry, fast Spanish.
          
                                                               03/22/2004   24.
          
          
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Plastic sheeting covers the windowless top floor of the unfinished
          condos. The white suited FORENSICS TEAM work meticulously, led by
          the tireless Dr. Chad Borman, delicately dusting anything and
          everything that might yield evidence...
          
          Morrison stands at the edge of an area cordoned off by POLICE
          TAPE. He's looking at Jay's smashed DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA, now
          bagged and tagged as evidence...
          
                              KRISTEN (O.S.)
                    Sexual predators often keep a trophy...
          
          Morrison spins, sees Kristen. He stumbles with his words, not used
          to talking to beautiful women...
          
                                 MORRISON
                    I'm sorry?
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Maybe he recorded the rape.
          
          Morrison looks at the remains of the camera.
          
                              MORRISON
                    And maybe he didn't. We'll never know.
                    Tape's mangled. Forensics said it'd take
                    months to fix it.
          
          He looks up into Kristen's hypnotic eyes.
          
                              MORRISON
                    We were never properly introduced.
                    Michael Morrison.
          
          She offers her hand, and Morrison shakes it.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Miss Richards. Kristen. Miami Parole. Was
                    just in town for a couple days checking
                    in on some parolees when all this went
                    down...
          
          She hands Morrison a BUSINESS CARD, which he absently stuffs into
          his pocket...
          
                              MORRISON
                    You think maybe you could lean on the
                    girl? Get her to drop this nonsense? We
                    all know she's lying. With all this Black
                    widow shit going down, we just don't have
                    the time or manpower to...

                              KRISTEN
                    She might not be lying, you know.
          
                              MORRISON
                    What makes you think that?
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Just a look in her eye. I...I have some
                    experience...
          
          Morrison doesn't want to push her further...
          
          All of a sudden the sunlight is blocked from the massive
          unfinished floor by black sheets erected by the Forensics team,
          leaving everyone in pitch darkness....
          
                              MORRISON
                    What the hell?
          
          Slowly an eerie ULTRA VIOLET GLOW fills the room. The white suited
          forensics technicians, glowing under the black light, wait
          patiently for evidence to show itself...
          
          Suddenly the clear IMPRINTS of hands on the wall become clear,
          along with the black stains of BLOOD FLECKS...
          
                                CHAD
                    Gotcha...
          
                              MORRISON
                    What is it?
          
                              CHAD
                    Blood, fingerprints, sign of a struggle.
                    I'd say we've got a rape on our hands,
                    Detective, but we won't know for sure
                    until we run the tests...
          
          Morrison's head is spinning...
          
                              MORRISON
                    Fine. Just do it...
          
          INT. BLUE BAY FORENSICS LAB - NIGHT
          
          Elena sits on the edge of a gurney in the high tech forensics lab,
          rubbing her arm where a band-aid covers a fresh needle mark. Chad
          appears at the doorway and she stares daggers at him.
          
                              ELENA

                    It's standard procedure in a rape test.

                                 ELENA
                    And such.
          
          She continues to pace as Chad makes his way into the room, rounds
          the desk and takes down a plastic beaker from the metal shelf.
          
                              CHAD
                    We're going to need a urine sample. Do
                    you think you could fill this?
          
                                 ELENA
                    From here?
          
          Chad goes red. Puts the plastic cup down on the desk and Elena
          grabs it.            C

                    some priv...
          
          The breath catches in Chad's throat as Elena takes her shirt off
          without hesitation. Stands there in just her black bra.
          
                              ELENA
                    Done. Next?
          
          Chad's jaw drops. Not just because Elena's in her underwear, but
          because of the clear BITE MARKS on her neck and arms...
          
                              CHAD
                    Those are...
          
                              ELENA
                    Bite marks. He chowed down.
          
                              CHAD
                    They're clear evidence markers...
          
          He reaches out, grabs a Polaroid Camera from the desk, starts
          snapping away like an ornithologist at a bird convention. The
          FLASH of the camera fills the room...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   27.

          FLASHBULBS explode as Marie accompanies her stepfather up the

          of sound bite hungry pressmen...

                    Any comment, Mr. Clifford?
          
          Jay puts his hand up to block the intrusive lenses. He disappears
          quickly into the shelter of the courthouse.

          Marie stops in her tracks, wheels around and addresses the throng
          of reporters...

                              JUDGE WILCOX
                    Order!
          
          Jay sits at the defendant's table, suit impeccable, hair
          immaculate, game face on. Theo sits beside him, scribbling notes.
          Marie is in the front row of the gallery, surrounded by her
          coiffured peers. She tries to smile stoically at Jay...
          
          Kristen sits beside Elena at the prosecution table.

           had is on the stand as ARLO MEESE, 35, the slick District
          Attorney, steps forward.
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    Dr. Borman, do your tests show that Elena                  
                    Sandoval had sexual intercourse on the                     
                    night of the 25th?                                         
                              CHAD                                             
                    Yes they do.                                               
                              D.A. MEESE                                       
                    Do they show that it was forced?                           
          
                                                         03/22/2004   28.

                    Yes. There was extensive bruising and
                    tearing. We found no semen evidence. The
                    latex abrasions point to the use of
                    protection. This is quite common in cases
                    of premeditated rape.
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    And what can you tell us about Miss
                    Sandoval's toxicology reports, Doctor?
          
                              CHAD
                    Came back positive for Rohypnol, a common
                    date rape drug. Traces were also found on
                    the bottle of beer at the crime scene.
                    Both Mr. Clifford and Miss Sandoval's
                    fingerprints were all over the bottle.
          
                              JAY
                    I took it from her. She was far too young
                    to be drinking!
          
          A slam of the gavel silences Jay.
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    Dr. Borman I am going to show you what's                   
                    been marked as state's exhibit number 1.                   
          He nods to the bailiff and a PROJECTOR whirs to life. An EVIDENCE
          PHOTO that Chad took of Elena's wounds is displayed on a screen
          beside him.

                              CHAD
                    Miss Sandoval was found to have numerous
                    bite marks on her upper torso that
                    occurred during the rape.
          
                              JUDGE WILCOX
                    What about those other markings?
          
          Chad looks confused, studies the slide, sees four equidistant dots
          aligned in a small circle.
          
                              CHAD

                    markings, possibly...

                    I'm going to show you another slide                        
                                                                               
                    that's been marked as state's exhibit
                    number 2.                                                  
          
                                                                               
          Meese nods to the bailiff, who dutifully changes the slide. The
          court goes dark for a second before the next slide is                
          displayed...It's a close up of Jay's teeth mouldings compared to

                    What can you tell us about these
                    mouldings?                                                 
                              CHAD
                    They were made from the defendant's                        
                    teeth, and the tests I conducted show                      
                    there's simply no other conclusion. The
                    bite marks on Miss Sandoval's body were
                    made by the defendant, Mr. Jay
                    Clifford...
          
          That's it. The Court erupts, flashbulbs exploding. Jay slumps back
          in his chair, his air of cool gone in an instant. He looks back at
          Marie, utter disbelief on his face. The tears well in her eyes...
          
          The Judge bangs his gavel in a vain attempt to regain control.

                    will testify in his defense tomorrow. And
                    in other news, officials from the FBI

          reaches down to pick up Jay's broken video camera, still in the
          evidence bag...

                    Used to play at being a spider when I was

          Morrison shakes the broken camera parts in the evidence bag.

                    over by the case by the end of the week.
          
          Chad's dumbstruck, but dutifully takes the shattered video camera.
          
                              MORRISON
                    You find anything on that tape, you let
                    me know, OK?
          
                              CHAD
                    Whatever you say, boss.
          
                              MORRISON
                    And make sure you get that money back
                    into the evidence locker.
          A
           nd Chad's left alone with the shattered remains of the video
          camera, and a whole shit load of work ahead...
          
                                                       FADE TO BLACK:
          
          EXT. BLUE BAY HIGH SCHOOL SWIMMING POOL - DAY
          
          The early morning sun casts a brilliant orange glow over the
          smooth-as-glass surface of the school swimming pool.
          
          Marie steps back up onto the high diving platform. Tries to focus.
          Slides the soon-to-be-diamond ring off her finger and throws it
          tentatively into the water...
          
          She takes a breath and then dives, straight and true, into the
          perfect blue water below.
          
          EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS
          
          Marie's lithe, taught body comes arcing through the water, darting
          down to the bottom of the pool to retrieve the ring...
          
          EXT. BLUE BAY HIGH SCHOOL SWIMMING POOL - CONTINUOUS
          
          Marie surfaces, reaches out and puts the ring on the side of the
          pool, before looking up to see an old pair of sneakers, an
          electronic ankle bracelet locked around one leg.
          
                                                         03/22/2004     32.
          
          
          
                               ELENA
                    Nice take off. Gotta work on the
                    landing...
          
          Marie's blood boils.
          
                              MARIE
                    What the hell are you doing here?
          
          Elena just reaches down and picks up Marie's unfinished ring.
          
                              ELENA
                    Looks like your bling ain't blinging...
          
                              MARIE
                    Give me that back. It was my Mother's...
          
          Marie climbs out of the pool, faces down with Elena...
          
                              ELENA
                    Looks like she got ripped off Princess,
                    where's the rock?
          
          Marie snatches the ring from Elena, slides it back on her finger.
          
                              MARIE
                    Is that what this is all about?
          
          Elena reaches out, tries to stroke the wet hair off Marie's face.
          She recoils before she'll let Elena touch her...
          
                              ELENA
                    You're not a dumb as you look...
          J
           enny, followed by the rest of the diving team, come marching out
          of the locker room and see the two arch-enemies confronting each
          other.
          
                              JENNY
                        (to her team mates)
                    We got trouble...
          
          Elena won't back down.
          
                              MARIE
                    You're ruining my life, and my
                    stepfather's.
          
                              ELENA
                    It can end. Just like that.
          
          She snaps her fingers and Marie's on the verge of tears...
          
                                                         03/22/2004   33.
          
          
          
          Jenny and the rest of the diving team approach, stand behind
          Marie, a seething mass of bikini-clad mindless hate...
          
                              MARIE
                    Why are you doing this?
          
                              ELENA
                    Because I can.
          
          As she turns and walks away...
          
                              ELENA (CONT'D)
                    Good luck in court.
          
          INT. BLUE BAY COURTROOM - DAY
          
          The usual assortment of paparazzi and spectators crowd into the
          small courtroom.
          
          Marie is on the witness stand, staring straight ahead at her
          stepfather at the defendant's table. Gone is the immaculate suit,
          the perfect hair, the poker face. He's looking worried now...
          
          Theo paces in front of Marie, running her through a series of well-
          rehearsed questions.
          
                              THEO
                    And why did you go to your stepfather's
                    building site that night, Miss Clifford?
          
                              MARIE
                    It was my birthday. Jay left the party
                    before giving me my present.
          
                              THEO
                    And you say you saw Miss Sandoval
                    leaving?
          
          Marie takes a moment, looks to Elena at the Prosecution table.
          
                              MARIE
                    I did.
          
                              THEO
                    And how would you describe her
                    appearance?
          
                              MARIE
                    She was...she looked fine. She smiled at
                    me. Actually smiled...
          
                              THEO
                    No further questions.
          
                                                          03/22/2004   34.
          
          
          
          He takes a seat next to Jay, whispers in his ear. D.A. Meese
          starts his cross-examination.
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    Would it be fair to say you don't like
                    Elena Sandoval, Miss Clifford?
                              M
                              MARIE
                    We don't see...eye to eye...
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    Is that why you attacked her at your
                    party earlier that night?
          
          Marie squirms.
          
                              MARIE
                    No...I was...she wasn't invited...
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    You'd had a few drinks, correct?
          
                              MARIE
                        (reluctantly)
                    I'd had a drink. Yes.
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    So by the time you allege to have seen
                    Miss Sandoval, could you tell the court
                    exactly how much you'd had to drink?
          
                              MARIE
                    A glass of Champagne. Or two, but...
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    No further questions.
          
          Jay sinks a few inches lower in his seat. Going down...
          
          INT. BLUE BAY FORENSICS LAB - DAY
          
          A bleary eyed Chad sits in front of a bank of monitors, working
          the image enhancement equipment, fighting to get a watchable
          picture from the fuzzy static in front of him. Kristen sits behind
          him, fighting to stay awake.
          
                              CHAD
                        (to himself)
                    Take out the chroma, raise the
                    luminescence...
          
          He clumsily reaches over the control panel, hitting almost every
          button on the way. And that does the trick...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   35.
          
          
          
          Suddenly the picture on the monitors becomes clear. Kristen's eyes
          snap open.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    H
                     oly shit...
          
          The pixilated image of Elena smiling comes into focus on the TV...
          
                              KRISTEN (CONT'D)
                    Call Detective Morrison. Now...
          
          SCENE OMITTED
          
          INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS- DAY
          
          The shaky, pixilated image of Elena smiling flickers on the TV.
          Soon enough though her smile fades...
          
                              ELENA (ON TAPE)
                    You're kidding right?
          
          Jay's voice can be heard behind the camera...
          
                              JAY (O.S. ON TAPE)
                    C'mon now baby, you can do it...
          
          The video shows Elena cowering...
          
                              ELENA (ON TAPE)
                    Please...you can't do this...
          
                              JAY (O.S ON TAPE)
                    No such word as can't...
          
          A hand reaches out from behind the video camera and grabs Elena,
          throws her violently against a concrete wall.
          
                                 JAY (O.S. ON TAPE)
                    Fuck me...
          
          A flurry of movement that goes in and out of focus. When the
          camera steadies again, Elena's hands are pressed against the wall
          and she's sobbing... E
          
                               LENA (ON TAPE)
                    Please, Mr. Clifford, don't...
          
                              JAY (O.S ON TAPE)
                    Just try to keep those legs together...
          
          And then static...
          
                                                         03/22/2004   36.
          
          
          
          Pulling back from the TV we find ourselves in the courtroom,        
                                                                              
          completely empty, save for Jay, Theo, Meese and Judge Wilcox all
          staring in shock at the blank TV screen...                          
          
                                                                              
                              D.A. MEESE
                    If Mr. Clifford would plead guilty to                     
                    rape, the state is prepared to drop the                   
                                                                              
                    charges of kidnapping and assault.

                        (to Jay)
                    If I were you I would seriously consider                  
                    the offer.                                                
          INT. COUNTY JAIL VISITING ROOM - DAY
          
          In the cold stone jail visiting room, Jay sits behind the wire
          mesh, an emotion Marie and Theo opposite. The PRISON GUARD waits
          by the barred door, keeping his beady eyes on Jay.
          
                              JAY
                    I'm gonna lose this trial.
          
                              THEO
                    I'm not so sure about that. The tape's a
                    fake, right? So all we need to do is...
          
          Jay holds up a hand, instantly silencing his attorney.
          
                              JAY
                    You had your chance.
                        (to Marie)
                    If we're gonna win at all costs, we're
                    gonna have to change the game.
                        (to Theo)
                    Do you have it?
          
          Theo nods regretfully, reaches into a breast pocket, pulls out a
          KEY.
          
                              THEO
                    I'm still dead set against this, Jay.
          
                              JAY
                    I couldn't care less.
          
                              MARIE
                    What's the key for?
          
                              JAY
                    The diamonds...If that's what it takes,
                    then that's what it takes...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   37.
          
          
          
                              MARIE
                    But...they're my inheritance...
          
                              JAY
                    All my assets are tied up in the condos,
                    Marie. We have to pay this girl off, make
                    her testify that she faked the tape,
                    faked the evidence.
          
                              MARIE
                    But, Jay...they're my diamonds...
          
                              JAY
                    As soon as I'm out of here, you'll have
                    them back. I swear. I know people, who
                    can...persuade her to hand them over...
          
          Marie shoots an uncomfortable look to Theo, then back at Jay,
          uncertain what to say.
          
                              MARIE
                    I
                     t's wrong.
          
                              JAY
                    More wrong than what she's doing to us?
                    We're team Clifford, right? You know I'm
                    not guilty. You know I could never do
                    anything like this. So do the right thing
                    and get me out of this hellhole...
          
          Marie's cracking...
          
                                 MARIE
                    I can't...
          
                              JAY
                        (tenderly)
                    No such word as 'can't.' Please...
          
          The tears well in her eyes.
          
          INT. MUSEUM - NIGHT
          
          The key slips easily into the lock below the dazzling Mother
          Daughter diamonds. The alarms disabled, Marie's finally able to
          reach inside the glass case and touch the priceless gems...
          
          The Curator stands behind her in the empty Museum hall, ruefully
          watching his prize exhibit being removed.
          
                              CURATOR
                    I knew the day would come, still doesn't
                    make it any easier...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   38.
          
          
          
          Marie, tears welling in her eyes, takes a hold of the diamonds,
          carefully takes them from the case.
          
                              CURATOR
                    The offer still stands, Marie. If you
                    ever decide to sell them, please give us
                    a first chance...
          
          Marie turns to him, the emotions overwhelming her.
          
                              MARIE
                    I don't think I'll be able to, I'm
                    sorry...
          
          She scampers towards the door, past the security guards.
          
                              CURATOR
                        (sotto)
                    Me too...
          
          EXT. THE GATOR TRAILER PARK - NIGHT
          
          Theo's SUV drives carefully down the mud path running parallel to
          the swamp, past countless rusted airboats, and into the 'GATOR'
          trailer park, finally coming to a halt in front of Elena's rotting
          trailer. Theo gets out carefully, his $1000 shoes sinking into the
          mud. Marie reluctantly steps out of the car...
          
          A blinding PORCH LIGHT flicks on. Theo and Marie spin round,
          squint through the light to see Elena standing in her trailer
          doorway...           E
                               LENA
                    Well, well, well. Look what the cat
                    dragged in...
                        (to Theo)
                    DA know you're here?
          
          Theo squirms...
          
                              MARIE
                    We need to talk.
          
                               ELENA
                    So talk.
          
                              THEO
                    Somewhere private, maybe?
          
                                                            03/22/2004   39.
          
          
          
          INT. ELENA'S TRAILER - NIGHT
          
          An elderly man, UNCLE MARTY, in a sweat-stained T-shirt and ratty
          underwear, snores on the tattered recliner, a half-drunk bottle of
          WHISKY hanging from one limp hand...
          
          Theo freezes when he sees him...
          
                              THEO
                    Who's this?
          
                              ELENA
                    Uncle Marty. Legal Guardian. Drunken
                    pervert, take your pick. Chill. He's out
                    til morning.
          
          Uncle Marty's deafening SNORES confirm the assertion as Elena
          leads them into her bedroom...
          
                              MARIE
                    Let's just get this over with.
                        (to Elena)
                    You won. You got what you wanted...
          
                              ELENA
                        (mocking)
                    I just wanted justice...
          
                              THEO
                    Tomorrow you'll take the stand, tell the
                    jury you faked the evidence, faked the
                    tape...
          
                              ELENA
                        (sarcastic)
                    Really?
          
                              MARIE
                    We are prepared to make it worth your
                    while.
          
          She holds the Daughter diamond in front of Elena's greedy little
          eyes.
          
                              ELENA
                        (poker face)
                    Not bad. But I always wanted a family...
          
          Theo nudges Marie. She sighs, holds out the Mother diamond in the
          other hand. A broad grin stretches across Elena's face.
          
          F
          
          
          
          
                                                         03/22/2004   40.
          
          
          
                              THEO
                    They're yours after you exonerate my
                    client.
          
                              ELENA
                    I'm afraid I'm gonna need that payment up
                    front.
          
                              MARIE
                    No, that's not the deal.
          
                              ELENA
                    It is now. Take it or leave it.
          
          Marie takes a deep breath. It's the most difficult thing she's
          ever had to do in her young life. Dead silence, except for Uncle
          Marty's snoring from the front room.
          
           inally, with a very heavy heart, Marie hands over the diamonds.
          
                              THEO
                    When this is all over, you'll leave town.
                    For good.
          
          Elena points to the ankle bracelet.
          
                              ELENA
                    I go more than five miles from the police
                    station and I'm straight back in juvie...
          
                              THEO
                    I understand your Parole term is up next
                    week.
          
          Elena smiles.
          
                              ELENA
                    You've done your homework. Fine.
                        (points to the ankle bracelet)
                    As soon as this thing comes off, I'm
                    outta here...
          
          She reaches down and grabs the diamonds. Dances past Marie...
          
                              THEO
                    May I suggest a little discretion, Miss
                    Sandoval. Certain...questions might be
                    asked about this...arrangement if you
                    were to...say...turn up to Blue Bay High
                    wearing a tiara...
          
          Elena winks.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   41.
          
          
          
                              ELENA
                    I ain't gonna flaunt it, mate. I gots too
                    much class for that shit.
          
                              MARIE
                    You're going to tell the truth on the
                    stand tomorrow, yes?
          
          Elena raises her right hand...
          
                              ELENA
                    I swear to tell the truth, the whole
                    truth and nothing but the truth...
          
          INT. COURTROOM - DAY
          
          The court Bailiff nods, takes the Bible from Elena's hands. She's
          dressed in the closest thing to a modest suit she has in her
          wardrobe; a low cut jacket and tiny miniskirt...
          
          The courtroom is packed with journalists, TV cameras and nosey
          neighbors. Everyone wants a piece of this story. At the
          defendant's table, Jay, slick once more in Armani, watches Theo
          approach the witness box with a new-found confidence.
          
          Sitting in the front row of the public gallery, Marie is riveted
          on the action. At the back of the courtroom, Kristen fidgets
          nervously beside Morrison as Theo steps up, ready to question the
          newly compliant star witness in this sensational rape trial...
          
                              THEO
                    It's your assertion that my client, Mr.
                    Clifford forcibly sexually assaulted you
                    on the night of the 25th. Is that true?
          
          A hushed silence. Marie, Jay, Theo all wait expectantly...
          
                              THEO
                    Is that what you say happened?
          
          Elena clears her throat.
          
                              ELENA
                    He... He didn't...
          
          A collective intake of breath from the crowd.
          
                              ELENA
                    ....just sexually assault me.
          
          Theo's balls shrink instantly.
          
                                                         03/22/2004   42.
          
          
          
                              THEO
                    What...did you just say?
          
                              ELENA
                    He didn't just sexually assault me. He
                    threatened to kill me if I told anyone...
          T
           he court is on the verge of erupting into anarchy. Theo's
          reeling, caught off-guard, stumbling over his words, trying to
          give the girl one last chance to make good on her promise.
          
                              THEO
                    Isn't it true that you were inebriated
                    during the assault, that it may not in
                    fact have been Mr. Clifford...Or anyone?
          
          A smirking Meese doesn't even bother to stand up.
          
                              D.A. MEESE
                    Objection. Leading the witness.
          
                              JUDGE WILCOX
                    Sustained. Council will please rephrase
                    the question.
          
          Theo's stumped. His eyes plead with Elena to take the ball and run
          with it. She does. Unfortunately it's to the wrong end zone.
          
                              ELENA
                    I was messed up, alright. In fact, only
                    two things I remember. One was that
                    bastard Jay Clifford taping me with that
                    Goddamn video camera while he violated
                    me. The other was what he whispered in my
                    ear, right before I blacked out...
          
          She pauses, for emphasis. Judge, jury, gallery, press corps, the
          town of Blue Bay, the state of Florida hangs on her every word...
          
                              ELENA
                    He said, "You won't remember, but you'll
                    never forget."
          
          That's it. The court goes berserk, flashbulbs exploding, along
          with the veins in Jay's head.
          
          Kristen's reeling from shock...
          
                              KRISTEN
                        (to Morrison)
                    What did she just say?
          
          Marie leaps to her feet, screams...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   43.
          
          
          
                              MARIE
                    Lying bitch!
          
          Marie has to be restrained, trying to break through the crowds to
          claw Elena's tear stained eyes out...

                    The young victim's wrenching testimonial
                    proved to be the final nail in the coffin
                    for Jay Clifford. It took less than an
                    hour for the jury to deliberate and
                    sentence Mr. Clifford to 15 years.
          T
           V cameras witness Jay being led away in handcuffs...
          
                              JAY (ON TV)
                    You can't do this to me! You can't...YOU
                    CAN'T!
          
          CLICK. The TV turns off. Marie sits huddled in Jay's unfinished
          concrete building site office, staring at the darkened television
          set. Mascara laden tear tracks line her perfect face.
          
                              MARIE
                        (mumbling)
                    No such thing as can't...
          
          She lets the champagne bottle slip through her fingers and it
          smashes on the concrete floor. Strangely the dregs of the
          champagne start running down the floor...
          
          Marie's heart suddenly skips a beat as she thinks she hears the
          rustling of plastic from outside the office.
          
                              MARIE
                    Who's there?
          
          No answer. She steels herself, gets shakily to her feet, stumbling
          drunkenly toward the door...
          
          EXT. ELENA'S TRAILER - NIGHT
          
          Kristen stands in the darkened doorway of Elena's less-than-
          welcoming trailer. She knocks.
          
                              KRISTEN

          No answer. She tries the door handle. It's unlocked. She takes a
          deep breath, steps inside.
          
          INT. ELENA'S TRAILER - NIGHT
          
          Kristen flips on a light switch. The room is illuminated for a
          split second before the bulb surges and burns out, leaving Kristen
          in the near-darkness...
          
                               KRISTEN
                    Elena?   Hello?
          
          She takes out a FLASHLIGHT, creeps through the front room,
          stepping over the discarded pizza boxes and assorted detritus.
          
          The beam of light finds a small BLUE PILL nestled in the
          carpeting. Kristen picks it up, slides it into her pocket...
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Marie steps cautiously through the unfinished concrete top floor,
          past the crime scene tape. In the dim light, her eyes dart to
          every corner, every shadow.

           he lets out a surprised shout as the room is suddenly plunged
          into darkness. Slowly the eerie forensic ULTRA VIOLET LIGHTS
          switch on, filling the room with black light.
          
          And with a knot growing in the pit of her stomach, Marie slowly
          turns, coming face to face with...
          
          Elena, her arch-nemesis...
          
          INT. ELENA'S TRAILER - NIGHT
          
          Kristen moves slowly into Elena's bedroom, shines her light on the
          walls. What she sees makes the blood run chill in her veins.
          Barely able to breathe, she takes out her cell phone.

          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Elena and Marie stare each other down. You could cut the tension
          with a chainsaw, until...
          
                              MARIE
                    Who invited you?
          
                                                            03/22/2004   45.
          
          
          
          A sinister grin spreads across Elena's face as she holds up the
          breathtaking Mother-Daughter diamonds, reflecting an unearthly
          glow under the UV lights.
          
                              ELENA
                    Mother and Daughter...
          
          This brings a mile-wide smile to Marie as she dances into Elena's
          arms. Their lips come together in a passionate kiss as their hands
          dance over each other's trembling bodies. When they finally
          break...
          
                              MARIE
                    I was sure you'd blow it on the stand,
                    going on about forgetting and
                    remembering.
          
                              ELENA
                    Gotta make it seem authentic. God's in
                    the details.
          
          And they kiss again, lips locked tighter than Jay's jail cell...

          Morrison's unmarked sedan pulls to a stop beside Kristen's car,
          and the harried Detective steps out, looking extremely unhappy.

          Elena and Marie are locked in their carnal embrace, failing to
          notice the florescent lights flickering back on. Suddenly Elena
          feels the sharp pain of teeth biting into her neck...
          
          She looks down to see DENTAL ALGINATE MOLDINGS of Jay's teeth
          being held by a smiling Chad.
          
                              CHAD
                    Mind if Chad joins?
          
          The girls look up to see a beaming Chad, holding the teeth
          molding. Elena just shakes her head...
          
                                 ELENA
                    Fuck me...

          He sets the dentures down on the concrete floor, and takes in the
          sight of the magnificent diamonds.

          running cold in their veins as Uncle Marty stumbles inside. They
          hold their breath, praying he doesn't see them, standing in
          Elena's doorway. Uncle Marty just mumbles something incoherent and
          collapses face first onto the couch, out like a light...

          candy. Chad   gulps down the third as Elena begins to run her hands
          up and down   Marie's back and shoulders. Chad's hands are all over
          Marie as he   helps slip off her bra.

                    No, Mr. Clifford. I just have a few
                    questions. I've noticed some

                    Here's one big fucking glaring
                    inconsistency for you: I was set up!
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Maybe so, but that's not good enough. Why
                    were you set up? What would Elena
                    Sandoval have gained from all this?
          
          Jay hesitates, unsure how, or if, to proceed. Theo shifts
          nervously. Jay gives J

                    much worse can it get? I paid her off,
                    okay? My assets were tied up in the

                    How the fuck should I know? Manipulative
                    little skank probably figured she could
                    bleed me for some more money down the
                    road. But I'll tell you this much, I'm
                    gonna get those diamonds back, make her
                    wish she was never born.

          Elena stands in her bedroom, disbelief washing over her. No sign
          of the newspaper articles. Her walls are barren.
                               E
                                  LENA
                        (sotto)
                    Oh shit...
          
          EXT. BLUE BAY HIGH SCHOOL SWIMMING POOL - DAY
          
          The diving team emerges from the locker room on their way to
          practice. Lagging behind is Marie. She's about to catch up when
          she runs smack dab into a panicked Elena.
          
                              MARIE
                    What the...If anyone sees us together...
          
                                                          03/22/2004   50.
          
          
          
                              ELENA
                    What choice did I have? We got big
                    problems...
          
          Before anyone can see them, Marie pulls her away, to the outdoor
          shower area, out of sight from her teammates. She turns on all
          the shower heads.
          
                              MARIE
                    Gotta be careful. Make sure no one's
                    listening. Now what's the 411?
          
                              ELENA
                    I...I think I fucked up...
          
          Marie gently takes a hold of Elena's face.
          
                              MARIE
                    How?
          
                              ELENA
                    I don't know for sure...but I think that
                    bitch Parole officer's made me...she was
                    at my trailer last night...
          
          Marie smiles, pulls Elena close as the steam rises all around.
          
                              MARIE
                    No bigee. You disposed of everything,
                    right? The teeth, the video, all the
                    research...
          
          Elena can't fess up. Not now...
          
                              ELENA
                    I did, but...She's got a hard on for me.
                    Wants to see me back in Juvie...
          
          Marie kisses her softly on the forehead. Her cheek.
          
                              MARIE
                    I won't let the big bad wolf get you. I
                    promise.
          
          Elena's damp tank top clings to her perfect body.
          
                              ELENA
                    I just want outta here.
          
          Marie brushes a strand of hair away from Elena's face.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   51.
          
          
          
                              MARIE
                    Be patient. I'll call the Museum Curator,
                    have him prepare the funds to buy back
                    the diamonds...
          
                              ELENA
                    Then we're outta here, right?
          
          A mile wide smile stretches across Marie's lips...
          
                              MARIE
                    Just sit back, relax, enjoy the
                    trip...Don't forget to come again.
          T
           heir trembling lips come together like wet hot magnets...
          
          EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY
          
          Sunlight cuts through the dark blue surface, illuminating Marie's
          lucky ring gold ring that drifts down gently until...
          
          Marie comes diving down into the crystalline water, plucks the
          soon-to-be diamond ring from the bottom of the pool...
          
          EXT. BLUE BAY HIGH SWIMMING POOL - DAY
          
          Marie surfaces at the edge of the pool. She places the ring onto
          the deck, pulls herself out of the water.
          
          She tries not to show surprise when she comes face to face with
          Kristen, who's picked up her ring, runs it around her fingers...
          
                              MARIE
                    Can I help you?
          
                              KRISTEN
                    I was wondering if I could have a moment
                    of your time. Ask a couple questions.
          
          Marie glances nervously back at the pool, where other members of
          the diving team go about their workout.
          
                              MARIE
                    I'm in the middle of practice...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    It'll only take a moment, Marie. Might
                    even help Jay. Remember your loving
                    stepfather? You want to help him, don't
                    you?
          
                                 MARIE
                    Of course.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   52.
          
          
          
          Kristen studies the ring for a moment, then ventures...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Why'd you agree to part with your
                    diamonds?
          
          This time Marie can't hide her shock.
          
                              MARIE
                    How...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Jay told me. But why? They were your
                    inheritance.
          
                              MARIE
                    Jay needed help. We're a team.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Team Clifford. Right. It's just...You
                    must've been pretty unhappy when Jay
                    didn't give you those diamonds for your
                    birthday.
          M
          Marie's taking a beating, doing her best to remain standing.
          
                              MARIE
                    He said I wasn't ready.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You're 18. That's heiress payday, no?
                    Must've crossed your mind that Jay might
                    never let you have them...
          
                              MARIE
                    No, of course not.
          
          She's a bad liar.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    And then this little scam artist saunters
                    in and just takes them. With your help,
                    no less.
          
          Kristen moves in for the kill.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    But what I don't get is, why wouldn't
                    Elena do what Jay asked, clear his name?
                    After all, she'd gotten what she wanted.
          
                              MARIE
                    How should I know?
          
                                                            03/22/2004   53.
          
          
          
          Marie watches in fascination as Kristen presses the top of the
          ring against the back of her hand. Hard. Winces, then...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    I mean, the only way I can make sense of
                    it is if somehow getting Jay released
                    from prison would spoil the plan.
          
                                 MARIE
                    What plan?
          
          She hands the ring back to Marie. Not so lucky anymore...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You tell me...
          I
          INT. BLUE BAY PD HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Chad strolls gingerly down the hallway, opens the door to the
          forensics lab, freezing when he sees...
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD FORENSICS - DAY
          
          Kristen, waiting patiently for him.
          
                              CHAD
                    Miss...Richards. Is...Is there something
                    I can do for you?
          
                              KRISTEN
                    I was wondering if you'd do me the favor
                    of running a quick test.
          
                              CHAD
                    Uh, sure, I guess. Whatcha got for me?
          
          She hands him the Blue Pill she found in Elena's trailer.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Could you tell me what this is?
          
          Chad tries to keep his cool.
          
                              CHAD
                    No problemo. It'll only take a minute.
          
          While Chad goes about his work, Kristen begins nosing around the
          office. Chad looks over his shoulder.
          
                              CHAD
                    Be careful, I got lots of evidence here.
          
          She starts flipping through EVIDENCE PHOTOS...
          
                                                          03/22/2004   54.
          
          
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Are these the evidence photos from the
                    Elena Sandoval rape?
          
                              CHAD
                    They are, but...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Ever find out what caused these markings?
          
          She holds up the photograph of the four circular indentations the
          Judge questioned Chad about in court...
          
                              CHAD
                    Like I told the Judge, I guess they're
                    finger nail markings...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    They don't look like finger nail markings
                    to me. They look more like this...
          
          She holds up the back of her hand, where she'd made the
          indentation with Marie's ring.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Would you say these markings are the
                    same?
          
                              CHAD
                    W-where did you get that?
          
          Kristen smiles.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Marie gave it to me. But you already knew
                    that, didn't you, Doc?
          
          Chad has no answer to that. He can only blink stupidly and pray
          his silence doesn't incriminate him further. Kristen heads for the
          door...
          
                              CHAD
                        (calling after)
                    The pill. It's Rohypnol. Uh, Roofies.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Been there. Done that.
          
          INT. CLIFFORD MANSION - NIGHT
          
          The massive front door swings open and Marie crosses the foyer,
          and is about to ascend the magnificent staircases when she hears
          the clanking of glass coming from the kitchen.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   55.
          
          
          
          Her heart is in her throat as she calls out...
          
                                 MARIE
                       Hello?
          
          No answer.
          
                                                                               
          INT. CLIFFORD MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Marie enters the lavish kitchen, stops in her tracks when she sees
          Chad standing at the full bar, mixing the strongest drink known to
          man.
          
                                 MARIE
                       What the hell, Chad?                                    
          Chad fidgets nervously.
          
                                 CHAD
                       That parole officer was sniffin' around
                       today.
          
          Marie scoffs, steps up to the bar, gets in Chad's face.
          
                                 MARIE
                       Not you too. She's just trying to prove
                       her worthless excuse for an existence.
                       She doesn't have a thing on us.
          
                                 CHAD
                       Yeah, but she's askin' the right
                       questions. It's only a matter of time. We
                       gotta make our move.
          
          Marie shakes her head, resolute.
          
                                 MARIE
                       No. We stick to the plan. Give the
                       Curator time to come up with the money...
          
          Chad's trembling hands pour the drink, most of the liquid making
          it in to two MARTINI GLASSES...
          
                                 CHAD
                       We gotta move fast, keep the heat off...
          
                                 MARIE
                       You can't take the heat, get outta the
                       kitchen.
          
                                 CHAD                                          
                       I wanna see 'em. The diamonds.   Make                   
                       sure they're safe.

                    They're safe.
          
          She downs half the drink in one giant gulp.
          
                              CHAD                                                 
                    I just wanna see 'em. I thought we were                        
                                                                                   
                    supposed to be partners here.
          
          Chad's trembling, looking like he could lose it at any second.
          
                              MARIE                                                
                    You're gonna be the death of me...                             
          She slugs the rest of the drink, strides away and Chad follows           
          like a lapdog...                                                         
          INT. CLIFFORD MANSION - JAY'S OFFICE - NIGHT                             
          Nothing's been touched in Jay's office, the drops of blood the           
          Cubans extracted from his thumb as a warning stain the white             
          carpet black...                                                          
          Marie walks over to his desk, opens a draw. Removes a metallic           
          lock box.                                                                
                              CHAD                                                 
                    Open it. I wanna see those puppies.                            
          Marie rolls her eyes, takes a key from a delicate chain around her 
          neck and fumbles with the lock. Finally she opens the box,         
          revealing the Mother-Daughter diamonds, resting on velvet lining.  
          
          The sparkling diamonds seem to have a calming effect on Chad.      He
          stops shaking, his voice becoming more steady...                         
                              CHAD
                    I called the museum. The deal's goin'
                    down tomorrow. 8 am...
          
          Marie stumbles as she takes a step toward him.
          
                              MARIE
                    What did you...
          
          She looks to the empty glass in her hand, then begins to sway,           
          watching in horror as Chad drops the diamonds into his pocket...
                               C
                               HAD

          Marie falls flat on her face, her world crashing to BLACK.

          EXT. EVERGLADES - MORNING
          
          The blinding morning sunlight climbs the horizon, the still water
          of the endless swampland glistening like diamonds...
          
          Elena sits out on her idling airboat, in the midst of the
          sawgrass, smoking. The peace is shattered by her ringing
          CELLPHONE.
          
                               ELENA
                    Yello...
          
                                                                               
          INT. CLIFFORD MANSION - JAY'S OFFICE - MORNING
          
          Marie has the phone cradled between her shoulder and ear, rubbing  
          her aching head, slowly getting her wits back. Nothing like good
          old fashioned vengeful rage to combat a nasty hangover.
          
                              MARIE
                        (into phone)
                    Chad fucked us.
          
                              ELENA (V.O.)
                        (deadpan)
                    I know. I was there...
          
                              MARIE
                    No, I mean he really fucked us. He
                    drugged me an' took the diamonds!
          
          EXT. SWAMPS - MORNING
          
          Elena stands on the edge of the airboat, fear rising in her.
          
                              ELENA
                     ell me you're kidding...
          
                              MARIE (V.O.)
                    Yeah, it's all a big joke...He stole the
                    diamonds!
          
          Elena lets out an anguished wail.
          
                              MARIE (V.O.)
                    Keep it down, my headache's bad enough as
                    it is.
          
                              ELENA
                    We've gotta stop him.

          INT. CLIFFORD MANSION - KITCHEN - MORNING
          
          Marie's fevered mind is racing as she glances at the wall clock.
          7:30. Finally a desperate plan scratches its way to the surface.
          
                              MARIE
                    He's heading to the museum, got himself
                    an 8am meeting...
          
                              ELENA (V.O.)
                    He's gonna sell the diamonds...
          
                              MARIE
                    Not if we find him first...
          
          EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY
          
          The deafening roar of an air boat cutting through dense sawgrass,
          speeding across the endless swampland expanse. Elena expertly
          maneuvers the machine, the wind racing through her hair...
          
          EXT. SWAMP ROAD - DAY
          
          Chad's speakers blare out heavy metal as his rusty DAEWOO bangs
          down the desolate swamp dirt road through the thick trees. Every
          hundred feet or so, the road runs parallel with the water, then
          cuts back into the trees.
          C
           had spots an Air Boat not more than a few hundred yards from him.
          He does a double take just as the road disappears back into the
          trees. That wasn't...it couldn't be, could it?
          
          The winding dirt road crosses back to swampside and Chad's worst
          fears come true...Elena's racing along side of him in the AIRBOAT,
          fighting to keep up...
          
                                 ELENA
                    Pull over!
          
          INT. CHAD'S CAR - DAY
          
          The road runs parallel to the swamp again and Chad's eyes nearly
          burst from their sockets as he sees the airboat now alongside him,
          matching his speed.
          
                              ELENA
                    Give us back the diamonds!
          
          Chad's heart stops.
          
                                 CHAD
                    Us?
          
                                                           03/22/2004   59.
          
          
          
          He spins round, looks straight ahead at the BMW RACING RIGHT AT
          HIM!
          
                              CHAD
                    FUCKING HELL!
          
          He yanks the steering wheel hard left, swerves his car clean off
          the dirt road and into the thick swathe of Melaluca trees, Marie's
          BMW shoots past, missing his car by inches...
          
          INT. MARIE'S BMW - CONTINUOUS
          
          Marie slams on her brakes, brings her BMW to a skidding halt on
          the dirt road. She looks back over her shoulder, at the swaying
          Melaluca trees. No sign of Chad's car...
          
          EXT. SWAMPSIDE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Elena brings the airboat to rest at swamp side, leaps into the
          reeds and clambers up to the dirt road. There's no sign of Chad's
          car, just a hole in the dense undergrowth where it ploughed
          through...
          
          Marie comes running up to join Elena, a tire iron in hand...
          
                              ELENA
                        (sternly)
                    We're not hurting him, Marie, got it? We
                    just get the diamonds back...
          
                              MARIE
                    I
                     'm not gonna hurt him. No way...
          
          Marie stalks down the path Chad's car took off the dirt road...
          
                              MARIE
                    I'm gonna kill him.
          
          Elena's breath catches in her throat. Marie disappears into the
          trees and she's alone, out on the deserted swamp road...
          
                              ELENA
                    Marie! Don't do this...
          
          She hears a scream, a girl's scream...
          
                              ELENA
                    Marie!
          
          Elena sprints into the thick of the trees...

          Kristen is sitting at Detective Morrison's cluttered desk, her
          brow furrowed as she shuffles through the stack of newspaper
          articles she pulled from Elena's wall.
          
          Morrison stands in the doorway, watching her.
          
                              MORRISON

          Kristen looks up from the articles, into Morrison's smiling face.
          She smiles back.

          Morrison turns and walks right into a suit with an FBI badge
          identifying him as AGENT MILTON DAMMERS. The buzzcut agent drops
          BOXES at Morrison's feet.

          Marie is standing in a clearing, staring at Chad's wrecked car, at
          the top of a small slope, wrapped around a Melaluca tree like a
          Christmas present.
          
          Her piercing screams force Elena to come running...
          
                                 ELENA
                    You okay?
          
          Marie stops screaming, her face contorting in anger...
          
                              MARIE
                    No, I'm pretty damn far from okay...
          
          She points to the front seat of the crashed car...
          
          Elena can barely bring herself to look inside. Marie shoves her in
          the back, pushing her towards the open driver's side door. Elena
          gasps when she looks inside the car. Chad's not there.

                               M
          surveys the swamp all around her like the lioness she is...

          Kristen, also carrying a box, a step behind.
          
                              MORRISON
                    I appreciate the help...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Right back at ya.
          
          Morrison blushes as he absently adds the boxes to the groaning
          shelves stuffed with Black Widow evidence. Kristen notices the
          bundles of cash stored in and amongst the Black Widow evidence...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You could have a helluva holiday on that
                    money.
          
                               MORRISON
                    Recovered from the Black Widow's last
                    score. If I'd gotten to the scene just
                    five minutes earlier, I woulda gotten her
                    as well...
          
          Morrison shakes his head, ruefully, when a sudden sharp beeping
          has Kristen reaching into her pocket, fishing out a handheld GPS.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    What the hell...
          
          A red flashing dot moves quickly in the middle of the map...
          
                               KRISTEN
                    Elena...
          
          EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY
          
          Elena runs full pelt after Marie, through dense swampland, the
          plastic ankle bracelet around her leg silently flashing red...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   62.
          
          
          
                              MARIE
                    Chad! There's nowhere to run to, you
                    little weasel!
          
          She swings around, finally spotting a bloody hand print on one of
          the ashen tree trunks...
          
                                MARIE
                    Gotcha...
          
          She races off in hot pursuit. Elena's about to follow when she
          notices the red light flashing on her ankle bracelet...
          
                              ELENA
                    This can't be happening...
          
          Marie slows, looks back to Elena.
          
                                MARIE
                    What now?
          
                              ELENA
                    I'm more than five miles away from the
                    Police station. I go beyond five miles
                    and the alarm goes off...
          
          Marie snarls...
          
                              MARIE
                    You telling me your Parole Officer knows
                    you're out here?
          
          Elena can barely speak...
          
                              ELENA
                    She knows...
          
          EXT. SWAMP - DAY
          
          Chad's face is drained of color as he runs through the dense
          swampland, hugging the priceless diamonds. Sweat cascades from his
          brow, and thick plumes of blood from wounds all over his body
          swirl in the stagnant waters...
          
          Most gruesome of all is a broken TURN SIGNAL embedded in his right
          leg. As the water gets knee-deep, the last of Chad's reserve
          energy goes. He collapses in the stagnant marsh.
          
          Not far off, GATORS circle. It's only a matter of time before they
          notice the blood in the water.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   63.
          
          
          
          EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY
          
          The small bit of solid ground gives way to swampland. Elena steps
          into the water, her Ankle Bracelet FLASHING RED.
          
                              ELENA
                    Call it off, Marie. We gotta go or
                    she'll find us here...
          
          A splashing sound from up ahead silences both girls...
          
                              MARIE
                    You hear that?
          
          The sound echoes off the dense trees. Marie points left.
          
                              MARIE
                    You go that way...
          
          Marie heads off in the opposite direction. Elena hesitates, wants
          to follow, but does as she's told, and goes left, soon enveloped
          by canopy of trees...
          
          INT. KRISTEN'S CAR - DAY
          
          Kristen blasts down the Blue Bay streets, a siren in the
          windshield blaring...
          
          The handheld GPS continues to monitor Elena's exact position in
          the midst of the swamp...

          EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY
          
          Elena stumbles through the thick, stagnant water, scouring the
          horizon for any sign of Chad...
          
                              ELENA
                        (sotto)
                    Please...
          
          A rustling sound stops her in her tracks. Dead silence, until...
          
          A HAND GRABS HER LEG, AROUND THE FLASHING ANKLE BRACELET, DRAGS
          HER DOWN INTO THE SWAMP...
          
          EXT. EVERGLADES CLEARING - DAY
          
          Marie hacks her way through the overgrown foliage with the tire
          iron, like a Prada clad big-game hunter...
          
                              MARIE
                        (calling out to Elena)
                    You see him?

          No reply, just her own voice echoing back...

                    Elena?
          
          She rolls her eyes.

                    Useless bitch...

          Kristen's unmarked car races across the desolate swamp road.
          
          INT. KRISTEN'S CAR - DAY
          
          She checks the flashing GPS signal. Getting closer...
          
          EXT. EVERGLADES - DAY
          
          Elena bursts up to the surface of the bloody water, gasps for
          breath. Looking down she sees Chad, holding on to her like his
          life depends on it. It does...
          
          He pulls her back down into the water, just as she catches a
          glance of the circling GATORS...
          
          Using her as leverage, Chad pulls himself out of the swamp,
          climbing over her writhing body to the relative safety of solid
          ground...
          
          Elena coughs and splutters, floundering in the blood soaked water.
          The ravenous Gators approach, sensing a feeding frenzy...
          
                              CHAD
                    Don't move! Don't splash, they can sense
                    you in the water, they'll rip you to
                    pieces...
          
          Elena freezes, looking round at the black eyes breaking the
          surface of the bloody water, gliding in for the kill...
          
                              ELENA
                    Hel..help me...
          
          She reaches out a hand to Chad, only a few feet away...
          H
           e hesitates, then reaches out to her. But stops short of grabbing
          her trembling hand. Just balls his fist, squeezing every last drop
          of blood out of the open wounds on his palm...
          
          The dark blood cascades down into the water around Elena...
          
                                                                       65.

                    No.
          
          And he smiles as the Gators ease open their powerful jaws...
          
          WHACK!
          
          Chad's eyes roll back into his head as blood flows from his nose,
          ears and mouth. He falls forward, stiff as a board, and SPLASHES
          down into the water next to an apoplectic Elena. Behind him stands
          Marie, the BLOODY TIRE IRON in hand...
          
          Marie reaches out a hand, pulls Elena out of the water. She
          collapses onto her back and sucks in the stagnant swamp air...
          
                              MARIE
                    What are you doing? Our diamonds are
                    about to become dinner...
          
          Elena can't move, leaving Marie to wade into the swamp...

          Kristen approaches a fork in the swamp road at high speed. She
          checks the GPS scanner. It doesn't show her which way to turn...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Which way, which way...
          
          Split second decision. Left. She spins the wheel, takes the left
          hand fork...
          
          Bad choice. Just a few meters down the right fork is an abandoned
          BMW, an idle airboat, a crashed car, one dead man and two wild,
          wild things...
          
          EXT. SWAMP ROAD - DAY
          
          Elena and Marie, soaked to the bone, drag Chad's cold, dead corpse
          out of the trees. Marie drops the body, heads straight for her
          abandoned BMW. Elena follows, stumbling through the vines, her
          clothes dripping wet, shivering more from nerves than cold...

                    I don't...I don't have a clue...
          
          Marie spins round, a vicious look in her eyes. She holds the blood
          soaked diamonds in her hand...
          
                              MARIE
                    Chad made us an appointment to sell
                    these. I'm gonna keep it...
          
          Elena looks down to her flashing ankle bracelet...
          
                              ELENA
                    It's only a matter of time before my
                    Parole Officer finds me...
          
          Marie turns back around, flings open the BMW door and gets in.
          
                              MARIE
                    Then I suggest you get to work...
          
          She fires up the powerful engine, speeds away in a cloud of dust,
          leaving Elena the most deeply unpleasant task of her young life...
          
          EXT. CHAD'S CRASHED CAR - AFTERNOON
          
          Elena struggles to drag Chad's bloody body back to his crashed
          car. The tail lights flicker, throwing an ominous red glow over
          the dense thicket of overhanging trees.

          With a Herculean effort she manages to stuff Chad's inert body
          into the driver's seat. She stumbles back, horrified at the grim
          tableau before her...
          
          EXT. MUSEUM - AFTERNOON
          
          Marie's car comes barreling into the parking lot outside the stone
          Museum building.
          
          INT. MUSEUM - AFTERNOON
          
          The Curator paces back and forth, like an expectant father, in
          front of the empty glass case that used to house the diamonds.
          Marie bursts into the Museum, and he strides up to meet her,
          shocked when he sees Marie's covered in blood, sweat and guilt...
          
                              CURATOR
                    Marie? Are you alright?

                    Never better. Got the money?
          
          The Curator nods nervously.
          
                              CURATOR
                    I convinced the board of the
                    extraordinary circumstances
                    surrounding...
          
                              MARIE
                    Good.

           he fishes in her bag for the diamonds...
          
                              CURATOR
                    I...I received a call from your
                    'associate'. He said he would be handling
                    the transaction.
          
                              MARIE
                    Change of plans. My 'associate' got tied
                    up at work. Completely swamped...
          
          The Curator nods, unsure if he inquire further...
          
          Marie finally pulls out two blood soaked Diamonds from her bag,
          thrusts them at the Curator. He screws up his wrinkled face,
          afraid to touch them...
          
                              MARIE
                    Calm down. It's just blood.
          
          EXT. CHAD'S CAR - AFTERNOON
          
          With trembling hands, Elena opens the trunk of Chad's crashed car.
          She pulls out a plastic gas container, sloshing the fuel around
          inside, then trailing it back across the vine covered ground...
          
          She carefully places the empty container down, standing twenty
          feet back from the wreckage, fumbling in her pocket for a match...
          
          She can barely control her hands, her whole body shaking in
          fear...
          
          Finally she pulls out a MATCHBOOK, still sopping wet from the
          swamp. She strikes match after match, but they won't light, until,
          finally, one produces a tiny flame that simmers for a second then
          smoulders out...
          
                              ELENA
                    Don't do this to me, please...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   68.
          
          
          
          In frustration, she runs back to Chad's car, looking desperately
          for a lighter, climbing all the way in. Because of the slight
          slope it's on, the car's flimsy door slams shut behind her.
          
          Elena pays no heed, continues to rummage through the glove
          compartment.
          
                              ELENA
                    You gotta have a lighter or some...
          
          She's cut off as the WRECKED CAR'S HORN BLARES OUT!
          
          Deafening, the sound echoes around the dense undergrowth. Elena's
          heart skips a beat. Chad's corpse has slumped forward against the
          steering wheel.
          
                               ELENA
                    Jesus...
          
          She struggles with all her might to pull Chad's body back off the
          horn...
          S
           ilence reigns once more. Elena takes short, sharp breaths. Looks
          over at Chad's body slumped to the side, leaning against the
          driver's side door...
          
                              ELENA
                    I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...
          
          Not as sorry as she's going to be...
          
          The match she discarded outside only seconds ago continues to
          smoulder for a second, then REIGNITES!
          
          INT. MUSEUM - AFTERNOON
          
          The Curator carefully examines the diamond, turning it over and
          over in his hands. Marie stands over him, impatiently tapping her
          muddy shoe on the marble floor...
          
                               MARIE
                    So?
          
                              CURATOR
                    I...I'm not sure...
          
                              MARIE
                    Can you get the cash or not?
          
          The Curator looks up to her, bemused.
          
                              CURATOR
                    I can get the cash...it's just...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   69.
          
          
          
          Marie smiles a wicked grin.
          
                              MARIE
                    Then let's have those dead presidents...
          
          EXT. CHAD'S CAR - AFTERNOON
          
          The discarded match has set fire to the surrounding vines on the
          ground, and slowly the fire edges it way towards the line of
          gasoline that Elena trailed from Chad's wrecked car...
          
          INSIDE THE CAR
          
          Elena reaches over, carefully closes Chad's bloodshot eyes.
          Satisfied, she turns to get out, only to find the passenger side
          door LOCKED...
          
          She tries the handle. Tries it again. Desperately yanks it. Not
          opening, no sir...
          
          Elena looks over, see Chad's limp elbow on the door lock...
          
          OUTSIDE THE CAR
          
          The small brush fire reaches the pooled gasoline and...WHOOSH!
          
          INSIDE THE CAR
          
          Elena can't help but hear the unmistakable sound of FLAMES
          CRACKLING. Through the smashed rear window she sees the line of
          FIRE racing towards the car she's trapped in!
          
          She reaches over, clawing her way past Chad's corpse, trying to
          reach the door lock. Her bloody fingers slip on the lock, unable
          to pull it up.
          
          THE FIRE's SHOOTING towards the crashed car, only a few feet
          away...
          
          Elena fumbles with the lock, tears streaming down her face.
          
          The line of fire hits the crashed car, and ENGULFS it instantly.
          Bright ORANGE FLAMES cover the wreckage...
          
          INT. MUSEUM - AFTERNOON
          
          The Curator carefully sets down the diamonds on the marble floor.
          Marie looks at him like he's mad.
          
                              MARIE
                    What the hell are you doing?
          
                                                             03/22/2004   70.
          
          
          
                              CURATOR
                    One last test...
          
          The Curator hovers his heel over the biggest Diamond. Marie
          screams out!
          
                                MARIE
                    NO!
          
          He slams his foot down and the DIAMOND SHATTERS!
          
          INT. CHAD'S CRASHED CAR - AFTERNOON
          
          Elena SCREAMS as the passenger side window next to her SMASHES,
          SPLINTERING into a million glass fragments.
          
          Hands reach in and grab her, pulling her through the FLAMES...
          
          Seconds later Elena finds herself on the swamp floor, in Kristen's
          singed arms...
          
                                KRISTEN
                    You okay?
          
          Elena can barely talk, looking back at the flaming wreckage in
          front of her...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Care to explain?
          
                              ELENA
                    It was...it was an accident...
          
          The flames reflect in her tear-filled eyes.
          
          INT. MUSEUM - AFTERNOON
          
          Marie stands aghast at the sight of her diamonds, in a million
          tiny pieces on the museum's marble floor...
          
                              CURATOR
                    Fakes, I'm afraid. Made of glass. Can't
                    believe they were our top attraction all
                    these years...
          
          Every muscle in Marie's body contracts...She stands before the
          empty diamond exhibit case, runs her fingers over the portrait of
          her mother cradling her as a baby.
          
                              MARIE
                    That's my inheritance is it, Mom? Goddamn
                    Christmas ornaments...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   71.
          
          
          
          And as the disbelief gives way to anger she rips the portrait from
          the case and tears it to shreds...
          
                              CURATOR
                    Marie, please...
          
          There's no stopping her now. Red-faced, she lashes out at the
          display case with a devastating kick, the glass SHATTERING...
          
                              CURATOR
                    Marie, stop this instant!
          
          She continues her rampage regardless, ripping a FIRE EXTINGUISHER
          from the wall and hurling it through another display case...
          
                              MARIE
                    I hate you, Mom!    I'm glad you're dead!
          
          EXT. BLUE BAY PD - NIGHT
          
          Storm clouds gather over the whitewashed Police station...
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Elena sits with her head in her hands, across from Kristen in an
          anonymous interview room.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    I told you.
          
          Elena looks up, tears streaking her mascara.
          
                              ELENA
                    Told me what?
          
                              KRISTEN
                    That if you were telling the truth I'd
                    back you all the way. If you lied to me
                    there'd be trouble...
          
          Elena slumps back down, her head on the table.
          
                              ELENA
                    Chad swerved off the road, I swear...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Just swerved for no reason. Just decided
                    to take a shortcut through the swamp?
          
          Elena sobs, can't look Kristen in the eye.
          
                              ELENA
                    It was an accident...
          
                                                            03/22/2004   72.
          
          
          
          The door to the interview room swings open, and Detective Morrison
          strides through, a fresh-from-the-printer REPORT in his hands...
          
                              MORRISON
                    Accident my ass.
          
          He flips the pages of the report...
          
                              MORRISON
                    Forensics finds the head trauma that
                    killed Chad Borman was inflicted by a
                    single blow from behind.
          E
           lena looks up, through Panda eyes...
          
                              ELENA
                    The crash. He...he hit his head...
          
                              MORRISON
                    Was that before or after you dragged him
                    through the swamp?
          
          Elena has no answers as Morrison takes the cuffs from his belt,
          snaps them on Elena's wrists.
          
                              MORRISON
                    You got the right to remain silent, which
                    in your case is probably best, cos of the
                    shit you come up with...
          
          Kristen stands up, shaking her head.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    That's two strikes, Elena. One more and
                    you're out.
          
          Elena looks at her pleadingly.
          
                              ELENA
                    I'll do whatever you want.
          
          Kristen stops. Thinks for a moment. Nods to Morrison as he drags
          Elena to her feet.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Yeah. Yeah you will.
          
                              ELENA
                    I'll tell you the truth. I'll tell you
                    what happened. She killed him, and took
                    the diamonds. Marie, it was Marie
                    Clifford...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   73.
          
          
          
          Morrison just sneers.
          
                              MORRISON
                    Keep bleeting, Missy. All the way to the
                    Judge. I think its time he heard the
                    truth about Jay Clifford's accuser.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Her arrest doesn't guarantee Jay'll be
                    cleared, you know that. You need Marie,
                    you need the proof they set him up...
          
          Morrison considers this.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You came so close to nailing the Black
                    Widow, don't let this slip through your
                    fingers, Detective...
          
          He's about to speak, when Elena's cell phone rings. Kristen takes
          it from Elena, looks at the CALLER ID, sees Marie's name...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Speak of the Devil...
          
          She holds the phone up.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You're gonna answer it. And you're gonna
                    say that everything went fine. No one
                    found Chad's body. The plan's still on.
                    Do you understand me?
          
          Elena nods slowly. Morrison turns to Kristen.
          
                              MORRISON
                    You thinking what I'm thinking?
          K
           risten's patient with him.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    This is your chance. Feds can't take this
                    one from you...
          
          Morrison weighs his options, then finally nods.
          
          Kristen clicks the phone ON, holds it to Elena's ear.
          
                               ELENA
                    Yello...

          INT. MARIE'S BMW - NIGHT
          
          Marie speeds wildly down the deserted Blue Bay streets, one
          trembling hand holding a cigarette, the other her cellphone.
          
                               MARIE (ON PHONE)
                    The diamonds are fakes. Totally
                    worthless.
          
                              ELENA (V.O.)
                    No. That can't be true!
          
                              MARIE
                    Believe it. I'm leaving. Tonight.
          
                              ELENA (V.O.)
                    You can't...what about...me...
          
          Marie takes a long drag from her cigarette.
          
                              MARIE
                    Don't you understand? There's no money.
                    Nothing. Zip. Zilch. Zero. How am I
                    supposed to take care of your broke ass?
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kristen is listening in on the whole conversation. She cups her
          hand over the phone, whispers to Elena.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Tell her she has to meet you. Tell her
                    she can't leave...
          
          Elena nods and Kristen puts the phone back to her lips.
          
                              ELENA
                    I...I gotta see you.
          
                              MARIE (V.O.)
                    I'll send you a photo.
          
                              ELENA
                    Please. Just one last time.
          
                              MARIE (V.O.)
                    I'm gone, gone, gonski.
          
          Elena's reeling. Kristen motions for her to continue.
          
                              ELENA
                    I think maybe...maybe there's a way we
                    could still get some money...

          Silence on the end of the line...
          
          INT. MARIE'S BMW - NIGHT
          
          Marie considers this for a long moment.    Finally...
          
                              MARIE
                    Okay, talk...
          
                              ELENA (V.O.)
                    Not over the phone. We gotta meet.
          
                              MARIE

          Click. She's hung up. Kristen nods to Morrison...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Where'd you keep the wire taps?
          
                              MORRISON
                    Evidence locker.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Gimme the key.
          
          He tosses her his electronic keycard...

          EXT. BLUE BAY HIGH SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT
          
          The Blue Bay High pool is illuminated in the dead of night,
          casting blue ripples over the bleachers where Elena waits
          nervously. She can't help but fiddle with the wire hidden beneath
          her shirt...
          
                              ELENA
                        (whispering)
                    Can you hear me?
          
          INT. MORRISON'S CAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          Morrison listens nervously to Elena's tinny voice coming in
          through the speaker...
          
                              ELENA (V.O.)
                    Is this thing working?
          
          The Detective shoots Kristen a concerned look.
          
                              MORRISON
                    She's gonna blow it...

          Elena adjusts the mic taped to her chest, wincing as the tape
          pulls her delicate skin.
          
                              ELENA
                    I..don't think I can do this...
          
                              MARIE (O.S.)
                    It's already done.
          
          Elena looks up guiltily. Marie is standing by the side of the
          pool. How much did she see?
          
                              MARIE
                    So?
          
          The word's stick in Elena's throat...
          
                              ELENA
                    I had no choice...
          
                              MARIE
                    Blah, blah, blah. Get over it. He's dead.
                    Now you told me you had a plan. Spit it
                    out.
          
                              ELENA
                    Jay's got cash. At the building site. I
                    saw it.
          
          Marie rolls her eyes.
          
                              MARIE
                    That's your brilliant plan? It's in a
                    safe, dumb ass. You a safecracker? Have
                    you got magic fingers, gonna pick that
                    lock? I don't think so. Next.

          Kristen winces as she listens to the girls' conversation.

                                LENA (V.O.)
                         (through the speakers)
                    We're gonna go to Jay. Tell him what we
                    did.
          
                              MARIE (V.O.)
                    Like hell we are.

          Elena walks down the bleachers, approaching a skeptical Marie.
          
                              ELENA
                    Listen to me. We go to the jail, tell him
                    we'll come clean, tell the police
                    everything, if he gives us the
                    combination. I'm still a minor, they'll
                    send me back to Juvie. Shit, I could do
                    that time standing on my head...
          
          Marie's wavering.
          
                              MARIE
                    How much money?
          
          Elena reaches Marie, puts her hands on her hips.
          
                              ELENA
                    Enough for you and me.
          
          Grinds against her. Slowly, sensually.
          
                              MARIE
                    We don't have to tell the cops anything.
                    We'll let Jay's videotape do the talking.
          
                              ELENA
                    But, we got rid of the real one...
          
                              MARIE
                    I kept a copy. Never trusted you
                    backstabbers.
          
          Elena tries to pull away, but Marie drags her back until their
          faces are inches apart.
          
                              MARIE
                    You're trembling.
          
          There's no denying it. Marie slowly draws her hand down Elena's
          face, down her neck, to her chest. So close to the wire. Finally
          places her palm over Elena's heart...
          
                              ELENA
                    Marie, I...
          
                                 MARIE
                    Ssshhhh...
          
          BOOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM...

          Morrison and Kristen listen intently in their headphones, unable
          to breath...
          
          EXT. BLUE BAY HIGH SWIMMING POOL - CONTINUOUS
          
          Elena and Marie stand there for what seems like an eternity,
          unblinking...
          B
           OOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM, BOOM BOOM...
          
          Finally Marie smiles...
          
                              MARIE
                    Alright. Let's do it...
          
          INT. COUNTY JAIL - NIGHT
          
          Jay laughs, as he sits across from Marie and Elena, separated by
          an inch of bullet proof glass. Theo stands by the door.
          
                              JAY
                    Well, well, well. Who'd have thought.
                    What a pleasant surprise. I guess you
                    guys have kissed and made up?
          
                              MARIE
                    Very funny. Did you know the diamonds
                    were fakes?
          
          Jay nods slowly.
          
                              JAY
                    Your Mom hocked them years ago. Boozed it
                    all away. You already know the end of her
                    sorry story...
          
          Marie's jaw tightens. Jay leans back.
          
                              JAY
                    So, to what do I owe the pleasure?
          
                              MARIE
                    We want money. Whatever you've got in
                    your safe at the beach condos.
          
          Jay bursts out laughing again.
          
                              JAY
                    Of course you do. Of course you do.
          
                                                          03/22/2004    79.
          
          
          
                              ELENA
                    We'll get you out of here...
          
          Jay stops laughing, leans back in to the inch thick glass.
          
                                 JAY
                    You will?
          
          Marie holds up a DIGITAL VIDEO TAPE...
          
                              JAY
                    Is that what I think it is?
          
                              MARIE
                    You give us the combination and this goes
                    in the nearest mail box, tied with a
                    pretty pink bow.
          
                              JAY
                    How do I know it's the real tape?
          
                              MARIE
                    You're gonna have to trust us.
          
                              JAY
                    I've been down that road before.
          
          Marie opens the cassette housing, ready to rip the tape apart...
          
                              MARIE
                    This is non-negotiable.
          
          Theo interjects...
          
                              THEO
                    Sir, we have no grounds for appeal. This
                    could be our only chance.
          
                              MARIE
                    What's the combination?
          
          The tortured screams of inmates echo in Jay's ears.
          
                                 JAY
                    I can't...
          
                              MARIE
                    No such word as 'can't'...
          
          A PRISON GUARD puts a massive hand on Jay's shoulder...

          Marie shakes her head.

          Marie handles the car like a Formula One driver, and with twice
          the intensity. The G-force pins Elena back against the seat.

                    Slow down!
          
          Marie steps on the gas.
          
                              ELENA
                    We're in a world of shit!
          
          Marie steps on the gas.
          
                              ELENA
                    We'll never get away with this. You know
                    that don't you?
          
          Marie steps on the gas. She ain't saying a word, and time's
          running out for Elena...

          Morrison struggles to keep up with Marie's Bullit-esque driving.
          Kristen stays focused on the one-sided conversation in her
          headphones...

          Marie's BMW screeches to a stop outside the beachfront condos, and
          Marie strides towards the construction site entrance.
          
          Elena gets out the car, feeling decidedly sick. She circuitously
          adjusts the microphone taped to her chest, then follows Marie into
          the dark, unfinished building
          
          INT. JAY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
          
          Marie enters the makeshift office like a wolf stalking her prey,
          heading straight for the safe. With a rock steady hand, she works
          the lock...CLICK...

                              ELENA (V.O.)
                        (over headphones)
                    Marie! Please, I can't do this...
          
          INT. JAY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
          
          Marie's working the safe combination like a master thief, spinning
          it nimbly between her buffed nails. CLICK...
          
                                MARIE
                    Two down.
          
          Elena stands in the makeshift office doorway, trying to coax
          something incriminating from Marie's perfect lips.
          
                              ELENA
                    I told you not to kill Chad. I'll tell it
                    to the police.
          
          Marie doesn't even look round, concentrating on the job at hand.
          Elena's reeling.

                    I'll tell 'em you made me lie about your
                    stepfather raping me, made me perjure
                    myself on the stand, went and killed
                    Chad, and now...

          revealing a STACK of CASH and Jay's HANDGUN...
          
          INT. MORRISON'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Kristen shakes her head. It's hopeless, Elena can't get Marie to
          say an incriminating word...
          
                              MORRISON
                    This has gotta end.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    It's gonna end. One way or another...
          
          INT. JAY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
          
          Marie pulls out a wad of crisp, clean bills, draws them across her
          nose like a wine connoisseur.
          
                              MARIE
                    Money. Always in style.
          
          She dances over to Elena, waves the cash in her face.
          
                              ELENA
                    Why'd you do it? Why'd Chad have to die?
          
          Marie slides up against Elena, fluttering the cash over her in the
          world's most expensive shower. Elena couldn't be less interested,
          focused on getting that confession...
          
                              ELENA
                    You killed him, Marie. You murdered him
                    in cold blood...
          
          Marie presses up against Elena, pushing her up against the
          unfinished dry wall. Kisses her passionately, finally silencing
          her for a few, brief, electric seconds. And when she pulls away
          her fingers dance down Elena's shirt until...

           he rips the microphone from Elena's chest. Stands there with the
          dangling cord in her hands, her face caught in a permanent snarl.
          The blood drains from Elena's face...

          A piercing feedback forces Kristen to throw aside the headphones.
          She looks to Morrison.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    She's been made...
          
          Morrison draws his gun.
          
                              MORRISON
                    Stay here...
          
          Kristen shakes her head resolutely.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    I got us into this...
          
          BANG! A GUNSHOT echoes in the darkness...
          
                              MORRISON
                    Just stay in the car! Please...
          
          Morrison sprints over to the building site, leaving Kristen in the
          car, alone.

          Elena stands with her hands up, an ugly bullet hole in the wall
          just beside her. Marie keeps Jay's gun trained on her as she
          unloads the cash from the safe...
          
                              MARIE
                    You stupid fucking Sherbert. You think
                    you could sell me out?

                    this...
          
          Marie takes dead aim once more...
          
                              ELENA
                    Please, don't...

          BOOM!
          
          Kristen tenses as the gunshot echoes throughout the construction
          site. She reaches across to the driver's seat, grabs the
          SHOTGUN...
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Elena scrambles across the concrete floor, desperately trying to
          make it to the relative safety of one of the support pillars. She
          sees the forensic UV light switch on the floor, reaches for it...
          
          MARIE
          
          stands in the shattered doorway, surveys the expansive, unfinished
          floor. Is about to unleash a hail of bullets when...
          
          The WORK LIGHTS flicker out, replaced by the eerie ULTRA VIOLET
          LIGHTS scattered around the unfinished floor...Bathed in the
          florescent blue glow of the lights, Elena scrambles to safety
          behind a pillar. Her shirt GLOWS, her eyes like beacons...
          
          MORRISON                                                             
          Sweeps through the second floor, meticulously checking every         
          corner, every shadow...

          Runs towards the unfinished building, looking up to the UV glow on 
          the fourth floor. She sprints for the INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR...       
          MARIE
          
          scours the bizarre darkness, hears a sound. BOOM! The orange
          muzzle flash illuminates the floor briefly as Marie shoots
          randomly. The flimsy plaster walls EXPLODE...
          
          MORRISON                                                             
          Enters the third floor from the fire escape, continues his           
          meticulous sweep of the building.

          Stands in the industrial elevator, jabbing the 4th floor button,  
          hyperventilating as more gunshots EXPLODE. She clutches Morrison's 
          shotgun to her chest, getting closer to the top floor.             
          ELENA
          
          shields herself as plaster rains down on her, unable to see
          through the cloud of dust under the UV lights, until...

          BOOM! A bullet sparks off rebar inches from her foot. She looks up
          to see the barrel of Jay's gun. Marie's face is contorted
          maniacally as she squeezes down on the trigger...                  
          MORRISON
          
          Runs up the fire escape stairs when a final deafening GUN SHOT
          rings out. Followed by SCREAMS. He rips open the fourth floor fire 
          door, tearing through the building, pushing through thick plastic
          sheeting until he finds himself under the UV glow.
          T
           hick plumes of blood, black under the UV light, stain the walls
          and floor. He sees Elena, in a fetal ball, trembling
          uncontrollably.
          
          Beside her, Marie lies dead, her chest a gaping crimson mess,
          Jay's gun still clutched tightly in her cold, dead hands.
          
          Kristen looks up at him, almost too shocked to speak.   Morrison's
          shotgun is still smoking in her hands.
          
                               KRISTEN
                     I didn't have a choice. She was gonna
                     kill Elena.
          
          Morrison steps forward, calmly, takes the gun from her.
          
                               MORRISON
                     It's gonna be okay.
          
          EXT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDINGS - LATER
          
          The new crime scene is alive with activity. Cops, reporters,
          bystanders. Morrison sips coffee as PARAMEDICS wheel Marie's
          corpse to the ambulance.
          
          One of them hands something to Morrison. A blood-splattered
          digital video tape.
          
                               PARAMEDIC
                     We found this on the body.
          
          Morrison takes it without a word...
          
                               KRISTEN (O.S.)
                     Just got off the phone with the Parole
                     board...
          
          Morrison turns around, sees Kristen approaching, still visibly
          shaken.

                    in the morning.
          
          She hesitates...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    I'm... sorry for this whole mess.
          
          Morrison considers this, picks his words carefully.
          
                              MORRISON
                    Don't be. It was my gun that fired the
                    shots, so it must've been me who pulled
                    the trigger. I'll take the credit on this
                    one. After all the Black widow crap I had
                    to put up with, I've earnt it...
          
          Kristen nods.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You did the right thing...

                    We did the right thing.
          
           risten smiles, almost, moves in, and wraps her arms around the
          Detective. He closes his eyes, savors the moment. As she pulls
          away, she hands him a card.

                    I will. I will.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Now that this is all over, maybe we can
                    have that drink soon...
          
          She leans in, kisses him sweetly on the lips. Morrison watches her
          walk away. In spite of all the shit that's gone down, he's
          probably the happiest son of a bitch in all of Blue Bay.
          
                                                        FADE TO BLACK.
          
          EXT. COUNTY JAIL - MORNING
          
          Morrison's unmarked Sedan idles outside the barbed wire fences of
          the County Jail. The gate slowly opens and guards lead a dazed Jay
          Clifford outside, wincing from the bright sunlight.

          Morrison gets out of the car, meets Jay.

                      How you holdin' up, Jay?

                      So what's next?
          
                                JAY
                      No idea. Everything's gone. Repossessed.
                      Guess there's nowhere to go but up.
          
          It's all he can do to keep from breaking down.
          
                                MORRISON

          Morrison watches sadly as Jay stumbles past him, walking to
          nowhere in particular.
          
                                MORRISON
                          (hopeful)
                      ... but up, right?
          
          No reply.
          
          The Detective heads back to his car, stops for a second, reaches
          into his pocket and pulls out Kristen's already-dog eared card. He
          can't resist. Dials the number After four rings there's no
          message. Just a BEEP.
          
                                MORRISON
                          (into phone)
                      Uh, Kristen, it's Michael again. Haven't
                      heard from you. Hope you're doing okay.
                      Everything's fine here.

                    Haven't been any questions asked that I
                    can't answer, an' no one's brought your
                    name up. So give me a call back and maybe
                    we can go for that drink...

                              RECORDED VOICE
                    BEEP. The mail box you are trying to
                    reach is full. Your message has been
                    deleted.
          
          Morrison's disconnected. Puzzled, he gets into his car.
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD - DAY
          
          Morrison gets the shock of his life when he enters the usually
          quiet police station and finds himself in the midst of utter
          pandemonium.
          
          Federal Officers are everywhere.
          
          He tries to pick his way through the crowd when he's intercepted
          by Officer Entwistle.
          
                              OFFICER ENTWISTLE
                    You better come with me, Detective.
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD - MORRISON'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Entwistle leads Morrison into his office, where Agent Dammers sits
          behind his desk.
          
                              AGENT DAMMERS
                    Detective Morrison. So good to finally
                    see you.
          
                              MORRISON
                    What the hell, Dammers?
          
                              AGENT DAMMERS
                    I should be asking you the same question.
          
          INT. BLUE BAY PD EVIDENCE LOCKER - DAY
          
          Morrison stands in the middle of the evidence locker, dumbfounded.
          Dammers watches him, his arms crossed.
          
                              MORRISON
                    It's...gone.
          
                              DAMMERS
                    That's right, Morrison. Every last bit of
                    evidence from the Black Widow case.
          
                                                               03/22/2004   89.
                              DAMMERS(CONT'D)
                    Not to mention the money you confiscated.
                    All $427,000.                                                 
                                 MORRISON
                    But how...
          
                              DAMMERS
                    I was hoping you'd be able to answer that
                    question.
          
                              MORRISON
                    What in God's name are you talking about?
                    I didn't have anything to do with it!
          
                              DAMMERS
                    Well, your key card was the last one that
                    opened this locker.
          
          Morrison's heart is beating a mile a minute.
          
                              MORRISON
                    Holy shit. Kristen...
          
          INT. DADE COUNTY PAROLE OFFICE - DAY
          
          A PRETTY RECEPTIONIST sits behind a sparse desk when the phone
          rings.
          
                              PRETTY RECEPTIONIST

          INT. BLUE BAY PD EVIDENCE LOCKER - DAY
          
          Morrison paces back and forth, on the phone, as Dammers watches,
          not saying a word...
          
                              MORRISON
                        (into phone)
                    This is Detective Morrison, Blue Bay PD.
                    I was wondering if you had a forwarding
                    number for Kristen Richards...
          
                                 PRETTY RECEPTIONIST(V.O.)
                    Who?
          
                              MORRISON
                    Kristen Richards. She's one of your
                    officers. Has cases up here in Blue Bay.
          
          INT. DADE COUNTY PAROLE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
          
          The receptionist's fingers nimbly dance across the keyboard in
          front of her.
          
                                                                       90.
          
          
          
                              PRETTY RECEPTIONIST
                    I'm sorry, Detective. There's no one here
                    by that name.
          
                              MORRISON
                    No, of course there is. I worked with her
                    personally. I...
          
                              PRETTY RECEPTIONIST
                    I have no record of a Kristen Richards
                    ever working here. Besides, Blue Bay's
                    out of our jurisdiction...
          
          INT. EVIDENCE LOCKER - CONTINUOUS
          
          Morrison struggles to control his emotions...
          
                              MORRISON
                    Oh no. No, no, no...
          
          EXT. PARADISE - DAY
          
          Soft waves lap against a pristine beach. Palm trees sway in the
          warm breeze. A steady WHIRRING is the only sound that disturbs the
          serenity. Is it a lawn mower? A leaf blower?
          
          There's a gorgeous beach house with a patio looking out onto this
          idyllic scene. The swimming pool glistens in the bright tropical
          Caribbean Sunlight.
          
          And stretched out on a recliner in the sheerest of bikinis is none
          other than Kristen Richards, soaking up rays.
          
          At her side is a PAPER SHREDDER, and between sips from a piña
          colada, she feeds document after document, each one stamped BLACK
          WIDOW EVIDENCE in red ink...
          
          Kristen looks over at Elena, equally stunning in a matching
          bikini.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    I can't believe Morrison just handed me
                    the key to the evidence locker...
          
          A broad grin stretches across her lips as Elena empties the
          contents of a velvet pouch onto a table.
          T
           he Mother-Daughter diamonds are radiant in the bright sunlight.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    These are...genuine?
          
          Elena nods.
          
                                                           03/22/2004   91.
          
          
          
                              ELENA
                    Nothin' like the real thing. Switched
                    'em for the fakes right after Marie tried
                    to pay me off...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    They're...So beautiful.
          
          Elena picks up the bigger diamond, hands it to Kristen.
          
                              ELENA
                    The mother.
          
          Kristen picks up the smaller diamond, hands it to Elena.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    The daughter.
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDINGS - DAY
          
          Morrison paces the infamous crime scene, at wit's end. Dammers
          stands off to the side, just watching him with a bemused look
          etched across his face.
          
                              MORRISON
                    She was the Black Widow. Her and that
                    little...
          
          He tries to think of an appropriate slur for Elena. Can't come up
          with anything, continues pacing frantically.
          
                              MORRISON
                    Played me like a fool.
          
          Dammers shrugs.
          
                              DAMMERS
                    Hind sight's 20-20. No need to be so hard
                    on yourself, Morrison...
                        (beat, smile)
                    That's my job.
          
                              MORRISON
                    You smug son of a bitch. It's not like
                    you knew who she was anymore than I did.
          
          Dammers nods slowly.
          
                              DAMMERS
                    That's the God's honest truth. But at
                    least I didn't give her my evidence
                    locker keycard.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   92.
                              DAMMERS(CONT'D)
                    And I didn't lie about who fired the
                    shots that killed the Clifford kid.
          
          Morrison's heart sinks. He looks like he's going to faint.
          Steadies himself, placing both hands against the wall, just as Jay
          did that fateful night seemingly a lifetime ago...
          
          EXT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDINGS - DAY
          
          Dammers leads Morrison to his awaiting car. They pass MR. Barajas
          and Cicatriz. Mr. Barajas is in his usual foul mood...
          
                              MR. BARAJAS
                    Un pinche sink hole! No lo puedo creer!
          
          Morrison stops, regards Barajas...
          
                              MORRISON
                    What did you say?
          
                               CICATRIZ
                    The foundation is sinking. The entire
                    site is a sink hole. It's completely
                    worthless.
          
                              MR. BARAJAS
                    I'm going to kill Jay Clifford...
          
                              MORRISON
                    You and me both...
          
          EXT. PARADISE - DAY
          
          Elena and Kristen lay side-by-side on loungers, soaking in the
          sun, when a voice rouses them...
          
                              JAY (O.S.)
                    Poor Detective Morrison. It's hard to do
                    that to a friend. Especially one going
                    through such a nasty divorce.
          
          They look up to see Jay, standing before them in a pair of
          colorful shorts, no shirt, sipping at a martini...
          
                              JAY
                    Told me he'd never trust another woman as
                    long as he lived. And then along came a
                    spider...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    A black widow.
          
          Jay glances at Elena, as he downs the last drops from his drink.
          
                                                         03/22/2004   93.
          
          
          
                              JAY
                                                                               
                    More like widows... Gotta say I was a
                    little taken aback when you wanted to                      
                    snuff Marie, but you know what, I'm over                   
                                                                               
                    the bitch...
          
          Elena suddenly gets to her feet.
          
                              ELENA
                    You want me to top you off?
          
                              JAY
                    That'd be fine, just fine.
          
          He hands Elena his empty glass, then kisses Kristen tenderly.
          When they break...
          
                              JAY
                    She's got a good head on her shoulders.
          
          Kristen doesn't reply. Just smiles, watches Elena over by the
          outside bar, mixing Jay's drink...
          
                              JAY
                    You two got me out of a mountain of shit,
                    I'll tell you that. Craziest Goddamn
                    scheme I've ever heard of. But hell, you
                    played it perfectly.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    My job was easy. It was Elena who had to
                    keep it all together...
          
                              ELENA (O.S.)
                    We've had some practice along the way...
          
          Jay turns around, smiles at Elena as she holds out his drink.
          
                              ELENA
                    Here you go, Mr. Clifford.
          
          Jay takes it from her appreciatively, sips at it as he sidles off
          to the swimming pool.
          
                              JAY
                    Well, all that nasty business, it's
                    behind us. Forever. From here on out,
                    it's the good life.
          
          He starts to climb the high dive. When he gets to the top, he
          looks down at Elena and Kristen, smiles.
          
                                                           03/22/2004   94.
          
          
          
                              JAY
                    You two look so good, it's difficult to
                    tell which one's the mother and which
                    one's the daughter...
          
          Kristen calls back up at him.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    That's just the roofies talking...
          
          Says it so sweetly, it takes a moment for Jay to register the
          sinister implications...
          
                              JAY
                    What did you say?
          
          His eyes are blood shot. He starts to sway atop the high dive.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Delta Chi, class of '88. Hellova party.
                    I'd never really tasted cocktails like
                    that.
          
          Jay's swaying uneasily on the high dive platform...
          
                              JAY
                    I don't...whattya talking about?
          
                               KRISTEN
                    It was like being awake though an
                    operation. I could feel everything
                    happening, but I couldn't do anything to
                    stop it...
          
                              JAY
                    Oh...shit...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You took something from me that night.
                    But you left something behind...
          
          Jay's head is spinning as he looks to Kristen, to Elena.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Your daughter...
          
          He can't quite get his mind around it. Everything's becoming
          blurry.
          
                              JAY
                    I don't remember...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   95.
          
          
          
          He looks at the martini glass, thinks he sees blue residue, before
          it slips from his fingers, falls 20 feet to the concrete below,
          shattering into a million pieces like so many fake diamonds...
          E
           lena and Kristen stand side-by-side below him.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You may not remember...
          
          A broad grin stretches across Elena's lips as she finishes...
          
                              ELENA
                    ...But you'll never forget.
          
          Jay tries to take a step forward. He stumbles. Tries in vain to
          regain his balance. It's too late. He falls. 20 feet to the
          unyielding concrete, exploding like a paper bag filled with
          vegetable soup...
          
                              ELENA
                    Nice take off. Gotta work on the landing.
          
          They stand back, watching Jay's pancaked body draining its
          precious blood into the ice blue pool...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Let's go get our money.
          
          They gather the diamonds, walk away as the pool turns crimson
          red...
          
          THE END
          
          As the credits roll....
          
          INT. OFFICE - MORNING
          
          An anonymous, luxurious office. A fat, balding, semi-conscious MAN
          lies curled up on the floor as Elena, half undressed and wearing a
          black wig, shovels cash into her oversized purse...
          
          There's a crackle on her WALKIE-TALKIE...
          
                              KRISTEN (V.O.)
                    We got problems...
          
          From outside, she can hear the wailing of SIRENS. Getting closer.
          
                              ELENA
                    Almost done here.
          
                              KRISTEN (V.O.)
                    Leave it. Come on!
          
                                                                       96.
          
          
          
          Elena gets hesitantly to her feet, slides a stack of $100s in her
          pocket for good measure.
          
                              KRISTEN (V.O.)
                    He gonna be able to make an ID?
          
          Elena glances at the Man on the floor, his puffy eyes glazed over
          like a jelly donut.
          
                              ELENA
                    Not on your life. I gave him enough
                    roofies to make an elephant forget.
          
          EXT. OFFICE - MORNING
          
          Elena gets into a waiting car outside the bank. The getaway
          driver...Kristen, of course...
          
                              ELENA
                    I can't believe we just gave up all that
                    cash.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Forget it. The Black Widow's finally got                   
                    an angle on our real prey.  
                                         
                              ELENA                                            
                    We goin' to Blue Bay?  
                                              
                              KRISTEN                                          
                    He won't know what hit him.       
                                   
          A smile crosses Elena's perfect lips...    
                                    
                              ELENA                                            
                    'bout time...        
                                                
          And the car pulls away from the curb just seconds before a fleet
          of police cars screeches to a halt in front of the bank.
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - JAY'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Jay carefully places the stacks of cash into the wall safe in his
          unfinished office.
          
                              KRISTEN (O.S.)
                    That's an awful lot of money...
          
          Jay spins round, flabbergasted that someone's watching him.
          
                              JAY
                    Who the hell...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   97.
          
          
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Not enough though. Gonna need those
                    Diamonds if you're gonna ride out this
                    disaster...
          
                              JAY
                    What? What the hell do you mean?
          
          Kristen calmly reaches into her purse, pulls out a handful of
          marbles. Throws them onto the ground, letting them roll towards
          B
          Jay...
          
           ut they stop, change direction, all coming rolling back in a
          small circle, until they come to rest in the middle of the
          concrete floor...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    The building's built on a sink hole, Jay.
                    You know it, and I know it. Gonna need to
                    think fast if you wanna keep the Cubans
                    off your back...
          
          Jay's tiny mind can't take it all in.
          
                              JAY
                    How'd you...how'd you know all this...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    It's what we do.
          
                              JAY
                    We?
          
          Elena walks seductively into the unfinished office. It's on.
          
          INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY
          
          Marie sits in the bleachers by the side of the school dive pool,
          looking at her Mother's soon-to-be-diamond ring through teary
          eyes...
          
                              MARIE
                    I just want what's mine...
          
          Elena stalks the bleachers behind her.
          
                              ELENA
                    The diamonds are your inheritance. You
                    deserve them...
          
                              MARIE
                    My fucking Step-Monster'll never give me
                    the Goddamn key...
          
                                                           03/22/2004   98.
          
          
          
          Elena jumps down the bleachers, sits down next to Marie.
          
                              ELENA
                    So you take it, one way or another...
          
          INT. CHAD'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Behind closed doors, Chad's completing yet another dubious
          transaction, handing over a bag of roofies. The buyer this
          time...Marie...
          
                              MARIE
                    You take a check?
          
                              CHAD
                    Money talks, bullshit walks. I got
                    strippers to feed...
          
          Marie fishes out the money from her purse.
          
                              MARIE
                    How'd you like to make some real cash?
          
                              CHAD
                    Chad likes the sound of that.
          
          And it's that simple...
          
          INT. TEAM CLIFFORD BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          Chad uses Jay's teeth mouldings to bite Elena, as Marie trains
          Jay's video camera on her, wailing on her in a drunken stupor.
          
                              ELENA
                    Hey, that hurt!
          
                              MARIE
                    Shut it, bitch. No pain, no gain...
          
          Elena's face is pressed against the concrete wall...
          
          INT. BLUE BAY FORENSICS LAB - NIGHT
          
          Chad sits at his video console, all alone, expertly manipulating
          the audio and video footage.
          
                              CHAD
                    We'll put you right here, and...
          
          Chad presses play. On the video screen a frightened Elena is
          huddled against the wall.
          
                                                            03/22/2004   99.
          
          
          
                              JAY (V.O.)
                    C'mon now baby, you can do it...
          
          INT. ELENA'S TRAILER - NIGHT
          
          Elena watches as Marie and Theo drive away, then turns to the
          glistening Mother Daughter diamonds. She opens a case with two
          identical GLASS REPLICAS, and replaces the diamonds...
          
          All the while, Uncle Marty SNORES his head off...
          
                              ELENA
                        (to Uncle Marty, irritated)
                    Will you knock that off? They're gone.
          
          Uncle Marty's eyes snap open.
          
          EXT. BEACH PARADISE - DAY
          
          Kristen and Marie are sunning themselves on the crystalline beach
          when someone stands before them, casting a shadow over their
          sizzling bodies.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    You're blocking our sun...
          
          Looks over her sunglasses at...Uncle Marty...Only all cleaned up,
          in a pair of Bermuda shorts that show off his milky white legs...
          He clutches a briefcase...
          
                              UNCLE MARTY
                    Ladies. Hellova job back there. Your best
                    ever if I might be so bold...
          
                              KRISTEN
                    This is our biggest score. You sure you
                    can move it?
          
                              UNCLE MARTY
                    Not a problem.
          
          Kristen nods to the briefcase in Uncle Marty's hand.
          
                              KRISTEN
                    Let's see the green...
          
          Uncle Marty lays the case down on the lounger, opens it, revealing
          stacks of cash...
          
                              UNCLE MARTY
                    Got another lead, if you're interested.
                    Was just up in Boston, surveying a
                    mansion that's just been sold.
          
                                                           03/22/2004   100.
                                 UNCLE MARTY(CONT'D)
                       Termites already eaten most of it.
                       Owner's shitting bricks. There's gotta be
                       an angle for the Black Widows...
          
          Kristen and Elena look to each other.
          
                                 KRISTEN
                       It's over. We had a good run.
          
          Uncle Marty shrugs.
          
                                 UNCLE MARTY
                       Shame. Guess all good things come to an
                       end. So, the diamonds...
          
          Elena reaches down, pulls the diamonds from the sand. Hands them
          over and is about to take the case of money when...
          
                                 UNCLE MARTY
                       How do I know these are the real thing?
          
          Elena looks to Kristen. They smile.
          
                                 ELENA
                       You're going to have to trust us...
          
          Like fuck.
          
          THE END. AGAIN.
