1      ...wiped off by ANDY SACHS, 20's, pretty but not glamorous,            1
       smart but green, hair up in a towel, brushing her teeth. We
       intercut ANDY getting ready and...

       ... we see three or four other GIRLS getting ready too.

1A     A drawer filled with about forty lipsticks slides into                1A
       frame... One of the GIRLS carefully applies shiny lip gloss
       with a brush... ANDY puts on cherry Chapstick...

1B&C   A lacy thong floats through the air... one of the GIRLS pulls        1B&C
       it up her glossy legs... A comfy cotton pair of Jockey
       bikinis is tugged out of a pile... ANDY pulls them on...

1D     A gorgeous pair of slingback heels. One of the GIRLS pulls            1D
       the shoes on while her model handsome boyfriend reclines on
       crisp white sheets, watching her.

1E     A pair of comfortable wedges... ANDY dresses while NATE,              1E
       rumpled, unshowered, wearing an old Alice in Chains t-shirt,
       watches her, reclining in mismatched bed-in-a-bag sheets...

1F&G   A series of quick cuts... ANDY eats a full breakfast -- eggs,        1F&G
       bacon, bagel... One of the GIRLS carefully counts out seven
       almonds and pours a huge cup of black coffee...

1H&I   ANDY straightens a pile of newspaper clips from the Daily            1H&I
       Northwestern with the byline ANDREA SACHS and proudly tucks
       them into her hideous college-graduation-present briefcase...
       One of the GIRLS takes Listerine breath strips, keys and a
       Gucci moneyclip and shoves everything in a tiny Fendi clutch.

       The GIRLS, looking flawless, fold their legs into taxis and
       town cars as ANDY trots down the street and into the subway.

       ANDY strides into an office building, confident. A GUARD
       stops her. Indicates she sign his clipboard. She signs in.

                  What floor is Elias-Clarke? Human

    ANDY runs, but she's moving against the pedestrian tide. We
    widen out to see ANDY, bucking the flow like a salmon going
    upstream.

    She gets to an intersection, starts to cross the street...

    ...and just misses being decked by a bike messenger.

5   EXT. ELIAS-CLARKE -- DAY                                              5

    ANDY sees a tower looming in front of her. Elias-Clarke.

    Streaming into the building are the polished GIRLS we saw in
    the opening... their heels click-clack on the concrete...

    They are the CLACKERS of Elias-Clarke. ANDY runs in.

                           CLACKER #1
                 You look awesome today. I can't wear
                 cropped pants. I look like a whale.

                           CLACKER #2
                 Oh, please. I look terrible. I almost
                 called in fat today.

    ANDY looks at them, then down at herself. If they're fat,
    what am I? Ding! Elevator opens and ANDY exits.

    ANDY sits across from SHERRY, 40's. On the wall are covers
    from the Elias-Clarke magazines -- a news magazine, a cooking
    magazine, a fitness magazine... and Runway.

    ANDY is unloading clips from her horrible briefcase.

     Sleek, elegant, hard-edged chic. Behind the reception desk is
     an elegant logo that says RUNWAY. ANDY walks over.

     refers to herself as AN-dree-a.)

     ANDY turns and sees a taller, thinner and, amazingly, more
     groomed CLACKER. This is EMILY. She looks the part of the
     sleek fashionista, but is propelled by a core of barely
     tamped down anxiety. She examines ANDY.

                  Okay, so... I was Miranda's second

                  recently got promoted so now I'm the
                  first...

     ANDY glimpses an office in front of them, seductively bright.

                  two girls after only a few weeks. We
                  need to find someone who can survive
                  here. Do you understand?

                  editor in chief of Runway. Not to
                  mention a legend. Work a year for her
                  and you can get a job at any magazine

                  Andrea, Runway is a fashion magazine.

                  interested in fashion?

     EMILY gives her a look. ANDY smiles, like she has no idea
     what EMILY could mean.

     Suddenly, EMILY'S Blackberry goes off. She gasps.

     This doesn't cause him to turn around, though it does cause a
     few other people to stare. ANDY walks away, embarrassed.

                   impossible task, it generally means
                   one of two things. One, she thinks you

       MIRANDA, looking at the envelope.

       And then we see ANDY. She stands there, quiet, calm.

       And if MIRANDA is amazed by what ANDY did, she doesn't show
       it. She opens the envelope, looks in.

                              MIRANDA
                    One copy? What are my twins supposed
                    to do with that... share?

                              ANDY
                    Actually I made two copies. And had
                    them color-copied, re-set and bound so
                    they wouldn't look like manuscripts.

       She smiles. MIRANDA nods, but still won't concede the point.

                           MIRANDA
                 Darling, there you are.

                           STEPHEN
                 It's a banner evening. Three people
                 have failed to recognize me, one
                 person called me Mr. Priestly, and now
                 the damned bartender refuses to serve
                 me.

      Everyone looks uncomfortable. STEPHEN turns to IRV.

                           STEPHEN (CONT'D)
                 Why don't you get me a drink? He's
                 gotta listen to you, right, little
                 guy?

      Everyone freezes.

      MIRANDA forces a laugh. An awful beat. And ANDY leaps in,
      quickly turns to IRV, distracting him.

                           ANDY
                 I'm sorry to bother you, but I've been
                 dying to ask you... Is it true that
                 John Cheever used to ghostwrite the
                 editor's page of Manhattan Magazine in
                 the 50's?...

      And while she chats with him, MIRANDA puts her arm around her
      husband and leads him gently away.

                           MIRANDA
                 Come on, darling, let's get something
                 to eat. I'm starved, aren't you?

      And as she walks away, MIRANDA turns. And MIRANDA mouths the
      words "Thank You" to ANDY. ANDY'S eyes go wide in disbelief.
      Then she smiles. Yes!

      ANDY walks downtown alone, thinking. Walks by a newsstand
      covered with the latest Runway... a store window filled with
      the latest fashions... a bunch of people her age drinking at
      an outdoor restaurant, looking carefree...

      ANDY looks through the clips of all her articles from
      college. And at a picture of herself at graduation,
      surrounded by her parents, her relatives, her friends.

      Her parents are beaming, exuding pride.

140   INT. RUNWAY - BULLPEN -- DAY                                          140

      The desks outside MIRANDA'S office are empty. We hold for a
      few beats.

      Then ANDY comes in, walking slowly, still unsure.

      And at that moment MIRANDA appears. They look at each other.

      MIRANDA nods, almost imperceptibly. ANDY nods back.

      And MIRANDA takes her coat off. ANDY holds out her arms to
      take the coat from her.

      But MIRANDA puts the coat on EMILY'S desk instead. Right in
      front of EMILY'S Arc de Triomphe screensaver.

      And then MIRANDA strides into her office. ANDY sits down,
      trying to grasp the magnitude of what just happened. And just
      then MIRANDA pokes her head back in.

                           MIRANDA
                 Don't forget to tell Emily.

      And we see ANDY'S face. Me?

                   Sorry I'm late. Miranda wanted some
                   scarves from Hermes and she told me
                   yesterday but I forgot and so--

                             ANDY (O.S.)
                   Emily, I have to talk to you.

                             EMILY
                   I freaked out of course, but then I
                   just called Martine at home and she
                   opened the store early, so I got them.

      EMILY juggles an Hermes bag, her purse, her cell phone,
      almost mows down an OLD LADY. She mouths "Sorry."

                             ANDY
                   Okay. Emily. When you get in, I want
                   to talk to you about something--

                   Good. Because I've got so much to deal
                   with before I go, I swear to God I
                   can't even--

      And that's when EMILY steps into the street without looking.
      The second she steps off the sidewalk--

      Blam! EMILY is hit by a taxi.

      We see her purse, her cell phone, her shopping bags, some of
      the orange Hermes boxes, and some of the scarves as they fly
      through the air.

      Lying in a hospital bed, her face with no make-up, wearing a
      dumpy hospital robe, EMILY looks like what she is...

                   Oh, please. That's a pathetic excuse.

      Just then an ORDERLY walks in with her dinner, laden with
      fattening foods -- a cream soup, bread, pasta, cheese and
      dessert.

      EMILY grabs a pudding, peels off the foil top.

                             EMILY (CONT'D)
                   What gets me about this whole thing

      She angrily finishes the last spoon of pudding, grabs a
      dinner roll, which she starts to butter.

       We see EMILY, back at her desk. The camera widens out so we
       can see... a new SECOND ASSISTANT, eager and nervous. She is
       showing EMILY a letter. 

                            EMILY
                  My God, you call this a letter? Can
                  you spell any word in the English
                  language?

       The phone rings. EMILY picks up.

                            EMILY (CONT'D)
                  Miranda Priestly's office.

                            ANDY
                  Emily, it's Andy. Don't hang up. I
                  have a favor to ask you.

       EMILY looks incredulous.

                             EMILY
                  You're joking. YOU have a favor to
                  ask of ME?

       ANDY is walking up the street, on her cell phone. 

                            ANDY
                  Thing is, I have all these clothes
                  from Paris and I don't have
                  anyplace to wear them, so I was
                  wondering... is there any way you
                  could take them off my hands? 

       Beat. EMILY realizes what ANDY is offering, but she won't let
       that show...

                              EMILY
                    Well, I don't know. It is a huge
                    imposition, but I suppose I could
                    help you out... I'll have Roy pick
                    them up this afternoon.

       And without a goodbye, EMILY hangs up. The slightest smile
       creeps across EMILY'S face, but she quickly recovers, hands
       the ASSISTANT the letter. 

                              EMILY
                    Why can't you be more like Andy?

       ANDY hangs up her phone and smiles. And suddenly she sees
       MIRANDA walk out of the building, on the phone.

                              MIRANDA
                    ...I don't understand why it's so
                    challenging to get a car when I ask
                    for one.

                              EMILY (O.S.)
                    It should be there any second.

       And at that moment the car edges into view. MIRANDA hangs up
       and strides towards it.

       And just then something catches MIRANDA'S eyes. ANDY,
       watching her. They look at each other.

       A beat.

       And then ANDY nods her head -- in thanks, in salutation, and
       in farewell...

       But MIRANDA does not react. She gets into the car.

       ANDY shakes her head. That's MIRANDA. She smiles, then turns
       and starts to walk down the street.
                                                                 108B.

      MIRANDA gets in, sits back in her seat. Through her window
      she can see ANDY, a bounce in her step, walking away...

      And MIRANDA, alone, where no one can see her, finally breaks
      into a real smile.

      ANDY walks away, smiles, shakes her head, the whole thing
      almost like a dream. And as she continues moving confidently
      in the opposite direction from MIRANDA we...
