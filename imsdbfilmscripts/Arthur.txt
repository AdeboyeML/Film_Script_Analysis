          EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT
                         
          A HOMELESS MAN, who from his tatty suit may have been a top
          broker this time last year, is picking through a bin in
          Manhattan's deserted night-time financial district.
                         
          The street starts to vibrate. A TERRIFYING GROWL approaches.
                         
          A huge black shape smashes into view - THE DARK KNIGHT'S
          BATMOBILE! Our audience wonder if they've wandered into the
          wrong movie. The Homeless Man dives for cover.
                         
          BAM! The Batmobile smashes into a row of parked cars.
                         
          We hear manic laughing from inside the car, which screeches
          and careers violently into a sign reading `WALL STREET'.
                         
          Sirens herald THREE POLICE CARS in hot pursuit.
                         
          The Batmobile roars up Wall Street, bashing against the New
          York Stock Exchange, thumping up and down the Federal Hall's
          steps and finally smashing at high speed into the rear end of
          the famous 'Charging Bull' statue. Two enormous bronze
          testicles thud onto the Batmobile's bonnet and roll away.
                         
          The cop cars screech up, surrounding the Batmobile. TWO OLDER
          COPS and A ROOKIE surround it, weapons drawn.
                         
          A HELICOPTER appears, blazing the Batmobile in white light.

           Cooool.
                         
          An older Cop flashes the rookie a dirty look, then points a
          FLASHLIGHT into a tiny window. THE BATMAN - actually drunken
          English socialite ARTHUR BACH TEMPLEMEAD in a costume -
          lowers the window and offers a handshake.

           to squeeze out the back arsehole

          Arthur wriggles awkwardly out of a rear hatch. The bronze
          bull teeters, a little scarily. He stands, wobbly. His Batman
          utility belt features a big water pistol, a firework, a hip
          flask and line of shot glasses. And, inexplicably, a big red
          stapler. The younger cop is desperately fighting the giggles.

           to get to this! I planned to just
           be your friend but then I started
           to fall for you and I thought `I
           can't marry Susan, I might fall for
           Naomi!' But I thought `No I have to
           marry Susan or I'll be poor so I
           won't fall for Naomi' But then I
           did fall for you! Because you're
           brainy and funny and gorgeous and
           too smart to do walking tours.
           You're too smart, Snart. Smart
