          OVER A BLACI: SCREEN:
          Crickets chirp in the night.
          A DOORBELL rings.
          Sheets rustle...
          A BEDSIDE LAMP is turned on.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

          NORMA LEWIS ( 31) sits up in bed. The soft glow of the lamp
           casts her in silhouette. Her husband, ARTHUR LEWIS (30), lies
          next to her.

                          NORMA
          Did you hear something?

                         ARTHUR
          The doorbell.

                         NORMA
          Are you sure that was the doorbell?
          From down below... the DOORBELL rings again.

                         ARTHUR
          Yep.
          Norma retrieves her WATCH from the bedside table.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          What time is it?

                         NORMA
          Quarter 'til five.
          Norma gets out of bed and throws on her bathrobe.
          Arthur sits up, hair sticking up in every direction. He has
          sideburns that run down the side of his face like daggers.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FOYER -- NEXT

          Norma comes down the stairs and approaches the front door.
          She looks through the PEEPHOLE.
          Through the PEEPHOLE... she glimpses a BLACK SEDAN idling in
          the street. It quickly drives off.
          Norma unlatches the DEAD BOLT and opens the door. She notices
          something at her feet.

          Someone has left a CARDBOARD BOX on the front step. It's
          dimensions are 1' x 1' x 1'
          She leans down and picks up the box, noticing that it has
          been meticulously sealed with clear tape. There are no
          markings on it whatsoever.
          Norma looks down the quiet, empty street. She quickly closes
          the door and turns inside and away from the cold air.
          Arthur arrives at the bottom of the stairs.

                         ARTHUR
          What is it?

                         NORMA
          Someone left a box.

                         ARTHUR
          Who?

                         NORMA
          I don't know. There was a car
          waiting... but they drove off.
          Norma hands the box to Arthur. He examines it.

          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          Is that one of my Christmas
          presents?
          Their young son, WALTER LEWIS ( 9), is standing at the top of
          the stairs. He is dressed in his pajamas.
          His parents just stare back at him in silence.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

          The Lewis family has now moved into the kitchen. WRAPPING
          PAPER and CHRISTMAS ORNAMENTS are scattered across the table.
          Norma is pouring COFFEE. Arthur is cutting through the tape
          that seals the box with a knife while Walter looks on
          eagerly.

                         WALTER
          Should I close my eyes?

                         ARTHUR
          Maybe... it's up to you.
          Arthur opens the lid and sees that there are FOAM PEANUTS
          inside. He digs down and retrieves a WOODEN BOX. Its
          dimensions are 8" x 8" x 8".

          The box is made of WHITE OAK with a clear varnish. Mounted on
          top is a CLEAR GLASS DOME attached to a lid with a HINGE
          MOUNT. Inside of the dome is a CYLINDRICAL METAL BUTTON.

                         NORMA
          Is there a note?
          Arthur reaches inside the box and retrieves a small WHITE
          ENVELOPE. Printed on the envelope in CALLIGRAPHY is the name:

          MRS. LEWIS

                         ARTHUR
          It's for you, Norma.
          Norma opens the envelope and removes a folded piece of white
          stationary.
          Printed in elegant calligraphy is a single sentence:

          MR. STEWARD WILL CALL UPON YOU AT 5:00 PM.

                         NORMA
          Mr. Steward will call upon you at 5

                         (TO HERSELF)
          Do I know a Mr. Steward?
          Arthur yawns.

                         ARTHUR
          I dunno. You tell us.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- LATER THAT MORNING

          Arthur is now showered and shaven, dressed for work. He and
          Walter sit at the kitchen table, waiting for Norma to deliver
          breakfast.
          The box sits on the table between them.
          Arthur opens up the newspaper.

                         INSERT SHOTS:

          RICHMOND TIMES-DISPATCH... FRIDAY, DECEMBER 17, 1976.

          What kind of car was it?

                         NORMA
          I couldn't see. It was dark and 1
          didn't have my contacts in.

                         WALTER
          Why would they just drive off?

                         NORMA
          I don't know. But the bus will be
          here if five minutes... so eat.

          EXT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FRONT WALK -- MOMENTS LATER

          Norma and Walter emerge from the house onto the front porch.
          She hands him his LUNCH BOX and a WINTER HAT. SNOW has begun
          to fall from the sky.

                         WALTER
          Last day of school and now it
          starts to snow?!

                         NORMA
          Put on your hat...
          A young girl, DANA ( 13) is waiting at the end of the
           sidewalk. She is wrapped head-to-toe in warm clothes...
          EARMUFFS and SCARF around her neck.

                         DANA

          Norma closes her eyes, taking in a breath of cold air.
          Snowflakes land in her face and hair.
          Walter sighs... looking at his watch.

                         WALTER
          Why does the bus stop have to be at
          the end of our driveway?

                         NORMA

                         (HIGH-PITCHED)
          So I can watch my little Walter get
          on his bus... safe in one piece!
          Down the street, A SCHOOL BUS begins to crest the hill...
          fast approaching...

                         WALTER
          Please. Go. Inside. You're
          embarrassing me.

                         NORMA
          My love embarrasses you?

                         WALTER
          Yes. Yes it does.
          She begins to walk down the sidewalk... taunting him as the
          bus approaches.

                         NORMA
          What if I give little Walter a
          little kiss in front of all his
          friends on the school bus?
          Dana's eyes widen. A MISCHIEVOUS GRIN emerges from behind the
          scarf that covers the lower part of her face.

                         DANA
          Do it!
          The bus is fast approaching... brakes squealing as it slows
          to a stop.

                         WALTER
          Don't come any closer!
          Norma gives him a big HUG and a KISS right as the bus doors
          open. A bunch of OLDER KIDS stare out the window... scowling
          at him.
          Walter pushes away from her and stomps up onto the bus...
          mortified. Dana follows him.

                         DANA
          Okay.
          Dana gets on the bus. BUD WALL (30s), the bus driver, smiles
          at Norma. He is an enormous giant of a man with a shaved
          head.

          He stares at her for a moment that is almost too long... then
          shuts the doors to the bus.

          Arthur sits at the table... reading the morning paper.
          The CAMERA zooms into the COMICS SECTION... revealing the
          panels of the comic strip REX MORGAN, MD. Arthur begins

          RADIO VOICE (V.0.) (CONT - D)
          The French government, in what was
          seen here as a gesture to President-
          elect Jimmy Carter, announced
          Thursday a further tightening of
          controls over the exportation of
          nuclear technology.
          The CAMERA swoops down alongside the driver's side of
          Arthur's car... moving into the SIDE VIEW MIRROR. His face
          reflected in the mirror... listening to the radio as he
          begins his southbound commute to work.

          The CAMERA pulls back from .a sign at the entrance to
          COLLEGIATE... an exclusive PRIVATE SCHOOL. Norma's STATION
          WAGON pulls into the school parking lot.

          The CAMERA tracks with Norma as makes her way through the
          CROWDED HALLWAY... filled with LOUD TEENAGERS from the age of
          9-18. Her limp. has gotten worse.
          She WINKS at someone... then turns a corner and the CAMERA
          whips around to reveal WALTER standing at his locker. He
           closes the door, revealing Dana and another friend named
          CHARLES ( 12) standing there.

                         DANA
          Why does your mom limp?

          That's none of your business.

                         CHARLES
          Dana saw her take her shoe off in
          the parking lot yesterday.

                         DANA
          There's definitely something wrong
          with her foot. It looks mangled.

                         CHARLES
          You didn't say mangled... you said
          it looked gross.
          Walter lunges at Charles and pushes him up against the

          can't afford to send him to
          Collegiate any more.
          The drop of blood has begun to flow down onto his upper lip.

                         POATES
          Like I said, I'm real sorry.

                         NORMA
          Yeah... your nose is bleeding.
          Poates reaches for his HANDKERCHIEF and puts it to his face,
          wiping off the blood. The MORNING BELL rings.

          INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

          Norma walks hurriedly down the empty hallway. Her limp has
          gotten worse as the morning grind has now begun.

          INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- SCIENCE LAB -- MOMENTS LATER

          Norma comes into her CLASSROOM... a SCIENCE LAB with SINKS
          and BUNSEN BURNERS mounted in MARBLE TOP DESKS. Kids are
          moving about... loud and rambunctious.

                         NORMA
          Okay... everyone quiet down! Take
          your seats!
          Norma moves toward a stack of METAL TRAYS on her desk. Inside
          of each tray is a BALL OF BLACK MUSH.

          Norma sets an OWL PELLET down in front of a FEMALE STUDENT

          Grey forest owls feed upon field
          mice, squirrels and small birds.
          The owl will then regurgitate the
          bones and waste matter in a ball of
          black mucous. Inside this mucous
          you will likely find the entire
          skeleton of its prey.
          Norma goes to the front of the room and lowers a SCREEN.

          The CAMERA tracks with Arthur as he moves through the crowded

          various colleagues along the way.
          All of the men at the facility are dressed the same... with
          white shirts and TIES and POCKET PROTECTOR BADGES. The place
          resembles an all-male community college for young scientists.

          Arthur eases his way into the small, crowded AUDITORIUM that
          serves as a MEDIA ROOM. A PRESS CONFERENCE is underway.
          NORM CAHILL ( 40s), the VIKING PROJECT COORDINATOR, is
           standing at the podium. Next to him is an OVERHEAD PROJECTOR
          with maps and various schematics projected from it onto a

          LARGE SCREEN.

                         REPORTER #1
          It's been five months since the
          Viking lander touched down on the
          surface of Mars. We've seen dozens
          of photographs of the rock covered
          surface... what can you now tell us
          about the tests you've been
          conducting? Is there any sign of
          life on the red planet?
          Arthur takes a seat in the back of the auditorium.

                         CAHILL
          Well... there are three separate
          tests that we've been conducting...
          Pyrolytic Release, Labeled Release
          and Gas Exchange. The first two
          tests, based on soil samples about
          22 centimeters deep, came back
          negative... and the third is...
          still pending.
          Cahill smiles. Laughter erupts from various parts of the
          auditorium.

          hydrogen, and oxygen during the
          incubation of the martian soil
          sample.

          up there?
          Laughter from the press.

                         CAHILL
          Well... there is a possibility that
          the planet abounds with chemical
          compounds produced by living
          systems. Their chemical nature,
          distribution and structural
          uniqueness could be used to argue
          the presence of microscopic living
          organisms on Mars.
          As Cahill moves on to the next question... Arthur taps the
          reporter on the shoulder.

                         ARTHUR
          It all comes down to water.
          Arthur points to an OVERHEAD SATELLITE PHOTO of Utopia
          Planitia, a raised level of martian terrain in the vicinity
          of the site where VIKING II landed.
          There are dry river-bed formations in the soil.

                         ARTHUR (CONT-D)
          If we find water beneath the
          surface... and the topographic maps
          of Utopia Planitia indicate that
          there were once rivers on the
          surface of the planet, it's
          possible that we'll eventually find
          evidence of life.

          reaching for her foot... massaging it gently. She cringes...
          clearly in intense pain.
          Charles looks back at her... noticing this. They make eye
          contact... and Charles turns back to the screen.

          Arthur now sits across from Cahill in his office. Behind him
          is a window that overlooks a huge laboratory.

          I'm sorry Arthur, but they've
          denied your application to be
          admitted into the astronaut

          The CAMERA tracks through a LARGE LABORATORY in the heart of
          one of the main buildings on the Langley campus.
          Work tables assembled with LABORATORY EQUIPMENT and MACHINERY

          Christmas present for Norma.
          Arthur retrieves a WHITE CERAMIC MOLD. The mold has an
          extrusion that is shaped like a WOMAN'S FOOT... only the end
          of the foot is round and missing its toes, save for the PINKY

          TOE.

          something wrong with it.
          The whole class goes silent. Norma begins to blush. She looks
          down at her right foot, hidden inside of a CLOSED-TOE SHOE.

          She looks back at her class and sees that their curiosity has

          They found out that the tissue in

          against her left inner thigh.

          So they have to amputate four of my
          toes. And then they had to take a
          bunch of skin from my inner thigh
          to cover the front of my foot. This
          is back in 1963... so they didn't

          Norma opens the front door.
          A man named ARLINGTON STEWARD (40) is standing there, his
          body is turned in profile. He is wearing a crisp wool suit
          and a BLACK HAT, with a BRIEFCASE in his right hand.

          My name is Arlington Steward.
          Her eyes light up, as she remembers the name and the box.
          Arlington then rotates his body... revealing the RIGHT SIDE
          of his face. Norma's eyes widen in horror at what she sees.
          Nearly all of the right side of his face from his cheekbone
          to his lower jaw has been burned away. His rear MOLARS and
          GUMS are exposed beneath the absence of tissue that is
          supposed to conceal them.
          Norma immediately feels a strange connection... a deep
          sympathy for him and the pain he must have endured.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT-D)
          I assume you received the box that
          I left on your doorstep.
          His speech has a slight impediment from the burn that extends
          to the right side of his mouth.

          Oh, yes. Yes we did.

                         ARLINGTON

          inside of the box.
          Norma smiles. He smiles back at her.

          Indeed. May I come in?

                         NORMA
          Sure.
          Norma turns and leads him back into the kitchen. She
          retrieves the button unit from the table.

                         NORMA (CONT'D)
          So what it this thing? I assume
          you're trying to sell me something?

          Well... in a way, yes. I do have an
          offer to make.

          A financial opportunity.
          Arlington gestures toward the table with his briefcase.

          May I?
          She nods. He places the briefcase down on the table.
          He takes the button unit from her and sets it down on the
          kitchen table. They both sit down.
          He then withdraws a SMALL YELLOW ENVELOPE from his suit
          jacket pocket.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          inside of this envelope is a key.
          Arlington opens the envelope and withdraws a small METAL KEY.

          This is the key that opens the
          glass dome of the button unit.
          Arlington then inserts the key into a small HORIZONTAL SLOT
          at the top edge. He turns the key, and the LID that houses
          the GLASS DOME pops lose.
          The METAL BUTTON is now exposed.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          Then, you will receive a payment of
          two-hundred thousand dollars... tax
          free.
          Arlington opens the briefcase. Inside are neatly stacked rows
          of ONE-HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.

          with crisp precision, and hands it over to her.
          He then closes the briefcase and stands up to leave.

          My name is Arlington Steward, and I
          can assure you that this is no
          joke. The offer is real, but I am
          not at liberty to disclose any more
          information than I already have.
          He withdraws a BUSINESS CARD and hands it to her.

          Good day.
          He heads down the walk toward his car.

          Walter is sitting on a bench in front of a line of shops in

          Norma walks back into the kitchen, holding the key envelope
          in one hand and the business card in the other.
          She stares at them both, then down at the box. She then
          retrieves the key from the envelope and inserts it into the
          slot, opening the glass dome.
          She stares at the button for a long moment... then closes the

          The CAMERA follows Norma and Arthur into the GRAND BALLROOM
          of the country club. There are several hundred people
          there... all dressed in black tie. A MASSIVE CHRISTMAS TREE
          sits in the center of the room, surrounded by tables.
          A PIANO PLAYER plays CHRISTMAS CAROLS up on the stage.

                         NORMA
          Jesus. All this for a rehearsal
          dinner... Deborah is so lucky.
          Remember our rehearsal dinner?

                         ARTHUR
          Yeah. Keg party in our back yard.
           Susan and Jim are standing with ARTHUR LEWIS, SR (50s) and
          BEV LEWIS ( 50s). Arthur and Norma go over to greet them.
           The CAMERA drifts over to a PLACARD that reads:

          Dana enters the family room and hands a package to Walter.

                         DANA
          Merry Christmas...
          Walter takes the package and begins to remove the wrapping
          paper.
          Inside is a COMIC BOOK. He pulls it out of the wrapping...
          and on the cover is an illustration of a DARK FIGURE walking
          upon a RED DESERT SURFACE.
          The title is: THE MAN FROM MARS
          Walter looks at the cover in awe.

                         WALTER
          Thanks Dana. My dad is gonna love
          this.

          Norma and Arthur are now seated around a table with both sets
          of parents. Bev is running her hand through Arthur's long
          hair.

          Outer space? Is someone planning on
          departing the surface of the earth?

                         ARTHUR
          Nathan!
          Arthur stands up and gives him a hug.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          It's been years. How have you been?

                         NATHAN
          I've been better... I mean, I used
          to have legs...
          The table goes silent... Susan looks as though she might
          start to cry.

                         NATHAN (CONT'D)
          Sorry... morbid humor. What's this
          talk about outer space?

                         NORMA
          Arthur has been working at Nasa.

                         JIM
          He helped design the camera that
          photographed the Mars surface.
          Arthur puts his hands on the back of Nathan's wheelchair.

                         ARTHUR
          Nathan and I are gonna go grab a

          He begins to wheel Nathan toward the bar.

                         NORMA
          Arthur made me a new prosthesis for
          my foot. Some space age formula...
          it's incredible.

          eighteen months crawlling through
          the Vietnam jungle and not one
          bullet so much as grazes my body.

          And I come home, take a few tabs of
          LSD at a Grateful Dead show and
          wrap my car around a tree.
          Arthur doesn't know how to respond.

                         NATHAN (CONT'D)
          Pretty damn sad... losing the legs
          that way, but I always thought it
          was Karmic retribution for what I
          did to Norma.

                         ARTHUR
          What'd you ever do to Norma?

                         NATHAN
          I dropped that barbell on her foot
          when we were kids. That's why she
          went to get that x-ray. If it
          wasn't for me... she'd still have
          all her toes.

                         ARTHUR
          You can't think of it that way.

                         NATHAN
          Why not? It's the truth.

                         ARTHUR
          You didn't leave the x-ray machine
          on, Dr. Stupid did.

                         NATHAN
          Yeah, but my mistake sent her to
          Dr. Stupid... so that makes me
          culpable in the eyes of Buddha.

                         ARTHUR
          You're no more culpable than the
          company that manufactured the
          barbell. Stop punishing yourself.
          Nathan smiles in appreciation and takes a long swig of Jack
          Daniels.

                         NATHAN

          Nathan nods his head across the room... where DR. EARL STUPE
          ( 50s) is seated at a table with his wife.

                          NATHAN (CONT'D)
          Dr. Earl Stupe. He's still got a
          practice over on the west end.
          Arthur looks over at him... for a moment they make brief eye
          contact... and Stupe quickly looks away.

          INT. C.C.V. -- GRAND BALLROOM -- NEXT

          Susan is now staring at Dr. Stupe. They are joined by DEBORAH
          BURNS (24), Norma's younger sister and bride-to-be.

                         SUSAN
          I wonder if he even recognizes us.

                         JIM
          I'm sure he does.

                         DEBORAH
          I can't believe they still let him
          practice medicine.

          You gotta let it go. You gotta
          learn to forgive and forget.

                         SUSAN
          I'd be willing to forgive him if he
          would've just admitted his
          negligence under oath. The bastard
          lied... said it was the x-ray
          machine that malfunctioned.
          SENATOR GRIFFITH POWELL (50s) and his son EDWARD POWELL
          ( 20s), approach. Edward is the husband-to-be.

          Well Senator! You look very spiffy

          Now that the mid-term elections are
          over... the smile lines are

          And you're married to the aspiring
          astronaut.

          That's right. There he is right

          him... and they briefly make eye contact.

          Dana and Walter come down the stairs into the BASEMENT of the
          house. RED LIGHT envelops the room. There are two long wooden
          WORK BENCHES running down the middle.
          There are a series of BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPHS hanging
          from a wire. Each one shows a different view of the surface
          of MARS.

          Is that Mars?

          the Viking?

                         WALTER
          He helped design the camera.
          Walter points to a PLASTIC PROTOTYPE MODEL of the VIKING
          LANDER mounted on a third WORK BENCH at the end of the room.
          A model of the MARS SURFACE has been re-created and painted
          with exacting detail.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          He's making the model for the
          science museum.
          Walter points to one of TWO CAMERAS mounted on the front of
          the SPIDER-SHAPED LANDING MODULE. The camera is cylindrical
          and features a VERTICAL SLOT on the front.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          They designed the camera to
          photograph in 360 degrees. It scans
          in the image one line at a time...
          and takes about five minutes to
          complete one revolution.

                         DANA
          How do they get the images back to
          earth?

                         WALTER
          Radio transmission. They figured
          out a way to interpret the scan
          lines and then print them onto
          film.

                         DANA
          How long does it take to transmit
          back to earth?

                         WALTER
          About ten hours.
          Dana looks over at the wall and sees a NEW YORK TIMES FRONT
          PAGE from September with a large image of MARS on it.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          They tested the camera in the
          parking lot at Langley last year.
          Walter points to another FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH on the wall. In
          the black & white photograph, we see a group of FIFTY NASA
          EMPLOYEES assembled in a long line in a PARKING LOT.
          Walter points to his father standing in the group.

          ARTHUR appears for a SECOND TIME in the row.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          And there he is again.
          Walter then moves his finger down toward the right side of
          the photo... ARTHUR LEWIS appears for a third time.

                         WALTER (CONT'D)
          And there he is again.
          Dana looks close at the photo.

                         DANA
          How'd he do that?

                         WALTER
          Because the camera takes five
          minutes to scan in 360 degrees, he
          waited until the camera passed over
          him then jumped ahead in the
          circle.
          The CAMERA moves in closer to the photograph... to the THIRD
          VERSION of ARTHUR LEWIS.

                         DANA
          Your dad sounds pretty clever.

                         WALTER
          My dad is more than just clever,
          Dana. My dad is the coolest man who
          ever walked the face of the earth.
          The CAMERA ZOOMS in close to Arthur's face... then tips down
          to another MAN kneeling on the pavement directly below him.
          It is ARLINGTON STEWARD... smiling at the camera. His face is
          normal... no evidence of any burn visible...

          She goes upstairs... leaving him alone with the glowing tree.
          Arthur looks down at the coffee table. The box sits there...
          taunting him. He retrieves the KEY ENVELOPE from his pocket

          Norma seems lost in her own world.

          Norma and Deborah emerge from the hair salon with the others

          The box sits on the kitchen table. She retrieves the key and
          inserts it into the slot... opening the glass dome. Arthur
          comes into the kitchen.

          Norma and Arthur move toward the front door. Norma puts her
          eye to the PEEPHOLE. Arlington's disfigured face stares back

          Arlington then opens the BRIEFCASE and shows it to them.

          Thanks... we trust your word.
          Arlington offers him a broad smile.

          He then turns to leave.

          They follow Arlington out onto the front walk as he
          approaches his car. The engine is idling... and someone else
          is behind the wheel... but through the tinted windows it is
          unclear who is driving.

          He smiles... opens the door... and steps into the passenger
          side. The driver hits the gas and the car speeds off.
          Arthur moves out into the street... watching the car go...

          Arthur comes into the kitchen and goes to the desk and grabs

          INT. DREAM -- SECOND DRAWING ROOM -- NEXT

          Inside the SECOND DRAWING ROOM... the CAMERA finds ROBERT
          BEVILACQUA and his WIFE. Their DAUGHTER is wearing a SILK

          BLINDFOLD.
          The CAMERA then drifts up and moves through the GLASS PANELS
          at the top of the room...

          The CAMERA pulls up higher... revealing the layout of a
          massive network of CORRIDORS and DRAWING ROOMS that form a
          larger box. Through the glass ceilings looking down into each
          room... FAMILIES are assembled together... trapped
          together... forever...

          EXT. MARS SURFACE -- NEXT

          The CAMERA flies over the edge of the SARTRE'S HOTEL of rooms
          and corridors to reveal the plateau of UTOPIA PLANITIA on the
          surface of mars...

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- LATER ON

          Arthur's eyes pop open... he rolls over... and Norma is
          asleep in bed next to him. They are both fully dressed in the
          clothes they were wearing in the library.

                         ARTHUR
          Norma...
          Her eyes open. She looks around... disoriented.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)
          Norma... what happened?

                         NORMA
          I don't know.
          Norma notices Walter standing in the doorway.

                         WALTER
          You came home an hour ago.

                         NORMA
          We did?
          She sits up in bed... looking at the clock radio. It is 6PM.

                         WALTER
          Neither of you said a word... you
          just walked into the house like two
          zombies. Went straight to bed.
          Arthur and Norma stare at one another, trying to make sense
          of what has just transpired.

                         NORMA
          The wedding. It starts in an hour.

          bedside table.

          EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. -- NIGHT

          A U.S. ARMY JET flies over the nation's capital. The PENTAGON
          and the WASHINGTON MONUMENT are visible below.

          INT. U.S. ARMY JET -- NEXT

           The CAMERA approaches US ARMY GENERAL NATHAN TEAGUE ( 50s),
          seated just behind the cockpit.
          In his lap is a file. He is thumbing through a series of
          photographs of the MARS SURFACE. He then arrives at a stack
          of paperwork. There is a photograph of ARTHUR LEWIS at the
          top of the stack.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- MASTER BATHROOM -- LATER ON

          Norma, now wearing her BRIDESMAID DRESS, puts a DIAMOND
          EARRING in her right lobe. She turns to the mirror and jumps
          in her skin... as the face staring back at her has no
          eyelids.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- WALTER'S BEDROOM -- NEXT

          Arthur sits on the end of Walter's bed. Walters stands in
          front of him as his father ties his NECK TIE in front of a
          standing mirror.

                         WALTER
          What's going on?

                         ARTHUR
          I don't know.

                         WALTER
          This is about the box... isn't it?

                         ARTHUR
          Yeah.

                         WALTER
          Did you push the button?

                         ARTHUR
          Your mother did.

                         WALTER
          What happens when you push the
          button?

                         WALTER
          Yes you do. You're just not telling
          me.
          Arthur finishes with his tie. He notices something on the
          floor of his son's bedroom. It is the MARS COMIC BOOK.
          He picks it up and stares at the dark figure looming on the
          cover.

                         ARTHUR
          Where did you get this?

                         WALTER
          Dana. She gave it to me.
          Arthur begins to page through the comic book.

          EXT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- ROOF TOP -- NEXT

          Arlington kneels at the edge of the MOTEL SWIMMING POOL. He
          runs his hand through the water. Steam is rising from the
          surface.
          STROBES OF WHITE LIGHT begin flicker from beneath the
          surface... as though some unseen SOURCE OF ENERGY is
          emanating from down below.
          Arlington slowly rises to his feet and turns to leave.

          EXT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- DRIVEWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arlington approaches the BLACK SEDAN idling in the car port.
          He gets inside... and Bud drives off.

          INT. SCOPE INSERT -- NIGHT

          The CAMERA looks through a TELESCOPE LENS of some sort from
          high on a ROOFTOP in downtown Richmond.
          It scans across several CARS passing down the street...
          PEDESTRIANS on the sidewalk... landing on ARLINGTON and BUD
          as they move toward the entrance of a STONE FRONT BUILDING.

          EXT. RICHMOND ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

          We see that a SNIPER, dressed in a dark suit, is perched on
          the roof of an adjacent building. He has an earpiece in his
          left ear.

          Alright... they are entering the
          building from the south entrance on
          fourteenth street.

          INT. RICHMOND GENERAL ASSEMBLY BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arlington and Bud move down the main corridor of the GENERAL
          ASSEMBLY BUILDING, approaching a bank of ELEVATORS. A
          SECURITY GUARD nods to them nervously.
          Arlington nods back.

          INT. RICHMOND GENERAL ASSEMBLY BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arlington and Bud emerge from the elevators on the THIRD
          FLOOR and move down the hall. As they pass into a RECEPTION
          AREA, the CAMERA moves toward a GLASS PARTITION with the
          VIRGINIA STATE EMBLEM etched into the glass.
          Below it is a name:

          HOUSE OF DELEGATES

          GRIFFITH POWELL - MAJORITY LEADER

           INT. GRIFFITH POWELL'S OFFICE -- RECEPTION -- NEXT

           As they approach the RECEPTION AREA... the FEMALE
          RECEPTIONIST ( 30s) stands up anxiously behind her desk.

                         RECEPTIONIST
          Excuse me... may I help you?

                         ARLINGTON
          Where is he?

          I need to see him... now.

          INT. GRIFFITH POWELL'S OFFICE -- NEXT

          The RECEPTIONIST comes into the office. Griffith Powell
          stands at the window behind his desk... smoking a cigarette.
          He is dressed in a TUXEDO with his jacket hanging next to his
          desk.

          Powell turns to face her.

                         POWELL
          Let him in.
          The Receptionist goes back out... and within moments...
          Arlington and Bud enter the office. The Receptionist closes
          the door and leaves them alone.

                         ARLINGTON
          Hello Senator.

          Call me Arlington.

                         POWELL
          Okay... Arlington.
          Bud just stares at the Senator... showing no sign of emotion.

                         ARLINGTON
          Do you have my money?

                         POWELL
          I've given you four-hundred

          you going to need?

                         ARLINGTON
          As much as it takes.
          Powell sighs out loud... irritated.

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          First the nose...
          Powell turns around and there is now BLOOD GUSHING from his
          nose...

                         ARLINGTON (CONT'D)
          Then the ears...
          BLOOD begins to ooze from both ears... as he covers his
          face... feeling the warm fluid rush from every orifice...

          Please! I've got it right here!
          Powell reaches beneath his desk and retrieves a large
          briefcase. He places it on the desk.

                         POWELL (CONT'D)
          It's all there! Two-hundred

          The WEDDING PARTY comes pouring out of the church. There is a
          massive LAWN south of the entrance. During the holidays it is
          filled with CHRISTMAS TREES for sale, and dozens of ARTS &
          CRAFTS BOOTHS assembled in rows.
          The CAMERA moves through the crowd to find Norma posing for
          photos with her fellow bridesmaids out in front of the
          square.
          ACROSS THE SQUARE... Bud Wall lurks within the rows of
          Christmas Trees. He spies Arthur and Walter mingling with his
          parents and Senator Powell, who has TWO SECRET SERVICEMEN
          standing close by.

          The CAMERA approaches the driveway of the VIRGINIA HOUSE...
          which is positioned at the south end of Forest Lawn square.
          Wedding guests are arriving in droves.
          The house is a large GOTHIC MANSION that is often rented out
          for public events... and in this case... for the lavish
          WEDDING RECEPTION of Deborah Burns and Edward Powell.

          Arthur and Norma move through the courtyard into the wedding
          reception area... which flows through several TENTS that have
          been erected with HEAT LAMPS and tables covered in WHITE
          TABLECLOTHS and FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS.

          The play tells the story of uhree
          people, condemned to hell. They are
          to remain in a second empire
          drawing room for all of eternity.

          The look into one another's eyes... Norma sees a WAITER pass

          She decided to push it when I
          wasn't around to stop her.

                         ARTHUR
          And now she's dead. Did you kill
          her?

                         ARTHUR
          Where are you taking me?
          Bevilacqua retrieves a NASA DOSSIER from the dashboard and
          hands it to Arthur.

          Yep. He's next. Him and his wife...
          they've got the box now.

          Kenneth Weller. We've got to break

          Bevilacqua swerves into the ONCOMING TRAFFIC LANE to pass a
          car in front of them. A LARGE 18-WHEELER TRUCK is barreling
          toward them.
          Bevilacqua pulls the truck back into the right lane.

          The 18 WHEELER slams on the brakes... then jack-knives to
          the left... blocking both lanes...
          One of the POLICE CRUISERS pulls off into the ditch... while
          the second CRUISER swerves and SMASHES head on into the side
          of the truck bed... sheering the top of the sedan into two
          pieces...

          he works for the CIA.
          UP AHEAD... Arthur sees FOUR MORE POLICE CRUISERS with their
          lights flashing. They have formed a ROADBLOCK.
          Bevilacqua lowers his foot onto the accelerator... refusing
          to back down.

          The WHITE TRUCK smashes through the line of POLICE CRUISERS
          as POLICE OFFICERS dive for cover.
          An officer raises his GUN and fires off several rounds toward
          the truck.
          A BULLET explodes the right front tire...
          The truck swerves and FLIPS OVER onto one side... tumbling
          over and over along the interstate in a horrific crash.
          ONCOMING CARS swerve into ditches... and the white truck
          comes sliding to a stop on the wet pavement.
          The CAMERA slowly approaches the smoking wreckage... catching
          a glimpse of Bevilacqua... his face covered in blood. Arthur
          remains hidden from sight.

          Jim Burns walks through the aftermath of the crash site.
          There are now several FIRE TRUCKS, AMBULANCES and other
          EMERGENCY VEHICLES scattered on either side of the
          interstate.
          Robert Bevilacqua's DEAD BODY is now on a stretcher. Jim
          looks down at him briefly... then turns to another OFFICER on

          They took him away in an ambulance.

          Arthur sits up in the back of the ambulance. He has a small
          scrape on his cheekbone... but otherwise appears unharmed.
          An EMS TECHNICIAN is in there with him. He hands Arthur an

          ICE PACK.

          Arthur steps out of the ambulance and sees that it is parked
          in front of a HOWARD JOHNSON HOTEL on an exit of 1-95. The
          hotel has a DINER attached to it.
          There are more than a dozen POLICE CARS parked in front,
          along with..several BLACK SEDANS and MILITARY VEHICLES.
          Arthur hears the rumble of a HELICOPTER circling the sky
          above them. Its SEARCHLIGHT sweeps through the forest.
          In front of the diner entrance... more than a DOZEN MEN
          operate VIDEO CAMERAS and STILL CAMERAS mounted on tripods,
          all pointed toward the front window of the diner.
          Teague is standing with Cahill and Reston, along with several

          In the 1940s... when NASA was
          formed, we began developing, in

          Arlington sits alone in a booth. He pivots his head around to
          face them.

                         ARLINGTON
          Please have a seat.
          Reston sits down next to his twin brother... Arthur and Norma
          sit down across from the twins.
          Arlington has now locked completely into his brother's
          spirit...
          The movement of the two men is in now in PERFECT
          SYNCHRONICITY, staggered by exactly one second... Reston
          following Arlington.
          Arlington's eyes remain closed in deep concentration...
          Arlington's lips move silently... and Reston repeats them out
          loud. Reston's demeanor is now kind... gentle... almost
          apologetic for his past behavior.

                         RESTON/ARLINGTON
          Don't be frightened by my manner of
          communication... but it is becoming
          more difficult for me to speak,
          given my body's... condition.

          Bud now has Walter laid out on the cement next the edge of
          the SWIMMING POOL at the shallow end. The boy is
          unconscious... still dressed in his suit from the wedding.
          From across the pool... Dana is squatting on the end of the
          DIVING BOARD... watching them.
          Bud then removes Walter's right shoe and sock... exposing his
          bare foot. He then retrieves a SERRATED HUNTING KNIFE... and
          cuts in the flesh from his BIG TOE across the ball of his
          foot... drawing blood.

          INT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- DINER -- NEXT

          Reston closes his eyes for a moment. When he opens them...
          tears have begun to form, as though he cannot bear the news
          that his brother is forcing him to deliver.

                         RESTON/ARLINGTON

          for redemption and salvation.

          EXT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- POOL -- NEXT

          Bud is now carrying the unconscious Walter in his arms. He
          steps into the shallow end of the heated pool... and dunks
          the boy under the surface.
          BLOOD from the cut on the bottom of his foot drains out into
          the water like red ink...

          Norma closes her eyes... the impending sense of dread
          building inside of her.

          Blood streams out from his foot into the water.

          Blood is now flowing out of Reston's left nostril. Both
          Arthur and Norma recoil in horror.

          Reston then reaches into his pocket and retrieves a PISTOL.
          He places it on the table next to the box.

          You can fire this bullet into your

          Arthur, you will then be arrested

          Arthur and Norma emerge from the diner in a state of
          delirium. A SOLDIER pulls up in Arthur's TRANS-AM. He steps
          out of the car and holds the door open.
          Teague and Cahill approach... as MEN in dark suits snap
          hundreds of photographs of the couple.
          Cahill puts his hand on Arthur's shoulder... searching for
          words.

          Arthur and Norma stand across from one another in the
          kitchen. Arthur holds the GUN in his right hand... and he
          slowly limps over to his wife and takes her into his arms.

                         ARTHUR
          Norma...

                         NORMA
          Arthur... I love you, and I'm so
          sorry... I'm so sorry that I did
          this to us...

                         ARTHUR
          I'm the one who told you to push
          the button... so don't apologize.
          He looks out through the window at his back yard... likely
          for the last time.

          I love you too... and please
          know... that I regret nothing in
          this life we've lived together.

                         NORMA
          I'll be waiting... counting the
          days until my Arthur comes to see
          me.

          INT. WELLER HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- NEXT

          Suzanne Weller smiles at her husband... reaches her finger
          out and places it on the button.
          She then presses down.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          FROM UPSTAIRS... thump... thump... their son's head banging
          against the door...

                         NORMA
          It's going to be harder for you to
          live than for me to die.
          Arthur closes his eyes... the noise is excruciating. There is
          no time to wait any longer.

                         ARTHUR
          Well then.

                         (BEAT)
          Let's get on with it.
          Arthur kisses her... then steps back... still clutching her
          hand... raises the gun... and fires off a round into her
          heart.
          Norma collapses... Arthur falls with her... breaking her fall
          with his arms as they collapse into a heap onto the linoleum
          floor.

          INT. WELLER HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- NEXT

          Suzanne looks over at her husband and lets out a deranged
          giggle. He smiles back.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Arthur looks down into his wife's eyes as the life drains
          from her body. Seconds later... Norma is dead.

          BLOOD begins to flow from the exit wound in her back across
          the linoleum. Arthur is now covered in it.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Walter crawls across the blood-soaked kitchen floor and
          reaches up to the PHONE that is mounted on the wall. He takes
          his finger and places it in the cradle... dials 911.

          INT. RICHMOND POLICE STATION -- 911 EMERGENCY -- NEXT

          The CAMERA tracks along a series of CUBICLES at the POLICE
          STATION in downtown Richmond. An OPERATOR sits at each
          cubicle... each one female.

                         OPERATOR #1
          911 emergency... how may I direct
          your call?
          The CAMERA moves in closer...

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Arthur has the phone to his ear... imprints of his wife's
          blood are smeared on the phone's receiver.

                         ARTHUR
          Yes. This is Arthur Lewis at 1560
          Monument Avenue. I've just shot my
          wife... can you please send an
          ambulance?
          The Operator begins to ask more questions... but Arthur does
          not listen. He hangs up the phone.
          The thumping from upstairs has now subsided.

                         ARTHUR (CONT'D)

          WALTER!!!
          He pulls himself to his feet and heads into the foyer.

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT

          Arthur rounds the corner at the base of the stairs...

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NEXT

          Arthur rounds the corner of the upstairs hallway... rushes
          toward the bathroom door.
          Walter's hand comes sliding out from beneath the crack in the
          door. Arthur grabs it.

                         ARTHUR

          WALTER!!!

          Walter?

                         WALTER
          I'm in the bathroom...

                         ARTHUR
          Can you see clearly?

                         WALTER
          Yeah... I can see... everything is
          bright... but I can see.

                         ARTHUR
          Everything is bright. Everything is
          bright Walter... you're gonna be
          okay, buddy.

                         WALTER
          What's going on?

                         ARTHUR
          You're gonna be okay, buddy. That's
          all that matters.

                         (BEAT)
          That's all that matters, now.
          Out of the corner of his eye, Arthur notices something at the
          top of the stairs. It is a POLICE OFFICER. He has his gun
          aimed at Arthur.

                         POLICE OFFICER

          BACK AWAY FROM THE DOOR AND PUT

          of his decision now stare him in the face with a loaded gun.

          POLICE OFFICER (CONT'D)

          I SAID BACK AWAY FROM THE DOOR AND

          PUT YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEAD!!
          Arthur obeys... and the cop rushes over and pushes him over
          onto his stomach... handcuffing his wrists together.

          INT. WELLER HOUSE -- FOYER -- NEXT

          The DOORBELL rings.
          Suzanne Weller opens the door. Arlington is standing there
          with his briefcase... smiling.

                         ARLINGTON
          Mrs. Weller... do you have the
          button unit?

          INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- LATER THAT MORNING

          A CORONER places a BLANKET over Norma's face as the house is
          sealed off by various CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATORS and other
          police.

          EXT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FRONT WALK -- MOMENTS LATER

          Arthur is now being escorted by two POLICE OFFICERS to a
          waiting CRUISER that is parked in front of the house.
          Jim Burns is standing there with the door open.

                         ARTHUR
          I'm sorry, Jim.
          He stares Arthur down as he is put into the back seat of the
          cruiser. Jim closes the door and goes around to the front of
          the car.
          Jim gets behind the wheel and starts the engine.
          Arthur looks back through the window, toward his house.
          Upstairs in the MASTER BEDROOM WINDOW... Walter is watching,
          tears streaming down his face.
          Arthur reaches up with his hands... cuffed together... and
          tries his best to wave at his son.

          curb.
          He places his hand on the glass... waving back.
