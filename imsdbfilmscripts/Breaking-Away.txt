          EXT. QUARRY OUTSKIRTS - DAY 1

          A narrow dirt road totally surrounded by thick vegetation.
          Here and there we see a huge block of stone blocking the
          road. The sun is shining but it has a hard time making it
          through the foliage. In the distance we see four guys
          walking TOWARD the CAMERA. There is a swagger to their
          walk. MIIï¿½ is singing. The others are humming along. The
          melody of the song of "0 Bury Me Not On the Lone Prairie"
          but it's a loose version.

          I HAD THREE BOOKS BUT I NEEDED FOUR

          TO GO TO HEAVEN AND REDEEM MY SOUL.
          By this time the four are in front of the CAMERA. Mike is
          handsome and well built. CYRIL is tall and skinny. MOOCHER
          is very short. DAVE, hanging back a little, is carrying a
          large trophy.

          They pass.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          The presence of the quarry is felt much stronger now. More
          and more blocks of cut stone appear. The guys are dwarfed
          by them. They have to climb over some.

                         MIKE
          I sent away for this stuff from
          Wyoming. It'll tell you everything.
          Since you don't believe me maybe
          you'll believe it when you see it.

          That's a terrible thing to say.

          The quarries are felt even more now. Walls of stone rise
          up around the guys.

          They are now standing above a huge pool of water with sheer

          Mike's car turns into a street called Fraternity Row.- Most
          of the fraternities and sororities-are located along this
          stretch. Neat lawns line the area. The houses are enormous:
          an architectural mixture of old manor house and modern motel.
          The college kids are outside on the lawns. Some are reading.
          Girls in bikinis sunbathing. Guys washing their cars. Some
          other guys passing the football around. Transistor radios

          Ahead of Mike's car we see two Guys and two Girls playing
          Frisbee. They are standing on the lawns and throwing the
          Frisbee to each other across the street. Mike's car is
          moving slowly forward when an ill-thrown Frisbee lands on
          the street. Mike sees it and speeds up. A Girl is running
          to get it but Mike gets there first and runs over it. Dave
          gets a quick look at the Girl as she stops"suddenly to keep
          from getting hit. The two college Guys run out and give'
          Mike the finger. He sees them in the rearview mirror.

          Dave is looking back at the Girl. The two Guys are
          challenging Mike, motioning to him to come back. The two
          Girls are trying to talk them out of it. Mike-is gunning
          the car.

          you ran over a samurai's Frisbee
          he had to commit suicide.
          Just as he laughs Mike shifts the car in reverse. The
          two Guys and Girls are standing in the middle of the road.
          The Guys are coming forward thinking Mike's going to stop,
          but Mike has no intention of stopping. The Girls and the
          Guys split as Mike's car roars between them. Once again
          Dave catches a fleeting glimpse of the Girl. Having
          scattered them, Mike makes a U-turn and drives away in
          the direction he came from.

          Dave leaves. Mrs. Blase sighs. She too would like a big
          family. Mr. Blase is holding the trophy and looking at it.
          Neapolitan music is heard coming from Dave's room. Mr. Blase
          has had it.

          Mrs. Blase follows him a few steps and stops. She waits...
          listening. She is apprehensive. She wants to follow and
          help Dave out but she stays behind wringing her hands.
          Mr. Blase reappears looking quite stunned. He's holding the
          trophy in one hand along his side.

          Students are everywhere and so are classroom buildings. Tall,

          Students sit on the steps outside the buildings. They are
          lying around on the grass and walking to and from classes.
          All of them have books in hand. The wind is blowing.

          He's sitting next to his bike on the grass and looking around
          at all of them. In his hands he has his Italian Phrase Book:
          the book being his admission ticket into this world. It's
          obvious he's feeling a little out of place, but he enjoys
          looking at the campus world. A campus Police Car drives by
          and Dave quickly hides his face in the book. Waits for it
          to pass and when he looks up he is struck by something.

          several cars. He follows Katherine up the hill leading to
          Fraternity Row. He overtakes her just as. she's about to
          turn into the drive leading to her sorority. But Dave is
          there on her right preventing her-from turning. She too

          athlete's foot and jock itch
          went away. I was sure I'd get
          a basketball scholarship. My

          understanding. He loves to do
          that. Be understanding when I
          fail. 'That's all right, Cyril,

          Dave is riding in his church clothes. His trousers, as
          before, are rolled up to avoid getting dirty from the chain.
          He's feeling great. It's a nice day. He's been to church.
          He hears the music of Italy in his soul. As he's crossing
          an intersection, he sees Moocher and Nancy going down the
          street. He pauses...as if wondering whether to join them.
          Decides not to. He rides away in his direction. The CAMERA
          STAYS ON Moocher and the girl. They are stopping in front
          of her house.

          Mrs. Blase is making some French fries. Mr. Blase is looking
          very neurotic. He's listening to the music filtering in from
          Dave's room.

          MR. BLASE
          I want an answer, Evelyn.
          What're we going to do with
          him?

          MRS. BLASE
          I don't know, dear. I suppose
          we could strangle him while
          he's asleep.

          MR. BLASE
          That's not funny, Evelyn.

          MRS. BLASE
          Why don't you talk to him.

          MR. BLASE
          I'm afraid to talk to him. I'm
          afraid to look at him. I'm
          afraid if I did, I'd see his
          eyes twirling like pinwheels.
          Mrs. Blase brings the fries.

          MRS. BLASE
          The only reason I'm giving you
          these French fries is because
          you promised to calm down.
          Don't expect to get them
          again.
          Mr. Blase is still annoyed by Dave's music.

          MR. BLASE
          I can't eat while that noise
          is on.
          He gets up and heads toward Dave's room. Dave appears
          dressed for riding. They cross paths. Mrs. Blase goes to
          wash the pan in the sink. Dave sees the French fries on - X
          the table. He sits down and starts eating them. The
          music stops. Mrs. Blase turns around and sees Dave eating
          the French fries. She wants to say something. Mr. Blase
          reappears and sees Dave eating his fries.

          Mrs. Blase is frightened.

          It's his heart. It's those damn
          French fries he ate.

          Mrs. Blase opens the 'fridge and starts putting all kinds of
          food into a bag: cheeses, sausage, the rest of the eggs in
          the carton...bacon. Mr. Blase looks at her.

          He's not''riding very hard. To the right of him,-in the
          fields, we see a few cows and horses. Above him, on the

          about to ride onto the highway. He looks at his watch as he
          does. We see a truck behind him making the same turn. As
          Dave gets on the highway we see a sign: BLOOMINGTON - 50
          miles. The truck follows him..

          Sweat is dripping down his chin. Pain is beginning to distort
          his face. But his legs move in the same rhythmical motion.

          Dave is now a dot on the horizon.

          As Dave goes past the sign, he quickly looks at his watch.
          He's elated. A huge grin breaks in his salt-covered face,
          and he reaches for his water bottle and sprays his head with
          it as if it were victory champagne. Ahead of him we see
          the Marlboro Man billboard.

          Mr. Blase is driving one of the "fanciest" cars off his lot.

          (NOTE: AN OLD LINCOLN OR A CADDY WOULD BE JUST FINE.)

          INT. CAR

          Mr: Blase is dressed neatly. He's wearing a jacket and & .tie
          although it's hot and he's sweating.

          Mr. Blase pulls into the parking lot and gets out. He looks
          at the shop. The NOISE of MACHINERY is HEARD from the huge
          building. The NOISE gets LOUDER as Mr. Blase walks toward
          it, trying to avoid stepping into the Limestone dust with his
          polished shoes, but the dust is everywhere.

          EXT. SHOP ENTRANCE 58-C

          Several CUTTERS are having lunch. They are eating heartily
          right outside the shop. The NOISE is EVEN LOUDER but they
          don't seem to be bothered by it. One of them looks.

                         CUTTER ONE
          Well, look who's back.
          He has to shout to be heard. The others look.

          ANGLE ON MR. BLASE
          He's glad to be back but he's also trying to keep a little
          distance as if proud of how far he had come in life. He
          smiles and waves grandly, his suit and tie sticking out in
          this surrounding.

          They all laugh and get up to greet him. All except one
          younger man who continues sitting and eating. The Cutters
          slap Mr. Blase on the back, their dusty hands leaving dusty
          imprints on his jacket.

          visiting. But if I wanted to
          come back I could pick up where
          I left off.
          The entrance to the shop draws him forward. A couple of the
          Cutters accompany him. He takes half of a sandwich from one
          of them. It's lunch hour at the shop and the old instincts
          are coming back.

                         YOUNG CUTTER
          Who's he?
          Mr. Blase looks back over his shoulder hurt by this remark.

          I . SHOP DAY
          The NOISE is now DEAFENING. Dust is everywhere and slowly
          through the dust we see men working, pausing only long enough
          to smile and wave at Mr. Blase. Mr. Blase is finishing off
          his sandwich just like the Cutter next to him who walks to
          his place leaving Mr. Blase, who has no place here, to wonder.

          I really thought I was a great

          still think so. I can't even
          bring myself to light a cigarette
          'cause I keep thinking I should-
          stay in shape. And you know what
          gets me. Living here and reading
          in the papers how some hotshot kid
          is the new star on the college team.
          Every year there'll be a new one and
          it's never going to be me. I'll
          just be Mike. Twenty-year-old Mike.
          Thirty-year-old Mike. Old mean old
          man Mike. But the college kids will
          never get old...out of shape...'cause
          new ones come every year. And they'll
          keep calling us 'cutters.' To them
          it's a dirty word but to me it'll
          just be something else I never got
          a chance to be.
          He falls silent and sticks a cigarette in his mouth. His
          genuine confession has caught everybody,. including himself,
          off guard. The guys look at him with sympathy and under-
          standing but Mike doesn't like that. He starts the car up.

          gentleman, takes the lighter from her. He doesn't know what
          to make of it. He fiddles with it and then strikes and a
          huge jet of flame shoots out. Dave-is frightened. He lets
          go of the button, but the lighter is stuck and the flame is
          still burning., He blows'on it. He shakes it. Katherine
          starts laughing. Finally, in desperation Dave pours coffee
          on the lighter and it goes out.

                         ROD
          Smart move, shorty.
          This is all Moocher needs. He hits Rod right in the tray
          Spilling the drinks all over him. Rod falls back knocking
          the table down. His friends jump up to his aid. Our guys
          are surrounded. The only opening is the cafeteria line.
          Mike is hit and falls back knocking down a tail row of plates,
          saucers, cups. Cyril is swinging the bowling ball around
          himself for protection. More rows of plates fall as the
          ball hits-them. The College Guys, led by Rod are trying to
          advance but our guys are throwing plates and maybe even food
          at them. The College Guys are throwing back what they can.
          Cyril's ball flies off and hits somebody in the stomach.
          By now its a free-for-all.

          Most of you will only spend four
          years here but to a lot of us
          Bloomington is our home and .1
          don't like the way you are behaving
          in my home. These needless
          hostilities have happened before.
          They will not happen again. If
          you feel compelled to compete with
          the kids from the town then you
          will do it in a different arena.
          I am looking at a plan to open
          our intramural program to them.
          And as a starting point, in
          consultation with Mr. Armstrong,
          we have decided to expand the
          field of this year's Little 500
          to include a team from the town.
          A loud protest is heard from everybody.

          Mike stands up. He's ready to walk away. He pauses
          suddenly... On the other side of the quarry he sees Rod
          and his group. Dave sees Katherine and without making it
          obvious to the others leans back behind a rock.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          Mike is looking at Rod. Rod sees him and just stands there.
          His friends, Katherine included, seem to be trying to get
          him to leave. But he doesn't. Mike feels the eyes of his
          gang on him. He gestures to Rod to come in the water. Mike
          runs up his rock and dives in. Rod dives off his side.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          The two of them are swimming toward each other.

          They are side-by-side. Rod is smiling. Mike takes off
          toward one end of the quarry swimming as fast as he can.
          Rod lets him go. Looks up at his friends and takes off
          after hiu. Mike is splashing clumsily but going as hard
          as he can. Rod is smooth and powerful. He catches up to
          Mike. He changes from breaststroke to backstroke. It's
          all so easy for him.

          CLOSEUP - DAVE
          He's staying out of sight of Katherine. He's feeling quite

          Rod has reached the "all of the quarry and is waiting. Mike
          reaches the wal?...a:rhausted and starts back again. Rod
          seems amused. He thc,3ght the race was over. He takes off
          after Mike imitating the way Mike is swimming. His friends
          laugh.

          Once again Rod is waiting by the wall. Mike shows up. He
          can't see the edge. He hits .t with his head and starts
          bleeding. But he pushes off and starts going back again.
          Even Rod is getting to feel a little bad.

          ON THE RACE
          Mike seems to be half-drowning. He can't see where he's
          going. He's no longer swimming in a straight line. His head
          is bleeding and he's running into the edges of the quarry.
          Hitting them with his hands. His hands are bleeding too.

          He's swimming in a total daze. Blood is dripping down his
          face. Dave is swimming toward him. Moocher and Cyril are
          behind Dave.
          Mike's arms go around Dave's neck. He's smiling a little
          through his pain. As he relaxes he lets his weight-sink
          on Dave and Dave sinks under water.

          We see one of Mr. Blase1s cars. The Homecoming Queen. A
          bunch of College Kids are pushing it into the lot.

          Mr. Blase is standing in front of the Homecoming Queen.- He's
          got his hands on the hood and is pushing. The KID who
          bought it is at the other end with his friends. They are
          pushing the other way.

          are poor, but we're honest.
          Mr. Blase is stunned.

          MR. BLASE
          What? Who're you?
          He starts to push real hard.

          He's getting very red in the face. Hess pushing for all he's
          worth. The Kids are pushing the other way. Mr. Blase
          becomes a fanatic. His veins are swelling on his neck. The
          world becomes'all blurred through his eyes, but he pushes.

          Suddenly the world starts to spin for him. He clutches his

          of willpower, he gets himself to collapse forward on top of
          the hood.

          A DOCTOR is listening to his heart with a stethoscope.
          Mr. Blase is in a coma of sorts. He's muttering something.
          It sounds very much like "Refund...no refund." The Doctor
          prepares an injection.

          It's a passport.

          They're quite cheap, you know.
          A real bargain. I eep carrying

          there'll be a new girl at the

          check she'll ask me for some
          Indentification and I'll take
          out my passport and say: Here.
          Won't that be something.
          Dave is moved by this gesture: By the spirit of yearning for
          travel that it implies and by the knowledge that she will
          probably not go anywhere.

          from Italy. They are touring
          America and so far are undefeated.

          Dave is putting a banana and an apple in the back pocket of

          We PICK UP the last rider in the field and MOVE PAST him.
          There are stragglers already: individuals and little groups,
          and then a large group. We MOVE PAST them TOWARD:

          ANGLE ON THE LEAD GROUP
          The Italians, Dave and half a dozen other riders are in the
          lead group. They are separated from the rest by about half
          a mile. Some riders in the group are eating their bananas.
          Others are drinking water. They are approaching a hill. The
          Italians shift their gears and like clockwork the rest of the
          riders do the same. The Italians start sprinting up the hill
          The others pursue. Strain is showing on everybody.

                         LONG SHOT
          We see the pack climbing the hill.

          ANGLE ON CREST OF THE HILL
          The Italians appear first.. They look back over their
          shoulders and see nobody there. They nod to each other and
          continue over the crest, shifting into a higher gear for the
          descent. Dave and three riders appear over the crest. Dave
          is in the lead. As he goes over the crest, he shifts gears
          and starts to sprint. The other riders cannot match him.

                         CUT TO:

          ANGLE ON ITALIANS
          They are bent over their frames in their descent positions.
          Their knees and elbows are tucked in and they are coasting
          down the hill.

          They are still in their descent. The hill is steep and they
          are going very fast. Suddenly, Dave, bent over and breathing
          hard appears in the FRAME. He tries to appear that he's not
          tired. He smiles.

                         DAVE
          Buon giorno. Come sta?
          The Italians look stunned. The 1ST ITALIAN is annoyed. The

          The Italians are riding hard. The effort is showing on their
          faces. Dave is behind them. He too is tired. But when the
          1st Italian looks back to see how Dave is doing Dave manages
          to smile. This seems to "psyche" the lst Italian out. He
          gestures angrily to Dave to take his turn up front. Dave is
          thrilled at the command. He moves to the front. The
          following conversations will have to be subtitled.

          hard and he's tired. The Italians behind him are likewise.
          Dave swings off to let another rider pull in front. As he
          does Dave once again smiles. He doesn't do this to fool
          them. He's just thrilled to be in their company.

          But the lst Italian is upset. He wants to drop Dave. But
          he doesn't want to kill himself doing it. He's thinking.

          ANGLE ON THE HILL 136
          The Italians are switching off as they begin another ascent.
          It's Dave's turn to take the lead. As he goes up front the
          1st Italian reaches in and pushes Dave's lever all the way
          forward. This suddenly shifts Dave into a very high gear.
          He can hardly turn the cranks. The 1st Italian smiles at him.

          around to get back in the right gear.

          He does not look happy. The CAMERA MOVES BACK and we SEE
          Dave at the front again.

          CLOSEUP - DAVE
          He's getting a little more serious. He sees a huge pothole
          in front of him. He rides right toward it and then at the
          last second he jerks his bike aside. The 1st Italian goes
          right over the pothole. He's jarred and angry. Dave looks
          back. Smiles.

                         DAVE

          The 4th Italian appreciates this little reversal. The

          ANGLE ON THE FLATS
          All five of them are continually taking turns being up front.
          They are approaching a small hill. The lst Italian points
          to the hill. Dave is too exhausted now to fake any smiles.
          The pace is as hard as it's been.

          Dave is up front.
          Behind him we see the 2ND ITALIAN taking out his pump. Dave
          pulls off to let him take the lead but as he does the
          lst Italian pulls up behind him to block his way back. The
          3RD ITALIAN sprints up front to block his way forward. Dave
          is trapped. The 3rd Italian puts on his brakes. Dave puts
          on his to avoid running into him. As his speed slows down
          the 2nd Italian sticks his pump into Dave's rear wheel. Dave
          sees all this. In the split second that it takes, he sees
          it all. His wheel collapses and Dave tumbles off the road
          falling down the steep grade. The Italians ride off. The
          4th Italian slows down a little to look at Dave. He seems
          genuinely sorry about what happened but he too continues.
          He shouts after his teammates. He's a little angry.

          The tour Italians are sprinting toward the finish line. A
          large "FINISH" sign flutters in the breeze. The 4th Italian
          wins and as he does he turns and fives the "Italian finger"
          to his three buddies. He's still angry at them. Cyril,
          Mike and Moocher look for Dave. The crowd is cheering.

          EXT. ROAD - DAY 140-A

          All the guys are riding in silence. Dave is crushed by his
          shattered Italian dream. Mendelsohn's Italian Symphony is
          playing: the second movement. They drive past the finish
          line of the race. The big cloth sign "FINISH" is still up
          fluttering in the wind. A man is taking it down. Everybody
          else is gone. Dave looks on heartbroken.

          it's Santa Maria. Ah, 'Santa Maria.'

          is very short. They are walking out of step. All the other

          catching up. They are coming around the curve. Moocher runs
          up to Mike, pushes him away and gets on the bike. His
          intentions are great, but his legs are short. He can't sit
          in the saddle and reach the pedals. So he stands and rides

          still playing as he catches up to them and pulls up behind
          Rod who's riding on the inside. They are going around the
          curve. Rod drifts out a bit and that's all the room that
          Dave needs. He takes the inside edge as they come around
          for the final stretch. All three of them stand up and begin
          their final sprint. It looks dead even as they're
          approaching the finish line. A man is waving the checkered
          flag. Then, with about forty yards to go, Dave suddenly
