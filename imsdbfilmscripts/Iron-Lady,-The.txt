INT. SHOP. NR CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAWN.

The HUM of a large refrigerator just audible over the
sound of Indian music -
MARGARET, briefly glimpsed pondering cartons of milk.
The electronic PEEP of the cash til.
A man on a mobile phone pushes past MARGARET, who takes
her place second in the queue.
The female shopkeeper piles newspapers on the counter in
front of MARGARET. Distracted by images of the bombed
hotel on the TV, she hesitates for beat.

                        MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER
          One forty-nine please.

                        MARGARET
          How much is the milk?

                        MAN BEHIND THE COUNTER
          Forty-nine pence.
               (taking the change)
          Thank you.
MARGARET turns to leave, jostled by a tall young man
wired into an ipod.

EXT. STREET. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAWN.

MARGARET heads down the busy street, shopping bag in
hand.


INT. KITCHEN. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.
MARGARET sits at breakfast with her husband DENIS,
sipping tea. DENIS butters his toast. MARGARET shakes her
head.

                        MARGARET
          Too much. Much too much butter.

                        DENIS
          I like butter.
                        MARGARET
          Milk's gone up.

                                                                         2

            MARGARET reaches for a jug, pouring milk into it, sliding
            it down on a table.
                                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      49p a pint.
                                    DENIS
                      Good grief! We'll have to
                      economise. I suppose we could
                      always sell the car.
                           (chuckles)
                      Or take in paying guests!
            He scoops up the newspaper and glances towards the door -
                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      Watch out. She's on the prowl.
            MARGARET looks beyond DENIS to a a sense of growing
            commotion. A concerned POLICE GUARD coming up the stairs
            meeting JUNE [early 60's] MARGARET's carer, along a
            distant corridor, steady on the approach.
                                    MARGARET
                           (to DENIS)
                      Eat your egg.
            JUNE smiles with visible relief on seeing MARGARET, now
            sitting tapping open her egg.
                                    JUNE
                      Goodness! There you are.
            JUNE's look of quiet concern.
                                     MARGARET
                      Yes.
            MARGARET eats her egg.
                                     MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      Here we are.
            But for JUNE, she is entirely alone.


            INT. CORRIDOR CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY.

            WHISPERING-

                                    JUNE
                      I don't understand how it
                      happened, how could she possibly
                      have got out? It's very very
                      important -

            MARGARET looks out of the kitchen. Her POV down the
            corridor of JUNE and the POLICEMAN and a CLEANER.

                                                                         3

                                    JUNE (CONT'D)
                      Please just make it really clear.
                      Who's on after you?

                                       POLICE GUARD
                      Dixon.

            MARGARET slips away.


            INT.HALL. CHESTER SQUARE. DAY.

            MARGARET hurries through the hall.


            INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.DAY.

            A wide cupboard-

            MARGARET's eyes move back along the rail in front of her,
            her fingers touch hanger after hanger of brown tweed and
            grey twill.

            JUNE goes over to the curtains, pulling them back,
            letting in the sunlight-

                                    JUNE
                      Beautiful day. Oh, you've made a
                      start. Carol's coming soon, I'll
                      get some bags. Anything you want
                      to go to Mark, I'll bring up a
                      suitcase for it.

            The smell of smoke lingering. Suddenly DENIS' hand
            reaches across, wavering between jackets of brown tweed
            and grey twill-

            He reaches for a suit.

                                    MARGARET
                      No no no no. The grey.

                                       DENIS (O.S)
                      You sure?

            The swipe of a clothes brush, briefly seen, drawn across
            one sleeve-

                                       MARGARET
                      Yes.

            Distant footsteps-

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      ...Definitely the grey.

            JUNE returns, oblivious-

                                                                         4

                                    DENIS (O.S)
                      Righty ho. Boss knows best.

            JUNE spies the newspaper, sees the photos of twisted
            carnage on the front page.

                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      Don't let her take my paper away.

            JUNE reaches one hand out to scoop it up in passing-

                                    MARGARET
                      Oh, I haven't had a chance to look
                      at that yet, dear.

                                    JUNE
                      Sorry.

            JUNE hesitates, leaves the newspaper resting on the bed
            as she heads off with the suit on a hanger.

                                    DENIS
                      Atta-girl.

            DENIS smiles as he stands in the bathroom doorway,
            soaping his face with shaving cream-

            He hums to himself as he resumes shaving until-

                                    DENIS (O.S) (CONT'D)
                      Damn.

            MARGARET looks up, DENIS has nicked his chin-

                                    MARGARET
                      Blot it...Blot it..

            She turns, sees JUNE, through the ajar door, standing in
            the corridor, looking back at her

                                    JUNE
                      Sorry ?


            INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.

            A comfortable drawing room, filled with the photographs
            and memorabilia of a former political life.

            MARGARET stands by the window, half a dozen of DENIS'
            ties in her hand. Pulling back the net curtain, MARGARET
            peers out-

            Two POLICEMAN stand down below next to a Police BMW car.
            They are lost in conversation, pointing to the door,
            clearly concerned.

                                                                         5

            One POLICE MAN nods to the other, a sense of the changing
            of the guard as he drives off in the BMW.

            SUDDENLY from behind-

                                    DENIS
                      Now look what you've done. Are
                      they to keep the loonies out or
                      you in?

            MARGARET eyes DENIS, looking at her with wry smile -

                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      I'll be off then.

                                    MARGARET
                      Wear your scarf. There's a chill
                      out there.

            Suddenly looming over her and grinning down as if at the
            top of a tunnel SUSIE, MARGARET's personal secretary
            carrying a cardboard box.

                                    SUSIE
                      Good morning Lady Thatcher. Are
                      you alright ?
                           (concerned)
                      How are you feeling ?

                                    MARGARET
                      I'm fine, thank you Susie.

                                    SUSIE
                      I've just been reading about the
                      bombings.

                                    MARGARET
                      Yes. Frightful.

            SUSIE's mobile goes off.    She fumbles in her bag to
            switch it off.

                                       SUSIE
                      Sorry.

                      These are the books for you to
                      sign. I brought as many as I could
                      find. Shall we go through your
                      appointments?

            MARGARET looks at her still nonplussed.

                                    SUSIE (CONT'D)
                      We said we'd go through them

                       The invitation has come from
                       Downing Street for the unveiling
                       of your portrait. I'll put it on
                       the mantelpiece, and there's an
                       invitation from Lord Armstrong for
                       lunch on the first Friday of next
                       month.

            The murmur of SUSIE's voice, a kind of white noise-

                       I said no because you've got a
                       concert that afternoon but if
                       you'd like to..?

            SILENCE-

                       What are they playing?

            SUSIE looks at her momentarily at a loss then scrabbles
            back through the diary-

                                     SUSIE
                       I think they said Rogers and

            An orchestra in full flight-

            MARGARET's gaze, seeing DENIS just visible in the street
            below. He looks up, smiles,

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      He hasn't got his scarf on.

            MARGARET throws DENIS a half wave. In return, he twirls
            his umbrella and does a couple of steps of a Chaplin walk
            for her benefit before passing the Postman who is
            shuffling through his letters as he approaches the front
            step, below.

            SUSIE looks on with quiet concern.

            MARGARET' is at her desk signing a stack of her memoirs,
            The Downing Street Years.

            MARGARET opens one, reaching for a pen. The curve of inky
            handwriting as she begins to sign them, Margaret
            Thatcher.

            Close on the swoop of the pen. Without missing a beat,
            she writes the name Margaret Roberts...

            The insistent blare of an air raid siren from another
            time cuts through -

            INT. BACK PARLOUR. SHOP. GRANTHAM. 1943. DUSK.

            The rumble of an approaching air raid overhead-

            The STEADY SHAKE of the table legs all around pulls out
            to reveal-

            BEATRICE ROBERTS [early 50's] austere, crouched next to
            MARGARET under a wide kitchen table along with ALFRED
            ROBERTS [early/mid 50's] a cumbersome man and MURIEL
            ROBERTS [21 yrs]. The sound of an air-raid siren.

                      Did someone cover the butter?

                       milk then what is the world coming
                       to. Really Carol, please don't
                       fuss about it. You've always been
                       like this, fuss fuss fuss. You
                       must find something better to do
                       with your time. It's most
                       unattractive in a woman. When I
                       was your age the last thing I
                       wanted to do was fuss around my

            The MURMUR of conversation all around-


            INT. DINING ROOM. HOUSE. DARTFORD. 1949. EVENING.

            Pudding is on the go and Margaret is warming to her
            theme.

                                    MARGARET
                      What I do think is that a man
                      should be encouraged to stand on
                      his own two feet. Yes we help
                      people of course we help people.
                      But for those that can do, they
                      must just get up and do. And if
                      something's wrong, they shouldn't
                      just whine about it, they should
                      get in there and DO something
                      about it, change things.

            The female guests exchange glances. A half-chuckle from
            someone.

                                    PORTLY HOST
                      With all due respect, Miss
                      Roberts, what may have served in
                      Grantham-

                                    MARGARET
                      Can serve very well for the people
                      of Dartford too.

                                    MALE GUEST
                      Really?

            A general sense of quiet incredulity.

                                    MARGARET
                      I know much more than those who
                      have never lived on a limited
                      income. Just like the man or woman
                      on the street, when I am short one
                      week, I have to make economies the
                      next.

                                    GREY SUITED MAN
                      Nothing like a slice of fiscal
                      responsibility.

                                                                        22

                                    MARGARET
                      A man might call it fiscal
                      responsibility, a woman might call
                      it good housekeeping.

                                    MALE GUEST
                      I'm not sure a home economics
                      lesson is quite what the Dartford
                      constituents need. They see
                      industry being nationalized, the
                      unions on the up, the pound on the
                      slide...whoever can sort that lot
                      out - he's my man.

                                     MARGARET
                      Or woman?

            Denis lets out a spontaneous guffaw as the host and
            hostess exchange looks. He signals `Get them out of
            here'. The men rise.

                                    HOSTESS
                      Ladies shall we ?

                                    PORTLY HOST
                      Miss Roberts, do join the ladies.

            The ladies scurry to the sitting room. Margaret is the
            last to leave.

                      Well. That's told us!

            The men laugh raucously. She turns to the ladies who are
            regrouping at the fireplace and regarding her with
            suspicion.

            EVENING.

            The aftermath of the muted dinner party-

            MARGARET at the helm, a small whisky just visible nestled
            next to her wine glass. She is flushed and nicely mellow
            surrounded by mainly MALE GUESTS-

                                    MICHAEL
                      So, Margaret, how would you have
                      dealt with this if you'd been
                      Prime Minister?

                                                                        23

            MARGARET looks at him, her flicker of bemusement.

            ...slowly registering across the faces of her FRIENDS and
            COLLEAGUES including CAROL.

                                     MARGARET
                        Where?

                                      CAROL
                        The bombings, mummy. Today?

            MARGARET still lost

                                      CAROL (CONT'D)
                        We were just talking about them?

            MARGARET deflects, reaching for her glass, it trembles
            unsteady in her grasp.

                                      MARGARET
                        No, uhm, yes - we have always
                        lived alongside evil. But it has
                        never been so patient, so avid for
                        carnage, so eager to carry
                        innocents with it into oblivion.

                                      MARGARET
                        Western civilization must root out
                        this evil, wherever it hides, or
                        she risks defeat at the hands of
                        global terror in a nuclear age.

            Appreciative murmur of agreements amongst the listening

                        The Prime Minister gave a very
                        good statement I thought.

            NIGHT.

            MARGARET says final farewells to a guest. He walks away
            as another couple approach.

                                      MARGARET
                        You don't mind if I sit down...

                                                                        24

            Sitting down on a nearby chair, MARGARET looks with
            feigned recollection at the FEMALE GUEST as she sinks
            down on the ground in front of her, gripping MARGARET's
            hand.

                                    FEMALE GUEST
                      I heard you speak at conference in
                      1984 in Brighton just after the
                      IRA bombed the Grand Hotel. You
                      were remarkable. I hope you
                      appreciate what an inspiration you
                      have been for women like myself.

            MARGARET hesitates, smiles, nods to herself, considering-

                                    MARGARET
                      It used to be about trying to do
                      something. Now its about trying to
                      be someone.

            The FEMALE GUEST nods and scrambled to her feet, clearly
            concerned, shooting a look to her HUSBAND standing beside
            her, waiting to depart.

                                    FEMALE GUEST
                      Well anyway, I...thank you.

                                    MARGARET
                      Good night to you.

            MARGARET sits alone. In the background, the chatter of
            Carol saying final farewells.

                                    CAROL (O.S.)

                      OK...hold on to me...that's right.

            MARGARET struggles with the catch on her pearls

                       quite -

            CAROL hurries to help her, MARGARET quietly concedes.
            Fingers fumble to unclasp the pearls-

            CAROL drops the pearls into a jewelry box, close to
            MARGARET, staring back at their reflections.

                       You've got an eyelash.

            CAROL catches the stray eyelash on the tip of her finger,
            holding it close to MARGARET, with a smile-

                       Make a wish.

            MARGARET, closes her eyes until-

            MARGARET blows. She opens them smiles. CAROL smiles.

            INT. TOWN HALL 1950. NIGHT.

            MARGARET sits on the edge of a trestle table, scrunching
            a rosette in her hand. The Town Hall is empty save for a
            couple of Volunteers stacking chairs and sweeping the
            floor. The litter of election night is everywhere.

                                    RADIO ANNOUNCER
                      Twenty-four-year-old Miss Margaret
                      Roberts lost her bid to win a seat
                      in Parliament today, but she has
                      put new life into the Dartford
                      Conservative Association. Winning
                      candidate Mr Dodds had better
                      watch out, this bright young woman
                      is on his tail.

            DENIS appears in the doorway, carrying fish and chips. He
            slides them down in front of her.

                                     DENIS
                      Eat!

            MARGARET almost smiles. Then sinks once more into misery.

                      Hang on...Hang on...Hang on...

            DENIS fishes in his pocket pulling out a hip flask. An
            impromptu supper made. MARGARET takes in the aftermath of
            rosettes, the whiff of defeat all around.

                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      You shaved thousands off their

                      Not splendidly enough.

            MARGARET eyes him, mid chip-

                      No one is saying you don't need a
                      safe seat. You deserve a safe
                      seat. But it does not come unless
                      you learn to play the game a

                      What game?

            She is fuming but he regroups with a big breath.

                      - in their eyes. A single grocer's
                      daughter. But if you were to
                      become the wife of a moderately
                      successful businessman-

            For the first time, we see MARGARET taken by surprise.

                      Well ?

            She is frozen. Then she begins to smile and nod her head
            and smile.

                                    MARGARET
                      Yes. Yes!

            He leans over and kisses her, long and passionately until-

                      who stays silent and pretty on the
                      arm of her husband. Or remote and
                      alone in the kitchen doing the
                      washing up for that matter.

            He leans forward to kiss her again but she pulls away a
            little.

                                    MARGARET
                      No - one's life must matter,
                      Denis. Beyond the cooking and the
                      cleaning and the children, one's
                      life must mean more than that - I
                      cannot die washing up a tea cup.

            He sits up and stares as if seeing her for the first
            time.

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)

                      understand.

                                    DENIS
                      That's why I want to marry you, my
                      dear.

            She kisses him.

            A CHINK of a TEACUP-

            They pull apart. FLUSHED and GIGGLING on seeing-

            A LONE WOMAN enters the hall, cleaning up the last of the
            tea cups, and generally tidying.

            MARGARET smiles her joy at him as `SHALL WE DANCE'
            swells.

            And now she's in his arms as they dance, swirling through
            the election debris, eyes only for each other.

            MARGARET now on all fours, struggling with her glasses. A

            momentarily catching her eye until-

            A DVD with hand-written scrawl that we can't quite read.

            MARGARET flicks open the box, struggling to get the DVD
            out.

            Fiddling with the DVD player, MARGARET puts in the disc

            DENIS approaches the camera laughing and appears to take
            hold of it. MARGARET is seen sitting on a wobbly camping
            stool, hardly dressed for the beach, surrounded by papers
            weighed held down by pebbles. She merrily returns to her
            work.

            DENIS sits behind her on the sofa in a dressing gown,
            watching the footage. She sips her whisky.

                      change it.

            She freezes the image of him turning to camera, laughing.

            Without breaking step, suddenly, he's in the room,
            running past Margaret, still cheering and whooping.

            MARGARET's hand, just skimming MARK's golden curls. As he
            moves on, MARGARET's curiosity caught following him out

            phalanx of MINISTERS sitting beside and around her, BLUE
            and GREY SUITED MEN, almost at first glance
            indistinguishable, with PRIME MINISTER EDWARD HEATH (late
            50's), neat, effete, slumped rather forlornly on the
            bench.

            MARGARET, her speech and papers in her hand is fighting
            hard but the OPPOSITION LABOUR BENCHES scent blood - and
            they literally bray, getting to their feet and shaking
            their order papers in her face.

            The SPEAKER tries to control the chamber but his VOICE is
            almost lost in the bedlam.

                                                                        34

                                    SPEAKER
                      The Right Honourable Lady the
                      Secretary of State for Education.

                                    MARGARET
                      The right honourable gentleman
                      knows that we have no choice but
                      to shut down the schools!

            Cries of `Shame!' From the opposition. The chamber
            reduced to a bear-pit. HEATH glum and offering no help to
            MARGARET whose voice becomes increasingly shrill.

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      Because his union paymasters have
                      called a strike deliberately to
                      cripple our economy. Teachers
                      cannot teach when there is no
                      heating, no lighting in their
                      classrooms. And I ask the
                      honourable gentleman, whose fault
                      is that?

                                    SHADOW MINISTER
                      Methinks the Right Honourable lady
                      doth screech to much. If she wants
                      us to take her seriously she must
                      learn to calm down!

            The OPPOSITION BENCHES love that, rocking in their seats,
            laughing... falsely of course.

            But MARGARET is aware that there are many MEN behind her,
            on the government benches, who are also sniggering in
            agreement.

                                    MARGARET
                      If the right honorable gentleman
                      could perhaps attend more closely
                      to WHAT I am saying, rather than
                      HOW I am saying it, he may receive
                      a valuable education in spite of
                      himself!

            Her opposite number Shadow Minister looks almost smug:
            smiling, pointing a finger at her.

                                    SHADOW MINISTER
                      Why has this Conservative
                      government failed? Why has it
                      forced so many in the public
                      sector into taking strike action
                      to save their own jobs?

            It brings the OPPOSITION benches to their feet, shouting,
            applauding, stamping...

                                                                        35

            EXT. WESTMINSTER STREET. 1974. DAY

            MARGARET walking with AIREY NEAVE towards Downing Street
            for a Cabinet Meeting.

            All around, heaped high on either side as far as the eye
            can see are bags of rubbish. But not neatly stacked, just
            thrown there, many of them rotting down, spilling their
            filthy, putrid contents onto the street.

                                    SHADOW MINISTER VO
                      Minister, the breakdown of
                      essential public services -
                      transport, electricity, sanitation
                      is not the fault of the trades
                      unions but of this Conservative
                      government in which you so
                      shamefully serve!

            The stench is awful - and MARGARET'S expression reflects
            that as she picks her way through.


            INT. CABINET ROOM. DOWNING STREET. 1974. NIGHT.

            The ranks of BESPECTACLED GREY-SUITED MINISTERS   at the
            Cabinet table, including GEOFFREY HOWE.

                                    HEATH
                      So these power cuts will continue
                      unless we can reach a compromise.

            EDWARD HEATH is in mid-flow.

                                    HEATH (CONT'D)
                      The miners are asking for a 35%
                      increase in wages. Obviously we
                      can't go anywhere near that. The
                      unions are not our enemies and
                      never have been. We want - and
                      have always wanted - the broadest
                      consensus...

            The MINISTERS nod. MARGARET determinedly edges a little
            forward so that she is in equal line with the other MALE
            MINISTERS.

                                    HEATH (CONT'D)
                      I'm sure we are all in agreement
                      that we must do nothing for the
                      moment that will further inflame
                      the current situation.

                                    MINISTER 1
                      Hear hear, Prime Minister.

                                                                        36

            MARGARET leans forward for a better view, trying to catch
            his eye. HEATH wavers, mid-speech. All turn to look at
            MARGARET - who sits unwavering. HEATH resumes.

                                    HEATH
                      - the fact of the matter is, it's
                      absolutely crucial that we are
                      seen by the public to be acting as
                      conciliators and not aggressors.
                           (Finally

                                    MARGARET
                      Yes...

            All eyes TURN on her again, hearing the reservation in
            her voice.

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      Prime Minister, with the Miners'
                      leader calling today for the army
                      to mutiny in support of the
                      strikes, this seems the wrong time
                      for conciliation.

            SUDDENLY ALL THE LIGHTS GO OUT.

            A lot of `bloody hell' `oh for god's sake'.

                                    HEATH
                      Be patient. They'll come back on
                      in a minute.

            A beam of light cuts through, just for an instant picking
            out HEATH'S moon-like face surrounded by darkness.
            MARGARET holds the small torch.

                                    HEATH (CONT'D)
                      Thank you, Margaret.

            A snigger, then the lights flicker back on.

                                    HEATH (CONT'D)
                      Your thoughts are duly noted.

            MARGARET turns of the torch and clicks her handbag shut
            in satisfaction. Heath's words echo in her head,
            `compromise...compromise...compromise...' An inward look
            as she's caught by a memory.

                      He meant it as an insult but to me
                      it's a compliment. That's why he
                      couldn't beat us, and that's why
                      Hitler can't beat us.

            YOUNG MARGARET watches her father, face aglow.

                      to fulfil their own potential,
                      especially the young. There's no

                      equal, we're not all the same,
                      never have been, never will be. We

            ...CAROL and MARGARET seated, driving steadily along a
            deserted street. MARGARET thoughtful as the radio plays.

                      It's 1974 and you'd think it was
                      WWII. Blackouts, no petrol. It's a
                      mess. Heath should resign now and
                      make way for someone who's not
                      afraid to tackle the unions.

            CAROL'S nervous prattle begins to break through.

                      I swear, it's all gone completely
                      out of my head. My driving
                      instructor thinks I should pass
                      but I feel as if I've hardly had
                      any lessons. Ridiculous isn't it?
                      Maybe third time lucky.
                                    MARGARET
                      Right. The only thing you should
                      remember is that everyone else is
                      either reckless or inept. And
                      often both.

            goes round and round the square, almost balletic.

            She is watching herself intently, as are REECE and AIREY
            NEAVE. They are polar opposites, REECE flamboyant to
            NEAVE's bluff.

            She sounds very plummy, like a Conservative party wife
            from the shires. And she wears a hat.

                                    MARGARET ON TELEVISION
                      We in Great Britain and in Europe
                      are formed mainly by our history.
                      They on the other hand are formed
                      by their philosophy. Not by what
                      has been, but by what can be. Oh,
                      we have a great deal that we can

            MARGARET is trapped in the moment - but the two men
            exchange a glance. NEAVE freezes the picture. MARGARET
            smiles uneasily, like someone expecting a compliment.
            REECE considers her, long and hard. It is a little
            unsettling until-
                                    REECE
                      Well er...For a start, that hat
                      has got to go. And the pearls. In
                      fact I think all hats may have to
                      go. You look and sound like a
                      privileged Conservative wife and
                      we've already got her vote. You've
                      got lovely hair but we need to do

                      It's all very well to talk about
                      changing my voice, Mr Reece, but
                      for some of my colleagues to
                      imagine me as their leader would
                      be like imagining, I don't know,
                      being led into battle by their
                      chambermaid. It's my background,
                      and my sex. No matter how I've
                      tried, and I have tried, to fit
                      in, I will never be truly one of
                      them.
            Both REECE and NEAVE are aware that she has spoken very
            nakedly - and is thus extremely vulnerable.
                                    REECE
                      If I may say so - I think that's
                      your trump card. You're flying in
                      the face of everything the Tories
                      have been thus far. It's really
                      very exciting. One simply has to
                      maximise your appeal, bring out
                      all your qualities and make you
                      look, and sound, like the leader
                      that you could be.

                      this party, lead it. If you want
                      to change the country, lead it.
                      What we're talking about here
                      today is surface. What's crucial

                      the sides...Because this isn't
                      really about the voice, it's about

            REECE and NEAVE are watching and monitoring the

            surprised, stabbing out his cigarette, turning quickly

                        The Trade Union Movement was
                        founded to protect workers. Now it
                        persecutes them. It stops them
                        from working. It is killing jobs
                        and it is bringing this country to
                        its knees. I say enough. It's time
                        to get up. It's time to go to
                        work. It's time to put the Great

            A distinguished consulting room-

            She looks at him as if he really should know this about
            her. The DOCTOR notes this down.

                      We just want to keep abreast of

            MARGARET nods. Looking through the bannisters, her eyes
            fall on-
            A golf ball running along the floor. MARGARET considers,

            Her cabinet are all around her dining room table. There
            is no seat for her. She moves round the table.

                                    MINISTER 1
                      We will never win another election

            Close on a minister's face in the dim light.

                      If you were to stand, I of course
                      would vote for you Prime Minister
                      -

            She is at her desk in the PRESENT in Chester Square as
            one minister after another in interchangeable glasses
            slide into the chair in front of her.

                                    MINISTER 2
                      - of course would vote for you
                      Prime Minister but I don't think
                      you can win. The loyalty of my
                      colleagues cannot be counted upon.

            MARGARET stands, watching the evening news.
                                    DENIS
                      Margaret, you can't let them do
                      this to you. Please, boss.
            MARGARET looks at DENIS, with quiet surprise, hears the
            desperation in his voice, the crack-
                                    DENIS (CONT'D)
                      They'll destroy you.
            MARGARET looks at DENIS, sees he is near to tears-

                      Throw in the towel now, love.

                      humiliated. You just won't win,
                      darling. Not this time.

                      Oh Denis.
            DENIS, fingers touch hers, she looks at him, sees the
            tender concern in his eyes. MARGARET smiles, determinedly
            steely under his gaze.

            MARGARET sits alone on the front bench.    A stream of

            INT. CORRIDOR. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1990. DAY.

            MARGARET descends the stairs like an operatic heroine,
            her hand gripping the banister of the staircase. Below
            the Downing St staff waiting to say goodbye. Many are in
            tears.

            She passes the photographs of her predecessors and stops
            to receive a gift, opening it-

                      useful.

            She moves down the receiving line of staff. The floor is
            carpeted with roses. Men's wet eyes. The door ahead. She
            is crying.

            MARGARET nods, bracing herself. A hand on the door

            MARGARET stands staring at herself in the mirror.

            DENIS lies on the bed behind her with the newspaper.

            DENIS's clothes are all over the room and the main
            cupboard is open and empty apart from shoes. There are
            several bin liners already filled with clothes.

                                    MARGARET (CONT'D)
                      Don't they know if you take the

                      you out with the rubbish!

            MARGARET turns away from this thought and opens a last
            big chest of drawers.

                                    MARGARET V/O
                           (seizing shirts and
                            jerseys and putting

                      And you did, love, you did.

            She sits at the end of her bed and opens a box she has
            found in Denis's cupboard. There is a programme from `The
            King and I' and a faded blue rosette from some long
            forgotten election campaign. A small flyer `Margaret
            Roberts. Conservative Candidate for Dartford' and some
            childrens cards "to the world's greatest Daddy love Mark
            and Carol."

                      to grow up well and be happy -
                      happier than I was certainly. And
                      I wanted you to be happy of
                      course. Were you happy, Denis?
                      Tell me the truth.

            There is no response. MARGARET is momentarily lost in the
            room.

            Then, seized by some compulsion, she begins to pull out
            the rest of his clothes, shoving them into black bags.

            As shirts and trousers go in, quick flashes of Denis -

                                                                        93

            His youthful face, smiling at her at the opera.

            Laughing on the beach in Cornwall.

            At the door of Number 10, smiling at her.

            Sharing her bed.

            MARGARET looks up. Denis's suitcase is on the bed. His
            coat and hat lying beside it. She folds his dressing gown
            - the one from the bathroom hook - tenderly and puts it
            on the top of the case.

                                      MARGARET
                      Denis? Denis?

            And there he is by her side.

                      Here's your bag. You're all
                      packed, sorted.

            She walks him to the bedroom door and gives him a gentle
            kiss. DENIS starts to walk away.

            MARGARET calling out as DENIS reaches the window at the
            very far end of the house and appears to disappear into
            the white light-
                                   MARGARET
                           (calling out)

            INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.DAWN
            From above we see MARGARET lying dead asleep on the bed
            on a pile of DENIS' clothes. The bed is surrounded by
            bulging black bin bags.

                                    CAROL OOV
                      Mummy-
            CAROL looming over Margaret, looking horrified.
                                    CAROL
                      My God, Mum. Are you alright?
                           (opening the
                            curtains)
                      Mummy you should have called for
                      help, silly old sausage. Have you
                      not even been in your bed
                      properly? You've done all this?
                                    MARGARET
                      Yes, all sorted. Finished.
            MARGARET looks around her.

                                    CAROL
                      Yes well don't worry about all
                      this. June and I will crack on
                      with it.
                                    MARGARET
                      I was just going to get dressed.

                      ...Shall I call someone, see if
                      anyone can come over and do your
                      hair?
            MARGARET looks at her warmly.
                                    MARGARET
                      Oh. No, you do it.

            CAROL reacts, surprised but pleased.

            INT. KITCHEN. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.
            MARGARET sit finishing a cup of tea. Hears Carol's bustle
            in the downstairs hallway.

                                    CAROL OOV

                      OK. `Bye.
            She stands, picking up the cup.
            From behind-
                                    JUNE (O.S) (CONT'D)
                      Oh let me do that, Margaret.
            MARGARET's turns for a moment-
            It is JUNE. MARGARET shakes her head.
                                    MARGARET
                      No, dear, I'll do it.
                                    JUNE
                      Carol said you might go to the
                      House of Lords today?
                                    MARGARET
                      No no. I'm not going anywhere.

            The sound of hot water running. CHINK of a teacup-
            MARGARET stands, washing up a tea cup.
            The SQUEAK of her wet cloth, working on a stubborn tea
            stain, puncturing the silence.
            The sound of birdsong and children playing drifts from
            the street outside.

                                                                        96

            MARGARET sets the cup aside, turns and walks out of the
            room, and out of sight.

            THE END
