               FADE IN:

               EXT. THE PORT OF GENOA, ITALY - NIGHT

               Forklifts RUMBLE. Workers WIPE FRAME. All the bustle and 
               cacophony of a major seaport.

               We FIND ourselves focusing on ONE LARGE CRATE. With the 
               GRINDING of gears, a crane lifts it off the dock and carries 
               it onto a ship.

               INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

               Through night-vision binoculars, CHARLIE CROKER, 28, watches 
               the mysterious crate. Charlie is young to run his own crew 
               but he's a born leader.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Lyle?

               SWISH PAN TO: LYLE, 21, brilliant and punctilious, fingering 
               the keyboard of his strap-on supercharged laptop.

                         clock corrections for each satellite 
                         that gets the signal. That'll make 
                         my reading as solid as the Precise

                         D.O.D. can use. We're talkin' 100 
                         meter horizontal accuracy, 156 meter 
                         vertical accuracy, .340 nanoseconds 
                         time accuracy.

               SWISH PAN TO: STEVE, 30, bearded. Steve has an arrogant 
               confidence mixed with the hint of a smile.

                         ...Because he's not.

                         I do need one more thing, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What's that?

                                     LYLE
                         Someone to turn the goddamn homing 
                         device on. No signal, no score.

                         relate to. Albert got a lotta trim.

               INT. HOTEL JEWELRY SHOP - SAME TIME

               The final member of the crew, JOHN BRIDGER, 50s, is a tasteful 
               man buying a very tasteful, and very expensive, diamond 
               necklace. The saleswoman wraps it up as he dials a number on 
               his cell phone.

                                     STELLA (V.O.)
                         Hello?

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Hi, sweetie.

               INT. STELLA'S CONDO - PHILADELPHIA - INTERCUT

               STELLA BRIDGER, 27, crushingly attractive, has just stepped 
               out of the shower, hair still wet, body wrapped in a towel.

                                     STELLA
                         Daddy. How are you?

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         I'm sending you something.

                                     STELLA
                         Really? Does it smell nice?

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         No. But it's sparkly.

                                     STELLA
                         Does it come with a receipt?

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         I'm having it sent to you from the 
                         store.

                                     STELLA
                              (toweling her hair)
                         Why not bring it by yourself? We 
                         could have dinner.

               He leaves the store and heads for the HOTEL ELEVATOR.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Be a long trip. I'm in Genoa.

               She doesn't like the sound of that.

                                     STELLA
                         Let me guess. Checking out the 
                         birthplace of Christopher Columbus.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Something like that.

                                     STELLA
                         With your parole officer's approval.

               He steps into the elevator. Rides up.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         I think I've paid my P.O. my last 
                         visit. I liked the guy, but we never 
                         really connected.

                                     STELLA
                         What are you into, Dad? Don't break 
                         my heart. You told me you were 
                         through.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         After this, I swear to you, I am.

                                     STELLA
                         You promised me. Daddy, don't do 
                         this.

               The elevator door opens, Bridger steps out and starts down 
               the hall.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Everything's going to be fine. I've 
                         got to go now. I love you. Bye.

               He clicks off then uses his card key to step into the --

               INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               He eyes Charlie, who looks pretty tense.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Italians?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Not yet.

                                     STEVE
                         Don't worry, they'll come through. 
                         You can trust these guys.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         I trust everyone. It's the devil 
                         inside them that I don't trust.
                              (then, to Charlie)
                         Got a sec?

                                     CHARLIE
                         My office.

               INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT

               They step inside, Charlie closing the door.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         How you feeling, boss?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Fine. I'm fine, fine.

               Bridger seems amused by that answer.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         You know what fine, stands for, don't 
                         you? Fucked-up, Insecure, Neurotic, 
                         and Emotional.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You've become quite the philosopher 
                         since you quit drinking.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         You don't like me sober?

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, I'm glad. Makes you a better 
                         thief.

               Bridger pulls out a fine cigar, still in its wrapper, hands 
               it to Charlie.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         For after the haul.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hope I get to fire it up. If Steve's 
                         Italians are a no-show, it's three 
                         months prep down the shitter and 
                         I've dragged you out of retirement 
                         for nothing.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         This is kinda nice. You being the 
                         boss with all the worries, me just 
                         along for the ride.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Ain't you sweet...

               From the other side of the door, they HEAR --

                                     STEVE (O.S.)
                         Charlie!

               INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Charlie takes the binoculars from Steve. He SEES TWO ITALIAN 
               CUSTOMS INSPECTORS climbing onboard the ship.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Your Italians.

                                     STEVE
                         Yup. Dixie cups.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Dixie cups?

                                     STEVE
                         I toss 'em away if there's a problem 
                         down the road.

               EXT. SHIP - NIGHT

               In ITALIAN, the Inspectors quiz the NERVOUS CAPTAIN about 
               the mysterious crate.

               One Inspector takes a crowbar and yanks out several strips 
               of plywood, REVEALING unmarked cardboard boxes inside. The 
               other Inspector pulls out one of the boxes and tears it open.

               It is filled with tomatoes. He takes a bite out of one.

               Nods. Everything seems to be order. The Captain looks 
               relieved. The inspector closes the cardboard box but...

               Watch carefully now, because as he does this, he hits a power 
               button on a small HOMING DEVICE and stuffs it in with the 
               tomatoes...

               INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

               On Lyle's computer screen, a pulsating dot appears, BEEPING, 
               sending out precise longitude and latitude.

               Charlie dials his cell phone.

               INT. HUMVEE (MOVING) - INTERCUT

               Handsome Rob answers.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Yeah.

                         Let's get rich.

               Handsome Rob pulls over. They're at the port. They can see 
               the mysterious crate being lowered into the ship's hold.

               Half-Ear climbs out, taking a large duffel bag with him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHIP (DOCKED) - LATER, NIGHT

               The Captain is doing his final checks before launch. OUR 
               CAMERA DROPS to --

               BENEATH THE WATER

               where we FIND Half-Ear, in scuba gear, applying Nitramon 
               explosive primer to the hull of the ship.

               INT. HUMVEE (MOVING) - NIGHT

               Plowing through thick brush that breaks out onto a secluded 
               beach. Handsome Rob is still behind the wheel but now Steve 
               is in the passenger seat. Lyle, in the back, is still on the 
               laptop, legs fidgeting like a drummer on meth. POP goes his 
               bubble gum.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Can you chill out back there? You'd 
                         make a hummingbird nervous.

               EXT. UNDERNEATH THE SHIP - NIGHT

               Half-Ear finishes up. Speaks into the headset inside his 
               gear.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         I'm done. Over.

                         Copy that. Enjoy the ride, cowboy.

               Half-Ear grabs onto the bottom rung of a ladder that is bolted 
               to the side of the ship as it launches off the dock and into 
               deeper water.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               TWO BRIGHT CIRCLES IN A SEA OF DARKNESS

               Coming closer... becoming clearer... It's Charlie and John 
               Bridger, in scuba gear, riding torpedo-shaped Dive Propulsion 
               Vehicles (DPVs) that pull them through the deep blue sea at 
               a good 5 m.p.h. Both DPVs drag equipment bags.

               A Global Satellite Positioning Device is mounted on the 
               handlebar of Charlie's DPV, being fed information via Lyle's 
               laptop. A circle pulsates on the monitor, a beacon to the 
               crate in the ship.

               EXT. UNDER THE BOAT - NIGHT

               Half-Ear still clings to the ladder. It's a wild ride.

               Through the headset inside his gear, he HEARS:

                                     LYLE (V.O.)
                         Get ready. 3. 2. 1. Drop.

               Half-Ear lets go of the ladder. The ship's propellers speed 
               by just above his head. WHOOSH.

               He removes a radio-controlled detonator. Hits the button.

               EXT. SHIP - ON THE CUT

               The hull of the boat EXPLODES.

               INT. SHIP'S HOLD

               A very neat hole on the bottom of the boat beneath the crate 
               is opened. Water RUSHES IN and the crate falls right through 
               the cavity, vanishing.

               UNDERWATER

               The huge, heavy crate drops down... down... hits the bottom.

               ON THE SHIP

               Chaos rules. She's taking on water fast. No way to save her. 
               The captain orders the dinghy lowered into the water.

               INT. HUMVEE - NIGHT

               Parked in the sand at the top of the bay. Steve looks out to 
               the bay through infrared binoculars.

               The ship is going down. The crew on the dingy head back to 
               the port, which is in the opposite direction of this beach.

               EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA - NIGHT

               The DPVs are now attached by a tether to an underwater lifting 
               bag that is used to move heavy loads through water.

               The crate is surrounded by our three diver-bandits.

               Using crowbars they pull apart the plywood. The cardboard 
               boxes of tomatoes dump out, tomatoes spilling everywhere.

               And now we see what was hidden between the boxes...

               A large safe.

               They move like clock-work. Half-Ear aims an underwater light 
               at the dial. Charlie drills a small hole near the dial.

               John peers inside a horoscope and lines up the three wheels 
               of the combination lock... until the door pops open.

               As they stare at what's inside, they speak into their 
               headsets, heard by all.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Sweet Jesus.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         "That for which all virtue is sold. 
                         And almost every vice -- gold."

               And now we see the contents of the safe: 160 glistening GOLD 
               BRICKS. Made in Singapore, they weigh 25 pounds and each one 
               is decorated with the face of an exotic Balinese girl. We're 
               talking thirty million dollars worth of gold.

               INT. HUMVEE (PARKED) - NIGHT

               They holler and high-five and it's just a great moment to be 
               alive. Steve takes another peek through his infrared 
               binoculars and sees --

               The last vestiges of the ship hang above the waterline, then 
               disappear.

               EXT. UNDERWATER - A LITTLE LATER

               The gold is now stacked and secured on the lifting bag.

               They attach an underwater parachute to the bag and hook a 
               hose from an air tank into press of a pressure release valves 
               which cause the parachute to INFLATE.

               Looking like a hot-air balloon underwater, the whole thing 
               floats up about fifteen feet. Half-Ear holds onto its side, 
               going along for the ride.

               Then Charlie and John Bridger speed off on the DPVs which 
               are tethered to the inflatable bag. As they glide through 
               the water towards the secluded beach, we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD - FIRST LIGHT OF DAWN

               The Humvee climbs into the mountain ranges of the Alps.

               INT. HUMVEE (MOVING)

               The gold is in three crates in the cargo bay.

               Handsome Rob and Steve are still up front. The others are in 
               the back seats, the divers out of their scuba gear. They are 
               pouring champagne into paper cups; except for Bridger who 
               abstains. He holds up his empty cup.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         My name is John and I'm a very rich 
                         alcoholic. And I'm going to live my 
                         life one very rich day at a time.

                                     THE CREW
                         Alright, John!

               They laugh and pound their fists against the roof of the 
               Humvee. Charlie pulls out the cigar Bridger gave him. As 
               Bridger lights it for him --

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         You planned this one down to a t, 
                         kid. It's a gift. You saw the big 
                         picture, made contingencies, covered 
                         the angles...

               Hearing this, Steve looks a little jealous.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Shit, you made thirty million dollars 
                         in gold drop out of sight without 
                         holding a gun. Who else could've 
                         pulled that off?

                                     CHARLIE
                         You could've. I had big shoes to 
                         fill.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         Fill the shoes but don't follow the 
                         footprints.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What're you talking about? You've 
                         lived the life.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         My life's been nothing but fake IDs, 
                         fake business cards and divorce 
                         papers. This is the only thing that's 
                         real.

               Bridger shows him a photograph of Stella that he keeps in 
               his wallet.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Stella's a beautiful girl.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         She's amazing. And I spent half her 
                         childhood in prison. This is a once 
                         in a lifetime haul, Charlie. Bring 
                         down the curtain after this one. 
                         Make a new life. Find someone amazing 
                         and be there for her.

               As the advice escapes Bridger's mouth --

               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD

               A Jeep thunders out of a hiding place in the trees and blocks 
               the road. The Humvee brakes to avoid running into it.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Shit.

               Click. That's the sound of a gun cocking as it's pressed 
               against Handsome Rob's temple.

                                     STEVE
                         Anyone acts stupid and his brains go 
                         on the windshield.

               They see the two Italian Inspectors jump out of the Jeep, AK-
               47s leveled at the crew. Steve has double-crossed them.

               ON THE CREW: shocked would be a good place to start.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What the hell do you think you're 
                         doing?

                                     STEVE
                         Sorry Charlie. But I want the box of 
                         Cracker Jack all to myself.

               The Italians pull the crates of gold out of the back of the 
               Humvee.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You're not thinking this through. 
                         It's a stupid move.

                                     STEVE
                         Think so? Well you're the brilliant 
                         one. The Master Planner. Isn't that 
                         so, John?

               Steve climbs out of the Humvee, gun still on Handsome Rob, 
               the AK-47s aimed at the others.

                                     STEVE
                         You bet on the wrong horse.

                                     JOHN BRIDGER
                         We'll hunt you down. You're gonna 
                         regret this.

               EXT. HUMVEE

               Safely outside, Steve turns his gun on Bridger.

                                     STEVE
                         No regrets, Dixie cup.

               BOOM. He shoots Bridger in the head. Just like that.

               The Italians follow suit, AK-47s SCREAMING out bursts of 
               full automatic fire at the crew.

               INT. HUMVEE

               They duck for cover as the vehicle is riddled with gunfire.

               Glass shatters. Bullets ricochet. They're in the epicenter 
               of hell.

               Handsome Rob jerks the steering wheel and stomps the gas.

               Driving blind.

               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD

               The Humvee hits the side of the Jeep, grinds alongside it, 
               metal tearing against metal.

               The Humvee's right side tires precariously hover by the cliff 
               and the raging water below.

               The gunners keep FIRING. Bullets rip into the Humvee's tires.

               EXT. HUMVEE

               It almost escapes, but it can't make it on shredded rubber.

               It careens off the road and --

               SERIES OF SHOTS

               The Humvee plummets through the air and plunges into the 
               raging river.

               INT. HUMVEE

               Water cascades in through the open windows. They're thrown 
               around as the Humvee rides the rapids. WHAM. The passenger 
               door caves in as the Humvee rams into a large rock then is 
               swept further downstream. Through the foam and spray, Charlie 
               looks over to Bridger. He's dead. The torrent ROARS.

               Only their chests and heads are above water. And that's not 
               all. There's a WATERFALL AHEAD.

               EXT. WATERFALL

               The Humvee is palmed in its deadly embrace and hurled over.

               It cartwheels into the pool below, sending up a huge geyser 
               of water.

               It sinks out of sight.

               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD - SAME TIME

               The crates of gold are now inside the Italians' Jeep. Steve 
               climbs in, leaving the crew for dead.

               UNDERWATER - SAME TIME

               The Humvee strikes the surface bottom with an ominous thud.

               EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD - DAWN

               The Jeep jerks to a stop. A door opens and the bodies of the 
               two Italians, shot dead, are dumped out into the mud.

               Steve is alone now. Just him and the millions in gold.

               INT. HUMVEE - SAME TIME

               The water entombs them. Blood from Bridger's fatal gunshot 
               mists the water red.

               They manage to get the door open. They start to swim out but 
               Charlie won't go without Bridger. He grabs his friend's body 
               and pulls it up with him.

               EXT. RIVER - SUNRISE

               They drag themselves ashore, Handsome Rob helping Charlie 
               pull Bridger's corpse. Charlie is shocked, tormented, grieved, 
               and angry beyond description. Against the rocky embankment, 
               he holds Bridger. Not wanting to ever let go.

                                     CHARLIE (V.O.)
                         If you would have told me that I 
                         would spend the next three years 
                         searching for Steve Bandell, I would 
                         have said that was nothing. Cause I 
                         would have spent a lifetime looking 
                         for that bastard if I had to.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. OFFICE - DAY

               SOMEONE'S POV. A top of the line safe. The only light in the 
               office is the beam of a penlight on the dial.

               GLOVED HANDS spin the dial, feeling for "contact points", 
               areas on the dial where a slight resistance can be felt -- 
               if you have the touch.

               NEW ANGLE. A woman holds the penlight in her teeth while 
               trying to crack the safe. It's Stella Bridger, now 30.

               SUPERIMPOSE:

                              Three Years Later Philadelphia

               She manipulates the dial. Click. She grabs the safe's lever 
               and swings the heavy steel door open, her face a mixture of 
               pride and relief. But before we see what's inside -- LIGHTS 
               TURN ON.

               TWO COPS lurk at the doorway.

                                     FIRST COP
                         You always work in the dark?

                                     STELLA
                         Buzz of the fluorescents throws me 
                         off. She's all yours.

               The cops come closer and only now do we realize that they're 
               on the same team.

                                     SECOND COP
                         Damn. Chris Perley couldn't crack 
                         it. Neither could Michael Hoyt.

                                     STELLA
                         Now you know who to call first.

                                     FIRST COP
                         You're expensive, Stella. Those guys 
                         cut us a break on subpoena jobs. 
                         Goodwill, community service...

                                     STELLA
                         Well I do it for the money. I'll 
                         send you the bill.

                                     SECOND COP
                         Don't you want to see what's inside?

                                     STELLA
                         I never look. Bye, guys.

               And as she walks off, they do look -- at her.

               EXT. STREET - DAY

               A car RISES INTO FRAME on a bustling street: a 1960 Mini 
               Cooper S., a worldwide motoring icon. Its shape crouches low 
               to the ground and its tiny 10-inch wheel-at-each-corner gives 
               it the legendary Mini look.

               If when you see its headlights and classic grille it doesn't 
               bring a smile to your face, then you've got no automobile 
               soul.

               INT. MINI (CRUISING) - DAY

               Stella takes on the road like someone who loves to be behind 
               the wheel of a car that claimed victory in the Monte Carlo 
               Rally three times. She passes a minivan, a breeze with the 
               Mini's quick, go-kart-like handling.

               She searches for a parking space on a street lined with SUVs.

               Sees a spot, it's not really a space, just a gap between two 
               gas guzzlers, there's no way any car could squeeze in.

               Brake. Shift. Hard turn. She parallel parks the Mini with 
               ease. She's right in front of --

               HER SHOP

               Antique keys and locks dominate the storefront window with 
               the name of the shop stenciled across the glass: BRIDGER 
               LOCK AND SAFE COMPANY. Stella hops out of the Mini. With a 
               poised walk she heads inside.

               INT. SHOP - DAY

               It is filled with old cast-iron safes she has rebuilt along 
               with some new models. Stella's RECEPTIONIST greets her.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         How long?

                                     STELLA
                         Four minutes, forty-three seconds.

               High-five.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         You're the man.

                                     STELLA
                         So what's on the line-up?

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         2:00. Home safe in Fairmount Park. 
                         Owner died and the wife never knew 
                         the combination. And Todd Milliken 
                         called. He has a prototype combination 
                         lock he wants you to test out tomorrow 
                         morning. Says he added two false 
                         contact points on the tumbler.

                                     STELLA
                         Tell him if I don't have it opened 
                         in six minutes flat, breakfast is on 
                         me.

                                     RECEPTIONIST
                         And there's a Charlie Croker in your 
                         office. He said you two know each 
                         other.
                              (an aside)
                         And he looks pretty fine for a white 
                         boy.

               Without a response, Stella heads over to --

               HER OPEN OFFICE DOOR

               and sees him fiddling with her collection of safe doors that 
               line the shelves.

                                     STELLA
                         Charlie Croker.

               He turns around. Smiles. Charming.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hi, Stella.

               She steps inside.

                                     STELLA
                         Refresh my memory. After you came to 
                         see me and told me what happened to 
                         my father, I told you I never wanted 
                         to see you again, didn't I?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yeah. You did.

                                     STELLA
                         So I'm a little confused.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I found him.

               At first it seems that Charlie's words have no effect on 
               her, but then he notices that her hands are trembling.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I can tell you where he is.

                                     STELLA
                         I don't want to know.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Are you sure?

               She doesn't answer.

                                     CHARLIE
                         He's in Los Angeles.

               She doesn't respond. Doesn't ask him to go on, doesn't ask 
               him not to. So he goes on...

                                     CHARLIE
                         The gold bricks he stole from us 
                         were minted in Singapore and decorated 
                         with the face of a Balinese girl. 
                         I've had my tentacles out and got a 
                         call from a friend of mine and your 
                         father's, Philly Steak.

               Stella remembers him.

                                     STELLA
                         When I was little he would play poker 
                         at the house and drop quarters under 
                         the table for me to find.

                                     CHARLIE
                         He got word from an L.A. connection 
                         named Skinny Pete that a gold dealer 
                         has been buying bricks with the 
                         Balinese girl on them, three or four 
                         at a time.

                                     STELLA
                         You ever heard the expression, cut 
                         to the chase?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I tracked Steve down to an address 
                         in the Hollywood Hills. He's changed 
                         his last name to Frezelli. And get 
                         this: he had a Worthington 1000 
                         installed in the house before he 
                         even moved in. We both know that you 
                         don't install a Worthington 1000 
                         unless you have something precious 
                         to guard.

                                     STELLA
                         Precious or not, I don't deal with 
                         ill-gotten goods.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We boosted that gold from a terrorist 
                         group that was about to trade it for 
                         bio-weapons. Now that doesn't exactly 
                         make us Robin Hood, but maybe in our 
                         own little way we were doing a good 
                         deed. Problem is, no one in my crew 
                         can handle that safe. And I need 
                         someone I can trust.

                                     STELLA
                         And you think that's me? Haven't you 
                         heard that I work for the other side?

                                     CHARLIE
                         What I heard is that you have your 
                         father's touch. And he was the only 
                         safecracker I knew who could open a 
                         Worthington 1000.

                                     STELLA
                         I'm not a safecracker. I'm a 
                         professional safe and vault 
                         technician.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You're John Bridger's daughter. And 
                         this is our chance to set things 
                         right.

               That sets her off.

                                     STELLA
                         Our chance? Who do you think you are 
                         coming in here? Stealing the gold 
                         isn't going to bring my father back 
                         to life.

                                     CHARLIE
                         No, it won't.

                                     STELLA
                         Then get out.

               EXT. STREET  DAY

               Charlie comes out of her shop and starts down the sidewalk.

               Suddenly, Handsome Rob appears out of the crowd and is walking 
               next to him.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         How'd it go with the chick?

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm working on it.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         I don't want her on the crew, Charlie.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Gotta have her. Important piece of 
                         the puzzle.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         There has to be someone else. What 
                         about Bill Huchins?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Doing ten long at Levinworth.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Red O'Reilly?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Chemo.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Martin Hernandez?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Found Jesus.

               Handsome Rob stops Charlie.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         I don't want a civilian to screw 
                         this up.

                                     CHARLIE
                         She has the skill. And the motivation.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Exactly. She's emotional. You know 
                         what happens when emotion gets into 
                         it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's emotional for all of us at this 
                         point. Don't kid yourself.

               INT. EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT/BAR - NIGHT

               RICHARD WORTH has his back to the bar. He's a blue blood 
               trial lawyer with an ego that has more horsepower than a 
               Ferrari.

                                     RICHARD
                         It's all in my patented sideways 
                         glance. Like this...

               He gives a sideways glance to Stella; it's their first date.

                                     RICHARD
                         I hit each woman on the jury with 
                         one of these. We make contact. And I 
                         know exactly what they're doing. 
                         Undressing me with their eyes.

                                     STELLA
                         I see...

               What a nightmare. Someone bumps into Stella, a mumbled, 
               "Excuse me." Nightmare continues...

                                     RICHARD
                         The case is all but won. That's why 
                         in jury selection I choose as many 
                         women as possible. Except lesbians, 
                         of course. I can tell in sixty seconds 
                         if they're a lesbian. Want to know 
                         how I know?

                                     STELLA
                         If they don't undress you with their 
                         eyes?

                                     RICHARD
                         Precisely. Like that waitress right 
                         there. See? She's looking at me right 
                         below my belt. Definitely not a 
                         lesbian.

               A waitress is indeed looking below Richard's belt. But Stella 
               notices that she was only looking because Richard's zipper 
               is all the way down. She smiles.

                                     STELLA
                         Your fly.

                                     RICHARD
                         I am fly. And I'm da bomb. Just wait 
                         until later tonight.

               Suddenly a BUSBOY stumbles and a tray of drinks fall, soaking 
               Richard's suit in red wine.

                                     BUSBOY
                         Oh, man. I'm sorry.

                                     RICHARD
                         You should be. Moron. What the hell's 
                         wrong with you?

                                     BUSBOY
                         It was an accident. I'm very sorry.

                                     RICHARD
                         Where's the manager? Richard Worth 
                         is not paying to have his suit 
                         cleaned. Damn.
                              (to Stella)
                         I'm going to... I don't believe this.

               He starts off to the bathroom and as soon as the space he 
               was occupying empties, Charlie fills it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I think your date's going pretty 
                         well, what do you think?

               She shoots him a look that could reverse global warming.

                                     STELLA
                         What are you doing here?

                                     CHARLIE
                         What do you mean? I come here all 
                         the time.

                                     STELLA
                         I don't think so.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Sure. Lawyers, Judges, my kind of 
                         crowd. See that gentleman there, he 
                         sentenced me to 90 days in county 
                         once. We need to talk.

                                     STELLA
                         No, you need to listen. I want you 
                         to leave. Got it?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hey, I paid valet parking prices to 
                         get in here, not to mention a twenty 
                         spot to the busboy to spill that 
                         drink on Mister Zipper.

                                     STELLA
                         You -- I don't believe this. You 
                         paid someone to spill that drink?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Actually, you paid for it.

               Charlie returns her wallet.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Didn't notice it was me who bumped 
                         into you earlier, did you? Anyway, I 
                         was hoping we could get to know each 
                         other a little better before we leave 
                         for Los Angeles. I already booked 
                         your flight.

                                     STELLA
                         You truly are a fatuous, odious man.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I have no idea what you just said, 
                         but I like the sound of it.

                                     STELLA
                         Well maybe you'll understand this. 
                         Hit the road, Jack --

                                     CHARLIE
                         Charlie --

                                     STELLA
                         Or you'll be sorry, Charlie, cause 
                         I'll kick you in the nuts so hard 
                         that your voice will be as high as 
                         my heels.

               She means it, too.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I'm beginning to worry about this 
                         whole relationship.

                                     STELLA
                         I'll let you in on a secret. You 
                         can't have a relationship with a 
                         pickpocket, gold robber, or any kind 
                         of thief.

               Charlie looks away, lets her have her point. This whole thing 
               is getting pretty heated so when he turns back to her, he 
               uses a whole new approach. His emotions are genuine.

                                     CHARLIE
                         John wasn't just a man I crewed up 
                         with, he was my friend, he was the 
                         closest thing to a father I ever 
                         had. I wish to God I could bring him 
                         back. But all I can do is go after 
                         this guy, the guy that killed him, 
                         and hit him where he lives.

               She feels the honesty in his words but before she can reply, 
               they're interrupted by --

                                     RICHARD
                         Everything alright, Stella?

               He's back, red wine splotched on his suit.

                                     STELLA
                         Fine. Richard. Charlie. Charlie was 
                         just saying goodbye.

               But for now, Charlie is just staring at Richard, boring into 
               to him...

                                     RICHARD
                         Can I help you with something?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Oh, sorry. I was just undressing you 
                         with my eyes.

               And with that, Charlie goes. Stella can't help but smile.

               EXT. STELLA'S CONDO - NIGHT

               She comes home, having shed her date.

               INT. STELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               She goes through a drawer and pulls out a package she hasn't 
               looked at for years. She opens it.

               Inside is the beautiful necklace that her father bought her 
               in Italy. It brings tears to her eyes.

               INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               He lies in bed, can't sleep. His phone rings. He picks up.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Hello.

               INT. STELLA'S BEDROOM - INTERCUT

               She's on the other end of the line.

                                     STELLA
                         I'm in this for one thing, Charlie, 
                         and one thing only. I want to see 
                         the look on his face when his gold 
                         is gone. He took my father from me, 
                         I'm taking this; it's the best I can 
                         do.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREETS - DAY

               Stella's Mini passes, weaves, tucks in between cars. She 
               drives like a madman.

               INT. MINI (SPEEDING)

               Charlie feels like he's inside a video game.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I see Drive Defensively is your motto.

                                     STELLA
                         Don't worry. Jack Daniels never let 
                         me down.

               She slaps the dashboard of her car.

                                     CHARLIE
                         By the way you drive, I'm not 
                         surprised you named your car after a 
                         bottle of whiskey. Left.

                                     STELLA
                         Jack Daniels was chief engineer of 
                         the Mini. And I drive it exactly the 
                         way it was meant to be driven.

               She whips down the avenue.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Another left.

               She hangs a left.

                                     STELLA
                         We're going in circles. Who's tailing 
                         you this week?

                                     CHARLIE
                         The possibilities are endless.

               EXT. STADIUM PARKING LOT - DAY

               The Mini parks in the middle of the huge, empty lot that 
               surrounds Veterans Field, home of the Philadelphia Phillies.

               INT. MINI

               She looks around...

                                     STELLA
                         Where are they?

                                     CHARLIE
                         We're a little early. I didn't expect 
                         us to get here quite that fast. 
                         There...

               A Vespa pulls into the lot, headed their way. It's Lyle.

               Charlie starts the introductions.

                                     CHARLIE
                         That's Lyle. Gearhead. He's who really 
                         invented Napster...

               Below a Metallica poster, Lyle has fallen asleep on his desk.

               His roommate, Napster creator SHAWN FANNING, recognizable in 
               his trademark baseball cap, sneaks a peek at Lyle's computer.

                                     CHARLIE (V.O.)
                         At least that's how Lyle tells it.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               And now they see a monster pick-up truck bouncing into the 
               lot, MUSIC THUMPING from its Alpine at ear-bleeding levels.

                         Half-Ear. Explosives. He lost fifty

               A 10 year old boy stands in front of a toilet in the stall.

               BOOM! Water geysers out of the bowl and soaks him.

                         One M-80 in the toilet bowl too many.

               Some kids in the bathroom saw the whole thing.

                                     KID
                         That was rad!

               And now a RUMBLING in the distance. Stella looks. Sees a car 
               streaking their way, almost like a mirage in the heat waves 
               coming off the pavement. Closer. Faster. A classic Mustang. 
               Its engine rumbles like a jackhammer. It's had some serious 
               custom work done to it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Handsome Rob. Premier wheel man. He 
                         once drove all the way to L.A. just 
                         so he could set the record for longest 
                         freeway chase.

               Handsome Rob's behind the wheel, flicks a cigarette butt out 
               his open window --

               We watch it hit the pavement, ashes spark, and then behind 
               the fallen butt we see that every lane of the 405 is filled 
               with cop cars in pursuit.

                         Smashed the mark by twelve minutes.

               We now see Handsome Rob through the lens of a TV news

               SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE is shoved against a chain link fence 
               by a SIXTH GRADE BULLY.

                                     BULLY
                         Cough it up, Charlie!

               Charlie hands the bully a dollar bill. The bully puts it in 
               a wallet that is over-stuffed with cash and saunters off, 
               laughing it up with his bully pals. Charlie turns to his 2nd 
               grade classmate who sports a fresh black eye.

                                     CLASSMATE
                         So much for lunch.

                                     SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE
                         You need a dollar?

                                     CLASSMATE
                         I thought he took your last one.

                                     SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE
                         He did.

               Charlie holds up the over-stuffed wallet that he pickpocketed 
               from the bully.

                                     SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE
                         But I got lots more now.

                                                               CUT BACK TO:

               EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

               Doors open simultaneously. Everyone out. The crew eyes Stella. 
               Charlie gets right down to business.

                                     CHARLIE
                         This is Stella. She's working with 
                         us on this one. IDs?

               Handsome Rob hands out fake driver's licenses.

                                     LYLE
                              (reading his)
                         Melvin Lisp? Could I -- just once -- 
                         have a cool name?

                                     HALF-EAR
                              (also complaining)
                         220 pounds? Try 180.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Try 'Deal A Meal'.

                                     LYLE
                         I don't even have a cool nickname.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Enough of this sewing-circle shit. 
                         Phones.

               Half-Ear hands out new cell phone to everyone and takes their 
               old phones.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Philly Steak says these are clean as 
                         a whistle. He also got us four dozen 
                         internal chips with different numbers. 
                         Change out the chips twice a day.

               As Charlie hands out airline tickets --

                                     CHARLIE
                         We travel to L.A. separately.

                                     LYLE
                         You still haven't told us the most 
                         important thing. What exactly is the 
                         job, Charlie? And who exactly is 
                         she?

               Lyle and Half-Ear have been kept in the dark until now.

                                     CHARLIE
                         This is Stella Bridger. And we're 
                         finishing the job that we started in 
                         Italy.

               They're a little stunned at first.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Holy shit. It's about time.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MONTAGE - LAX - NIGHT

               The crew deplane from five different airplanes, different 
               air carriers.

               They disperse in separate vehicles. See Charlie at Avis, 
               renting a car.

               See Handsome Rob renting a U-Haul panel truck.

               See Stella on a hotel shuttle bus.

               See Half-Ear on the underground Metro Rail, taking the Red 
               Line.

               See Lyle in a taxi, headed south on Figueroa Street. He 
               notices a YOUNG WOMAN HITCHHIKING. For a moment, their eyes 
               connect. She is a beautiful waif and the feeling sweeps 
               through Lyle: if only... But the taxi passes by.

               Charlie checks into Shutters, with its Victorian beach house 
               feel and oceanfront view.

               Stella's at the Peninsula in Beverly Hills with its opulent 
               lobby.

               Handsome Rob's at the Standard, with its kitschy decor and 
               ironic style. He stares at a huge empty aquarium behind the 
               front desk where a performance artist writhes and a DJ spins 
               out rhythmic throbs. Very L.A.

               Half-Ear's at the new Renaissance Hollywood Hotel adjacent 
               to the dramatic Babylon Gate and the Kodak Theatre.

               And Lyle's at the Downtown Bonaventure, riding up the glass 
               elevator. Perfect gearhead hotel.

               EXT. SHUTTERS HOTEL - BALCONY - SUNSET

               The five of them sit in chairs on the balcony of his hotel 
               room. There's a sweeping view of the Pacific.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We need an in to get a video blueprint 
                         of the interior. We're not going 
                         into this place blind. Half-Ear, you 
                         take the first surveillance shift. 
                         Who goes in, who goes out, levels of 
                         security, you know the drill.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         You got it.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I also want audio surveillance on 
                         his phone.

                                     LYLE
                         I'll hack into the phone company's 
                         central office remote observance 
                         monitoring system and fool it into 
                         thinking there's a legal tap on the 
                         line. Reroute the digital copies of 
                         his calls to our own listening post.

                                     CHARLIE
                         How long?

                                     LYLE
                         I'll burn through the night, have it 
                         up and running before morning.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (to Handsome Rob)
                         We need to know how long to get from 
                         the house to Union Station downtown.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         No problemo.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Stella. How much time will you need 
                         with the safe?

                                     STELLA
                         I'll have it open in five minutes 
                         flat.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         It's not the same as opening a safe 
                         for the cops. Your heart will be 
                         pounding in your ears. Perspiration 
                         on your fingertips. It's a whole 
                         different ball game.

                                     STELLA
                         You get me to the safe, I'll open 
                         it.

               Out over the ocean, the sun is in its death throes, bruising 
               the sky a coiling purple and orange.

               EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE - MORNING

               Nestled at the end of a cul-de-sac on Oporto Drive in the 
               Hollywood Hills. Chrome. Glass. Carved wood.

               EXT. MARAVILLA DRIVE - MORNING

               The U-Haul panel truck is parked on the side of the road 
               that overlooks Oporto Drive and Steve's house.

               INT. U-HAUL - MORNING

               It's been converted into their surveillance vehicle, the 
               back outfitted with monitors and surveillance equipment.

               Half-Ear peers through binoculars and says his notes into a 
               micro-cassette recorder. His binoculars focus in on the fence 
               that surrounds the perimeter of the property.

                                     HALF-EAR
                              (into recorder)
                         We've got an anti-scaling fence. 
                         Hardened, electroplated steel. Hacksaw 
                         won't work. We'll need Nitramon.

               The binoculars SWISH PAN TO a guard booth where a guard keeps 
               an eye on the gate.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Armed guard. 9MM semi-automatic in 
                         the holster. Security booth is 
                         accessible and ideal for a triple 
                         charger chemical grenade.

               The binoculars SWISH PAN TO four Rottweilers prowling the 
               grounds.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Shit. Dogs. Why do black men hate 
                         dogs? I'll tell you why, Charlie. 
                         Because dogs are racist. That's a 
                         natural fact. Someone else deal with 
                         'em.

               EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY

               A sea of cars, gridlock in L.A. Crammed in the middle of the 
               traffic meltdown is Handsome Rob's rental car.

               INT. RENTAL CAR (CRAWLING)

               Timing out the getaway route. He's got a Thomas Guide on the 
               passenger seat and a stopwatch ticking away but he's going 
               nowhere fast. He futilely leans on the car horn.

               INT. U-HAUL - DAY

               Lyle's surveillance shift. He takes digital photos with a 
               telephoto camera. ZOOMS IN on a security pad on the front 
               door.

                                     LYLE
                              (into micro cassette 
                              player)
                         Advent Home Navigator Hybrid System. 
                         Monitors 132 points for intrusion, 
                         fire, and environmental hazards. 
                         Best way around it is to get a back 
                         door password, trip the alarm during 
                         the heist, then call it in as a false 
                         alarm.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STEVE'S HOUSE - OFFICE - DAY

               A HAND turns the dial to a Worthington 1000 vault. The vault 
               opens and voila: stacks and stacks of gold bricks.

               EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE -DAY

               The same hand clutches a very heavy duffle bag. OUR VIEW 
               BOOMS UP to see Steve, three years older than when we last 
               saw him, his beard shaved away.

               INT. U-HAUL - SAME TIME

               Through his digital camera lens, Lyle watches Steve walk 
               towards his car: a Ferrari 550 Barchetta Pininfarina. It's 
               the first time he's seen Steve in three years.

                                     LYLE
                              (into micro cassette 
                              recorder)
                         15:25. There he is. He's gained 15 
                         to 20 pounds living off our money. 
                         And Handsome Rob, you're going to be 
                         pissed when you see his wheels.

               Lyle watches the security guard hit a switch in the guard 
               booth. The gate rises like the blade of a guillotine in 
               reverse. The Ferrari zooms away.

               EXT. FIGUEROA STREET - DAY

               Another route. Handsome Rob's rental car is in the left turn 
               lane waiting for the light to change.

               INT. RENTAL CAR

               The light finally is a green arrow but the lady in front of 
               Handsome Rob is so preoccupied with applying her make-up 
               that she doesn't go until he honks but by then it's too late 
               as she makes it through the light but he doesn't.

               He checks his stopwatch. Simmers.

               EXT. PENINSULA HOTEL - POOLS SIDE - DAY

               In a bikini, Stella lies on a lounge chair under a cabana, 
               reading a copy of Vogue magazine.

               But as we take a closer look, we see that she's really reading 
               the owner's manual for the Worthington 1000 safe which she's 
               inserted in the fold of Vogue.

               INT. U-HAUL - DAY

               Charlie's shift. He sees a Latina housekeeper get into her 
               car.

                                     CHARLIE

                              recorder)
                         Housekeeper leaves at 17:30.

               EXT. COIN & BULLION STORE - EVENING

               Steve bangs a fist against the steel security door that covers 
               the closed store. The steel door rises up and a Ukrainian 
               named YEVHEN unlocks another door. He is the gold dealer 
               that Philly Steak told Charlie about.

                                     YEVHEN
                         You're right on time.

               INT. COIN & BULLION STORE - EVENING

               Yevhen is 50 and like many in the gold trade, there isn't a 
               conspiracy theory that he doesn't embrace. As they make their 
               way to a back room, he keeps his mouth in overdrive --

                                     YEVHEN
                         All those poor bastards out there 
                         putting their life savings in banks 
                         and S&Ls and mutual funds. What do 
                         they think -- that when the collapse 
                         comes they can depend on the 
                         government? I don't think so.

               Steve motions to a security camera that looms down on them.

                                     STEVE
                         Is the camera off?

                                     YEVHEN
                         Of course. Just like you said. I 
                         never tape you, you can see for 
                         yourself.

               Steve sees the red light is off. He lays the duffel bag on a 
               table, unzips it, pulls out three 25 pound gold bricks with 
               the face of a Balinese Girl stamped on each one. As Yevhen 
               inspects them --

                                     YEVHEN
                         Governments are nothing more than 
                         puppets on the strings of the 
                         Trilateral Commission with their 
                         twisted gods.

               Yevhen retrieves a briefcase, opens it, presenting Steve 
               with stacks of Ben Franklins: $100,000 worth. As Steve 
               inspects the cash --

                                     YEVHEN
                         I mean, it's so obvious that in a 
                         world where NAFTA can overturn the 
                         Supreme Court, not to mention 
                         Microsoft's nefarious financial 
                         machinations, this, is our only 
                         refuge; gold.

               Steve closes the briefcase.

                                     YEVHEN
                         Plus a little walking around money.

               EXT. 7TH STREET - NIGHT

               A fender bender in the middle of an intersection has traffic 
               backed up for miles.

               INT. RENTAL CAR

               Handsome Rob checks the latest time on the stopwatch.

               INT. U-HAUL - NIGHT

               Through night-vision binoculars Charlie sees a (different) 
               security guard open the gate as Steve returns.

               He watches Steve go inside his house. Through the windows, 
               he sees him use a remote to turn on a TV.

               EXT. 101 FREEWAY - THE NEXT DAY

               A freeway sign says: UNION STATION 1/2 MILE

               INT. RENTAL CAR

               HANDSOME ROB can see the exit up ahead, but traffic is so 
               backed up and going nowhere that it feels like it's a hundred 
               miles away. And it's not even rush hour. Just life in L.A.

               Idling on the freeway, he looks at the drivers in the cars 
               beside him. He sees a businesswoman reading the Wall Street 
               Journal. Sees a man with his finger deep, deep up his nose.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Where's a grenade launcher when you 
                         need one?

               EXT. YAMASHIRO RESTAURANT - DAY

               Our crew walks along the pathways of Japanese gardens that 
               wind along outside the restaurant. It's a breathtaking view 
               from high in the Hollywood Hills. Some tourists take in the 
               vista.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Doesn't matter what time it is. It's 
                         either bad traffic, peak traffic, or 
                         slit-your-wrists traffic.

                         I'm sure it's ideal for carrying a 
                         ton of gold, genius.

                         If we had all green lights, fourteen 
                         minutes. But in the twenty times 
                         I've done it, the average is thirty-
                         two minutes, with a top time of fifty 
                         minutes.

                         Then we'll travel like Rockefeller.

               They don't know where Charlie is going with this, but they've 
               been around him long enough to know it's going somewhere.

                         When cars first started catching on, 
                         workers on tall ladders would use 
                         these swiveling colored boards for 
                         traffic signals. Now whenever 
                         Rockefeller would take the drive 
                         from his mansion to his office on 
                         Wall Street, the workers would make 
                         sure that he got green boards all 
                         the way.

                         Did you know that the first traffic 
                         signal to be patented was invented 
                         by a black man named Garrett Morgan?

                         We'll never get by the guard unless 
                         they're certain it's legit. I'm 
                         thinking cable TV. We cut his cable, 
                         he calls the cable company. We show 
                         up. Send a cable technician into the 
                         house with a pinhole video camera 
                         while we get a feed through an RF 
                         antenna.

                         Who plays cable technician? Steve 
                         thinks we're all dead.

               But Stella knows that's not exactly true. He doesn't think 
               Stella is dead; he doesn't know her at all.

                                     STELLA
                         If you're all dead, I guess I'm the 
                         man for the job.

               EXT. ADELPHIA CABLE - PARKING LOT - EVENING

               Service trucks pull into the lot. Technicians are getting 
               out, finishing their shifts.

               INT. RENTAL CAR (PARKED NEARBY)

               Handsome Rob behind the wheel. Lyle shotgun, aiming his 
               digital camera at the exiting workers.

                                     LYLE
                         I'm telling you. He claims he named 
                         it Napster because his hair is so 
                         nappy underneath that cap of his. 
                         But I know the real reason. It's 
                         because I was NAPPING when he stole 
                         the idea from me. I should've been 
                         on the cover of Wired magazine.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Would you clam up. You'd give a 
                         woodpecker a headache.

                                     LYLE
                         I'm the Napster.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Okay. You're the Napster. Heads up: 
                         cable chick.

               They see a female service tech getting out of her work truck.

               Lyle zooms his camera lens in on her Adelphia Cable work 
               shirt. It has BECKY sewn in above her right breast.

                                     LYLE
                         Becky. Nice name. I wonder what she 
                         calls the other one.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         And it's such a mystery why you don't 
                         have a girlfriend.

                                     LYLE
                         I had a girlfriend. Unfortunately 
                         even though the relationship ceased 
                         in an objective reality, it's still 
                         going on in my mind.
                              (tapping his head)
                         That woman's lived in here rent-free 
                         for four years.

               Lyle takes a few more pictures of Becky.

                                     LYLE
                         Okay. All we need now is a work shirt 
                         like this one and a service truck 
                         like that one. You think Stella will 
                         be able to pull it off?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         I have my doubts, but there's no 
                         talking to Charlie.

                                     LYLE
                         Maybe he's been inserting his hard 
                         drive into her software. Clouds the 
                         judgment.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         He knows better than to mix business 
                         with pleasure.
                              (getting out of the 
                              car)
                         Only I'm allowed to do that.

                                     LYLE
                         Where you going?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         To get a work shirt and a service 
                         truck.

               Lyle watches him stroll over to Becky and strike up a 
               conversation in the parking lot. Lyle can't hear what's being 
               said, but Becky smiles, and lest we forget, his name is 
               Handsome Rob for a reason.

               INT. BECKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               OUR CAMERA FOLLOWS a trail of clothes, hastily littered, 
               that lead to the cable chick's bed. Lit candles are on the 
               bedside table. The couple is asleep under a tangle of sheets. 
               Handsome Rob has clearly mixed business with pleasure. His 
               eyes flash open.

               He slips out of bed. Pulls on his pants. Reaches into her 
               pants and removes her key chain.

               He selects the key to her service truck and does an old trick: 
               he blows out one of the candles and presses the key against 
               the warm wax, making a clear impression of the key's ridges.

               He returns the key chain. Takes a couple more steps, past 
               her panties, past her bra and.

               He snags her work shirt. Then he's gone.

               INT. HANDSOME ROB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Using locksmith equipment, he cuts a key that matches the 
               impression on the candle wax.

               EXT. ADELPHIA CABLE PARKING LOT - DAWN

               Stella, wearing Becky's work shirt, arrives before any other 
               workers. Using the key Handsome Rob made, she unlocks the 
               door to the cable truck and gets in.

               EXT. NEARBY STREET - MORNING

               The cable truck pulls over. Charlie and Lyle climb into the 
               back where they can't be seen.

               EXT. OPORTO DRIVE -MORNING

               The cable repair truck pulls over, parking down the street 
               from Steve's house.

               Charlie gets out. He quickly uses a crowbar to lift up a 
               sidewalk cement grate that says CABLE on it. Inside are cable 
               wires that feed the street. He crouches over and uses pliers 
               to disconnect one of the cables.

               INT. STEVE'S HOUSE - MORNING

               He drifts into the kitchen for a cup of coffee. He hits the 
               remote control for a TV. It turns on but there's nothing but 
               snow.

               He goes into the living room and checks out the plasma TV.

               The cable's not working in here, either. He hits an intercom 
               button on his telephone.

               INT. GUARD HOUSE - INTERCUT

               A SECURITY GUARD answers the intercom.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         What can I do for you, Mister 
                         Frezelli?

                                     STEVE
                         The cable's out. See if you can get 
                         someone over here to fix it'.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Yes, sir.

               He finds the number and dials.

               INT. CABLE TRUCK (PARKED) - MORNING

               Lyle monitors a digital copy of the security guard's call 
               that's being routed to his laptop. Then he takes off his 
               headphones and tells Charlie and Stella:

                                     LYLE
                         Whoa. I've never heard the Muzak 
                         version of Purple Haze before.

                                     CHARLIE
                         When's the appointment?

                                     LYLE
                         Thursday between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m.

               Charlie dials a number on his cell phone.

               INT. GUARD HOUSE - INTERCUT

               The security guard answers the phone.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Hello.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yes, I'm calling from Adelphia Cable. 
                         I understand your service is out and 
                         an appointment was set up for 
                         Thursday.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Yes.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Well we have a technician working in 
                         your area who finished with an 
                         appointment earlier than expected. 
                         Will someone be there for the next 
                         hour?

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         Sure. That'd be great.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Our technician will see you then. 
                         Have a nice day.

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                         You too.

               Charlie hangs up.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Let's check the camera.

                                     LYLE
                         Stella, you're going patriotic today.

               Lyle puts an American flag pin on her work shirt. Then he 
               hits keys on his laptop and an image pops up on his monitor 
               via an RF antenna: the POV of the pin.

                                     CHARLIE
                         He's got cable lines in the kitchen, 
                         living room, bedroom and a cable 
                         modem on the computer in the office. 
                         Try to get a 360 look at each room. 
                         And walk slowly or the image will 
                         streak.

               Lyle hands her some papers.

                                     LYLE
                         I printed these up to look like 
                         paperwork from Adelphia. When you're 
                         done, ask him to sign and date the 
                         bottom.

               Stella looks very tense.

                                     CHARLIE
                         How you doing?

                                     STELLA
                         Fine. I'm fine.

               Charlie seems amused by that answer.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You know what fine, stands for? Fucked-
                         up, Insecure --

               Stella joins in with him...

                                     STELLA & CHARLIE
                         Neurotic and Emotional.

               They look at each other a moment... and smile.

               INT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING) - DAY

               While the others deal with the cable, Handsome Rob and Half- 
               Ear drive down Sunset.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Here's our spot.

               They pull up in front of a strip joint.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Girls girls girls.

               Half-Ear pulls a switchblade out of his boot and puts it in 
               the glove compartment. Handsome Rob gives him a questioning 
               look.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Philly Steak said we'd be frisked.

               INT. STRIP CLUB - DAY

               Outside the doorway of a back room they're frisked by a BURLY 
               MAN. He's very thorough, digging hard into their crotches.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                              (scowls)
                         Y'got a great job.

                                     BURLY MAN
                         Pays the rent, asshole. You got a 
                         problem, talk to Skinny Pete.

               He opens the door to the --

               INT. BACK ROOM

               Where we meet SKINNY PETE, who is the FATTEST MAN YOU'VE 
               EVER SEEN. He takes up an entire couch in the rear of the 
               room.

               His catcher's-mitt-sized hands motion them to come closer.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         Philly Steak sent you?

               His voice is raspy, it's like a climbing-ten-floors-effort 
               just for this guy to get out the words.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         That's right.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         So was I right-on about the gold 
                         bricks or what?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         That's really not what I'm here to 
                         talk about. Philly Steak said you 
                         could get us some supplies.

               The fattest man you've ever seen attempts a nod, triple-chins 
               colliding like a train wreck.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         What do you need?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         A four inch can of Nitramon. Nitramon 
                         primer. Detonating cord. Two triple 
                         charger chemical grenades. Launcher.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         Nine p.m.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Should we hang here? Check out the 
                         dancers?

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         Nothing's going down here. I don't 
                         shit in my own yard, do you?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         No, but I take a whizz off the deck 
                         sometimes.

               With his distended belly and bursting shirt, his eyes glazing 
               with repletion, Skinny Pete writes down an address.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         Five thousand dollars. And don't be 
                         late.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SECURITY GUARD BOOTH -DAY

               Looking at a monitor, one of Steve's security guards sees 
               the Adelphia repair truck pull up to the gate. He hits a 
               button and the gate rises, beckoning it inside.

               INT. CABLE TRUCK (MOVING)

               Stella heads up the driveway, apprehension painted on her 
               features. Lyle is hidden in the back.

               She parks next to the Ferrari and finds herself surrounded 
               by the four Rottweilers. They snarl and flash their teeth 
               outside her door until a shrill WHISTLE yanks their attention 
               to --

               EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE

               where Steve has just stepped out the front door. The dogs 
               immediately back off.

               Stella gets out of the truck as Steve walks over, smiling at 
               her.

               She comes face to face with the man who killed her father.

                                     STEVE
                         It's all right. They won't bother 
                         you now.

               She's not sure she's going to be able to speak or pull this 
               off.

                                     STELLA
                         It's okay. I'm used to running into 
                         all sorts of dogs on my job.

               He holds out a hand.

                                     STEVE
                         I'm Steve.

                                     STELLA
                         Becky.

               She shakes his hand. She hates this, feeling his skin touch 
               hers, but she can't betray her feelings. He stands there a 
               moment.

                                     STELLA
                         You want to show me the problem?

                                     STEVE
                         Yeah. Course. This way.

               INT. STEVE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

               She enters, moving her body to give the pinhole camera a 
               full sweep of the entryway.

                                     STELLA
                         I'd like to check the cable modem 
                         first.

               INT. BACK OF THE CABLE REPAIR TRUCK - SAME TIME

               Lyle watches Stella and Steve on his laptop via the pinhole 
               camera and hears them talking through his headphones.

               INT. HALLWAY - INTERCUT

               Steve leads Stella down the marbled hall...

                                     STEVE
                         I'll show you.

               They step into the --

                                     OFFICE
                         She turns her body so the mini-lens 
                         can stare at the gleaming black 
                         Worthington 1000 safe. Then she goes 
                         up to his desk and pretends to work 
                         on the cable line that feeds into 
                         his computer.

               He stares at her as she bends down...

                                     STEVE
                         The cable guy who hooked this up 
                         weighed about 300 pounds, didn't 
                         wear any underwear, and his pants 
                         slung a little too low if you know 
                         what I mean.

               She tries her best to ignore his flirtatious stare and his 
               words.

                                     STELLA
                         There we go. Now onto the TVs.

               INT. BACK OF THE CABLE TRUCK - DAY

               Lyle sees a perfect view of the main hallway as Stella walks 
               down it.

               INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

               He escorts her inside. She works on the cable connection to 
               the plasma TV. Finishes.

                                     STEVE
                         Is it fixed?

                                     STELLA
                         Turn it on and see.

               EXT. OPORTO DRIVE - SAME TIME

               Back at the spot where Charlie disconnected the cable.

               Wearing a headset with a mic, he gets the word from Lyle --

                                     LYLE (V.O.)
                         Now.

               Charlie reconnects the cable just as --

               INT. LIVING ROOM

               Steve turns on the TV and the picture is --

                                     STEVE
                         Perfect.

                                     STELLA
                         Then it looks like you're all set.

               Steve stares at her a moment.

                                     STEVE
                         Have we met before?

               She's hoping to get out as quickly as she can.

                                     STELLA
                         I don't think so. Sign here, please.

               She hands him the paperwork and a pen. He signs it.

                                     STELLA
                         Date.

                                     STEVE
                         You read my mind.

                                     STELLA
                         Oh, no. I meant that I need you to 
                         put the date by your signature. It's 
                         the 26th.

                                     STEVE
                         I know what you meant.
                              (he smiles)
                         This might seem a little sudden, 
                         but... would you like to have dinner 
                         with me?

                                     STELLA
                         I don't think that'd be a very good 
                         idea.

                                     STEVE
                         Why? Is there some kind of cable-
                         rule against dating customers?

                                     STELLA
                         No, it's my rule. I don't accept 
                         dates from men I've just met. I've 
                         only known you five minutes.

                                     STEVE
                         Then I guess I'll have to sabotage 
                         my cable over and over again until 
                         you get to know me better.

               He's being charming, and she has to act like he is being 
               charming, but she really wants to throw-up.

                                     STEVE
                         Look, I'm just talking about dinner. 
                         Friday night. It's no big deal. If 
                         you don't like me, you never have to 
                         see me again. You know I'm not going 
                         to stop until you say yes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CABLE TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY

               Stella drives in heavy traffic down Sunset. Charlie and Lyle 
               are in the back.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I know it was tough in there.

                                     STELLA
                         He touched my hand. And he came-on 
                         to me. That slimy, disgusting man 
                         came onto me and I had to pretend 
                         that I liked it.

               Stella keeps her eyes forward, on the road, so Charlie and 
               Lyle can't see her face. But Charlie catches her reflection 
               in the rearview mirror and watches a tear glide down her 
               cheek. She wipes it away.

                                     STELLA
                         You do know what this means... I've 
                         created our window of opportunity.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I know. When Steve leaves Friday 
                         night, we go in. By the time he 
                         realizes you've stood him up, we'll 
                         be long gone with the gold.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HOUSING PROJECTS - NIGHT

               A different world. A different vibe. That feeling in the 
               gut: you don't belong here.

               INT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING)

               Handsome Rob drives, Half-Ear in the passenger seat.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Skinny Pete.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         The guy makes Jabba the Hut look 
                         like a spokesman for the Subway 
                         Sandwiches' diet.

               They pull over in front of the apartment building that Pete 
               sent them to.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         What do you think?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         I'm trying not to.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Half-Ear hits the buzzer for the apartment number on the 
               paper from the fat man. The door to the building buzzes in 
               response and they go inside.

               INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Climbing stairs. From behind closed doors: TVs, crying babies, 
               violent yelling. They start down a hallway. Ahead of them a 
               door opens and a suitcase is put in front of the doorway. 
               The door closes. They don't even get a glance at whomever is 
               inside.

               They go to the suitcase. Half-Ear clicks open the lock for 
               just a peek. He sees the goods.

               Handsome Rob starts to slide an envelope of cash under the 
               door frame. Its sucked out of his hand by someone on the 
               other side of the door and disappears.

               EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

               Half-Ear carefully deposits the suitcase into the trunk of 
               the rental car. Handsome Rob closes the trunk.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Drive slow. We crash and we're a 
                         crater.

               They get into the car.

               INT. RENTAL CAR

               Handsome Rob keys the ignition.

               The beam of his headlights illuminate TWO HOMEBOYS. TWO MORE 
               step out of the shadows, one right up to the passenger's 
               door window. That one taps a 9 MM against the glass.

               Half-Ear lowers the window. The homeboy pats one hand against 
               the faux-leather inside of the door, his other hand clutches 
               the weapon.

                                     HOMEBOY
                         What'd you put in the trunk?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Suitcase.

               The homeboy, bugging on crank, is not one to be fucked with.

                                     HOMEBOY
                         Just gimme the keys before I pop a 
                         cap in your head.

               Handsome Rob takes the trunk key off the chain and passes it 
               over to Half-Ear... who nervously drops it onto the carpeted 
               floor.

                                     HOMEBOY
                         Hurry up!

               Half-Ear reaches down for the key... but in the flash of an 
               eye... moving so fast it almost doesn't register... we see 
               him yank his switchblade from his boot, unleash its blade, 
               and stab it down into the homeboy's hand. The knife goes 
               through his hand and lodges into the faux-leather interior 
               of the door.

               The homeboy suffers as Half-Ear whacks the gun out of his 
               other hand -- while Handsome Rob keys the ignition and guns 
               it.

               The other homeboys are already POPPING OFF SHOTS at the car 
               with semi-automatic handguns. Half-Ear hits the deck. Glass 
               shatters.

               INT. TRUNK OF THE CAR

               Bullets slam into the trunk, illuminating the darkness with 
               streaks of light from the bullet holes. They barely miss the 
               suitcase filled with explosives.

               EXT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING)

               The homeboy is still attached to the car door by the knife.

               His legs scurry to keep up with the moving vehicle but it's 
               going too fast so pretty soon he's being dragged. Bullets 
               whiz by him. He cries out in agony until Half-Ear has the 
               time to yank out the knife and the homeboy rolls away on the 
               pavement.

               The car makes a sharp right at the next block and pulls over.

               The U-Haul is waiting for them.

               They get out of the rental car and open its trunk. Half-Ear 
               sees the bullet holes that surround the suitcase. An inch 
               closer and they would've been a crater.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Christ.

               INT. U-HAUL - NIGHT

               They get in with the suitcase. Charlie is behind the wheel, 
               he's been waiting for them. He hits the gas. They take off, 
               leaving the shot-up rental car behind.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Looks like that went without a hitch.

               INT. CHARLIE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

               An edited loop of the exterior and interior of Steve's house 
               plays on Lyle's laptop. The crew is huddled around.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Lyle, what's the distance from the 
                         front door to the vault?

               Lyle doesn't answer.

                         Lyle?

               Handsome Rob leans over to Charlie.

                         He only answers to The Napster now.

                         I'm not calling you The Napster.

                         You call him Half-Ear.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         That wasn't my idea.

                         That's only cause he is Handsome 
                         Rob.

                         How far?

                         So here's the riddle. How do we get 
                         over a ton of gold from the vault to 
                         the getaway car?

               The video that Stella got of the hallway plays on the laptop.

               Lyle calculates:

               The sideview mirrors scraping wallpaper. Then:

               The thin car is like a missile firing RIGHT DOWN STEVE'S 
               HALLWAY, a hair-raising fit.

                         We could rumble right up the front 
                         steps, bring the getaway car right 
                         to the vault, and then straight to

               EXT. CAR RENTAL COMPANY - DAY

               Parked in the lot are shimmering Supercharged Mini Coopers, 
               a new model that still captures the legendary Mini look and 
               feel.

               Half-Ear climbs in one Mini. Lyle into another.

               In the background, a large window overlooks the lot.

               Handsome Rob fills out the paperwork on the Mini he's renting 
               while flirting with a petite COUNTER BABE.

               At the same time, in the background, we see Lyle and Half-
               Ear's Mini pull out of their parking spaces and BACK RIGHT 
               INTO EACH OTHER. Just a little bumper hit.

                         Do you know them?

               They get out of their cars and start yelling at each other.

                         were allowed free -- and illegal -- 
                         access to official election material.

               Steve puts his duffel bag down on the table. It THUDS. Once 
               again, he pulls out three gold bricks that each weigh 25 
               pounds.

                                     YEVHEN
                         Now given the sordid history in Miami 
                         of joint ventures between Central 
                         Intelligence and the Mob, which led 
                         to the unsuccessful attempts to kill 
                         Fidel Castro and the successful 
                         assassination of your President John 
                         F. Kennedy, this conjunction raises 
                         numerous red flags.

                                     STEVE
                         And I'd love to hear more about it, 
                         but like I said...

                                     YEVHEN
                         Don't worry, we'll have you out in 
                         no time. The cash is on its way.

               Steve cocks his head, as if he could not have heard right.

                                     STEVE
                         On its way?

                                     YEVHEN
                         My cousin is bringing it over.

                                     STEVE
                         Your cousin?

                                     YEVHEN
                         Yes. Cousin Mashkov.

                                     STEVE
                         He's on his way?

                                     YEVHEN
                         Don't worry, he will be here any 
                         minute.

               Steve looks up to the security camera.

                                     STEVE
                         The tape's off?

                                     YEVHEN
                         Of course. Believe me, he doesn't 
                         want to be on video, either.

                                     STEVE
                         Yevhen. Didn't I tell you, many times, 
                         that I never wanted to meet with 
                         anyone but you?

               Yevhen sweats a bit.

                                     YEVHEN
                         I know. But it's his cash. He uses 
                         me to launder money. I'm just a 
                         middleman.

                                     STEVE
                         And a middleman is supposed to stay 
                         in the middle.

                                     YEVHEN
                         But you were early. Please. Don't 
                         worry. It will be fine. My cousin's 
                         a cool guy. Like I am.

                                     STEVE
                         What you are, is a Dixie cup.

               Yevhen smiles quizzically, not sure if he's being complimented 
               or insulted.

                                     YEVHEN
                         Dixie cup?

               Before the words are out of Yevhen's mouth, Steve grabs one 
               of the 25 pound gold bricks and slaps it across Yevhen's 
               face, shattering his jaw.

               Yevhen's falls to the floor and Steve lifts the brick again 
               and rams it down onto his head with an ugly THUD.

               And again.

               And again.

               He then takes the gold brick -- slathered in blood -- and 
               places it back in his duffle bag.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. YEVHEN'S COINS & BULLION STORE - TEN MINUTES LATER

               Yevhen's Ukrainian cousin, MASHKOV, stares down at the corpse. 
               Steve is long gone.

               Mashkov kneels down by the body and starts sobbing.

               INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

               Mashkov walks through a living room, past some lighting 
               equipment and a video camera and we get just enough of a 
               look to realize that a porno is being shot here but he 
               couldn't care less as he makes his way into the kitchen where --

               His boss, DANYA, 60, the owner of this house, is eating a 
               bowl of Frosted Flakes at the kitchen table. They speak in a 
               colloquial Ukrainian tongue that we SUBTITLE.

                                     MASHKOV
                         My cousin Yevhen was beaten to death.

                                     DANYA
                         By who?

                                     MASHKOV
                         That's what I'm going to find out.

               They stop talking for a moment as one of the "ACTRESSES" 
               comes in, plops herself down next to Danya and pours herself 
               a bowl of cereal. She puts her hand on Danya's leg. She's 
               young and it's a disturbing image and we RECOGNIZE HER: she's 
               the HITCHHIKER who Lyle passed in the taxi ride down Figueroa 
               Street when he first arrived in L.A.

               Danya goes back to speaking SUBTITLED UKRAINIAN.

                                     DANYA
                         And what will you do when you find 
                         this piece of shit who killed your 
                         cousin?

                                     MASHKOV
                         I'll hack off his limbs and bury him 
                         while he's still alive.

                                     DANYA
                         Okay. But now we should stop talking 
                         Ukrainian, it's rude to my girl.
                              (switching to accented 
                              ENGLISH)
                         How are you tonight, Karen?

                                     KAREN
                         Hungry.

                                     DANYA
                         Then eat your Frosted Flakes.

                                     KAREN
                              (like Tony the Tiger)
                         They're grrrreat!

               Danya laughs pleasantly.

                                     DANYA
                         Such a perfect girl.

               But as she eats her cereal, we see a troubled, sad look on 
               her face.

               INT. RENTED WAREHOUSE - DAY

               The three Minis are parked inside: one red, one white, one 
               blue. Handsome Rob and Stella are doing custom work under 
               the hoods. Lyle is wearing the strap-on laptop and typing 
               away. Half-Ear squeezes silver Haliburton suitcases into the 
               Minis' trunks as Charlie enters --

                                     CHARLIE
                         How are our matchbox cars?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Souped.

                                     STELLA
                         Don't let their size fool you. These 
                         were rally cars back in the day. 135 
                         mph, 155 horsepower --

                                     LYLE
                         Do I get to drive one?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         No.

                                     LYLE
                         Why not?

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Because you can't navigate your way 
                         out of a parking lot. Here's your 
                         ride.

               He pulls a blanket off a Vespa. Lyle points at Half-Ear.

                                     LYLE
                         But he ran into me.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         He's not driving either.
                              (to Stella)
                         You ever got a speeding ticket?

                                     STELLA
                         Let's put it this way: I can only 
                         get insurance through companies that 
                         advertise on TV at 3:00 in the 
                         morning.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         You drive. I drive. Charlie drives.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I got us spots for three cars on a 
                         car carrier and five first class 
                         seats. Train 59 from Union Station 
                         to New Orleans.

                         That's N'Or'lins, Yankee.

                         The Traffic Control Center is on the 
                         top floor of a building on Olympic 
                         and Grand. They get their data from 
                         pavement loop detectors and video 
                         image vehicle detectors. That info 
                         is fused together by specially 
                         designed algorithms to predict traffic 
                         conditions and control the traffic 
                         lights. So all I have to do now is 
                         change the data by creating my own 
                         algorithm.

                                     CHARLIE
                         What can I do to help?

                                     LYLE
                         I need to hard-wire into the 
                         mainframes.

               EXT. TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER - NIGHT

               Housed in a towering building on the corner of Olympic and 
               Grand in the heart of downtown L.A. OUR VIEW RISES UP to the 
               rooftop, where WE FIND Charlie and Lyle.

               OUR VIEW MOVES IN CLOSER on Charlie, who adroitly picks the 
               lock to an access door and they climb down a short set of 
               steps into the 

               INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS SHOT

               From an equipment bag, Charlie pulls out a silent power drill 
               and uses it to remove an access panel from the AC vent.

               INT. AIR-CONDITIONING VENT - NIGHT

               Charlie leads, crawling through this tight space, his path 
               illuminated by the thin beam of a penlight.

               INT. TRAFFIC CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

               A high-tech setting with a half-dozen workers overseeing the 
               large traffic information monitors that display multiple 
               images.

               OUR CAMERA PUSHES IN on the wall of monitors and then 
               BLACKNESS as OUR VIEW CROSSES to the --

               OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL

               Where the 70" tall mainframe computers are housed and running. 
               We see that the AC vent to this room is now open since Charlie 
               and Lyle have already snuck inside.

               They move fast. Charlie removes the rear panels of the 
               mainframes while Lyle adeptly hard-wires his laptop into the 
               computers. The laptop's screen lights up.

               Charlie fits two false panels where the rear panels of the 
               mainframes used to be. Lyle pulls an innocent looking filing 
               box out of his equipment bag. He places the box on a nearby 
               shelf where it enjoys line-of-sight to the false panels.

               He punches a key on his laptop and the false panels and the 
               filing box quietly clicks into action, communicating with 
               his laptop via infrared. His laptop now shows a guiltwork of 
               thumbnail views from the traffic information monitors.

               Typing commands, Lyle is clearly operating on a higher 
               bandwidth than the rest us.

                                     LYLE
                         B4 X TTratio, where Bi are Fisher's 
                         linear discriminant function 
                         coefficients, SpdRat is the speed 
                         ratio, and TTratio is the travel 
                         time ratio.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I have no idea what you're doing. 
                         Just do it fast.

               There.

               He hits the ENTER button.

                                     LYLE
                         We own this place.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE PANTRY RESTAURANT - DOWNTOWN L.A. - DAY

               Their motto: "Never closed. Never without a customer!" The 
               place has the same decor as it did 75 years ago. It's also a 
               spot where everyone minds their own business. One of the OLD 
               TIME WAITERS leads OUR CAMERA to a table in the back where 
               Mashkov sits across from a LAPD HOMICIDE DETECTIVE. He slides 
               over an envelope of cash and a photograph of Karen.

                         Fresh off the bus. One of Danya's 
                         guys picked her up hitchhiking 
                         downtown.

                         They're all yours Saturday. You can

                         I needed a fast answer.

                         And I'm the Shell Answer Man. A guy 
                         who works the counter at your cousin's 
                         shop told me that someone named Skinny 
                         Pete had been asking around about 
                         gold bricks with the face of a 
                         Balinese girl on them. Same gold 
                         bricks your cousin was buying.

                         You talked to this Skinny Pete?

                         I thought you'd want a shot at him 
                         first.

               INT. RENTED WAREHOUSE - DAY

               Handsome Rob does some final tune-ups on the Minis.

               Half-Ear loads a triple charger chemical grenade into a 
               launcher.

               Charlie steps into the U-Haul which is parked in here...

               INT. U-HAUL

               Lyle is fixing glitches on his computer program. Stella is 
               doing her nails. Charlie looks at her.

                                     STELLA
                         You want the safe cracked, don't 
                         you?

                         Yeah.

                         Then I have to have perfect nails.

               Square tips have a more even surface area. Better grip, no 
               slipping.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Are you making this shit up?

                         your getaway, not even Rockefeller

               INT. STEVE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               He's getting dressed for his date. We can tell by the way he 
               preens in front of the three sided full length mirror, 
               adorning himself in the most expensive fashion, that he is a 
               vain and arrogant man.

               EXT. RENTED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

               The three Minis pull out of the warehouse and head off down 
               the road. The U-Haul follows.

               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI (MOVING) - NIGHT

               Leading the pack. He wears a headset and mic.

               Lyle drives. His Vespa is parked in the cargo bay with his 
               equipment.

               EXT. STEVE'S DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

               Looking sharp, Steve gets into his Ferrari.

               EXT. OPORTO DRIVE - NIGHT

               The U-Haul is idling on the side of the street about a mile 
               down from Steve's house. The Vespa is parked behind it.

               From up ahead, we see the Ferrari cruising down the winding 
               road. As it passes by.

               INT. U-HAUL

               Lyle speaks into his headset:

                         For those about to rock, we salute

               From side streets, the Minis converge on the road and head 
               up towards Steve's house.

               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI (MOVING) - NIGHT

               He can feel the adrenaline already starting to course through 
               is body.

                                     CHARLIE
                         This is it, guys. Moment of truth.

               He takes a sharp curve... and the moment that Steve's house 
               should come into view... he hits the brakes, his expression 
               turning to complete surprise.

               HIS POV

               The neighbor across the street from Steve is having the 
               biggest party in town. The road is filled with parked cars 
               and arriving guests. Ain't no way they're blowing the gate, 
               launching chemical grenades or in any way robbing Steve's 
               house in the midst of this.

               CHARLIE'S FACE

               As he takes this in, there's a KNOCK on the window. He turns. 
               Sees a uniformed VALET. Rolls down the window.

                                     VALET
                         Are you hear for the Baxter party, 
                         sir?

               EXT. OPORTO DRIVE - NIGHT

               We see the three Minis pull tight U-turns and head back the 
               way they came.

               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI (MOVING) - NIGHT

               He slaps his hand against the steering wheel, fuming.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Shit. Stella?

               INT. STELLA'S MINI (MOVING) - INTERCUT

               She already knows what he's going to say.

                                     STELLA
                         I know. I've got a date tonight.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You'll have to fake it. Laugh at his 
                         jokes. You need him to ask you out 
                         again.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. AGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               A posh restaurant. As OUR CAMERA FINDS Stella and Steve, she 
               is laughing at something he said, faking her way through the 
               date. They're sitting at an intimate table.

                                     STELLA
                         You really make laugh.

               He takes the lie like the compliment she wants him to think 
               it is.

                                     STEVE
                         So here's what I have lined up for 
                         after dinner. We'll go to Club Deep. 
                         The Ferrari always gets me to the 
                         front of the line. We'll do a little 
                         dancing...

                                     STELLA
                         Not tonight. I don't want to be out 
                         late.

                                     STEVE
                         Why the curfew?

                                     STELLA
                         Let's just say I've made some wrong 
                         calls in the past. I like to take 
                         things slow, cautious. Next time...

                                     STEVE
                         I understand. You have nothing to 
                         worry about. You can trust me.

                                     STELLA
                         I trust everyone. It's the devil 
                         inside them that I don't trust.

               That saying strikes Steve.

                                     STEVE
                         That's an interesting saying.

                                     STELLA
                         What?

               He looks at her closely, really closely.

                                     STEVE
                         There's only person I've ever heard 
                         say that. Used to say it all the 
                         time.

               This worries her. Because of course, she used to hear it 
               from her father.

                                     STELLA
                         Who was that?

               Under the table, he grabs her by the wrist, squeezes it like 
               a vise.

                                     STEVE
                         A man named John Bridger. Where did 
                         you pick up that phrase?

                                     STELLA
                         Ow. I don't remember. You're hurting 
                         me.

                                     STEVE
                         John Bridger was a thief. And he had 
                         a daughter. About your age. He told 
                         me that she took over a safe and 
                         lock company that he used as a front.

                                     STELLA
                         Let go of my wrist. What is wrong 
                         with you? It's just a saying.

               Steve's voice is calm, so at ease that watching them you'd 
               think this was pleasant dinner conversation.

                                     STEVE
                         No wonder I liked you right away. 
                         Just like I liked your old man, right 
                         up until the moment I shot him in 
                         the head. Now tell me who you're 
                         working with and tell me the plan. 
                         Do it now or we'll go for a ride and 
                         I'll break every bone in your body.

               Stella intentionally knocks over a glass of wine. It shatters 
               on the floor. An emergency signal...

               Charlie, Half-Ear, Handsome Rob and Lyle appear around the 
               table.

               Steve is shocked to see the men he left for dead three years 
               ago standing before him, very much alive.

               They pull up chairs from another table, encircling him for a 
               tense and pointed talk.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Something wrong, Steve? You look 
                         like you want to call Ghostbusters.

               Half-Ear furtively slides the switchblade out of his boot.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         She's coming with us. You got a 
                         problem with that?

                                     STEVE
                         Fine by me. But it's you that has 
                         the problem.

                                     LYLE
                         How do you figure?

                                     STEVE
                         You've just blown the one thing you 
                         had going in your favor, the element 
                         of surprise. And I was surprised.
                              (he laughs unpleasantly)
                         Jesus Christ when I saw all you guys 
                         come out of the woodwork. For a minute 
                         I thought maybe you were ghosts. But 
                         you're screwed now.
                              (an arrogant sneer a 
                              Half-Ear)
                         Did you figure out how to take care 
                         of my security guard? I'll hire five 
                         more.
                              (at Lyle)
                         You know how to bypass my alarm 
                         system? I'll have a new one installed 
                         tomorrow.

                         Does it tear you up inside seeing 
                         what car I drive? I'll buy a matching 
                         one in red.
                              (at Stella)
                         You think you can crack my safe? 
                         You'll end up the same way as your 
                         dad.
                              (then to Charlie, all 
                              smiles)
                         Looks like Good Time Charlie's got 
                         the blues.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You can wear that shit-eating grin 
                         on your face, but I know under that 
                         Versace shirt you're in a cold sweat. 
                         And you're not going to sleep a minute 
                         tonight. Cause you thought you'd 
                         gotten away with it free and clear. 
                         You thought you'd gotten rid of us. 
                         You're the one who's screwed. Right 
                         to the wall.

                                     STEVE
                         Give it your best shot. I'll outsmart 
                         you every step of the way. And this 
                         time, I'll bury you myself.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (taking the challenge)
                         Get more guards. Change the alarm. 
                         Buy a dozen Ferraris. We'll still be 
                         here. Sleep tight.

               Charlie grabs a bread stick off the table and goes. The others 
               follow.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STRIP CLUB - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

               The door bursts open as the burly man we met earlier is 
               dragged inside at gunpoint. Five Ukrainians armed with MAC-
               11 machine pistols storm the room where Skinny Pete works.

               Mashkov walks behind the posse. He carries a duffel bag. He 
               takes in the sight of the fattest man he's ever seen.

                                     MASHKOV
                              (in accented English)
                         Do you know who I am?

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         You work for Danya.

                                     MASHKOV
                         Yes. And you are gonna be straight 
                         with me and everything's gonna be 
                         okay. You fuck with me, I will be 
                         ruthless.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         I understand.

                                     MASHKOV
                         I don't want you to understand. I 
                         want you to overstand.

                                     SKINNY PETE
                         Overstand... Okay.

                                     MASHKOV
                         Because if you don't overstand, I 
                         will use this.

               Mashkov nonchalantly opens the duffel bag and pulls out a 
               short-handled ax. Skinny Pete sees dried blood on the blade.

                                     MASHKOV
                         Someone was asking about gold bars 
                         with a Balinese girl's face on them. 
                         I want the name of this man.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHUTTER'S ON THE BEACH - MORNING

               The sun shines over the ocean and the hotel.

               INT. CHARLIE'S HOTEL ROOM

               The crew is gathered. Lyle, monitoring digital surveillance 
               on his laptop, takes off his headphones.

                                     LYLE
                         Well we scared him alright. He's 
                         flying the coop. His security guard 
                         called Brink's Armored Car Service 
                         to confirm a 5 p.m. pick up at his 
                         house, then JetClub to confirm a 
                         MD11 cargo plane departing from the 
                         Imperial Terminal at LAX at 8 p.m.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Confirmed? How'd we miss the first 
                         calls?

                                     LYLE
                         They must have been cellular. The 
                         cargo plane is being chartered to 
                         Mexico City.

                         Only place with worse smog and traffic 
                         than L.A.

                         Once the charter's in the air, he 
                         could change the flight path to 
                         anywhere. And good-bye gold.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Not so fast. This is good news for 
                         us.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Good news?

                                     CHARLIE
                         Sometimes when you're up to your ass 
                         in alligators you forget that you 
                         started off trying to drain the swamp.

                         Meaning what the fuck?

                                     CHARLIE
                         We've been trying to get to the gold 
                         in the safe. Now the safe is coming 
                         to us. We'll boost it in transit.

               He might as well have said they'll steal the Holy Grail before 
               sunrise.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Charlie. He could take a dozen 
                         different routes to the airport and 
                         we have no idea which one. We can't 
                         take out an armored truck during 
                         rush hour.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We're already set to do it. Napster: 
                         how would you like to create the 
                         biggest traffic jam in the history 
                         of Los Angeles?

                                     LYLE
                         Keep talking.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You gridlock every route except the 
                         one we choose. Force the truck to go 
                         exactly where we want it to go.

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         But where do we want it? We can't 
                         shoot it out with armed guards in a 
                         Brink's. We'd lose. And even if we 
                         pulled it off, the cops would be all 
                         over us, chasing us all the way to 
                         Union Station. We're outmanned and 
                         outgunned.

                                     CHARLIE
                         But not outsmarted.

               Charlie hums with focused energy. There's a term for it in 
               horse racing. When a thoroughbred is at peak condition, and 
               twitching with eagerness to run, he is "on the muscle." That 
               describes Charlie right now.

                                     CHARLIE
                         We'll do it like the Italian job. 
                         We'll make thirty million in gold 
                         drop out of sight.

               They're interrupted by Charlie's cell phone RINGING. This 
               throws them all off.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Who else has this number?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         No one but us.

               It's still RINGING. Charlie decides to answer it.

                         Do what?

               OUR CAMERA TRACKS AROUND to Philly Steak's face which is 
               weathered and as leathery as a football. An old school crook.

                         Listen to me. You've gotta get out 
                         of L.A. Now.

                         What're you talking about? We didn't 
                         clip anybody.

                         Well Skinny Pete just called me. 
                         Yevhen's cousin is under the distinct 
                         impression that you did.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Why does he think that?

                         Because you wanted, to know about 
                         the gold with the Balinese Girl. 
                         Plus I guess Pete was under duress. 
                         This Ukrainian thinks he's Paul 
                         Fucking Bunyan.

                         Do you know how to get in touch with 
                         him?

                         Yeah but... 

                                     CHARLIE
                         Maybe there's a way we can play this 
                         to our advantage.

                                     PHILLY STEAK
                         Are you out of your mind? Listen to 
                         me, Charlie. Get out of L.A. Now. 
                         Cause if there's one thing I know, 
                         it's that you never mess with Mother 
                         Nature, mother-in-laws, or mother-

               stuffed with her only belongings, creeps into the kitchen 
               with two 3/4" videotapes in hand.

               She sets them down on the counter. They say MASTER TAPE on 
               the labels. She opens the microwave oven. Puts the tapes 
               inside. Sets the timer for 60 minutes at the highest level 
               and presses the start button.

               As the videotapes start to cook, we watch Karen flee out the 
               door.

               and Lyle's Vespa. We see traffic flowing through the busy 
               intersection next to the vehicles. Then WE BOOM DOWN, really 
               fast, right into the black pavement and --

               THROUGH THE DARKNESS and out the other side, so we are now 
               underground in the middle of the --

               where Half-Ear is at work, mounting Nitramon primer to the

                         of high school.

               There's a RUMBLING SOUND in the distance.

                         Secret's safe with me.

               The RUMBLING grows unbearable as a Metro roars closer, 
               headlights gobbling up the dark tunnel. They press themselves 
               into a crevice in the wall.

               With a ROAR and a gust of wind, the Metro howls by. It makes 
               their jaws clatter.

               Handsome Rob's Mini is parked on the side of the winding 
               road. Using binoculars, he looks down onto Oporto Drive at 
               Steve's house. Into his headset:

                                     HANDSOME ROB
                         Everything's quiet here. Over.

               INT. METRO RAIL TUNNEL - DAY

               The Nitramon is applied. Half-Ear closes his eyes. Charlie 
               observes him a moment.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You okay?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Ah huh. Just need a moment's 
                         meditation.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Now?

                                     HALF-EAR
                         I'm about to insert a wire into a 
                         detonator tube and if the wire touches 
                         the sides of tube, we'll be blown to 
                         Kingdom Come. Best to be at one with 
                         yourself.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Take all the time you need.

               Another moment, then Half-Ear sets to work. Charlie holds a 
               mini-flashlight, illuminating the intricate detonator. Very 
               carefully, he inserts a wire into a tube. Remember, the wire 
               must not touch the sides.

               The wire is half-way in when a LARGE SPIDER drops onto his 
               hand. Frozen, he ponders this.

               Charlie sees the spider, doesn't know what to do.

               Half-Ear studies the spider... then he closes his eyes just 
               a moment... relaxes... breathes in, breathes out... and then --

               He leans forward, opens his mouth and clamps his lips over 
               the spider, comes back up. Finishes inserting the wire.

               Job done, he calmly opens his mouth. The spider puts a hairy 
               leg out and delicately explores his cheek. Half-Ear plucks 
               it off just as delicately, depositing the spider on the wall.

               Charlie just shakes his head in disbelief.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         My work here is done.

               A Brink's truck climbs the road towards Steve's house, flanked 
               by two BMW K1200LTA motorcycles.

               EXT. MARAVILLA DRIVE - SAME TIME

               Through binoculars, Handsome Rob is still keeping an eye on 
               Steve's house from the higher vantage point.

               HIS POV

               The front gate rises. The Brink's truck and motorcycles are 
               let inside and head up the driveway.

               But then he sees a SECOND ARMORED truck drive up, also guarded 
               by two motorcycles. And a third Brink's followed by 
               motorcycles turns into the driveway.

               EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE

               It's a convoy of matching armored trucks...

               The caravan of armored trucks and motorcycles now head down 
               the driveway. The Ferrari follows behind.

               Handsome Rob sees the vehicles head east on Oporto. He reports 
               into his mike:

                         truck has the gold?

               Charlie is just as frustrated... but in a tight spot he always 
               comes up with an idea.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You can monitor the traffic video 
                         cameras from your laptop, right?

                         Where's the first camera the trucks 
                         will go past?

               Lyle hits a command key and we now see the intersection of 
               Woodrow Wilson Drive and Cahuenga where vehicles are driving 
               under the traffic signal that a traffic video camera is 
               mounted to.

                         Cahuenga Boulevard. They all have to 
                         cross that.

                                     CHARLIE
                         The weight of the gold will lower 
                         the suspension on the truck.

               the image of the Brink's truck. He strikes another key, 
               momentarily FREEZING the image. He makes a visual check of 
               the top of the armored truck against the Cahuenga Boulevard 
               street sign.

               He unfreezes the first image just in time to check out the 
               next armored truck in line. FREEZE. The top of this truck 
               also lines up perfectly with the top of the street sign.

               We see the truck with the California plate AWP82092. OUR 
               VIEW RISES UP until we're looking at an AERIAL VIEW as the 
               three armored trucks and their motorcycles fan out in three 
               different directions, with the Ferrari going in a fourth 
               direction.

               At the same time, we see Charlie get out of the U-Haul and

               Pandemonium. People scatter. A man jumps out of his BMW and 
               sprints away from the explosion.

               Lyle gets out of the U-Haul and runs to his getaway vehicle: 
               the Vespa. He's about to hop on, but something stops him...

               The sight of the vacant, shimmering, 2002 BMW 750iL parked 
               just ahead, keys dangling from the ignition.

               his best to remain calm but Jesus, that was close.

               Suddenly, Handsome Rob veers off the road and WHAM. He takes 
               down a chain link fence and is now in the parking lot of 
               the:

               EXT. CONVENTION CENTER

               His white Mini catapults across the asphalt, the motorcycle 
               still right behind.

               INT. HANDSOME ROB'S MINI

               Up ahead, he eyes the open door entrance to the Convention 
               Center. Stomps the gas.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         What are you doing?

               The turbine howls.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         What -- are -- you -- doing?

               EXT. CONVENTION CENTER

               The Mini squeezes through the doorway and into the --

               INT. CONVENTION CENTER

               It's the STAR TREK GRAND SLAM 2002 convention in full swing.

               Display tables are lined up in the cavernous hall and the 
               Mini snakes through the maze and the Trekkies as --

               The motorcycle follows right behind and the chase is really 
               on now.

               THUDA THUD THUDA, the Mini's wheels climb a flight of steps.

               Waves of people flee the path of the little car and --

               THUD, THUDA, THUD, the motorcycle follows right behind.

               The Mini zips down the wide Concourse Hall -- travels 
               underneath banners of Star Trek characters that hang from 
               the ceiling -- the motorcycle keeps up, tires tearing into 
               the carpeting.

               INT. HANDSOME ROB'S MINI

               He shifts, swerves, avoiding people, obstacles.

                                     HALF-EAR
                         Go that way!

               Handsome Rob turns, taking them down the --

               WEST HALL

               that stretches out toward the Staples Center.

               WHIZ. The Mini goes by. WHIZ. The motorcycle goes by.

               Then --

               The Mini steamrolls through the exit doors and --

               EXT. CONVENTION CENTER/STAPLES CENTER

               It bounds down outdoor steps and ramps onto the outside 
               entrance to the Staples Center, fitting snugly between cement 
               pillars that are designed to keep regular-sized cars out.

               INT. STAPLES CENTER - DAY

               The Mini bulldozes through glass doors. Across the lobby.

               Down an aisle that leads right to --

               CENTER COURT

               where OUR L.A. LAKERS are in the midst of practice. The Minis 
               do look like matchbox cars next to these towering players.

               The car's tires leave a streak of rubber on the parquet floor. 
               The team clears a path. The car is off the court before they 
               know it.

               But now the players see the motorcycle coming down the aisle.

               See the guns. See security guards running after it.

               KOBE BRYANT picks up a basketball.

               The motorcycle charges across center court.

               Kobe aims... hurls the ball. It RAMS into the motorcycle's 
               handlebars. The bike spins out of control and into a nasty 
               fall, spitting off the riders while --

               EXT. STAPLES CENTER

               The Mini crashes out the opposite side of the arena and glides 
               right through the L.A. Sports Arch of Fame before escaping 
               onto Figueroa. Meanwhile:

               EXT. SOUTH ALAMEDA - DAY

               The Ferrari is eating up the pavement as it hounds after 
               Stella. Two police cars are roaring after them both.

               INT. STELLA'S MINI

               She slaps the gears into action, maneuvers tight turns around 
               the cars in her path, just like she does at home with Jack 
               Daniels.

               EXT. SOUTH ALAMEDA

               A cop car tries to pass the same car as the Ferrari but 
               smashes into an oncoming vehicle. As it spins like a corkscrew --

               EXT. FERRARI

               The rear tires spin smoke and it launches like a missile 
               after the Mini.

               INT. STELLA'S MINI

               She keeps flooring it... the gauge rising... the customized 
               engine screaming...

               But the Ferrari, like an unstoppable force, hangs menacingly 
               in her rearview mirror.

               I/E FERRARI

               Steve RAMS into the rear bumper of the blue Mini. The bumper 
               tears off, rolls across the pavement. The Ferrari is about 
               to make another charge.

               INT. STELLA'S MINI

               She yanks the wheel left to avoid the hit. Suddenly finds 
               herself in the path of an ARROWHEAD WATER TRUCK. She yanks 
               the wheel right to avoid a collision.

               INT. ARROWHEAD WATER TRUCK

               The truck driver hits the brakes, over compensating as he 
               turns away from the Mini and --

               EXT. SOUTH ALAMEDA

               The truck falls over onto its side, sending those big jugs 
               all over the road, water exploding into the air and --

               The Ferrari crashes through the jugs, one rolling up the 
               hood and over the windshield, dousing it like a car wash.

               The lane is blocked by the wreck. Steve makes a right turn.

               The police cruiser hits the brakes but not fast enough. It 
               slams into the water truck.

               EXT. 5TH STREET

               Steve turned onto a one-way street and he's going the wrong 
               way. A Jeep Wrangler almost runs into him head-on but both 
               cars stop just in time.

               The DRIVER of Wrangler, a muscular fire plug of a guy, jumps 
               out, furious.

                                     FURIOUS DRIVER
                         What's wrong with you, you stupid-
                         ass, son of a bitch, dickhead...

               As more invectives are hurled, Steve gets out of the Ferrari 
               and walks towards the furious driver.

                                     FURIOUS DRIVER
                         What? You want a piece of me? C'mon, 
                         dumbshit. Bring it on. I'll be pulling 
                         peanuts out of your asshole --

               BANG. Steve shoots the guy's foot.

                                     FURIOUS DRIVER
                         Shit! Shit! You shot me in the foot!

               While the furious driver hops on one leg, Steve gets into 
               the Wrangler and takes off, abandoning the Ferrari. At the 
               same time --

               INT. BMW 750IL (MOVING) - SUNSET

               Lyle's coasting down Exposition Boulevard towards Union 
               Station. Clear sailing for him.

               He sees a young woman thumbing for a ride. It's Karen. And 
               he recognizes her: she was hitchhiking when he first arrived 
               in L.A. He pulls over. To Lyle, she might be an angel in the 
               empyrean if she wasn't, so completely, a woman.

                                     LYLE
                         Where are you going?

                         Away.

                         How about far, far away?

                         The farther the better.

               EXT. FIGUEROA & OLYMPIC - DAY

               Charlie's still having a helluva time getting rid of the 
               motorcycle. It screams like a Banshee as it streaks up 
               alongside the Mini. Charlie suddenly sees an AK-47 pointed 
               right at him.

               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI

               He jerks the steering wheel and swerves off the street, 
               driving through the parking lot of the historic Hotel 
               Figueroa.

               With the motorcycle dogging his heels, he looks up at the 
               building. It has three towers that rise up 12 stories, with 
               a giant mural of Albert Einstein covering one of the towers

               (it's an ad for Apple Computers: Think different.)

               Suddenly the LAPD helicopter swoops down towards the parking 
               lot, shattering the air, blowing up dirt and discarded 
               newspapers in a rush of turbo-wash, trying to box in the 
               Mini.

               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI

               He's got no place else to go...

               INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA

               The Mini squeezes through the entrance and into the lobby 
               with its exotic Moroccan decor. Horrified guests catapult 
               out of the way. The Mini drives past wooden statues, potted 
               palm trees.

               The motorcycle follows the car as it streaks towards the 
               elevator. Charlie looks back, sees the motorcycle. The 
               elevator door opens. Some tourists step off.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Going up?

               INT. ELEVATOR

               The Mini darts right in, not an inch to spare. Charlie reaches 
               out the window, presses the button for ROOF.

               He sees the motorcycle charging after him, burning rubber 
               across the beautiful tiled floor. Closer, closer.

               The door closes just in time.

               A second elevator opens, the motorcycle zooms inside, people 
               screaming at the sight of the guns.

               EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

               The doors open, PING, and the Mini reverses out, spins.

               LOOKING DOWN onto the building's rooftop, we see that it is 
               shaped like a capitol E, three towers connected by a narrow 
               strip. Each tower has its own elevator.

               INT. CHARLIE'S MINI

               He wants to drive across the rooftop strip but there's a big 
               problem: the giant sign that exclaims HOTEL FIGUEROA in red 
               and white neon lights blocks so much of the strip that even 
               the Mini couldn't squeeze through.

               In his rearview, he sees the second elevator door open and 
               out comes the motorcycle. He's trapped up here. But he's not 
               about to abandon ship.

               EXT. ROOFTOP

               So he floors it, slaps the gears, hurtles to the edge of the 
               first tower and in --

               EYE-POPPING CGI SLOW MOTION SHOTS

               His car hurls into the wide blue empty space... The ground 
               deliriously distant... Spiraling through the air like a 
               football...

               NEXT TOWER - ROOFTOP

               The Mini lands right-side-up with a THUD. Charlie, rattled, 
               looks over his shoulder and sees the LAPD helicopter rising 
               over the rooftop, turbines SCREAMING.

               And here comes the motorcycle. Flying from one section of 
               the rooftop to the next. It lands and the driver REVS it 
               forward --

               I/E CHARLIE'S MINI

               He speeds toward the edge of the roof and launches off towards 
               the third tower some twenty feet away. Lands. Keeps going to 
               the last elevator, skids to a stop.

               He reaches out, punches the call button. Then looks over his 
               shoulder to witness --

               THE MOTORCYCLE

               going full throttle to make the final rooftop to rooftop 
               jump.

               But its front wheel hits the edge slightly off-kilter...

               It soars but with a slight downward trajectory...

               Towards a large window on the top floor...

               Then lower...

               And the look on the driver's face says it all as...

               The front wheel of the motorcycle SMACKS into the side of 
               the building, just below the window.

               The guards are flung off the bike and their bodies CRASH 
               through the window as --

               A hunk of exploding metal imbeds itself in the side of the 
               LAPD chopper and --

               INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA

               The guards land in the Tangier Suite in a hailstorm of glass 
               shards.

               I/E. LAPD HELICOPTER

               Smoke billows out where the hunk of metal hit. The pilot 
               keeps it under control but it's time to go. With a WHINING 
               THROB, the injured chopper banks away.

               INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA LOBBY - DAY

               PING. The elevator door opens. Charlie's Mini shoots out 
               then skids out the lobby's exit. He made it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STELLA'S MINI (SPEEDING) - DAY

               She checks the rearview mirror. No sign of the Ferrari.

               Just a Jeep Wrangler back there.

               Stella looks relieved. Feels like she's home free.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. UNION STATION - SUNSET

               Stella's Mini pulls up to the ramp of the enclosed car carrier 
               at the end of Amtrak Train 59, bound for New Orleans.

               She can see the other two Minis are already inside. She gets 
               out and hands the cargo loader a ticket.

               EXT. UNION STATION - NIGHT

               The "All Aboard" announcement goes out over the PA system.

               Then the Superliner train pulls out of the station, quickly 
               picking up speed.

               INT. FIRST CLASS CAR - NIGHT

               The outside streaks by through the window. It's a happy crew. 
               Champagne is poured. Charlie holds up his glass and gets 
               their attention.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I want to make a toast. Cause there's 
                         somebody missing here today, and we 
                         all know who it is.

               They all raise their glasses.

                                     CHARLIE
                         To John Bridger. The most brilliant 
                         master planner of them all. We wish 
                         he was with us.

               We PAN ACROSS their faces. It's been a three year odyssey 
               for them. They got the gold, but they lost someone they loved.

                                     ALL OF THEM
                         To John.

               Clink.

               INT. CAR CARRIER - NIGHT

               OUR CAMERA MOVES past the three Minis parked inside...

               And STOPS at the last car in the carrier -- the Jeep Wrangler. 
               Its rear hatch rises and Steve creeps out. Looks around. 
               It's safe.

               He walks over to Stella's Mini. Pops open the trunk REVEALING 
               a silver Haliburton suitcase. He unzips the case.

               It's filled with stacks and stacks of gold bricks, the exotic 
               face of a Balinese girl on each one.

               Steve pulls out a brick, embraces it. He knows his gold.

               These bricks are real.

               But as he has a moment with his gold, BEHIND HIM, the trunks 
               of the other two Minis RISE in unison.

               Then Mashkov RISES out of the trunk of the white Mini.

               Another Ukrainian RISES out of the trunk of the blue Mini.

               Four more Ukrainians slide out from underneath the Minis.

               They cock their M-lls.

               CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK.

               Steve hears the sound from behind him. He turns around to 
               see the weapons pointed at him.

                                     MASHKOV
                         Take out your gun and drop it on the 
                         floor.

               Steve has no choice.

                                     STEVE
                         Who are you?

                                     MASHKOV
                         You knew my cousin. Yevhen.

                                     STEVE
                         I never knew anyone named Yevhen.

                                     MASHKOV
                         Get in the trunk. Not that trunk, 
                         this one. That gold is for us. A 
                         gift from some old friends of yours. 
                         They said to tell you that they didn't 
                         mind sharing the box of Cracker Jack, 
                         as long as you didn't get any. Not 
                         even the toy surprise.

               The Ukrainians force Steve into the trunk of the white Mini.

               And for the first time, he's scared. Looking up at Mashkov, 
               he begs.

                                     STEVE
                         Please. Don't shoot me. Please...

                                     MASHKOV
                         Don't worry. That wasn't the deal. 
                         I'm not going to shoot you.

                                     STEVE
                         Thank you. Thank God.

                                     MASHKOV
                              (to the others)
                         He really thought I was going to 
                         shoot him.

               The Ukrainians laugh. Steve tries to laugh.

                                     MASHKOV
                         No. No. I'm not going to shoot you. 
                         I'm going to hack off your limbs and 
                         bury you while you're still alive.

               And with that, he closes the trunk. THUD. Like the lid of a 
               coffin. And for Steve, the world falls into BLACKNESS.

               INT. FIRST CLASS CAR - SAME TIME

               Underneath the crew's seats, we see the other two silver 
               Haliburton suitcases filled with the rest of the gold. We 
               BOOM UP to our five thieves...

                                     CHARLIE
                         New IDs.

               Handsome Rob passes out new fake driver's licenses for when 
               they arrive in New Orleans.

                                     LYLE
                              (re: his fake license)
                         Simon Quackenbush? Could I -- just 
                         once -- have a cool name?

                                     HALF-EAR
                              (also complaining)
                         250_pounds?

               They're interrupted by the RING of Charlie's phone. He 
               answers.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Did you get what you wanted?

               INT. CAR CARRIER - INTERCUT

               Mashkov is on the other end of the line.

                                     MASHKOV
                         I'm happy.

               During this, Lyle types commands into his laptop that is 
               connected to a phone jack in the car.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It was good doing business with you.

               Lyle hits a final command and --

               INT. ENGINEER ROOM - SAME TIME

               signal box receives the command and --

               EXT. CAR CARRIER - SAME TIME

               The coupler between the car carrier and the rest of the train 
               is electronically disengaged.

               This causes the train to separate from the car carrier. The 
               train speeds on without it at 100 miles per hour.

               The car carrier slowly comes to a stop in the middle of 
               nowhere.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The Dining Car features crisp white linens and extended 
               windows for scenic dining. Lyle walks over to a table where 
               Karen is waiting for him. She looks resplendent.

                                     LYLE
                         Is this seat taken?

                                     KAREN
                         It is now.

               He sits. And as OUR CAMERA HOLDS ON Lyle, ready to embark on 
               a new life, we --

                         We did it.

                                     STELLA
                         We sure did.

                                     CHARLIE
                         There's something I've been meaning 
                         to ask you, Stella. But I've just 
                         been so busy lately, what with the 
                         explosion, car chase, Ukrainians and 
                         all.

                                     STELLA
                         It has been a hectic day.

                                     CHARLIE
                         It's about that thing you said to me 
                         back in Philadelphia.

                                     STELLA
                         That thing?

                                     CHARLIE
                         You said that you can't have a 
                         relationship with a pickpocket, gold 
                         robber, or any kind of thief.

                                     STELLA
                         Oh... That thing.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Do you still believe that?

                                     STELLA
                         Yeah. I do.

                         Well I was wondering... What about a 
                         retired pickpocket, gold robber, 
                         thief?

                         Now that's an entirely different 
                         question.

               And as an enigmatic smile settles across her face, we --
