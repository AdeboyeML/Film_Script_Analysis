          1 EXT. CHINATOWN STREET - MORNING 1

          The same crowded Chinatown street where Rand Peltzer first
          found Gizmo the Mogwai. As LOCALS bustle past, ANGLE FAVORS
          the stairs to the basement curiosity shop.

          2 INT. MR. WING'S STORE

          MR. WING, the storekeeper who took Gizmo home after the
          Gremlins' night of carnage, opens the door, beginning his day.
          As he lights his pipe, he HEARS a commotion upstairs.

          3 EXT. STREET 3

           PEDESTRIANS dodge a long black LIMOUSINE as it pulls up short.
           ANGLE reveals that most of the stores on the block have closed
           -- GOING OUT OF BUSINESS signs and boarded-up windows.
           FORSTER, a sour-faced man in a business suit, gets out of the 
           limo, followed by three beefy MEN, also in suits. The three
           big men take a big-screen TV VT and a VCR out of the car.
           INT. MR. WING'S STORE tj.
           Mr. Wing looks up from ' hers game as the four men sweep
           into the store.

           Mister Wi Daniel Clamp would
           like to see you.

           The men quickly set up the big-screen TV set and VCR. One of
          the men puts in a tape and hits some buttons, and the TV screen
          fills with the face of DANIEL CLAMP. At a young 40, he's New
          York's most successful real estate developer.

          CLAMP (ON TV)
          Good morning, Mister Wing. Let's
          out through to key issues, okay?
          I'm prepared to increase my offer
          substantially.

          (BEAT)
          Now, Mister Wing, you're attached
          to your business. I appreciate
          that. I'm attached to my own
          business. I develop the biggest
          buildings in New York, and you
          sell, ah, little things. Fine.
          But I'm not just talking about
          money here.
          On the big-screen TV, the IMAGE widens to incim a an easel
          beside Clam , holding an architect's RENDER that shows the
          grandiose of a huge office building,..

           Take a look, Mister Wing --

          (READS)
          "The Clamp Chinatown Center --
          Where Business Gets Oriented."
          When I put up a building, it's the
          biggest -- it's the newest -- it's
          the best. People are going to be
          killing each other to get into
          this building --
          The soft O.S. TWITTERING of Gizmo is heard from the rear alcove
          of the store.

           GIZMO (O.S.)
           Tee vee!

           CLAMP (ON TV)
           Now,'we've been able to reach an
           understanding with everyone on the
           block -- except for you. Let me
           show you what I willing to do
           for you -- a s tand and
           souvenir cone on, right here
           under the at The foot
           traffic thrr here is going to
           make the building look like
           a ghost town.

           Mr. Wing regards the video image impassively. 


           CLAMP (ON TV) (CONT.)
           Please IF us know when you've 
          made a decision, Mister Wing. You
          know, I believe that there's
          always an area of agreement that
          two people can reach.
           The Clamp Corporation's LOGO a stylized "C" -- fills the 
          wereen, replacing Clamp's image.

          MR. WING
          Yes -- a man can always agree with
          others. It is more difficult to
          agree with oneself.

          FORSTER
           Does that mean you -- 
          He's interrupted as Mr. Wing COUGHS -- a rattling spasm that
          sounds deeply unhealthy. When the coughing subsides, he
          answers Forster.

      

          MR. WING
          I'm sorry. Please tell Mister
          Clamp that the answer is no.

          FORSTER
          Keep the TV.
          As Mr. Wing walks Clamp's men to the door in b.g., HOLD on the
          TV set -- and a small, furry PAW that reaches into FRAME to
          change the TV CHANNEL.
          With the change of stations, the TV screen fills with a SCENE
          from a Rambo picture. SYLVESTER STALLONE addresses the movie

          CAMERA:

          STALLONE
          To survive a war... you've got to
          become war.
          Then he screws an explosive-filled metal ARROWHEAD onto an
          arrow, and SHOOTS the arrow from a bow. The arrow hits a
          HELICOPTER, which bursts into FLAMES.

          GIZMO (0.3.)
          Neat!

          But as the helicopter starts to burn, Mr. Wing comes back and
          angrily turns the TV set OFF, addressing the unseen Gizmo.

          MR. WING
          Television again! Ai-vuh !. An -
           invention for fools.

           Forster and the bodyguards are dri away from Mr. Wing's
          store.

          BODYGUARD
          I'm sorry that didn't work out,
          sir. I thought he'd like the TV.

          FORSTER
          You hear that cough? The guy must
          be eighty -- maybe ninety. We can
          wait.

          of the Gremlin siege of Kingston Falls. Though they're a few
          years older now, Billy and Kate are still small-town types, who

          18 INT. OFFICE AREA.----''s 18
          The advertising department of Daniel Clamp's empire occupies
          modern, "open-plan" offices -- endless beige partitions form
          tiny CUBICLES full of "ergonomic" furniture. Unseen speakers
          pipe in "WHITE NOISE" -- low-volume static to insulate
          conversations.

          MARLA
          Listen, this deadline. Its not
          my fault. They're making me
          miserable so I have to make you

           Billy and Marla a4lie at Billy's cubicle, whose "work station" 
           consists of a dra g board and several drawers. The PHONE is
          equipped with a VIDEO SCREEN. SPOT a small, struggling POTTED
          PLANT, and, pinned to the cubicle wall, Billy's DRAWING of the
          main street of Kingston Falls.
          On Billy's drawing board is an illustration of Clamp's
          projected Chinatown building -- _a l s monstrosity with insane
          pagoda touches. But Billy has tried to breathe some' 3 e into
          it, wit r T the street, kids flying dragon kites, etc.
          Marla looks over Billy's shoulder at the drawing.

          A JANITOR, pushing a cart of cleaning supplies, comes into the
          office area. Gizmo, on the floor, peeks around a corner to
          watch as the cart's wheels rumble past him.
          As SEEN by Gizmo, the towering janitor stops at the department's
          WATER FOUNTAIN and tries to get a drink. The fountain's spigot
          OVERSHOOTS, giving the janitor a SPLASH in the face.
          Gizmo inches away from the source of the water, and -- seeing a
          puddle on the carpet where the water landed -- carefully avoids
          it. He keeps moving, and evades a second ARC of errant water
          from the fountain.
          The janitor decides t )gx,the fountain. Attacking the spigot
           with a wrench, he sends off 1morq STREAMS of water. To duck
          0 them, Gizmo takes cover, back, isu; under Billy's desk...

          .down the side of the desk...
          Gizmo looks up, but too late. From his POV, the blob of paint-
          tinted water is huge, and coming down fast. It HITS him --
          -- and, as the janitor's feet and the wheels of his cart pass in
          â¬.g., CAMERA HOLDS on Gizmo on the floor, writhing in pain. The
          janitor leaves, and Gizmo SCREAMS, as -- THWIP! THWIP! -- two
          tiny FURBALLS shoot out of his body and land in the open DRAWER
          of a nearby filing cabinet.
          THWIP! The painful Mogwai replication continues, and a third
          furball caroms off a drafting table and into a wastebasket.
          THWIP! The fourth and final offspring shoots from Gizmo's body,
          and -- as Gizmo watches in horror and pain -- BOUNCES crazily
          around the office area, a little Superball of fur.
          As Gizmo sits up and looks up, we watch with him -- four newborn
          Mogwai HANDS reach out of the filing cabinet drawer, gripping

          S
          the top edge from inside.

          Mogwai with the demented juvenile Joie de vivre we associate
          with the great Daffy Duck.
          In the first seconds following birth, Daffy goes daffy over the

           the Vice President of the United States and starting "Thank you #
           for your generous contribution..." #
          As the letter turns into paper spaghetti, the secretary leaves
          the shredder on, turns to her computer, and starts typing down
          Clamp's dictation. SPOT her prim pink SWEATER hanging on the

          The claws withdraw from sight just as the secretary turns to
          pick up the sandwich again. She takes a bite -- and, though her

          The Gremlin responds by grabbing a SILEX POT of boiling-hot
          water from the nearby coffee station, and FLINGING the boiling
          water at Clamp --
          -- who ducks it, as it SCALDS the paint on the wall behind him.
          Clamp makes a tentative move toward the Gremlin, who THROWS the
          empty Silex. It barely misses Clamp, and SMASHES against the
          wall.
          The Gremlin JUMPS at Clamp, who tries to bat it away from his
          face, like a kid panicked by a moth --
          -- but his flailing knocks the Gremlin back, so that its foot is
          caught in the hopper of the secretary's SHREDDER. Hating to do
