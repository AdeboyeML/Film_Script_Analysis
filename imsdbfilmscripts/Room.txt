    Darkness. The faint background hum of a refrigerator. A light
    clicks on, briefly, then snaps off again.

    Then on again, for a little longer.

    We wake groggily with JACK (five), blinking up at MA (26).
    She's standing in a worn t-shirt and underwear beside a lamp,
    switching it on and off at apparently random intervals. She
    cranes up at the recessed skylight, Room's only window.

    The irregular flashes of lamp-light reveal glimpses of this
    little world lined with cork: ten foot a side, seven foot
    high, gabled ceiling rising to ten foot.

    Clusters of Jack's and Ma's vivid drawings are pinned all
    over the walls, quivering in the draft from the vents. Done
    with five crayons (red, yellow, blue, orange, green) and
    pencil on toilet tissue, lined pages or cardboard, they show
    dogs, trees, aliens, rocket ships, figures labelled 'Jack' or
    'Ma'. Delicate mobiles (uncooked spaghetti, threads,
    plastics, foil, down from pillows, cloth scraps) dangle.

    A wardrobe with slatted louver doors. On top, toys crafted
    from garbage, a Labyrinth from toilet-roll insides.

    A dresser with a TV. A homemade pack of cards, papier mâché
    checkers and chess. A Fort constructed from vitamin and other
    bottles and cans. A single meagre African violet in a pot on
    the TV.

    A round dining table, two fold-up chairs side by side.

    A bath with a single small towel over the side.
    A toilet, with a flotilla of homemade toy boats floating in
    the tank which is oddly missing a lid.

    A sink, with a single worn toothbrush, toothpaste, dish soap,
    a broken comb, folded rags for washcloths. A small square of
    mirror tile hung up over it.

    A small kitchen cabinet. A dish rack: two each of big and
    small white plates, bowls, tumblers, knives, forks, spoons
    (one with a melted handle), a scissors, can opener, serrated
    knife, wooden spoon, spatula.

    A basic stove (with more folded rags on its handle, for pot
    holders), one frying pan and one saucepan.

    A small refrigerator (more toys on top), a tiny trash.

    A rocker.    Above, a shelf. Ten books stacked. Homemade toys.

    A reddish Persian-style rug on the floor.

    A grey steel door, no handle. On the wall, a ten-digit
    keypad with a red light like a watching eye.

    Ma looks over at Jack and sees that he's awake. She mouths
    'Sh' at him, soothing him back to sleep. Keeps signalling.

    Darkness again, as Jack's eyelids fall.

    Ma puts breakfast on the table. Sits.

    Jack sits, too. Ma gives him a half vitamin pill from an
    almost empty tub. She takes a contraceptive pill from a

    A little later, Ma is brushing Jack's teeth (with their
    single, frayed brush) zealously. He spits with vigor.

    A little later. Ma scrubs the floor with an old cloth diaper
    while Jack watches TV. Both in t-shirt and jeans (Jack's with
    worn-out knees), but shoeless.

    This makes him switch the TV off fast and run to the door.

    Ma marks his height with a tiny 5 in black pen on the cork.

    Jack ducks and uses his fingers to measure the gap. Frowns.

     A little later Jack watches as Ma places blankets and a
     pillow on the floor of the wardrobe.

                         JACK
               Can we have more birthday cake?

               Tomorrow.

               We've brushed our teeth already.

                         JACK
               One more story?

     She checks her watch nervously: getting close to nine.

                         MA
               Jack, it's late. Come on.

     Jack jumps in and snuggles down. Pictures of Dora and her
     monkey Boots are glued on the back wall; this is a tiny room
     within Room. Ma covers him up for the night.

     She begins to sing `The Big Rock Candy Mountain'.

12   INT. ROOM - WARDROBE - NIGHT                               12

     A little later. Dim light comes through the slats. Jack lies
     stroking the dangling clothes, the pictures glued to the
     wardrobe. He freezes at the sound of the beeps that mean the
     outside door is about to open.

     He lies absolutely still, listening for Old Nick's entrance.
     He savors the scent of fresh air, but shivers: winter.

     Boom: now the door's shut again.

               Hey.

     Jack goes up on his elbow to squint through the slats but
     only sees a bit of the man's down jacket as he takes it off.

                         OLD NICK (O.S.)
               Here's the jeans.

                         MA (O.S.)

                         OLD NICK (O.S.)
               The grapes were way too much, so I
               got canned pears.

     Jack can see Ma as she puts groceries away.

                         MA
               OK.

     Now OLD NICK moves into view too. Forties, solidly built,
     blue-collar: a ordinary monster.

                         OLD NICK
               What's that? A birthday cake?

     He cuts himself a piece and eats it in a few bites.

     Ma starts getting undressed.

                         OLD NICK (CONT'D)
               Shoulda told me, I'd have brought
               him a present.

     Jack twitches at this thrilling possibility.
     Old Nick starts undressing too: like some dull marriage.

                         OLD NICK (CONT'D)
               What's he now, four?

     Jack, in the wardrobe, is all agog for Ma to correct him.

     Sounds of the adults getting into bed. The lamp clicking off.

     Then the familiar creaks of the bed. Jack doesn't know what
     they mean but is troubled. He counts them under his breath.

               Three hundred six, seven, eight -

     A primal grunt from Old Nick. The creaking is done. Jack is
     asleep at the bottom of the wardrobe.
     Old Nick goes over to the TV and switches on sports.

                         MA
               Shh.

     He turns down the volume. The sound of the sports broadcast
     overlaps with the thud of the door closing. The wardrobe door
     opens admitting the faint light of the L.E.D on the keypad.

     We cut to a shot of Ma putting a sleeping Jack into the bed.
     As she starts to climb in beside we pull back and crane up.

     Ma is using a needle and thread to take in Jack's new, much-
     too-big jeans. Jack finds a trodden cigarette butt under the
     corner of the rug. Old Nick must have brought it in on his
     shoe. Jack studies it.

     Later the same day. Ma is napping. Jack is playing on the
     floor. Counting things. Tracing the patterns of rug with his
     finger.

     What was that? He stares at the floor by the stove; glimpses
     something.

     Jack tiptoes over, but the moving thing is gone. He looks
     furtively at Ma then takes out the cake. He crumbles some and
     sets the plate on the floor. He squats and waits.

     A mouse puts its nose out, sniffs and takes a crumb.

     Something smashes into the stove: one of Ma's heavy books.

     Jack cries out in shock and distress.

                         JACK

     The third morning. Jack wakes up in the bed, where Ma always
     carries him once Old Nick has gone.

     Ma is up already, sitting at the table, staring at a shiny
     red truck and remote in a hard pack. The snake is in Eden.

     Jack can hardly believe what's in front of him. He looks at
     it for a while.

     CHAPTER TITLE: UNLYING The screaming get's louder.

     Later, Ma is standing on a chair screaming and howling at the
     Skylight. Jack stands in the bath screaming into the small
     air vent above the shelf. He holds his truck up to the vent
     so it can join in.

     Then they hush and listen.

     Later, Ma, preoccupied, trims mold off cheese she slices very
     thin and lays on brown bread. Puts it in the toaster oven.

     Jack zigzags his truck around chair and table legs. Ma checks
     to see if the frozen peas are boiling yet. Jack drives the

     That evening. Jack, in the wardrobe, is meant to be asleep
     but he's still playing with his truck.

     The door beeps; he kneels up for a glimpse as it booms shut.

                         OLD NICK (O.S.)
               Hey. What's the smell?

     He puts down groceries, unzips his jacket.

                         MA (O.S.)
               Sorry, I burned some cheese.

                         OLD NICK (O.S.)
               You need to take more care.

                         MA (O.S.)
               I will. I wasn't thinking.

                         OLD NICK
               Yeah, well, thinking's not your
               strong suit.

                         MA (O.S.)
               I know. I'm really sorry.

     Ma is unpacking the groceries.

                         OLD NICK
               So did he like his truck?

     He laughs at her speechless discomfort.

     Jack, frightened, shrinks back in the wardrobe knocking into
     the back panel. Old Nick turns his attention to the wardrobe.

     He roots in his jacket pockets and produces an already opened
     tube of hard candy.

     A little later, everything is quiet.   Moonlight.

     Jack, asleep in a crooked position, wakes with a jump. He
     sits up and rubs his neck. Finds his truck. He opens the door
     and peeks out. Where's the candy?

     He takes another few steps and stubs his toe on a huge boot.

     Jack stares at Old Nick, asleep in the middle of the bed.

     Ma is sleeping too, clinging to the far side.

     Now he's come this far, Jack forgets the candy, fascinated by
     Old Nick, whom he's seeing up close for the first time.

     Jack puts his finger out, almost touching Old Nick's face.

     Old Nick's eyes open, startled.   Then he grins.

     Shot of ice-crystals on the skylight. Silence: no
     refrigerator hum.

     Jack wakes first, shivering, though he doesn't know why. He
     is astonished by purple bruises around Ma's throat. As if she
     feels his gaze, Ma wakes and musters a smile. Jack notices
     the white clouds of their breath in the air.

                         JACK
               Ma, we're dragons.

     Ma sits up. Registers the chill. Getting out of bed, she
     turns on the lamp: no light. Jack is crushed to finds his
     Jeep, one wheel snapped off.

     Ma opens the refrigerator: dark inside. She's appalled.

                         MA
               He's cut the power.

     She glances at the keypad: its little red light is out.

     With a wild, illogical hope, she hurls herself at the door
     and claws at its edges - but it's still locked. Jack watches,
     bewildered: he's never seen her try to open it.

     Both are dressed in all their clothes in an effort to keep
     warm.

               think that very few things indeed
               were really impossible.

     Ma comes to the table and doles out half-thawed green beans.

               rot. Once we eat we'll feel warmer.

     Jack makes himself chew a limp bean. Ma nibbles a few, with a
     show of enthusiasm. Jack looks at his three-wheeled truck.

               There's no magic! Everything we see

               One night I stood behind the door

               - it used to have a lid, it was the
               heaviest thing in Room. When he
               came in I tried to smash it down on
               his head. But I messed up, Jack.
               He shoved the door shut and grabbed
               me by the wrist - that's why it's
               sore now.

                         JACK
               We could wait till he's asleep and
               kill him dead.

                         MA
               Yes we could, but then we'd have no
               more food - and we wouldn't know
               the code, on the door, to get out.

               I can't.   I'm stuck.

     He bursts into loud tears.

               Remember your superpowers.

     Jack cries harder. Ma unrolls him fast and hugs him. Then

     Jack clenches his teeth and starts to writhe and roll side to
     side.

     He rolls over face down, and gets his butt slightly in the
     air, bending the cylinder of the rug.

     He rolls the other way, sits up: the rug opens. He claws his
     way out, his face red and smeared. Ma is looking almost as
     distraught as him, but she grins.

     We're with Jack; glimpses of twilight sky, shrubs, hedge
     through the end of the carpet.

     A terrible pause as Old Nick contemplates the back yard. Then
     walks on. Jack is heaved face-down into the flatbed of an old
     pick-up.

     A pause - Jack senses a light going on nearby. Then the clang
     of a shovel being dropped onto the bed of truck beside the
     rug.

     Old Nick's footsteps, heading for the driver's seat. Sound of
     the truck rumbling to life.

     At last he remembers that he's meant to be wriggling out.

     He writhes, but the rug has tightened in transit.

     With an effort, Jack manages to roll over. No better.

     The engine quietens as the truck slows. Jack is not sure if
     that's his signal and anyway he's still trapped in the rug.

     The truck doesn't stop at the stop sign, only slows.

     Jack remembers his arm. He forces it above his head, wincing
     as the rug scrapes the skin off his elbow. Jack puts all his
     misery into movement, thrashing about, kicking, jack-knifing
     like a dying fish.

     The truck's engine lulls as it makes a rolling stop.

     Jack feels the rug slide a little across the flatbed, which
     gives him just enough momentum that he bends, with a deep
     grunt, and the rug starts to roll open.

     He bursts out, on hands and knees: like a birth. Elbow and
     lip bloody, face covered in hair, snot and tears.

     The world hits Jack: street lamps, wind in his face, shocking
     colors of the sunset. Trees and houses looming and then
     receding, like a rollercoaster.

     His glance falls on the shovel meant for his grave.

     Jack's eyes focus on the cab of the truck and what he
     realizes must be the back of Old Nick's head, driving.

     Old Nick slows at the third stop, and swings right. Jack is
     flung headlong, banging his leg on the left of the flatbed.
     The truck screeches to a stop, because Old Nick heard the
     noise and glimpsed Jack in his rearview mirror.

     He flings the driver's door open.

     Jack scrabbles over to the opposite side.

     Old Nick jumps down and strides around the truck.

     Jack leaps down to the tarmac, bloodying his left knee. His
     jaw smashes into his right knee. He picks a direction at
     random and tears away from the truck, stumbles, keeps going.

     A large dog on a long leash, emerges from a yard.

     CARRIE, both in winter outdoor clothes, follow.

     Jack runs into the man, finds himself on the ground with the
     dog snarling at him.

                         DOUG
               Boomer!

     He pulls the dog away by the collar.

     Old Nick catches up, and scoops Jack up with one arm.

     Pinned in the air, Jack lashes out in soundless terror. Old
     Nick strides back towards the truck with him.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
               Excuse me? Hey.

     Old Nick puts Jack down but holds his shoulders.

     Jack cringes, eyes on the ground.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
               I'm so sorry. Is your little girl
               OK?

                         OLD NICK
               It's under control.

     Doug stares at Jack's bloody knee, elbow, lip.

                         DOUG
               She been in some kind of accident?
               You want me to call someone?
                         OLD NICK
               I'll take care of it.

     Jack can't speak, but pulls out the note. Old Nick snatches
     it out of his hand, scrunching it.

                         DOUG
               What's that you got there, honey?

               business and I'll mind mine?

     He pulls out his cellphone and dials. Old Nick picks up Jack
     again and hurries to his truck.

     Doug waits impatiently for the emergency operator.

               Hey! Hey!

     Jack, lying in a heap, hears the driver's door slam.

     Then the engine starts. Jack looks around: the truck is
     barrelling towards him. Confused and dizzy, he crawls towards
     the sidewalk. The truck roars past: a getaway, not attempted
     murder.

     Jack watches the truck zoom through the next stop.

     He collapses and blinks up at the vast evening sky. After a
     beat, Doug, leaning in, interrupts the view. The dog is
     there, too.

                         DOUG (CONT'D)
               It's OK, Honey.

37   INT. STREET NEAR OLD NICK'S - DUSK                           37

     A patrol car pulls up at the scene. Doug leaves the still
     curled up Jack and hurries to the car to talk to the emerging
     OFFICER GRABOWSKI.

     Jack, shuddering with cold notices Carrie staring at him.

     He feels his lip, touches the blood, looks at it, tastes.
     Then sees an oval on the ground. He picks it up: a leaf.

     OFFICER PARKER, a female officer, hunkers down beside him.

                         OFFICER PARKER
               Hey there, I'm Officer Parker.
               What's your name?

     There's something reassuring about her and Jack forces
     himself to talk to one of these alien beings - but barely
     whispering, and he can't look her in the eye.

               The third time, I got banged.

                          JACK
               The third slow, everything went
               sideways -
                   (mimes being flung across

     She closes her eyes and fixes the geometry of Jack's journey
     in her mind.

     Minutes later. Outside an unlit house, with a Police van and
     a back-up, unmarked car parked facing the other way. A plain
     clothes OFFICER is knocking on the front door of the house.
     Jack watches through the car window as Officer Parker
     consults with an OLDER WHITE MALE OFFICER, also plain
     clothes. Parker and the older officer start to poke around
     the side of the house, disappearing for a moment before
     running back. Officer Parker takes what looks like a crowbar
     from the trunk of the car. She draws her weapon. Grabowski
     moves to leave the car.

                         OFFICER PARKER
               Stay with the boy.

     She disappears around the back of the house. Jack
     hyperventilates, thinking about Old Nick and Ma.

     We hear shouting, a crack of splitting wood. Jack starts
     clawing at the car door, can't find the handle.

                         OFFICER GRABOWSKI (CONT'D)
               Hey, hey, take it easy.

     A figure hurtles towards the car: Ma. She can't get the door
     open either because of the lock.

     Faces pressed to the glass, she and Jack almost touch. Then,
     at last the door is open and Jack is in her arms.

     the police cruiser moves through the night.

      Still in Ma's arms, Jack half wakes to find himself carried
      through a hospital emergency room. They are being bustled
      along by Officers Parker and Grabowski, A FEMALE PLAIN
      CLOTHES DETECTIVE, a DOCTOR, a NURSE and a HOSPITAL SECURITY
      GUARD. A woman in her 50s, is beside them, her arm around MA.
      This is NANCY, Ma's mother. It's like a strange dream to
      Jack. Through the group around him he can make out other
      figures waiting in chairs. He can hear a drunk shouting,
      phones ringing.

45    INT. HOSPITAL - MA AND JACK'S SUITE - DAY                 45

      Next morning. A bright hospital room. Jack and Ma share the
      fancy hospital bed. A cot bed, unused, has been set up to one
      side. Jack is awake but content to lie close to Ma for a
      while - studying the dials and switches on the wall above his
      head. He looks at Ma, asleep, bruises fading to yellow-green.
      He sits up and pulls back the sheet. He's wearing only a pair
      of underpants from Room which look particularly wretched in
      this new antiseptic environment. He touches the part of the
      mattress he's being lying on. It's damp. He examines a
      bandage on his knee. He gets up. On a side table, he sees a
      plate with the remains of some toast on it and a half drunk
      cup of tea. He sniffs at the food. There are two surgical
      masks there, also. He walks slowly to the opposite wall, his
      little figure silhouetted against the translucent blinds. He
      stops in front of the one window which has its blind drawn.
      The hospital suite is high up and the view is spectacular.

     Coming around on Jack's face we see that he is trying to make
     sense of what he's seeing. It takes him a moment to realize
     what he's looking at and how high above ground he is. His
     breathing quickens and he turns and scurries back to bed.

     He shakes his mom.

               waiting so long for you to wake I
               fell back asleep.

48   EXT. HOSPITAL - UPPER STOREY TERRACE - DAY                 48

     Hospital roof garden. Jack sticks close to Ma. She is dressed
     in track-suit bottoms and her old warm winter coat. Jack has
     pajamas under his robe and a warm coat which doesn't quite
     fit. Ma has a pair of her old boots on, Jack has trainers.
     They wear tinted glasses against the brightness of the day.
     Jack is a strange sight, the part of his face not covered by
     his mask (the others are unmasked) or woollen hat is smeared
     in heavy sun screen. They sit with Robert and Nancy. Nancy
     smokes a slim cigarette. Jack watches her cigarette for a
     while, then his attention is snagged by a nurse pushing an
     old woman in a wheelchair. He is also fascinated by the sky
     reflected in the mirrored glass of the building.

     Ma runs her hand along her coat.

     POLICE and HOSPITAL SECURITY are outside along with FBI
     agents, a VICTIM LIASON person and Ma's LAWYER.

     As Jack again takes in the scale of the outside world the
     adults get caught in the logistics of who goes in which car,
     who will take Ma's bag, what will happen at the other end of
     the journey. Jack observes the little clusters of people with
     their overlapping voices raised in clarification,
     reassurance...

     Ma and Jack are led to one of the waiting cars. Jack bumps
     his head getting in.

     We watch the convoy pulling away from the hospital and out
     into the world.

               I've been in the world nineteen
               hours. I've seen pancakes and
               stairs and a cat and windows and
               hundreds of cars and birds and
               police and doctors and Grandma and
               Grandpa, and persons with different
               faces and bigness and smells
               talking all at the same time. The
               world's like all TV planets on at
               the same time so I don't know which
               what to look and listen. Doors and
               doors and behind all the door
               there's another inside and another
               outside and things happen-happen-
               happening, it never stops.
               Plus the world's always changing
               brightness and hotness and there's
               invisible germs floating
               everywhere. When I was small I only
               knew small things but now I'm five
               I know everything.

     They turn onto a residential street of low houses and well-
     groomed lawns.

     It's all familiar to Ma yet utterly strange: a crowd of media
     (national and international) is set up across the road from
     her house behind temporary barricades. There are neighbors
     and well-wishers carrying helium balloons, flowers, toys, and
     signs. POLICE keep order.

     Nancy, Robert and a LAWYER emerge from the first car. Nancy
     manages an apologetic smile and half-wave to the neighbors
     who are watching from their own yards.

     RESIDENT AGENT leans in the driver's window to address Ma.

     They climb out, heads down, shielded by FBI agents. Jack
     stumbles, almost falls. Now they're outside they can hear a
     news helicopter overhead: it sounds like a war zone. Nancy
     joins them, taking Jack's hand, and they rush for the front

     Ma, like Jack, speaks quietly. It's as if they were in a
     doctor's waiting room or a stranger's house trying to make a
     good impression. All so unreal.

     only catch fragments of what she's saying.

     Conventional things, promising she is there, that there's
     nothing Ma can't say to her, how much she loves her. Ma is
     quiet, a little shell-shocked. Nancy leaves.

     Struck by the sight of her music keyboard, Ma tries it: dead.
     She kneels down, finds the plug and puts it in the outlet.

                         MA
               You didn't know I could play piano.
               Guess this tune...

     But after a few notes of 'Home on the Range'/'Big Rock Candy
     Mountain' she stumbles. Tries again, and messes it up.
     Stretches her stiff hand. Then she sits on the bed, suddenly
     limp. Checks her watch. It's gone; an old habit. Both Ma and
     Jack are subdued.

                         JACK
               How long do we have to stay here?

     She takes out her bag of meds.

                    needs)
               We live here now.

     She swallows her antibiotics and painkillers without water.
     She lies down. We stay on Jack's face as he continues to take
     in his surroundings and digest what Ma has said. After a
     little while he lies beside her and lifts her shirt so he can
     snuggle up and breastfeed.

     We repeat a sequence of shots from life before their escape
     ending in a mother & child portrait. In the little bedroom,
     they could be in Room.

60   INT. NANCY AND LEO'S HOUSE - KITCHEN / DINING ROOM - NIGHT 60

     Ma, with Jack pressed close to her, sits at the dining table
     with Nancy, Robert and Leo. Desert. Jack is eating his first
     bowl of ice-cream. He takes a big mouthful and holds his hand
     to his head. He tugs at Ma and she leans down so he can
     whisper to her.

     Small talk as food is passed around. Ma puts her fork down,
     she is beginning to get upset. Nancy watches her, puts a hand
     on hers. After a little while Ma calms.

     They eat quietly, the adults aware of the complexity and
     strangeness of the situation. Jack, oblivious, chomps away at
     his ice-cream. Robert watches him.

     Jack lies awake beside his sleeping mom.

     He hears footsteps. The door cracks open and a convoluted
     shadow appears, rimmed in light. The door opens wider and the
     shadow resolves into Robert, watching his daughter and
     grandson sleep. Jack burrows into his pillow pretending to
     sleep. The door closes and soon he sleeps.

      Through a chink in net curtains of a car pulling up outside
      Nancy and Leo's house. The Lawyer gets out. We see that the
      press has thinned out substantially. There are a few curious
      MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC with nothing better to do, a UNIFORMED
      POLICE OFFICER and a POLICE CAR.

     The LAWYER and Nancy watch Ma filling out some forms. She is
     subdued. Jack has some blank paper in front of him. He is
     staring at a large open box of Crayola pencils; every shade
     of every color. He carefully selects 5 pencils - the 5 colors
     he's used to from Room - and begins to draw.

                Jack, you have all those colors.
                Why don't you use them. You could

      the sitting room. From where he sits he can see the open door
      to his and Ma's bedroom. It's dark inside. Eventually, Leo
      walks into view with a male DETECTIVE and a female VICTIM

     He lets them out, closes the door behind them, then peeps
     through the closed curtains. As he turns away, he spots Jack,
     gives him a salute and then busies himself in ways calculated
     to raise the interest of a 5-year-old. Tidying up, he picks
     up a ball from the floor, spins it on his finger, bounces it.
     Wanders off out of view, whistling, muttering about how
     particularly bouncy this ball is, etc.

     Jack starts down the stairs. He goes down on his backside not

     The back yard is a simple rectangle of grass bounded by
     barkdust and shrubbery with a few small trees. But to Jack it
     is a new cosmos. He wanders tentatively into the open space.
     Jack kneels to investigate the dirt and grass. He smells
     deeply.

     Jack's shoes are irritating him.

     She picks up her old laptop from the floor by the bed. She
     has been looking through her friends pages on Facebook. She
     clicks on a couple of pages showing the same girls as they
     are now, then loses interest, closes the laptop.

               Real estate. I mean I graduated
               Environmental Studies and I'm still
               super passionate about that - like
               what we're doing to this planet,

82   EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - DAY                               82

     The car drifts around, eventually finds a spot. Ma, Jack and
     Laura emerge. Jack is facing away from the mall. He is held
     by the big open view of the car park and road network beyond.

     They start to walk towards the entrance. Ma stops and
     crouches down. Puts her hands on Jack's shoulders and speaks
     tenderly.

     They walk through the whooshing doors of the mall and step
     onto the ascending escalator. In the atrium, mobiles,
     banners, skylights. Teenagers, families, everyone scanning
     the myriad goods on display. At the top of the escalator Jack
     sees a huge array of fruit and vegetables outside a
     supermarket.

     Further along, they pass a bookstore. Jack spots a display of
     new Dylan the Digger books. He grabs one.

                         JACK
               Ma, it's Dylan!

     The girls cart Jack into the store among the hanging clothes
     and mirrors.

     They tear through the racks. Techno music throbs. The
     mannequins leer.

     For a moment Jack loses track of the girls. The clothes are
     everywhere.

     Ma goes and stares at the shoe display. Many colors, many
     styles. She's paralysed. Jack is close beside her.

      An adult torso, Leo's, comes into the frame, driving with
      full force against the door which gives a little. Jack puts
      his face to the gap and sees Ma's hair spread out on the
      floor.

      A little later. Jack gets glimpses of chaos: on the bathroom
      floor, TWO PARAMEDICS working on Ma (who responds just enough
      that we know she's not dead), Nancy in the bathroom doorway,
      Leo trying to calm her.

      But no sound.   It's as if Jack has been deafened by an
      explosion.

      Later: as Ma is carried out in the background, Jack sits on
      the floor. We push in on him; he is hypnotized by the
      flashing ambulance lights on the wall.

                There's so much of place in the
                world, there's less time because
                the time has to be spread extra
                thin over all the places like
                butter, so all the persons say
                hurry up, let's get going, pick up
                the pace, finish up now. Ma was in
                a hurry to go boing up to heaven
                but she forgot me, Dumbo Ma, so the
                aliens threw her back down
                craaaaaaaash and broke her.

      Next morning. Jack in a ball on the bed. He opens his fist;
      Bad Tooth, all he has of Ma.

                Sorry. There's none left.

      Jack think for a bit, accepts the new situation.

                            JACK
                OK.

                          MA
                I'm not a good enough Ma.

                          JACK
                But you're Ma.

                            MA
                I am.

      She puts her arm around him. They sit in a gentle silence.

                          JACK
                I'm going to play with Aaron now.
                He's my friend.

      Ma hugs him hard before he leaves.

      Ma and Jack look out to sea.

                          JACK (V.O.)
                When I was four I didn't even know
                about the world and now me and Ma
                are going to live in it forever and
                ever till we're dead.
120    INT. NANCY AND LEO'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY                120

       Ma and Jack water their new African Violet.

                           JACK (V.O.)
                 This is a street in a city in a
                 country called America on the earth
                 that's a blue and green planet
                 always spinning so I don't know why
                 we don't fall off. Then there's
                 Outer Space, and nobody knows
                 where's heaven.


120A   INT. NANCY'S HOUSE - LOUNGE - NIGHT                       120A

       Ma and Nancy are curled up together on the sofa. Leo is
       there, too. The adults laugh as Jack fools around with
       Seamus.

       Ma and Jack are parked outside a Mom & Pop Burger Joint. They
       eat in the car.

                           JACK (V.O.)
                 Ma and I have decided that because
                 we don't know what we like we get
                 to try everything.

       Ma and Jack sit in a hammock in the back yard. The weather is
       turning warmer.

                           JACK
                 We have so many things to do.
                 Flying in an airplane.

                           MA

      Ma looks concerned.

                          JACK (CONT'D)
                Just for a visit.


124   INT. POLICE CAR - DAY                                    124

      A police car pulls up outside Old Nick's. Jack, Ma and
      Officer Parker get out. They stare at the house, still
      surrounded by crime-scene tape.

                          OFFICER PARKER
                Follow me, guys.


125   INT. OLD NICK'S HOUSE - LOUNGE - DAY                     125

      The car port is now sealed off and the only way out back it
      through the house. Jack follows Ma and Officer Parker inside.
      It's tidy (except for a desk ransacked by police),
      anonymously banal: a leather suite, a cross-trainer, a flat-
      screen TV.


126   EXT. OLD NICK'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY                  126

      They step out into the back yard. Jack's gaze moves to the
      grey shed. A double-take: it's Room.

      With an enormous bulldozer beside it.

      Ma heads for the shed, Jack right behind her.

      Officer Parker stands nearby. There's a MALE OFFICER there
      also, guarding the scene.


127   INT. ROOM - DAY                                            127

      They step in. Drawings stripped off the walls, furniture
      shifted: the magic's gone. Jack stares and sniffs the air.

                          JACK
                This isn't Room. Has it gotten
                shrinked? Our friends...

                          MA
                Taken away for evidence.
                    (explaining)
                Proof that we were here.

      Jack retraces their track marks around the bed. He draws a J
      in the fingerprint powder on the table.

      Their Plant is all shrivelled. Jack strokes it.

      Under the bed, he finds Eggsnake; touches the needle tongue.

      He comes back to the doorway, where Ma stands frozen. He
      measures his height with his hand: an inch over the 5.

      He hears bird song from the yard; patter of rain.
                          JACK
                It's because Door's open.

                          MA
                What?

                          JACK
                It can't really be Room if Door's
                open.

                          MA
                Do you - would you like it closed?

                anything you need?

      Jack looks around at the detritus of his childhood. Then he
      walks to the wall behind the bed and pats it.

                           JACK
                Bye-bye.

                Please, Jack.

      He looks up at the skylight, rain running down it. He climbs
      onto the table.

      and walk away without looking back.
