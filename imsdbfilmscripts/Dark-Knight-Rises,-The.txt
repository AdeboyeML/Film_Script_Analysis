           GORDON (V.O)
           Harvey Dent was needed. He was
           everything Gotham has been crying
           out for. He was...a hero. Not the
           hero we deserved - the hero we
           needed. Nothing less than a knight,
           shining...

                         
          The sound of cracking. Splintering. A shape appears, in ice.

           friend. And it will be a very long
           time before someone inspires us the
           way he did.
          Gordon, choked with emotion, gathers the papers of his
          eulogy.
           I believed in Harvey Dent.
          And we FADE TO BLACK.

           organized crime because the Dent
           Act gave law enforcement teeth in
           its fight against the mob. Now
           people are talking about repealing
           the Dent Act. And to them I
           say...not on my watch.
          Enthusiastic applause as the Mayor wraps up.
           I want to thank the Wayne
           Foundation for hosting this event.
           I'm told Mr. Wayne couldn't be here
           tonight, but I'm sure he's with us
           in spirit...

          Down below at the bar, Commissioner Gordon examines some
          sheets of densely written paper. A Congressman muscles in.

           Ever lay eyes on Wayne at one of
           these things?
          Gordon shakes his head. Gordon's Deputy Commissioner, Foley,
          cuts in.

           MAYOR (O.S)
           He can tell you about the bad old
           days, when the criminals and
           corrupt ran this town with such a
           tight grasp that people put their
           faith in a murderous thug in a mask
           and a cape. A thug who showed his
           true nature when he betrayed the
           trust of this great man - (Turns to
           picture of Dent.) And murdered him
           in cold blood.
          The Congressman watches a tray of canapés breeze past, then
          grabs the ass of the maid carrying them. She freezes.

          The Congressman grabs two. The Maid moves off. The
          Congressman glances down at Gordon's papers.

           Jesus, Gordon, is that your speech?
           We're gonna be here all night.

                          GORDON
           Maybe the truth about Harvey isn't
           so simple, Congressman.

                         

           MAYOR (O.S)
           But I'll let him tell you himself -
           Commissioner Gordon?
          Applause. Gordon approaches the mike. Looks down at his long
          speech. Thinks.

                          GORDON

          Gordon surveys the audience. Deciding.

           truth about Harvey Dent...
          Gordon folds up his speech.
           Maybe the time isn't right...
          Gordon stuffs the papers inside his jacket. The Congressman
          mutters under his breath.

                          CONGRESSMAN
           Thank Christ for that...

                          GORDON
           Maybe right now all you need to
           know is that there are a thousand
           inmates in Blackgate Prison as a
           direct result of the Dent Act.
           These are violent criminals,
           essential cogs in the organized
           crime machine that terrorized
           Gotham for so long. Maybe, for now,
           all I should say about Harvey
           Dent's death is this...it has not
           been for nothing.
          The figure on the balcony turns back into the mansion.
          People clap as Gordon leaves the mike. Gordon approaches
          Foley.

           That's your department.

                         
          Gordon heads for the line of town cars in the gravel drive.

          Our Maid dives into the bustle of Wayne Manor below stairs -
          Caterers and Maids, Wait Staff. She overhears another Maid.

                          MAID 2
           They say he never leaves the East
           Wing.

           he's disfigured.

                         
          The other Maids signal her to be quiet. All the chatter has
          died. Alfred has entered the kitchen.

                          ALFRED
           Mr. Till, why are your people using
           the main stairs?
          Alfred places a glass of water on a tray next to a covered
          plate. Picks up the tray, looks around the chaotic kitchen.

           I could try explaining that a
           save-the-world project, vain or
           not, is worth investing in,
           whatever the return. I could try,

          Close on the dinner tray. We hear a labored step approach.
          Bruce Wayne appears, leaning on a cane. Gaunt. Grey temples.
          He lifts the lid of his dinner, then freezes, hearing
          something. He slowly limps into the next room...

          Martha Wayne. Some are half-burned. She notices an archery
          target, arrows stuck in it. She reaches out. WHAM! An arrow
          sticks into the target - the Maid spins around, flustered.
          Wayne, at the other end of the long room, lowers a composite
          bow. Picks up his cane.

                          MAID
           I'm, I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Wayne.

           Although you don't have the long
           nails... (Nervous laugh.) Or facial
           scars...

          Wayne approaches slowly. He nods at her pearl necklace.

                          WAYNE
           That's a beautiful necklace.
           Reminds me of the one that belonged
           to my mother. It can't be the same
           one - her pearls are in this safe -
          He reaches out with his cane to press open a panel on the
          bureau, revealing a safe door...
           - which the manufacturer clearly
           explained is uncrackable.

                         
          ...which swings open with an awkward creak.

                          MAID
           Oops. No one told me it was
           uncrackable.

                         
          The Maid suddenly seems more confident. Older.

                          WAYNE

           those.

           Look, you wouldn't hit a woman any
           more than I would beat up a
           cripple.
          She kicks his cane from under him, smashes him down.
           Of course, sometimes exceptions
           have to be made.

                         
          The Maid vaults onto the bureau and up to a high window.
           Goodnight, Mr. Wayne.
          She flips backwards through the window. Wayne smiles, then
          rocks forward on his good leg and rises with athletic grace.
          He looks at the safe, notices something. Powder...

           Sir, I've been a cop for a year and
           I've only logged half a dozen
           arrests. When you and Dent cleaned
           the streets you cleaned 'em good.

          himself - pulls out a cellphone. Slides it across the table.

          door opens - a young woman, Jen. She enters, cheerful, spots
          Selina. Pulls out an envelope, looks around.

           He chased a gunman down into the

           was babbling about an underground

           are. (Off look.) But we've met
           before. When I was a kid. At the
           orphanage. See, my mom died when I
           was small. Car accident, I don't
           really remember it. But a couple of
           years later my dad was shot over a
           gambling debt. I remember that just
           fine. (Looks at Wayne.) Not a lot
           of people who know what it feels
           like, do they? To be angry. In your
           bones. People understand, foster
           parents understand. For a while.
           Then they expect the angry kid to
           do what he knows he can never do.
           To move on. To forget.

           sent the angry kid to a boys' home
           - St. Swithin's. Used to be funded
           by the Wayne Foundation. See, I
           figured it out too late. You have
           to hide the anger. Practice smiling
           in the mirror. Like putting on a
           mask. You showed up one day in a
           cool car, pretty girl on your arm.

           That's good -

                          DOCTOR
           No, that's because there is no
           cartilage in your knee. And not
           much of any use in your elbows and
           shoulders. Between that and the
           scar tissue on your kidneys,
           residual concussive damage to your
           brain tissue and general
           scarred-over quality of your
           body... (Takes a deep breath.) I
           cannot recommend that you go
           heli-skiing. About the only part of
           your body that looks healthy is
           your liver, so if you're bored I
           recommend you take up drinking, Mr.
           Wayne.
          Wayne smiles. The Doctor leaves. Wayne pulls on a ski mask,
          steps to the window, hops up, pulls a wire from his cane,
          which he clips to his belt. He props his cane behind the
          frame - jumps out. The wire unspools from the cane as -

          Gordon lies in his bed, hooked up to machines. Wayne, in ski
          mask, stands over him. Gordon's eyes flutter open. He tries
          to speak with a weak, hoarse voice...

          Wayne pulls up in front of a row of shabby subdivided town
          houses. Checks a tracking device. Jon, provocatively
          dressed, leads a Yuppie Banker-type in through a front door.

          Selina sits in a small room getting ready to go out. She

          The Yuppie has Jen against the wall - he reaches back to hit
          her with an expensive wristwatch-clad arm. But Selina has
          grabbed his wrist with a powerful grip.

           Now.
          She releases the Yuppie, who moves off down the stairs.
          Selina turns to Jen. Who is examining a wallet.

           I don't know what he's so upset
           about, he only had sixty bucks in

           where you been hiding?
          Lenses swing onto Wayne, who pushes a button on his key fob

          He spots Selina dancing with a deeply smitten Rich Twit. She
          wears a small, velvet pair of cat ears. And the pearls.

          only concession to fancy dress.

                          WAYNE
           Miss Tate, isn't it?

           Even before you became a recluse,
           you never came to these things...

                          WAYNE
           True. Proceeds go to the big fat
           spread, not the cause. It's not
           about charity, it's about feeding
           the ego of whichever society hag
           laid it on.

                          MIRANDA
           Actually, this is my party, Mr.
           Wayne.

                          WAYNE
           Oh.

                          MIRANDA
           And the proceeds will go where they
           should, because I paid for the big
           fat spread myself.

                          WAYNE
           That's very generous of you.

                          MIRANDA
           You have to invest to restore
           balance to the world. Take our
           clean-energy project...

           You have a practiced apathy, Mr.

           about the world doesn't spend half
           his fortune on a plan to save it...
           (Gentle.) And isn't so wounded when
           it fails that he goes into

          Wayne watches Miranda glide away. Then turns to Selina.

           Mind if I cut in?
          Rich Twit turns, annoyed - Wayne hands him his cane. Takes
          Selina by the waist. She glares at him.

           You don't seem very happy to see
           me.

          Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne. You
          don't know a thing about me.

                          WAYNE
          Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came
          here from your walk-up in Old Town
          - modest place for a master jewel
          thief. Which means either you're
          saving for your retirement - or
          you're in deep with the wrong
          people.

                         

                          SELINA
          You don't get to judge me because
          you were born in the master bedroom
          of Wayne Manor.

                          WAYNE

          they'll never let you do what you

          cell phone could find out what you
          did. Everything we do is collated

           I take what I need to from those
           who have more than enough. I don't
           stand on the shoulders of people
           with less.

           about what's really in your pants
           other than your wallet.

           There's a storm coming, Mr. Wayne.
           You and your friends better batten
           down the hatches, because when it
           hits you're all gonna wonder how
           you ever thought you could live so
           large and leave so little to the
           rest of us.

                          WAYNE
           Sounds like you're looking forward
           to it.

           These pearls do look better on you
           then they did in my safe...

                         
          Wayne rolls her into his shoulder - reaches up to the back
          of her neck, unclasps the necklace.
           But I still can't let you keep
           them.

                         
          The pearls slide off her neck into his other hand. Selina
          looks at him. Angry. Then kisses him, hard, and disappears

                          CATWOMAN
           I want what you owe me -

                         
          Click - Stryver has a gun to her head.

                          DAGGETT
           'I want' never gets...

                         
          Stryver looks appreciatively at Catwoman as she lowers her
          leg...

                          STRYVER
           Nice outfit...those heels make it
           tough to walk?

                         
          Catwoman digs her stiletto into his calf, hard. He screams.

                          CATWOMAN
           I don't know, do they?

                         
          Catwoman spins, disarms Stryver, grabs Daggett.

                          CATWOMAN
           So where is it?

                          DAGGETT
           Where's what?

                          CATWOMAN
           The program. The 'Clean Slate'.

                          DAGGETT
           Oh, yeah - the ultimate tool for a
           master thief with a record. I don't
           have it.
          The Bodyguard bursts in, gun drawn. Catwoman, holding
          Daggett, spins, kicking the window with the point of her
          heel. The glass shatters. She pulls Daggett through the
          window. He screams - they drop...

                         

          EXT. WINDOW-CLEANING PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS


                         
          ...ten feet onto the window-cleaning platform. Catwoman uses
          her bladed heel to cut a rope - the platform plunges down
          the side of the building.

          EXT. FLAT ROOF - MOMENTS LATER

          Catwoman dumps Daggett onto the roof, towering over him.

                          CATWOMAN
           Where is it?

                         

                          DAGGETT
           The 'Clean Slate'? Type in a name
           and date of birth and within a
           couple hours that person ceases to
           exist in any database? Little too
           good to be true.

                          CATWOMAN
           You're lying. Rykin Data took it to
           prototype stage -

                         

                          DAGGETT
           That's why I bought them. But they
           had nothing. It was a gangland
           myth.

                         
          Catwoman leans back from Daggett, taking this in... Shapes
          drop onto the rooftop. Emerge from fire exits. They're not
          Daggett's bodyguards, these are Bane's men... Catwoman holds
          Daggett by the throat, threatening him.

                          CATWOMAN
           Stay back!
          They continue to approach. One of them screws a silencer
          onto his gun.

                          CATWOMAN
           I'm not bluffing!

           VOICE (O.S.)
           They know...

                         
          All eyes search for the source of the voice. Catwoman spots
          it - a dark shape, crouched on the roof above: Batman.

                          BATMAN
           They just don't care.

                         
          As the Mercenary with the silencer looks up, Catwoman leaps
          forward, grabs his gun. Batman drops into the middle of the
          fray, fighting back Mercenaries at Catwoman's back - she
          fires at one, clipping him, he drops. She spins aiming at
          another's head - Batman yanks her arm down, forcing her to
          miss the Mercenary. Batman takes him out with a kick.

           62.

                         

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           You've got to be kidding.

                          BATMAN
           No guns. No killing.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           Where's the fun in that?
          As more mercenaries come out onto the roof, Batman runs for
          the far edge.

                         

                          BATMAN
           Come on!
          Catwoman follows, confused, as Batman leaps off the roof.
          She gets to the edge, pauses to look down into the alley -
          sees the black angular roof of the Bat, cockpit open.
          Shots impact around her - she leaps, landing hard, but
          gracefully on the back of the vehicle, slides into the
          cockpit. As the engines thunder into life, and the canopy
          hisses shut, taking bullets from above.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           My mother warned me about getting
           into cars with strange men -

                          BATMAN
           This isn't a car.
          Catwoman flinches as the Bat thunders into the sky,
          downdraft forcing the Mercenaries down onto the roof, all
          but one, who walks slowly across the roof, strong against
          the wind...Bane. He watches the Bat roar off into the night.

                         

                         

          EXT. ROOFTOP, SKYSCRAPER, GOTHAM - MOMENTS LATER

          The Bat lands - the canopy opens. Catwoman jumps out.

                         

                          CATWOMAN
           See you around -
          Batman steps down after her.

                         

                          BATMAN
           You're welcome.

                          CATWOMAN
           I had it under control.

           63.

                         

                          BATMAN
           Those weren't street thugs - they
           were trained killers. I saved your
           life. In return I need to know what
           you did with Bruce Wayne's
           fingerprints.
          Catwoman looks at him. Considering.

                          CATWOMAN
           Wayne wasn't kidding about a
           'powerful friend'. I sold his
           prints to Daggett. For something
           that doesn't even exist.

                          BATMAN
           I doubt many people get the better
           of you.

                          CATWOMAN
           Hey, when a girl's desperate...

                         

                          BATMAN
           What were they going to do with
           them?

                          CATWOMAN
           I don't know. But Daggett seemed
           pretty interested in that mess at
           the stock market.
          Batman considers this. A police chopper sweeps past,
          searching. Batman turns to it. Then turns back.

                         

                          BATMAN
           Miss Kyle -?
          But she is gone.
           So that's what that feels like.

                         

                         

          INT. BATCAVE - NIGHT

          Alfred is studying security camera footage of Bane killing
          at the stock exchange. A roar builds - the waterfall glows
          brighter until...SMASH! The Bat breaches, downdraft spraying
          water. Two cubes rise - the Bat lands, Batman jumps out.
          Alfred brushes water off his suit.

                          ALFRED
           Very inconspicuous. Shall I tell
           the neighbors you got yourself a
           new leaf-blower?

          Alfred takes the cowl from him, then the cape, as they walk.

                          ALFRED
           From the look of the television
           coverage, you seem to have your

           Perhaps they would've if you

                          ALFRED
           You don't. You lead a bloated
           police force on a merry chase with
           some fancy new toys from Fox. What
           about when you come up against him.
           What then?

                         
          Alfred points to the monitor - Wayne sees Bane killing...

          hand.

          Wayne's eyes dart about: filthy stone walls, distant
          sunlight from above, iron bars: an underground prison.
           Where I learned the truth about
           despair. As will you. (Rises.)
           There is a reason that this prison
           is the worst hell on earth...
          Bane steps to the bars - looks up at a bright opening five
          hundred feet above. Like being at the bottom of a gigantic
          well...
           Hope. Every man who has rotted here
           over the centuries has looked up to
           the light and imagined climbing to
           freedom. So simple. So easy. And,
           like shipwrecked men turning to sea
           water from uncontrollable thirst,
           many have died trying. I learned
           that there can be no true despair
           without hope. (Turns to Wayne.) So
           as I terrorize Gotham, I will feed
           its people hope to poison their
           souls. I will let them believe they
           can survive so that you can watch
           them clamber over each other to
           stay in the sun...
          Bane points to an old TV, just outside the bars.
           You will watch as I torture an
           entire city to cause you pain you
           thought you could never feel again.
           Then, when you have truly
           understood the depths of your
           failure, we will fulfill R¯'s al

                          A

           Gotham. And when it is done...when
           Gotham is ashes...then you have my
           permission to die.
          Bane rises. Leaves. Wayne drifts back to unconsciousness.

          swings into the rock face. Prisoners fall silent as Strong

          Wayne puts some scraps of bread into a rough coat which he
          folds into a makeshift shoulder pack.

           Supplies for your journey?
          Prisoners nearby laugh. Wayne moves to the cliff face. The
          Prisoner follows, intrigued by Wayne's new demeanor. The
          Tattooed Prisoner offers him the rope. Wayne refuses. Starts
          to climb. Prisoners gather around as word spreads. Wayne
          makes his way cautiously up the treacherous rock face. Down
          below the Prisoners start a low chant.
          As Wayne hoists himself up onto the precipice something
          EXPLODES from the cliff face. Wayne flinches - BATS... They
          circle up to the opening above...
          Wayne closes his eyes. The chant RISES. Wayne takes a
          breath...opens his eyes...looks down at the drop...up
          again...then he jumps.

                         
          Time skips a beat as the Prisoners stop breathing.
          And Wayne GRABS the ledge above.
          The Prisoners go WILD as Wayne hoists himself up onto the
          ledge. The Blind Prisoner nods. Wayne climbs to FREEDOM.

          to the wall. He pushes it into the hole then walks away...
