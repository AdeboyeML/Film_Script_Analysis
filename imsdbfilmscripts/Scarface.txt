         1       A PROLOGUE                                                     1

                              In May 1900, Fidel Castro -- in an
                              effort to normalize relations with
                              the Carter Administration -- opened
                              the harbor at Mariel, Cuba with the
                              apparent intention of letting some
                              of his people join their relatives
                              in the United States. Within seventy-
                              two hours, 3,000 U.S. boats were headed
                              for Cuba.   In the next few weeks, it
                              became evident that Castro was forcing
                              the boat owners to carry back with
                              them not only their relatives but the
                              dregs of his jail population. 3y the
                              time the port was closed 125,000
                              'Marielitos' had landed in Florida.
                              An estimated 25,000 had criminal
                              records.   This is the story of that
                              minority -- those they call 'Los
                              Bandidos.'

      We dwell first on the scar which he likes to scratch now and
      then.   We move to the eyes, pure in their fury.  Finally we

      muscle, tissue, brain -- a man willing to live or die and
      on the increment of a moment, inflict or receive either one.

      cardboard, his hair unkempt, his complexion sallow from
      prison.

           eyes -- younger than Tony, and dapper in his cheap clothing.
           He's eating a Baby Ruth candy bar.

           Tony pushes his feet off, sits. He takes the Baby Ruth out

      . . . the face of Bogart -- unshaven, paranoid.
      a badly damaged 16 mm print of The Treasure of the Sierra -
      Madre.     It's near the end of the film and he's alone, talking
      to himself just before the bandits get him....

      The rag-tag audience is noisily yammering back at the screen,
      the camera moving past Manny Ray, chewing gum, hair slicked,
      eyes in cat-like repose...to Tony, enrapt, eyes like an
      eleven year old, mouth hanging open.

                                          BOGART
                                                   What a thing.
                        Conscience.    Conscience.

         He hunches, darting exaggerated looks over his shoulder,
         imitating Bogart. Manny laughs. In his black shirt with
         zig-zag dots and colors and the baggy pants and sunglasses,
         Tony's starting to look American. He's even got himself a
         pop button pinned to his shirt that says "Fuck Off and Die."
         And hi6 English rolls faster off his tongue, his confidence
         more pronounced.

        for Manny.  "Later."

        He's in the middle of the "Boulevard" where a bustling black
        market in toiletries, clothing, cigarettes, and transves-
        tites is conducted nightly in the harsh glare of barrack

            Tony,     five     minutes        later,        in   a   phone    booth, in    the    middle     of
  ._        a bank of them, dozens of Marielietos pressing to get in,
            trying     still      to        contact    somebody      --    anybody    --   on    the   outside.

            Tony is dialing, his eyes shifting down to the telephone
            number written in pencil on the back of a snapshot-   As he
            finishes the number, he flips the snapshot over and we see
            a young girl, about thirteen years old, dark, tiny, fiery,
            standing together with a dog and Tony, early twenties, in
            shadow, the fringes of the photo heavily tattered with
            handling.   Tony stares at it, his mind drifting as the phone
            rings in a distant place. A brief moment of repose we have
            not yet seen in Tony.
            Someone     picks      up        the     phone. An older woman's Voice.                    His
            expression         alters         to     uncertainty.
                                                            VOICE
                             Yes? ..Hello?..Who                is this?
            Tony changes his mind, hangs up.  Pause. The faces of those
            in line peer in, the next party raps on the door, but Tony
            ignores it, slips the snapshot back into the wallet in his
            pants, then at his own pace, exits the phone booth.
            He walks a few beats, his eyes pensive.                                 Then recognizes
            somebody     in       another          phone     booth   and     goes    over.

            Angel Frenandez has got the face of one, as he argues on
            the phone, then hangs up, a desolate look on his face, a
            worn phone book in his hand.
                                                            TONY

     Tony     winks    and   walks   off.

     The radio is playing hard rock, something like Blondie or
     Benatar from the stoop of a nearby barrack.  Tony loves the
     sound and swings into it, snapping his fingers and rolling
     his hips like Presley. He back-peddles, smiling at Manny
     and Angel.

            A     bewildered        Emilio    Rebenga     grabs     his   papers     and       valuables.

            Manny runs up on him.
            Rebenga sees him, senses danger,                      flees   down the aisle            with
            his satchel, intersecting other                       panicked refugees.

            Manny      follows.
            Rebenga stumbles into a                   bed frame, shatters his glasses,
            then runs on.   Into the                  smoke and flame.  Out of which
            Scarface   now appears --                 in his killing wrath.

       Tony waves    her off, then changes his mind and runs up
       behind her    and throws up her skirt and peeks at her ass.
       Before she    can react, he hops away laughing as the two

       provoking Manny's laughter. Many double checks himself in a
       shop window.

       Tony walks right out into the avenue, sticking .out his arm
       and stopping traffic. Cars honk angrily but he couldn't
       give a shit.

                       Come     on?
       Manny follows as Tony now moves across the opposite lane, a
       car screeching to a halt in front of him.

                                                  TONY

                       Okay Rober Retfor,               strut your stuff.
       The    blonde    has     paused    to     look    in   a    shop    window.

       Manny stops alongside, pretends to                          look.    When he catches
       her eyes, he flicks his tongue.

       She looks at him, confused, then back into the window.
       Manny look back at Tony, winks, sidles closer to her.

       Tony, waiting off to the side, catches the gaze of a somber
       child, four, toddling along with it's'mom.  Be makes his
       own version of a funny face at the kid who looks back at
       him puzzled. Tony produces another face.   The kid now
       smiles.  The mother looks over.  Tony shrugs.  She smiles
       and moves along.

       Meanwhile,       Manny    has     moved     close      to    the    blonde    and   suggests
       something,    his eyebrows raising, the smile crooked. It
       takes a    moment, then the blonde smacks him across the face
       and walks        away.
       Tony     walks    over     to     him,    mocking.

           The parking lot is crammed with Moby Dick-size cars and
           casual Cubans in sports clothes bunched in conversations
           around their wheels or at the ice cream stand.

           The inside is a brightly lit glitterdome with fancy mirrors
           and chandelier effects, Spanish in influence, and every

           table is taken.
           family restaurant, cafe, tourist haunt and late-night
           watering hole for various beasts of prey.
           The waitresses move like well-oiled troops along the paths
           to the kitchen, turning the tables at a speedy rate. The
           camera following past the pots and the pans and the steam
           and the yelling cooks -- to the deepest, darkest recess of
           this dungeon....

           Manny Ray washing a stack of dishes. They're filthy and
           exhausted.      A dish slips through Manny's fingers and crashes
           to the floor. A look between them suffices to tell us all.

           diamonds and -- the mark of status -- large bodyguards.
           They're out front with the flash, shaking hands with
           friends, kissing, talking loud, familiar with the waitresses.
           Staring through the smeared window enrapt are Tony and

     Omar Suarez (El Mono -- "The Monkey") is so named 'cause he
     looks like one. Nervous, crooked, darting eyes, feverish
     intelligence, constantly smoking a cigarette and coughing
     between words, his face pock-marked and pitted like the moon
     from an old acne scars, he cuts a skinny figure at the
     wheel of a big beige Coupe De Ville, idling the motor...with
     him is Waldo Rojas eating a large foot and a half banana.
     In contrast he's amiable, heavyset with a receding hairline,
     flashing a lot of gold when he smiles.

     as Tony hangs back, nodding arrogantly. Omar's eyes move

     The somewhat run-down, art-deco cheaper hotels of South
     Miami Beach. The porches are filled with senior citizens
     playing cards, reading papers, staring, slowly walking the
     street.
     The ramshackle sedan, jammed with Tony and his gang,
     rattles past. It's a beaten-up black and blue Monte Carlo,
     jacked up on its springs with dune buggy threads and
     needing paint.   You'd arrest these guys on sight.

            salsa beat on the radio, smoking a cigarette tensely.
            Driving is Manny.   In the delapidated backseat are Angel,
            the baby-faced punk, and Chi-Chi, both from Freedomtown.

                      reflecting the tension, whistles a vapid series of

            blocking    her     off.

     The door's opened casually by an ugly, squat five-foot-four-
     inch Columbian, "The Toad". He's in his forties, sports
     shirt hanging over his polyester pants, old acne scars on
     his face, like Omar; he's good-natured, a nice guy, he
     smiles.

     blue motel room (with heavy blue drapes blocking the
     windows), spreads his hands in a similar posture inducating
     he too is not carrying; but this is only symbolic, it's not

     The other person in the room is a tough-looking little dark
     Columbian chick with expressionless eyes, red fingernails,
     and short boy-cut hair, "The Lizard"; she's tinier than the
     Toad, about five-two.
     The Toad looks around the corridor, eases the door closed.

                            (slang Spanish)
                   Don't!    Get up! Now shithead!
       She's standing there with a .32 pointed steady at him, the
       eyes like angry steel. There's no mistaking her ability to
       Shoot.


       The Toad pulls a 9mm out of the small of his back,
       approaches Tony.
       Angel is shoved into the room, followed by two more
       Columbians, "The Kids". They slam the door, both carrying
       Uzis with silencers, neither of them higher than five-four    (Xl
       or older than twenty, with their straight black Indian hair
       cut across their blank eyes, they look like hungry little
       pirranha careless about killing, muttering with the Lizard
       in fast Columbese slang.
       As Toad strips the handgun from Tony:

                                   TONY
                   Frog face, you just fucked up.     You
                   steal from me, you're dead.
       Toad shrugs, he couldn't care less.

                                   TOAD
                   Yeah, okay, you gonna give me the
                   cash or am I gonna kill your brother
                   first?  'Fore I kill you?
                                   TONY
                   Try sticking your head up your ass.
                   See if it fits.
       Toad, completing the body search, rips out the stiletto
       taped to the small of Tony's back. As he mutters something
       in hard Columbian slang to the two kids who shove Angel
       into the bathroom, producing strands of thick rope.
       Even more worrisome is the chainsaw that the Lizard now
       pull6 out of the suitcase under the bed.  Toad begin6
       assembling it as Lizard, still covering Tonywith her gun,
       completes the deadpan process by turning up the volume on
       the television set. The news, not 50 ironically in Miami,
       is about a drug-related triple-homicide.

       Chi-Chi sitting at the wheel of the sedan, parked across

       Manny paces outside the car, glances.

     A small woman -- the Lizard -- steps out in shadow in the
     parking lot of the Sun-Ray across the street, looks around,
     sees nothing, casually goes back in.

     Manny    looks     at   his     watch.

     Angel hangs suspended on the ropes from the top of the
     shower curtain bar, his legs straddling the edge of the
     bathtub.   Toad slaps a tape over his mouth.

     Tony, coverd by the two kids, watches from the lip of the
     bathroom.   He bucks angrily but the two kids ram their
     pistols up against his temple and pin him to the door.
     Angel      looks at Tony; the             eyes          between   them         steady.     They're
     dead     and they know it.

     Toad,   well-prepared, connects                     a     voltage    adapter and
     extension cord.

                                                TOAD
                                 (to Tony)
                       You watch what happens to your friend
                       okay?  If you don't want this to
                       happen to you, you get the money.

     Lizard reenters            the room, shakes her head                      at     the     Toad   who
     nods and turns             on the whirring machine.
     The Toad smiles            amiably       and       angles    the chainsaw              slowly
     towards Angel.
     The two kids press tight against Tony, guns pointed at                                            his
     brains...o.c. we know what's happening as we hear the
     chainsaw and we watch Tony's shock and rage.

     The Toad steps back from the tub, blood splattered on his
     shirt, examjning  his first cut like a butcher. He glances
     at Tony.

     A brief glimpse of Angel slumped by one arm like a cow on a
     strap, streaming blood, eyes conscious and horrified; a
     terrifying sight. The chainsaw whirrs once more.

     Chi-Chi across the parking lot of the Sun-Ray Motel.   They

     The Toad turns off the chainsaw and steps back, now drenched
     with Angel's blood, totally unaffected. He looks at Tony.
     Tony glances back at him with fury, tears involuntarily
     dotting his eyes.
                                 TOAD
                 Okay, my 'caracortada', you can die
                 too. Makes no difference to me.
     He nods. The kids shove Tony forward and we glimpse Angel
     lying hunkered at his feet in the bathtub, in the steam of
     his blood, piss dead.

     pistol in hand, past an older couple who pretend not to

     At the door of Room 9, Manny waits, listens....

     The Lizard watches from the lip of the bathroom, impassively.

     Tony,     devastated,            spits      in     his     face.

                     Go       fuck      yourself.
     Toad's      eyes     narrow        meanly.

     Kid   one    slaps         the    tape       across       Tony's        mouth.

     Kid two      reaches        up     to       tighten       the     overhead          strap       to    Tony's
     wrist.

     The Toad turns on his                       chainsaw          when    suddenly           there's       a
     gunshot from the hall.

45   INT./EXT.       TOAD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

     and the door smashes open and Manny barrels through and
     shoots a surprised Lizard as she raises her pistol. She
     crashes backwards into the room, wounded.  Everything
     happens very fast now.
     Manny is        at   the lip           of     the bathroom,             he    fires       and    hits      kid
     one, who        is   turning,          in     the neck.

     Tony, not tied up yet, spins on kid two and smashes the
     unloosened strap across his face, sending him reeling
     across   the bathroom.
     The      Toad, chainsaw           in       hand,        slashes      at      Manny.

     Manny     fires      a     burst       into      him      and     the        Toad    crashes         backwards.
     Manny     now      spins    into       a    wall,       hit     in    the      side.

     The Lizard, wounded on her knees, is firing her .32 at
     him.   In b-g., the window simultaneously blows out as
     Chi-Chi appears firing a burst with his Ingram.
      In sharp f-g., the                 Lizard         crumples          forward        on    her        knees,
      foaming blood.

      Tony, with the tape still stuck across his mouth, smashes
      kid two, pinned against the blood-stained sink, with the
      stock of his own Ingram.

      In the midst of this, the Toad jumps up, wounded but with
                  strength, he tears out the motel room door
      hysterical
      gripping the whirring chainsaw in a reflex action.
                                                                                     c0NT1NuED

     Chi-Chi     climbing         through     the        window     fires    at        him.

     Meanwhile, kid two, with a rattlesnake life in him, produces
     a knife out of nowhere, just missing Tony's gut by a half-
     second as Tony dances back, getting a grip on the machine
     pistol.

     He blows kid two away point-blank, putting another ten
     craters in the mirror of the now-wrecked motel room.

     Tony,     yelling, whirls              after     the    Toad.

                                                    TONY

     Manny, holding his side, empties                         his    pistol       on     kid      one     who
     is still twitching.
     Chi-Chi     sees       Angel,         gags.

     The senior citizens, playing Mah-Jorigg on the porch, mutter
     in astonishment.
     As the Toad staggers out into the parking lot,                                         blood       flying,
     chainsaw in hand, moving like a jerky chicken.

     Their      eyes       follow.

     As Tony comes out, walking after him deliberately, eyes set
     in cold fury, machine gun swinging loosely at his side.
     There's no rush, no fear of the police, getting even is all
     that counts.  He stands behind the Toad.

     Tony      empties      the     clip     into    the     Toad,       blowing       hiin      apart.
     The bystanders just                   stare, stunned           by    the      ferocity.            Then
     an old lady faints.
     The Toad's body lying awkwardly arched in the gutter, Tony
     turns and with a passing disinterested glimpse at his
     audience, calmly walks back into the motel; the distance
     and the light sufficient to conceal Tony's possible identi-

     A deluxe apartment with the latest in electronic security
     and surveillance, and a profusion of mirrors and luxury
     items... and a hefty, Indian-looking bodyguard (Ernie), eyes
     quietly trained like a Doberman pinscher.

     The boss, Frank Lopez, comes down a carpeted corridor,
     dressed for dinner in an expensive suit and shoes, somewhat
     preoccupied as he greets Tony, then Max-my with a phony
     effusion of warmth. He's of Cuban-Jewish extraction, now
     Americanized in a rough and handsome sort of way, on the
     heavy side, the face going slightly soft, but the eyes and
     bulk carrying an odor of danger about him.

          .We know this is no workingman's dive when Lopez piles them
          out of his Rolls, and the carhops are moving Bugattis,
          Lamberghinis and Corniches   in a long snaking line down the

          jumpsuits with cinched waists, prowl like big glistening

          coiffed playboys in their Porsches honking their horns in

          The interior is built like three or four plush apartments
          that run together on three separate levels with imaginative
          angles, mirrors, swimming pool, bars, twenty-piece band,
          hundreds of tropical plants, dance floor, video games,
          computers and a restaurant. Itrs a lavish fun spot that
          will play a central role in the film, a drug dealer haven
          and nighttime capital of South America.

          The crowd, a combination of                  Caucasian and Latin, is mostly
          young, rich and happy and a                  lot of them coked; the girls,

     The waitresses, mostly blondes, wear little coca channel
     hats pinned to their heads and the barest pants with hose
     and high heels.

     Rich young guys with a lot of gold and diamonds on their
     necks and hands huddle briefly in groups or chat.

     Down at the vid games are younger chicks in jeans and
     tough-looking tank tops with "Motherfuckah" and "Fuck Me"
     written on them.  Manny's coming from the toilets, tries to
     pick one of them up.

     A Man passes the table.      Lopez calls out.

               Hey, George -- buddy.

               Hey, Frank.. -how's         the case coming?
     The Man's eyes thread the table. He looks sharp, heavy-
     lidded,  cigarette-eyed, his voice a hoarse croak, a cigar-
     ette dangling from his mouth, his manner cool but amicable
     with Lopez. This is George Sheffield, Miami lawyer.
                               LOPEZ
               OY, I shoulda come to you 'stead of
               that putz, Neufeld.
                               SHEFFIELD
               Jack's a good lawyer.   I taught him
               everything he knows.
                                  LOPEZ
               Yeah, almost    everything.

                       (to Elvira)
               Elvira, you look terrific...
                       (to all)
               Enjoy .yourselves.
     He ambles off.

               I . . best goddamn lawyer in Miami.

          It's interesting to watch Tony walk to the                                floor, leading
          Elvira.   It's not so much an act of walking                             as it is an act
          of war, a tank bouncing anything or anybody                               off that gets
          in the way. Be just proceeds in a straight                               dead line, eyes
          forward.   It's not that he doesn't see the                              people he bumps
          off, it's that he couldn't care less.

     The interior is comprised of small, narrow rooms filled
     'with religious objects from macumba and waist-high black
      Jesus statues in various corners. The floor is without
     rugs and mosaicked with inexpensive, Aztec-type tiles, the
     impression clean, cluttered, Catholic, somewhat depressing.

     Stepping forward to the center of the living room like a
     cautious cat is his ninteen-year-old sister Gina.  Their
     eyes lock.

     She looks at her mother confused. She's a naturally dark,
     curly-headed beauty with a slim, graceful figure and
     large-lidded eyes brimming with the same energy as Tony's.
     (She might also be recognizable from the snapshot we saw in
     Tony's    possession.)

     Disengaging gently, he holds up the contents of the gift
     box in font of her.   It's a beautiful diamond locket to
     wear around her neck.   Her eyes open wide.

     The    mother is amazed       at the cost        of      the    gift.       Tony pulls
     out    another present,       for her.

     Moving towards her, he opens the package and pulls out an
     exquisite peral   necklace.  She stares at it, doesn't take
     it.   Gina comes over, takes it for her.

                         parlor.    I'm doing hair.  Remember
                         Hiram Gonzalez? His father had the
                         babershop?

                         It's his place. Plus I'm going to
                         junior college -- Miami Dade -- and in
                         two more years I get my cosmetology
                         license and then I'll be making
                         enough....

                         Yeah, well surprise, all that's over
                         with starting today.  I didn't bring
                         up my kid sister to work in no hair
                         shop....
          Mama looks over at him on the words "bring up" and he
          catches her look.

          starts peeling them off on the table.  Mama stops working,

                         a success.  I wanted to surprise
                         you.  That's how come I didn't show.
                         my face around before.   I wanted you

     He reaches into his pocket, pulls out a decal, a private
     joke.   He slaps it on the rear fender. It's the same

He reaches over and takes the coke from her.    Does a toot,
staring at her.   She's  uncomfortable. When he finishes he ,
makes as if to return it to her.    She leans to take it. He
kisses her.   She goes with it.

Alejandro Sosa is a playboy, about six-foot-two, black wavy
hair, athletic body and a Copacabana tan, the clothes, a
casual polo shirt and the latest pants from Calvin Klein.

On his wrist is a flashy gold ID bracelet with "Alex'
written in diamonds and on the other wrist a gold Rolex
with a bezel full of diamonds worth maybe $30,000. His
eyes fizzle with an energy derived not from drugs but the
continual excitement of his toys and his money.
Accompanying him everywhere is the Shadow, a thin, intense
venomous-looking Hispanic man in his thirties, he has the
look of death in an unsmiling face.   He is always in
proximity to his Jefe, usually slightly behind the person
or persons addressing Sosa -- in a sort of garotte
position, his eyes swivelling to stare down the person who
might glance at him. He is a continual source of tension
underplaying the scenes, particularly coming to affect Omar
who is insecure to begin with.

     Sosa is showing Tony and Omar through his coke processing
     lab, past four coal-fired stoves, each with mas,sive  iron
     kettles bubbling with coca paste...across  to a row of ovens
     where the refined coke dries. The chemists and Indians
     working there all acknowledge llel rey de1 rey" as he
     passes, as proud of his factory as a vine grower his
     vineyard.

                       kilos refined every month   of the

                       market.    Some months I can't get rid
                       of fifty keys, other months I have to
                       do 2 to 300 keys, it's crazy, hunh?

                       I know what you mean Mr. Sosa, we got
                       the same problems up in Miami, the
                       demand varies for us too, month to
                       month....
     Sosa looks at him like that's obvious and moves on.   In his
     skinny  suit, with the wet cigarette clamped between his
     nervous fingers, Omar's not quite in his league with Sosa.

     Tow, awed by the scope of it all,               follows   along,   stops    to
     look at a sample of the dried coke.
     The      Shadow     stops,   eyeballs    him.

     Tony eyeballs him back, playing a game with him, then
     samples the coke off his thumb into his nose. Pause.                       His
     expression says I like it.   He moves on.
     The Shadow moves with him.

     The camera moves past a spectacular view of the mountains
     to a cavernous dining room highlighted by huge paintings
     from the Spanish classical period and ornate candelabra.
     At the table are Sosa, Omar, Tony.     The Shadow sits impas-
     sively in a folding chair off to the side, watching Omar
     and Tony. Tony is impressed, looking at the plates, the
     glasses, the silverware, uncomfortable, trying to fit in.
     He eats the salmon off a silver plate with oafish movements
     of his knife and fork as the servants move to and fro, con-
     stantly changing dishes, confusing Tony (ad-lib during scene).

         Omar is looking at him, ready to explode at his blithe
         assumption of power -- whereas Sosa chuckles, amused by his
         brashness, starting to be intrigued by this animal.

          Interrupted, Sosa looks over at his black aide who suddenly
          appears at the door, apparently with a message.  Sosa waves
          him in.
          The black aide Y- The Skull -- is a slim, tall imposing man
          with academic, 'horn-rimmed glasses and close-cropped hair
          on a huge and impressive skull. He combines the physical
          qualities of an animal with an intellectual. As he

     briefly on Omar who doesn't connect. The Skull falters --
     just for a moment -- then continues towards Sosa with the
     same stony, loyal expression.
     Sosa lends his ear and the Skull whispers his information.
     A beat. He whispers a second thought. Sosa reacts minimally.
     Then he nods, dismissing the Skull who heads out the room.
     Sosa glances at his gold Rolex.

                 The helicopter blades whirr. The Skull waits inside with
       -~        the Shadow. They both stare at:
                 Omar, who, with one hesitant look, steps inside.
                 The chopper lifts off the lawn, the camera moving to the
                 polo players exercising in the distance...a woman on a
                 horse rides by and we swing with her towards the villa.
                 Sosa walks Tony down an outside gallery towards the veranda
                 where servants lay out the coffee and fruits.

                 Sosa laughs. They reach the veranda, Tony glancing past

                 her horse, held by a servant, and joins them.

          In long shot we see an agitated Lopez entering his
          dealership with his bodyguard. Against a background of
          used American cars without great distinction, he ad-libs
          his way through some customers and salesmen, shaking hands
          and acting like everybody's favorite uncle...till we see
          him approach Tony, who is waiting for him with Manny
          outside his office. He jerks his head.    Inside.  They go.

          The office is highly decorated with plagues, momentos,
          Cuban patriot flags, and lots of photographs, centering on
          JFK and RFK shaking the hand of Lopez who now stares

      He sticks out his hand. Manny slaps an envelope in it.    Tony
      begins counting out the cash, right on the tabletop.

      Tony waits in his red Jaguar in the driveway of the building.
      Lopez and his bodyguard exit the building.
      A limousine pulls up.
      Tony watches.
      The threesome get in the limo and drive away.
      Tony gets out of the car, crosses to the entrance.

      Tony waits outside the door, pushes the buzzer again.
      Elvira opens it, a look of utter surprise on her face.         She`s
      in jeans, barefoot and casual.

                Hi there.
      Elvira looks at him, still astonished and waiting for an
      explanation.  There is none.
                                   ELVIRA.

      She tries to slam the door in his face but he blocks it and
      bulls in.

      dress, with a flashy young Cuban guy in a burgundy suit.

                her to go out, have some fun?
      Gina spots Tony, hesitates, waves to him. Manny waves
      back.  Tony nods. Burgundy suit checks them out.

                             where you going?
                   Hey,
      He   doesn't      answer.
                                                                      CUT TO

      Tony comes down the plush velvet stairs, flings himself
      into the Ladies room...the ladies, surprised, look back at
      him. No Gina.

      He moves over to the Men's room, throws the door open.
      There are four legs visible in one of the stalls.  Tony
      moves past two men washing up, and hurls himself against
      the door.
      It crashes open on Gina in the act of snorting coke, with
      burgundy suit running his ha&s along her ass.
                                                  GINA
                               (shocked)

                     doing!
      He grabs burgundy suit by the collar and whips him several
      times into the wall.

      He   rips   the     coke out      of    her      hands   and   scatters   it   across
      the tiles.

                Okay, c'mon, let's go outside get
                some air....
      The argument has moved across the bathroom to the lip of
      the hallway. Several more people are watching.
                                 GINA
                You got a nerve, Tony, you got a

                want to fuck them then 1'11 fuck

      Tow, raging, smacks her            the face.    She reels back
                                across
      into the toilet.
                             Tony stands there, abated.
      The crowd is silent.
      Manny moves across the floor and kneels down, consoles Gina
      who is sobbing.

                        (tender)
                Come on, baby, it's okay. .-it's
                okay, he didn't mean it.

                Get her home, get her outta here!
      He turns and bulldozes his way through the growing crowd,
      no regrets, but disturbed.
      Manny helps Gina to her feet.

                Come on, pussycat,    I'll buy you    a
                cup of coffee.

                  All right, you coneheads, another
                  exciting evening at the Babylon, hunh?             (X)
                  Now I want you to check out this next
                  hombre.  I found him stoned in the
                  jungle and there's nothing you'll
                  ever see like him.  I present with
                  great pride, 'from Caracas, Venezuela
                  -- 'Octavia' !

      Lights dimming to the bluesy rhythm of the Sinatra song as
      sad-eyed Octavia suddenly appears in the shifting spot-
      light drawing immediate laughter.
      He is dressed as an enormously fat old man with a Quasimodo
      mask covering both the front and back of his head and neck.
      With a red bulb for a nose, he gyrates grotesquely to the
      sleek song; once the mood of laughter has been established,
      the music suddenly shifts upbeat to "Saturday Night Fever"
      and the clown, like a butterfly from a worm, starts
      shedding the stuffing from his clothes, his big eyes
      staring out at us in theatrical melancholy.
      Tony watches, sitting alone, distracted by the clown.
      More laughter, more clothes coming off, building a tempo.
      PJ%en the head mask comes off, we see the gaunt handsome
      face of a young clown in white paint with the large
      blackened eyes staring without expression at the laughing
      audience.
      Tony is hooked by the image, looks on.
      The clown is down to his leotards, thin as a stick, and
      pulling the girls out onto the floor to dance with him,
      bouncing around like yo-yos. Everybody is laughing,
      everybody is merry...

            ...except Tony and the clown, weaving in and out of the
            sharpening spotlight in his white face as the act comes to
            its close, a haunting figure of mockery....
            Tony, absorbed by his thoughts, is lucky this time.     His
            antennae warn him.     Out of the side of his eye, he sees....
            The two hitters moving on him.
            He sprawls. Machine gun fire rips through the upholstery,
            smashing the mirrors....
            Screams,    crowd diving for cover....
            Tony, hit in the shoulder, rolls, gets his Baretta out of
            his ankle, firing....
            Hits one of the gunmen in the chest; the man staggers
            across the disco floor firing volleys into the mirrors and
            ceilings....
            Tony moving under the tables, towards the door, firing....
            The second hitter is pinned, firing back, breaking more
            mirrors, and more screaming.
            Tony lets the gunman have another burst then runs out the
            door, his clothes ripped with blood and'glass.
            The clown, Octavia,    lies dead on the silent dance floor.

            Tony runs out, crouched, to his red Jaguar.
            Exchanging shots with a third hitter across the parking
            lot, he runs out of ammunition.
            He jumps into the Jaguar, his windows being blown out.
             The second hitter, wounded, running out of the club,
             towards him.
             The third hitter advancing, carhops scattering.
             Tony reaching under his seat, gets a hold of his own Ingram
             machine pistol, cocks it and lays down a field of fire.
             Carhops    scattering, the hitters seeking cover.
             Hitter two, already wounded, is hit again, his head
             exploding like squashed watermelon.

      Tony now pops a button. Bulletproof blackout shutters whap
      across the shattered windows.
      He guns the Jaguar out into the lot, bullets careening off
      the armor plating, whining against the shutters.
      Tony suddenly brakes the car and reaches down and slams the
      gear shift into reverse.
      In an instant, his warmobile                        in reverse,
                                           accelerates
      climbing to top speed....
      As hitter three realizes it's too late, tries to get out of
      there, but is overtaken and crushed by the car.

      Tow, aching from his wound, is attended by a Doctor, who
      reveals to Us an ugly wound on his rib cage. Tony looks at
      it, doesn't express a reaction.

      Manny, in bed, is snorting a line of coke off a mirror,
      takes the phone, in good spirits.

       . . . as Tony and Elvira take their marriage vows in front of
       the Monsignor; the triumphant montage music rising to its
       full glory as a beggar's banquet of gang members and various
       girl friends (but no sign of kids) looks on. Chi-Chi is
       with a girl who looks like an animal, with an extremely
       short    dress, looping earrings, the camera moving to Gina,
       her eyes covertly tracking to Manny who gazes back at her,
       evenly and openly as....
       Tony        and    Elvira        kiss.

       Tony, eating his wedding cake, his arm around Elvira,
       nuzzling her, shows his entourage his new hobby.
       Across a moat of water, a striped nine-foot Bengal tiger
       stretches majestically under a solitary banyan tree, extend-
       ing a giant claw and licking himself.

       Tony        and    Chi-Chi        kidding     around        with    the    tiger.

 151-A EXT. TONY'S MANSION - GUARD HOUSE - DAY
        Behind some nearby bushes, Gina and                                     are making out in
                                                                           MaMy
        the grass. They hear the sounds of                                 Tony's voice, freeze,
        making shushing signals, then almost                               laugh when they con-
        sider their childish state.

             From their point of        view, we see Tony leading the entourage
             back to the mansion        as Chi-Chi throws the Bengal his wedding
             cake.

             Tony,  accompanied by Marmy, walks a young, thirtyish bank
             president into his office, which is rigged with video
             monitors surveilling all areas of the house and grounds.
             There's an abundance of electronics -- televisions, sound
             systems, computer toys, video games, desk, couch, chairs --
             but not one sign of a book on the walls.
             Jerry, the Banker, is slickly dressed, hair coiffed, the
             eyes scooting shrewdly back and forth, the type of guy who
             follows the Hong Kong money markets on weekends, a guy who
             never stops thinking money.

                                          TONY
                         ...yeah, well, I can't pay that no
                         more Jerry, I'm gonna be bringing in
                         more'n I ever brung in, y'know. I'm
                         talking ten million a month now.
                         That's serious money.   So I think
                         it's time you bank boys come down
                         a bit, y'know, like....

                         The more cash you give us the harder it
                         is to rinse, y'know. The fact is we

                    what?   You gonna trust some monkey in

        he has another engagement,

      On the video monitor, Tony watches Jerry, the Banker,

      darkly, Tony hits the other nostril quickly, casually --
      passing the vial to Manny who does his hit.

159   EXT.     WAREHOUSE - ALONGSIDE MIAMI FREEWAY - DAY
      Tony and Nick The Pig get out of a van, frowning in the
      glary sunlight. From the continual sound of jet aircraft
      taking off and landing we might sense we're near an airport.
      As Nick hauls a duffel bag on his back, Tony, carrying a
      suitcase of his own, reads the sign on top of the warehouse:
      "CONSOLIDATED CARRIES INC.

160   INT. SEIDELBAUM OFFICE - WAREHOUSE - DAY                        16
      The office is bare and ugly, the furniture naugahyde black.
      There's noise from an outer office, and people on phones,
      moving, talking.
      Tony and Nick sit on a couch stacking twenty dollar bills
      from the duffel bag and suitcase onto a coffee table.
      Two men in casual sports clothing sit opposite them in
      chairs, one of them -- Seidelbaum -- squaring the bills and
      passing them efficiently through a money-counting machine
      which clicks at rhythmic intervals throughout the scene.
      Seidelbaum's a small, fat 7th Avenue-type with a lot of
      rings on his fingers and sharp, porky eyes.
      The other guy -- Luis -- a dark Cuban, is long, lean and
      smooth with aquiline nose and dancing eyes. He drinks
      coffee, smiles a lot and bullshits -- two sordid guys who
      look the part.
      It's a tedious process counting a million five in twenties,
      it takes four/five hours; and throughout the desultory
      dialogue Tony, absorbed by the money, and Nick never stop
      the monotonous work of counting and stacking and noting the
                 At all times all four men, thoroughly aware of
      amounts.
      the large stacks on the table, move and talk gingerly
      although they appear casual and bored. They drink a lot of
      coffee.
                                      LUIS
                   . I . yeah back then I worked in pictures

      They're drinking another round of coffee, exhausted, smoke
      filling the room. The table now resembles a Mount Everest
      of green and they're still counting. The money, like
      discarded food, is spread all over the place -- in boxes,
      brown paper bags, on the couch. They stretch, rub their
      eyes.

      Tony, tense, checks himself in the mirror, adjusts 3s
      hair.  A vial of coke appears. He snorts a large amount,
      goes out.   It's the first time we sense he might be using
      the stuff on a steady and increasingly heavy basis.

      Sheffield rasps through a            cloud     of cigarette smoke behind

      Tony shakes his   head, grimacing like he's having an
      epileptic fit.
                                  SHEFFIELD
                  I'll delay the trial.  A year and a
                  half, two years, you won't start

                  800,000 dollars, okay? With that
                  you can fix the Supreme Court, hunh?

                                   SHEFFIELD
                  Tony.. .the law has to prove 'beyond
                  a reasonable doubt.'   I'm an expert
                  at raising that doubt but when you
                  got a million three undeclared
                  dollars staring into a videotape
                  camera, honeybaby, it's hard to
                  convince a jury you found it in a
                  taxi cab.

      Tony paces back and forth like a tiger, corking his fury.
      Abruptly coming to a decision, he whirls and leans across
      Sheffield's desk.
                                     TONY
                  All right-.-all     right. I do the
                  three fuckin' years but lemme tell
                  you about my law, George.     It's real
                  simple.   There's no 'reasonable
                  doubt.'   If you're rain-making the
                  judge or you fuck me for the four
                  hundred grand and I come in guilty
                  on the big rap -- you, the judge,
                  the prosecutor, nothing's gonna stop
                                  I'm gonna come and tear
                  me, y'hear?
                  your fuckin' eyeballs out.
      Pause.

                          (cool)
                  The point is made. Now where's the
                  money?
      Tony nods to Manny who hauls a briefcase up on Sheffield's
      desk.  Tony abruptly walks out, a vial appearing in his
      hands as he steps out of the office.  He  sniffs.   .

      moving with another woman past                     a window of the house. Then
      she's gone.

                        Tony, you have a problem; we have a
                        problem... I think we can solve both
                        our problems.
           Tony     waits.

                         We all know you have tax troubles in
                         your country -- and you may have to
                         do a little time. But we have some
                         friends in Washington who tell us
                         these troubles can be taken care of
                            ...maybe you'll have to pay a big
                         fine and some back interest, but
                         there's no      time....

           Pause.  Tony looks.         The American guy, Goodson, shifts his
           gaze away.

                  I've heard whispers, Doctor Gutierrez,
                  about the financial support your govern-
                  ment receives from the drug industry in
                  Bolivia.

                                     GUTIERFSZ
                  The irony, of course, is that this
                  money -- which is in the billions,
                  J i m - - is coming from your country.
                  You are the major purchaser of our
                  national product -- which of course
                  is cocaine.

                                    INTERVIEWER
                  So what you're saying Doctor Gutierrez
                  is the United States Government is
                  spending millions of dollars to
                  eliminate the flow of drugs into our
                  streets and at the same time is
                               -     -    -
                  doing business with the very same
                  government that floods those' streets
                  with cocaine.. -that's a bit like
                  robbing Peter to pay Paul, isn't it?

                  Hi folks, don't get up. Anyway, Vie,
                  check it out.   I heard like it was
                  220 kilos went down. That means
                  twenty is missing, right? Ask your
                  friends, the cops, about that -- and
                  keep up the good work, Vie, but
                  don't believe everything you hear,
                  y'know what I mean? Okay, have a
                  good dinner, nice to meet you people.
      Waves farewell to          them, pats        Vie     once   more     on    the   shoulder,
      and leaves them            murmuring.

                  Hey, Tony, that's not                  cool,    he's     got   a

                  truth!
      Not caring if he's overheard, Tony seems to be in the grip
      of an anguish he does not understand.
                                                                     .CUT TO

                     Tony sighs, turning his attention to Elvira. He surveys the

                     Elvira's untouched plate.

                     I'm     not    hungry.

          She quickly does one               nostril    with    a      quick,     practiced       move-
          ment of her hand.

                     I     lost    my    appetite.
          She   does the other nostril. Tony looking                         at    her.     One     beat.
          Two   beats. He passes a silent burp.


                             (trying to
                             shift the mood)
                     So what about the trial?  I heard
                     Sheffield thinks he can get a new
                     postponement....
          Tony, bleary-eyed now and drunk, continues                         to     look    at     Elvira,
          then away, encompassing the restaurant.

                                     TONY
                            (ignoring the question)
                     Is this it? Is that what it's all about,
                     Manny?  Eating, drinking, snorting, fucking?
                     Then what? You're fifty and you got a bag
                     for a belly and tits with hair on 'em and
                     your liver's got spots and you're looking
                     like these rich fuckin' mummies in here?
                     Is that what it's all about?


                      It's    not       so    bad    Tony,     could    be      worse....

                                stonily on Elvira)
                      A junkie??? I gotta fucking junkie for

      Elvira reacts -- wanting to kill.  She gets up and dumps
      her plate filled with food on him.  Slop drips all over him.

                                             ELVIRA
                     You     sonufabitch!      You fuck!
      They got a black tie audience now. The waiter tipping
      around to clean up the mess.  Tony slowly wiping the food
      off   himself.

                                      ELVIRA
                     How dare you talk to me like that!
                     You call yourself a man! What makes
                     you so much better than me, what do
                     you do? Deal drugs? Kill people?
                     Oh that's just wonderful Tony -- a
                     real contribution to human history.
                     You want a kid. What kind of father
                     do you think you'd make, Tony? What
                     kind of stories are you going to
                     tell the kid before he goes to sleep
                     at night? You going to drive him to
                     school in the mornings, Tony? You
                     really think you're still going to
                     be alive by the time he goes to
                      school, Tony? You're dreaming, Tony,
                     you're dreaming!
      The       audience    is hushed, involved, the camera moving over
      the      faces of     Vie and his rich friends.

       Tony     acidly      quiet, looks     around   at   the   people,   back   to   her.

            Pause.    She starts wobbling out. Past the silent
            spectators, their eyes moving between her and Tony.

            Manny   rises     to     follow.

      The whole room is watching him sitting there covered with
      food, the silence cathedral.   He stands, wiping at the food
      and throwing several hundred dollar bills on the table,
      then looks up angrily at the staring millionaires.

      He wobbles        against   the   table.    Manny   tries     to    help.    Tony
      shakes him        loose.

                      like me again.

      He walks out, proud, Manny bringing up the rear. The room
      is empty for a beat -- an extended beat, the stage without
      its star -- and then the audience begins to buzz with horror
      and delight.

                                                                  CUT    TO

      A quiet East Eighties street. Two rich-looking male lovers
      stroll past with their dog. A moment of silence. Tony
      moves into frame.
      Behind him, the Shadow (Alberto) moves towards a sedan
      parked along the curb, carrying an airline bag. Be slips
      under the car.

      Tony     looks:

--d--         waits    in   Tony's   sedan   double-parked   down   the   block.

              Tony,    feeling everything's okay, does .a nervous, quick
              snort,    paces next to the vehicle the Shadow disappeared
              under.
              Ground level -- the Shadow, using a pen flashlight, removes
              the bomb from the bag. With subtly inexorable music, the
              camera frames and moves on the bomb -- wired, soldered,
              taped -- a malignant centipede in the long agile fingers of
              the Shadow, who delicately presses a tester. A glass
              button on the bomb now flashes red at soothing intervals as
              the Shadow winds a roll of black tape from the bomb to an
              axle of the car.

                A cop car comes cruising off the avenue up the street,
                towards us,
                Ground level -- the Shadow continues to wind his black tape
                trying to secure the bomb as tight as possible.
                Tony     hurries     to     the    car,    bends   down.

                The      Shadow     douses    it     and    freezes     in     position.

                Tony looks up just as the cop car pulls alongside, the
                passenger cop, a female, noticing him, saying something to

              The door of the        brownstone. No movement. Though now
              there's increasing      traffic on the street and passing
              pedestrians.

                           I don't know, Tony. He's been gone
                           last couple of days. Didn't say
                           nothing.

      Tony hangs up. A              moment of despair.             Then   he        snorts
      another spoon and             snaps back.

      Tony drives up in a white Corniche (the red Jaguar having
      been shot to shreds earlier in Lopez's attempt on Tony's
      life) with Chi-Chi, jumps out in the same bloodstained
      clothes, rushes in.

      Tony     stalks     off, towards           his      office.

214   INT.     TONY'S        OFFICE

      Amid his computer space games and half-dozen televisions
      and  stereos, Tony picks up the ringing phone.

                                               TONY
                    Yeah?          Hi.     Mami.

                                    Her voice on the phone sounds
      The other phone is ringing.
      hysterical and angry. Not really listening, Tony breaks
      open a new vial, pours the entire vial of coke out across
      the desk into a thick quarter-moon pattern. He snorts.
      Chi-Chi signals he's got Sosa on the other line.
                                         TONY
                                (into the phone)

                        problem, okay.

                              snorts, then pushes the button Chi-Chi                  indicates.
      He hangs up,
      The telephone           should be the latest in gimmickry.

      cold.

        217   INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   21:
              Mama is angry and ravaged with worry, made weaker than
              previously, as if overhelmed by events.

                          . she got   a place of her own, she
                       don't tell     me where. One day I
                       follow her     in a taxi.  She goes into
                       this fancy     house in Coconut Grove.
                                      TONY
                       The Grove? Where'd she get that
                       kinda money?

                       You ! You were giving her the money,
                       what do you think -- don't you see
                       what you do to her, don't you....

                        I never gave her that kinda money.                  (XJ

                        Mama, was there a guy with hex?

                        I don't know, there was this other car
                        in the driveway.  I know if I went in
                        there, she'd kill me, she's like you,
                        she....
              Tony's face filling with the old wrath, he grips his mother
              by the shoulders.
                                        TONY
                        Where's this house, tell me!

                        Four hundred something.
                                Four hundred nine. You

                        gotta talk to her Tony, she don't
                                                She says to
                        listen to me anymore.
                        me 'Shut up! Mind your own business.'
                                                                             (X)
                        Exactly like you do to me. Ever
                        since you come back, she's been
                        getting thiseway.
              He turns to leave but she clings to his arm.

      into his pocket.  Inside a wistful Billy Joel song plays

      Manny smiles easily and shrugs, the gesture drawing Tony

       Tony holds the gun, staring down, separated from himself.
       Manny lies at his feet, dead.

                                                 CHI-CHI
                                  come    on.    We gotta       get    out   of
                     Tony,
                     here.
                                   (to Gina)
                     Come     on     baby...Gina!

        Suddenly    she     goes      berserk.

                                                 GINA
                     Noooooooooooo!
        And shoving Chi-Chi aside, launches herself on Tony,
        screaming incoherently like a madwoman, trying to kill
        him.   She beats him around the head, the chest, scratches
        furrows of flesh from his face. He stands there, oblivious,
        numbed.

        Chi-Chi and Ernie have a demon on their hands.  They manage
      . at last to yank her off Tony, kicking and continuing to
        scream.

               Lights     coming        on     in     the     houses        around   the    neighborhood.

               Chi-Chi and Ernie, desperate now, drag her forcefully along
               the pavement into the Corniche.  She continues to scream.

                                                     ERNIE
                                           (to  Chi-Chi)

               Tony,     back     at    the       door,     looks     down     again.
               The     eyes     of      Manolo       staring        sightlessly.

               Chi-Chi       runs      back,        grabs     Tony.

                                                              CHI-MI

               Pulls     him.        Tony     snaps     out    of     it.

                                                              TONY

               Tony getting into the Corniche, Ernie pinning Gina against
               the front seat. Chi-Chi propping MaMy into the driver's
               seat with him. The car roars away.

               Tony, scratchesacross his face, strides through the front
               door into the marble foyer. Another Marielito is waiting               (X
               for them at the door.

               Ernie and Chi-Chi are almost carrying Gina, who is numb
               with shock.

                              Do what? Where? Put her upstairs.
                              Put her in my bedroom.

               She looks up at him through her stupor and spits in his
               face.  Chi-Chi and Ernie pull her away -- as Tony stares,              (Xl
                                    They trundle her up the stairs. Tony

                velvet like a snow scene painting on a Christmas card.
                Oblivious to the dust, he cuts open a fresh plastic kilo
                'bag of coke and spreads the entire pound out across the
                black marble coffee table.
               Ernie    and   Chi-Chi   come   in.                                    (X)

                Tony pays       no   attention, Ernie and Chi-Chi noticing the pile   (Xl
                of coke.
                Flashing his silver tooter, Tony snorts a truly giant
                amount in a large pendular swing of his elbow across the
                length of coffee table.
                Pause   as he   lets it sink in.

              Tony looks        up at him, focuses.                    The      eyes     are      uncompromising.
              Ernie, a          little     scared     of        him   now,    turns    away.        Chi-Chi          (X)

              Tony     starts     on      another     trek        along      the    coffee        table.

              The     Bengal      tiger     paces         his     spot,      restless.

              A     monsoon-like         wind     blows     through       the      trees     on     the    estate.

              The     monkeys      listen        quietly.
              The     f    lamingoes       flutter.
              . . . Then there's a burst of loud music from the stereo
              speakers on the balcony -- a Billy Joel song, something
              smooth and easy about the high times and how fast they
              go...

              . . . and we

              estate.
              ...On a closer angle, we track him to the edge of the
              balustrade.   He's done so much coke now he's practically
               catatonic; staggering and muttering to himself.

                    What the hell happened to us?...
      In far b-g. now, behind Tony, on the video monitors
      in his office we see:
      The main gate and guard shack -- a Marielito crosses into                       (X
      view, checks the gate, turns.  Suddenly two figures spring
      out at him. One of them garrotting the Marielito. He
      struggles.
      Another monitor now reveals two more figures moving into
      the interior of the guard shack. They knife the other
      Marielito
      A    third   monitor.    carries     another   image   of    shadows   moving
      through the trees on the estate.
      On the balcony, Tony is oblivious to it all, spent, almost
      incoherent.

      As  Tony turns and starts back through the terrace doors
      into his study, the camera glides around to a view of a
      hook flying up and catching the balustrade.                     A shadow

               As he crosses into his office, the                           camera moves to      reveal
               Gina standing there half-dressed in                          the     doorway,   her eyes
               blazing with hatred.
               Tony     sees   her.

               She steps         forward, offering her body almost naked to her
               brother.

                                                            GINA
                               Is     this    what       you want      Tony?...
               Tony     shocked.

                                               GINA
                               You can't stand another man                         touching
                               me.  So you want me Tony, is                        that it?
                               Well here I am 0-T
               She    fires    the    Baretta       we    now   see    in    her    hand.

               The bullet grazes Tony in the leg, snapping him from his
               catatonia   as he goes reeling across the floor behind his
               desk.    She fires again.  Again.

                                                           GINA
                               I'm all        yours       Tony,       I'm all yours
                               now.
               Bullets ripping into the desk.   She advances, offering
               her sex, methodically shooting out the clip at rhythmic
               intervals.

                                                           GINA
                               Come and get me Tony.                   Before       it's
                               too     late.

               He spins across the run away from the desk, trying to put
               distance between them.  She sees him scurrying,. turns, an
               expression like a demented angel.

                                                           GINA

                                 Fuck me!

               Advancing on him, firing. The furniture tearing up, the chair
               spilling, television sets and computer toys shattering, Tony
               squirming away, hit again in the thigh, shocked, scrambling
               over to the terrace windows.   Her next shot shatters the
               window and as Tony ducks again to the side, we see outside
               onto the terrace behind him:

      A young Columbian punk no more than twenty -- one of the
      hitters -- is crouched there, reacting to the broken window.
      He  doesn't hesitate, turning his machine gun on Gina.

      Gina is torn to pieces by the firepower -- blown across the
      room, spine severed and dead before she hits the floor.

      Tony sees it, yells something, in the same instant
      swivels to knock the barrel of the machine gun aside.
      The punk is taken by surprise, not having seen Tony, and
      Tony now runs him backwards across the balcony and hurls
      him over the balustrade.

      The punk lands in one of the shallow pools on the grounds
      at the base of the balcony.
      Tony, from above, grabs up the punk's machine gun and
      empties the whole clip into the figure thrashing in the
      pool below.

      Ernie runs into view on the far side of the pool, spots                  (X
               yells    up     ---
      Tony,

                                                                               (X

                   Tony,         they're    everywhere!
                   here!
      Ernie suddenly wheels, hit in the face, by a burst of                    (X
      silencer bullets.
      We catch a brief glimpse of Sosa's black aide, the Skull,
      moving quickly along the wall of the house -- directly
      underneath the balcony on which Tony stands.

      Tony, tossing the empty machine gun aside, wildly runs back
      into his office to get more guns, crosses to Gina corpse.
      It takes him by surprise. He comes to a dead stop, kneels,
      looking questioningly in her face.

                                            TONY
                                   (gently)
                       Hey     Gina come on, you still angry at
                       me?      I didn't mean to kill Manny, I
                       was..    .I   was.


      Running his hands along her face, trying to rouse her,
      gently lifting her eyelids.  Blood's running out of her
      mouth in rivers.

                Come on Gina, get off the floor.
                You're all dirty now, you need a

                Come on open your eyes my baby,
                open your eyes.. -give me a smile.
      There's been a steady pounding and calling now on the door     (X:
      of the office. Tony finally hears it, looks up, then over
      at the monitors.
      One of them reveals Chi-Chi standing there outside the door
      pounding it.
                                      CHI-CHI
                Boss !    Hey boss.     Open up!
      On the monitor we see Chi-Chi suddenly spin and open fire
      down into the foyer. Return fire decimates him. A grenade
      goes off, blows him up against the door.
                                      TONY
                Cheeee!
      He now seems to come out of his catatonia, runs to his
      sideboard, hauls out a rocket shoulder-fired rocket
      launcher and straps an Uzi across his shoulder. He looks
      up at the monitor.
      On the monitors, the hitters are now darting across the
      foyer and coming up the left and right hand stairs.
      Three of them are already huddled outside the door, around
      the corpse of Chi-Chi, motioning to-each other, laying a
      grenade at the base of the door to blow it out.
      Tony loading his rocket, ihtends to beat them to the punch,
      talking to himself.
                                 TONY

                 to my little friend here.
      Karroooomph!
      The rocket tears down the door and blows the Columbian
                                             It sounds like
      punks off the landing into the foyer.
      Armageddon, one of the hitters screaming, smoke billowing
      wildly.
      Tony, at the height of his mad glory, steps out at the apex
      of the stairs, firing his machine gun and yelling.

           Another hitter tumbles down the right-hand stair.

           Another hitter   drops,   screaming, off the stairs into the
           pool below.
           A grenade goes off. Tony is hit again, but keeps on firing
           away.  Laughing like a madman.

                       You need an army you hear!    An army
                       to kill me!
           Behind him we see the remainder of the     pound of cocaine go
           up in a burst of wind, whipping around    the office in auras
           of white.  It is a ghostly effect out     of which now appears
           the face of the Skull moving from the     terrace towards    _
           Tony's back with a sawed-off shotgun.

           The
           and blows Tony's spine out his belly.
           Tony crashes forward over the bannister into the interior
           swimming pool below.
           He floats quietly face down in the lit blue waters.
           As the titles begin their crawl up, the music theme is
           expressive salsa with a dash of gaiety.

           lit sculpture on the surface of the still waters.   It says:
