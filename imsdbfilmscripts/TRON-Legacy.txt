    Electric-neon netherworld.     Pulsing chromatics over jet black.

    CONSTRUCTION CREW toils to complete a vast SWITCHING NEXUS.
    CYPER-TECH CREWMEN and MACHINERY branded "X-NET".

    3D lattice of routers, refractors, reassemblers... New,

    X-Net Tactical Corps troops (herein X-Takks) patrol every

    DATA "TRAIN" enters. Sliver of RED DATA ENERGY shunt off,
    shooting into RANDOM MEMORY BUFFER - geometrically perfect
    lattice of PLASMA BEAMS and WHITE HOT intersection points.

    X-Takks notice, moving to investigate.

    DEEP IN THE LATTICE:

    Red data "uploads" into solid form. A RED FIGURE. We see
    from the back - infrared strobing DISK, etched metallic
    detail, lethal EDGES -

    Then slowly he - IT - turns.     Hardly a face, only data-hungry
    eyes, riveted to a TASK -

    TRON 2.0.

    Seriously upgraded, over-clocked, armed for trouble. The
    friendly hero we once knew has been re-programmed into a
    ruthless cyber-ninja.

    X-Takks search ten story gantries.

    TRON springs into the lattice, dodging PLASMA BEAMS, avoiding
    detection. Slips into:

    X-Takks on high alert.

    TRON slips down main shaft, freezes, confirms data.       Darts

    brutally accurate, takes out three more Police -

    TRON flips into the air - His DISK boomerangs straight for
    him. Certain death. But his timing is inhumanly accurate.
    DISK docks on his back midair, lands and bolts.

    CHANNEL -

    RX23 and a pair of his AGENTS hop on PULSE RIDER vehicles,
    hotly pursuing TRON.

    Vast, low-rez, uncool, largely forgotten.

    TRON pulls a LIGHT WAND from his legging, grips it. A TURBO-
    CHARGED LIGHT-CYCLE rezzes up beneath him. He fires his
    LIGHTCYCLE. ZIP, he's gone.

    Onto the grid blasts RX23, speeding on his Pulse rider.    He
    skids and swerves, learning the funky surface.

    The chase is on.

                  somebody - some hacker, some
                  competitor, somebody - just proved
                  they're smarter than us. Breaking

43   EXT.    GAME PORTAL OUTPOST

     Obsolete, abandoned computer game entry portal, guarding
     entry to the old game grid beyond. An electro-tech carnival
     zone gone dark. No life in sight... Then:

     Beam of DATA ENERGY sling-shots at ground level, solidifying
     to become:

     A slender, jumpy Program called I-BEEM. He wears the X-Net
     logo and a cracked disk on his back. He's highly unstable
     and way unplugged from the system (like one of those Japanese
     soldiers still fighting alone in the hills 10 years after
     WWII was over).

     I-Beem sees something - he PANICS, zapping away in
     characteristic streaks of airborne data. He reassembles in
     a hiding place, skittish, observing:

     Rush, Mega, Krod and D-Rezz arrive. See GIANT PILE of GAME
     VEHICLE PARTS blocking access to the grid.

     Rush picks up an old LIGHT WAND.       Krod finds one too.

                  D-rezz.   Cut a path.

     D-Rezz hurls his Romball, ZAPS into VEHICLE PARTS.       A dent.

                                 KROD
                  That's good.     Keep doing it.

     D-rezz retrieves Romball for another whack -

     ZAP -    DATA ENERGY BEAM snaps in front of them, becoming I-
     Beem.    He grips his rickety disk, challenging them.

                               I-BEEM
                  Violation!   Go away!   Access denied!

                  Pound him to bits, D-rezz.

     D-Rezz raises his Romball to pulverize I-Beem.

     I-Beem freaks, ZAPS away in his data beam as Romball crashes
     down. I-Beem reforms further way, then beside them - He
     snatches his pancake disk, the zaps away again, emerging
     then high on the pile of parts.

                              KROD
                  D-rezz, take out this blip.

     D-rezz cocks Romball. I-Beem freaks, sling-shots all over
     the place via his data beam, tossing his wobbly disk.

     Rush catches I-Beem's disk.       Holds off D-Rezz.

                             RUSH
                  Hang on. I-Beem. We're from X-Net
                  CPU. You're doing a great job out
                  here. Everybody knows it.

                  rogue Program around here? He's
                  red. Super fast. Known as "Tron".

     I-Beem stiffens, reflexively vigilant. He scans the four of
     them again, finally softening. He zaps to a wall near his
     giant barrier, then proudly pushes aside a thin panel. Beyond
     a corridor of game gear, view expanses to reveal:

                  beginning of the end of a free and
                  open cyberspace. We can't let Plexor
                  get away with this. Our game plan
                  has not changed. Tron was specially
                  programmed to break into X-Net and
                  shut down power supplies. We would
                  then exploit these weak points and
                  cripple the system. Tron's role was
                  essential One of you must take his
                  place.

                  to blame you.

     All stand firm.

     Flynn lays Tron's disk in the first Fighter's hands. Fighter
     summons his will, causing the disk to glow faintly. But it
     soon goes dark again.

                   Sinclair didn't get where he is by
                   being dumb. Even if we survive
                   Plexor's forces in here, Sinclair
                   will make sure we never get back

                   strong. I promise, no matter what

      Rush throws his arm around Mega and VAULTS across the moat,
      landing on the far side - gaining a slim foot-hold below a
      core ENTRY POINT.

      Flynn chooses his moment, leans out and throws. His mini
      disks take out X-Takks on the ledge. Their bodies tumble
      into the moat, flashing as they hit.

      Flynn spins, the wall behind him opens.       At the end of a
      square corridor stands:

      PLEXOR.   Flanked by his four snarling Cybavor beasts.

                                PLEXOR
                   Flynn. Your moment of obsolescence
                   is upon you.

      Across the moat, Rush and Mega climb to the entry point.

      Flynn plays for time, stalling Plexor so he doesn't catch
      sight of them.

                               FLYNN
                   Freedom, Plexor. It's the better
                   idea. That's why Mega chose my side.

                   bad. When each alternative has been
                   removed, X-Net will simply BE.

      With a hand signal, he commands his Cybavors.         They raise
      up, poised to attack Flynn.

                               FLYNN

      Rush and Mega gain footing at the entry point.      They turn at
      the sound of DIGITAL SNARLING.

      Across the moat, a gut-wrenching sight:

      All four Cybavors pounce on Flynn, hurling him off the ledge,
      mauling him as they go down, dividing into eight - Plummeting
      toward the MOLTEN DATA far below.

      Plexor steps out of his corridor, relishing the view:      Remains
      of fallen bodies FLASH into the inferno.

      Rush and Mega duck inside entry point, pelted by disks.

      surges in rings, drawing down huge columns. Every piece of
      geometry is based on perfect squares, made of mirror-finished
      rare earth elements.

      Rush pulls the HOLOGON KEY into view. Facets resonate with
      energy patterns like those in the core.

      this place is.

      X-Takk Soldier is grazed, stumbles into ENERGY COLUMN. RING

      his energy to the levels below.

      Rush and Mega encounter oncoming X-Takks - they must split
      up. They fling disks, taking out X-Takks, dodging fire -
      working their way deeper.

      Meg and Rush throw their disks simultaneously.     Both disks
      score hits, then arc to return.

      defense field repels it. He slams it aside and it's raked

      Rush DIVES at PLEXOR. He's like a statue. But this time

      Sinclair charges in, furious.    Trailed by SECURITY MEN.

                               SINCLAIR
                   What are you people doing down here!?!
                   Get back to work! X-Net has CRASHED!
                   We'll all be ruined!

                               FLYNN
                   Speak for yourself, Sinclair.

      Sinclair wheels to see Flynn: Alive, standing in front of
      him. Trapped by the ugly truth, Sinclair turns rage on Meg.

                               SINCLAIR
                   I ordered you to destroy this
                   equipment!

      Rush gets in Sinclair's face.

                               RUSH
                   Hey, jerk, she doesn't do your dirty
                   work. Neither do I. Not anymore.
                   You lied to me, to all of us. You
                   want to deal with somebody? I'm the
                   guy who crashed X-Net.

      Sinclair goes for Rush. Rush delivers a solid punch.
      Sinclair grabs his bloody nose.

                               SINCLAIR
                   You're fired, everybody get out.

                   No, Sinclair. I'm back. And I'm
                   the boss again. You're fired. Not
                   only are you fired, you're going to
                   have a lot of explaining to do to
                   the SEC, the Justice Department and
