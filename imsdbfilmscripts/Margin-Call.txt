    INT. LARGE INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR - DAY
1                                                                    1

    The frame is filled with the face of PETER SULLIVAN, a 27-
    year-old risk assessment analyst. He has a Doctorate from MIT
    and is staring intently into a large bank of computer
    screens.

    An elevator door opens and FOUR HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE come
    out of the elevator carrying large file boxes. They walk down
    a long glass enclosed hallway that runs the full length of
    the trading floor. The scope of the floor now comes into
    frame. There are more computers than can be imagined and
    several large boards on the far walls that are scrolling
    thousands of numbers. PETER gives a knowing glance to the guy
    sitting next to him, SETH BREGMAN, a young analyst in his
    early twenties.

                        SETH
              Is that them?

                           PETER
              (nods yes)

                        SETH
              Jesus Christ.

    The HUMAN RESOURCES people turn and separate into a large
    glass walled conference room that runs along the floor as
    almost every person on the floor watches.

                        SETH (cont'd)
              Are they going to do it right there?

                           PETER
              Yeah.

                           SETH
              Fuck me.

    WILL EMERSON, sitting next to them, leans back in his chair.

                        WILL EMERSON
                  (whispered)
              Have you guys ever seen this before?

                           SETH
              No.

                        WILL EMERSON
              Best to just ignore it. Keep your head
              down and get back to work... and don't
              watch.

    The HR people begin walking out onto the floor looking at a
    piece of paper in their hand then walking up behind a person
    and asking their name. It is brutal. The camera follows one
    HR woman, HEATHER, with her piece of paper down the hall and
    into a row of employees, she walks right past the THREE GUYS
    then stops a bit down from them.

                           HEATHER
                 Timothy Singh?

                              TIMOTHY
                 Yes.

                           HEATHER
                 I'm afraid we have to speak with you.

    TIM gets up and walks back towards the conference room with
    the woman. PETER puts on his headphones and very loud RAP
    MUSIC drowns out all other noise and PETER tries to get lost
    back into the numbers on his computer screen.

    The sequence follows the HR people walking around and firing
    people intercut with PETER just staring at his computer
    screen. It runs for almost the length of the song until
    finally the same woman comes walking back down the hall and
    stops behind PETER and taps him on the shoulder. He takes off
    his headphones and the MUSIC STOPS. He is shell-shocked.

                 Oh. I'm so sorry.

                           PETER
                 He's my boss, he's down that hall.
                                                                  3.

     ERIC DALE is sitting at his desk, he is 52 years old and
     looks exhausted. He looks out through the glass of his office
     as she walks over to the door.

     There is a more senior looking Human Resources lawyer, LAUREN
     BRATBERG, already sitting at the table. They all sit and look
     at each other for a beat.

               Well... Mr. Dale I'm obviously sorry that
               we are here today but these are extra
               ordinary times as you very well must
               know.

               I run risk management... it just doesn't
               seem like a natural place to start
               cutting.

               I hope you understand that this is in no
               way personal. A majority of this floor is
               being let go today.

    SAM ROGERS walks out of his office and stands in front of the
    trading floor that just an hour before had seated 130 people.
    Now just thirty-three are scattered throughout the vast
    mostly empty space. They all look up in silence at him. Long
    pause, then SAM'S face begins to glow a bit. His posture
    straightens, he fills up. He speaks slowly at first then
    builds.

                        SAM ROGERS
              You are all still here for a reason...
              Most of this floor was just sent home...
              forever. We have spent the last hour
              saying good-bye... they were good people
              and they were good at their jobs... but
              you all were better. Now they are gone.
              They are not to be thought of again. This
              is your opportunity. On every floor of
              this building and in every office from
              Hong Kong to London the same thing is
              happening. Before this is all done 3 of
              every ten guys who were standing between
              you and your boss's job are now gone.
              That is your opportunity. I've been at
              this place for thirty-four years and let
              me tell you that this will not be the
              last time you go through this. But you
              all are survivors... And that is how this
              firm over 107 years has always continued
              to grow stronger. So hold your heads
              high... and get back to work.

    He looks out at them then turns and heads back into his
    office and closes the door.

    ERIC DALE walks out the front door carrying the file boxes.
    There are other people streaming out the door doing the same
    thing. ERIC stops, turns, and looks up at the building then
    tries to make a phone call but his phone does not work as it
    has been shut off by the firm. He looks up to the sky and
    can't believe his fate. As he looks down he sees a woman,
    SARAH ROBERTSON, serious, classically beautiful and dressed
    in a well tailored power suit with her head down walking into
    the building. He can't help himself.

     This time she looks up. When she sees him she debates if she
     should stop. She does. He slowly moves a little closer to
     her, still carrying the slightly tattered box with his
     personal belongings in it.

                  Fuck you.

     They look at each other for a longer beat, both a little
     shocked that ERIC was so openly confrontational. She turns
     and heads back inside quickly. ERIC drops the phone to the
     ground and walks away.

               says as the doors on the elevator close
               is `be careful'.

                  This is basically everything that we have
                  on our books at any given time. But what
                  Eric was trying to do here is work it for
                  levels of volatility that fall outside
                  the limits of our standard VAR model.

                            WILL EMERSON
                  What are those levels.

                            PETER
                  Well it's a fairly complicated...

                  Simplify.

                            PETER
                  The volatility boundaries are basically
                  set using historic patterns then
                  stretching them out another 10-15%...
                  roughly.

     INT. BACKSEAT OF A BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CAR

     SETH and PETER sit in the back of the plush car as it
     struggles through traffic up town. SETH reaches into his bag
     and pulls out a large beer in a black paper bag. Their
     conversation is quiet, as if they are afraid someone might be
     listening.

                         SETH
               You want one?

                         PETER
               No.

     PETER gives him a bit of a look.

                         SETH
               What, we got them on our way to meet you
               at the office... we didn't know what the
               fuck you wanted to talk about...
                   (almost to himself)
               ... thought you might've gotten some
               chick pregnant or something.

                         PETER
               I haven't gotten laid in so long that's
               not possible at this point.

                         SETH
               I guess that's true.

     PETER looks out the window at all the people on the street
     enjoying the Thursday night.

                         PETER
               Look at these people.

                         SETH
               What?

                         PETER
               We are in here stressing our fucking
               heads off that the world as we know it is
               ending, and they've got no idea what's
               coming.

     SETH'S demeanor sitting and drinking a beer doesn't seem to
     project much in the way of stress.

                         PETER (cont'd)
               Right?

                         SETH
               I try not to let work get to me.

                            PETER
                  I've noticed that about you actually.

                            SETH
                  Look, we are twenty three years old...

                            PETER
                  Twenty-Seven.

                            SETH
                  Whatever, same thing, I made almost a
                  quarter of a million dollars last year...
                  for what... pushing some numbers around
                  on a computer screen, so a bunch of
                  glorified crack addicts could take that
                  information and pretend to understand it,
                  and then make a bet against some other
                  jock half way around the world who if he
                  wasn't doing this would probably be in
                  some OTB somewhere putting it all on
                  number seven. And at the end of the day
                  one guy loses and the other guy wins.

     PETER continues to look out the window in silence for a long
     beat. Then with a little sly humor and a smile to SETH:

                            PETER
                  You do know it's a little more
                  complicated than that?

     SETH'S phone starts playing a ring tone. He looks down at the
     text.

                            SETH
                  It's Will... He wants to know if we've
                  found him? What do I tell him.

                            PETER
                  Tell him that we haven't found him.

     SAM ROGERS comes through the door from the elevator looking
     quite disheveled and walks across the long and empty trading

     SAM looks at WILL for some hint of what is going on, then
     eventually puts his coat down and sits into a chair. They
     wait for who goes first.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  So?

                  So as he was leaving the building he
                  hands a disk to Peter Sullivan...

                  Who's Peter Sullivan again?

                  something but hasn't been able to figure
                  it out. So he gives him the disk and says
                  give it a try... but the last thing he
                  says as the doors to the elevator close
                  is `be careful'...

     They all sit down and at each place setting there is a pad of
     paper, a pencil, and an empty binder. Sitting at the head of
     the table is JARED COHEN. He is a blond boyish looking 43
     year old, although carries himself with intense confidence.
     He is the head of all fixed income securities, and oversees
     roughly 25,000 employees. Next to him is his chief risk
     management officer, SARAH ROBERTSON, the same woman from
     outside the building earlier who had the run in with ERIC.
     Next to her is her right hand man RAMESH SHAH, a sixty year

               this for some time but was unable to
               finish it, as he was leaving the building
               today he gave the program to Peter here,
               and told him to see what he thought.
               Peter figured a few things out that Eric
               seemed to be missing and this is what
               came out.

               Look    we'd need a little more time to go
               over    this, but Mr. Sullivan here seems to
               know    what he's doing. And I don't have to
               tell    you that this is a problem.

               Yes. But as you certainly know our
               business is selling AND buying. It
               doesn't work for very long without both
               components. If we suddenly stop buying
               for a day or two that just doesn't hide
               under the rug, it gets out and this whole
               this thing comes to a end... and right
               quick.

               I don't know, sixty.

     RAMESH has been looking down at the numbers while this
     conversation has been taking place.

               Jared I've just been looking here a
               little closer, and it's these VAR numbers
               that are really setting this thing off.

     JARED holds up a hand to interrupt Ramesh. Jared nods his
     head, his eyes are perfectly still but his brain is racing.

                         JARED COHEN
               Excuse me, I need to make a quick call.

     JARED calmly stands up   and steps out of the   room for a long
     moment. The room stays   completely quiet the   whole time he is
     gone. We hear nothing.   It is awkward to say   the least. He
     comes back in and sits   down without missing   a beat.

               that might be left on the books, if they

               Why would they still be on the books?

               them.

               Without an active market, it could take
               weeks, months for me to value them
               correctly. You'd have to go block by

               before we go in there... this could get a
               bit ugly but whatever you do... just...
               tell the truth... don't try to change a
               word of it, no sugar coating... no one
               here is smart enough... including the
               rocket scientist.

     He continues on.
                                                               47.

     The guys are taken aback because standing right outside the
     opening elevator door is a very well dressed page and a
     female executive assistant who is also dressed perfectly for
     the day ahead.

                            ASSISTANT
               Mr. Cohen?

                            JARED COHEN
               Yes.

                         ASSISTANT
               This way. They are already in there
               waiting for you.

                            JARED COHEN
               OK.

     They come through glass doors and enter a massive conference
     room with a commanding view of the city. It is filled with
     people along one side of the table. There are a team of five
     lawyers, three compliance officers, a couple of key board
     members, twelve in all. On the near side of the table sits
     RAMESH SHAH surrounded by empty chairs all alone. The head of
     the table is empty.

     They all file in and sit down. They all sit in silence...
     waiting. Finally from a side door JOHN TULD comes walking
     into the room. He is dressed in a average suit and tie, is
     not tall, late fifties and doesn't have a hair on his head.
     He carries himself without much exception. His eyes however
     tell a far different tale. Intense even at rest. He walks the
     length of the room, everyone half stands up.

                         JOHN TULD
               Please sit down.

     He then seats himself at the head of the table. Everyone in
     the room has the printout in front of them. JARED is seated
     immediately to his left, then SAM, then SARAH, RAMESH, WILL,
     PETER, and finally SETH.

                         JOHN TULD (cont'd)
               Welcome everyone. I must apologize for
               dragging you all here at such an uncommon
               hour but from what I've been told this
               matter needs to be handled urgently, so
               urgently in fact that it probably should
               have been addressed weeks ago...

                  but that is spilt milk under the bridge.
                  So why doesn't someone please try to
                  explain to me what's the problem here?

     Everyone looks around the room a bit and finally JARED speaks
     up.

                            JARED COHEN
                  Well, Mr. Tuld as I mentioned earlier if
                  you look here at the top page of this
                  printout...

     He cuts him off.

                            JOHN TULD
                  Jared, it's a little early for all that,
                  how bout in English? ... Actually I'd
                  like to hear from the guy who put this
                  thing together... Mr. Sullivan is it?
                  Does he speak English?

                             JARED COHEN
                  Sir?

                  I'd like to speak to the analyst who
                  seems to have stumbled across this mess.

                            JARED COHEN
                  Well, that's Peter Sullivan here.

     JARED looks down the table to PETER, as does everyone else in
     the room. JARED gives him a go ahead look.

                             PETER

               So Mr. Sullivan why don't you tell me
               what you think is going on here, and
               please speak as you might to a young
               child or a golden retriever, I didn't get
               here on my brains I can assure you of
               that.

     PETER is very nervous.

                         PETER
               Well, sir. As I guess you may or may not
               know I work for Mr. Rogers here as an
               associate in the risk assessment and
               management office at MBS

                         JOHN TULD
               Now you lost me at M...

                          PETER
               Sorry...

                         JOHN TULD
               I was joking Mr. Sullivan.

                         PETER
               Yes... Well as you probably know over the
               last 36-40 months the firm has begun
               packaging new MBS products that combine
               several different traunches of rating
               classification in one tradable security.
               This has been very profitable as I
               imagine you noticed.

                          JOHN TULD
               I have.

                         PETER
               Well the firm is currently doing a
               considerable amount of this business
               every day. The problem, which is I guess
               why we are here tonight, is that it takes
               us... the firm... almost a month to layer
               these products correctly thereby posing a
               challenge from a risk management
               standpoint.

                         JOHN TULD
               And Mr. Sullivan that challenge is?

                         PETER
               We have to hold these assets on our books
               longer than we might ideally like to.

                         PETER
               But the key factor is these are
               essentially just mortgages, so that has
               allowed us to push the leverage
               considerably beyond what you might be
               willing, or allowed to do in any other
               circumstance, thereby pushing the risk
               profile without raising any red flags.

                         JOHN TULD
               And how far have we pushed that profile
               tonight Mr. Sullivan?

                         PETER
               We have pushed it to 1.215 Trillion
               dollars... at MBS alone.

                         JOHN TULD
               Give or take.

               Now Mr. Sullivan what I am guessing, and
               give me a little rope here, what I am
               guessing that your report here says is
               that considering the, shall we say bumpy
               road, we've been on the last week or so
               that the numbers that your brilliant co-
               workers up the line ahead of you had come
               up with in the past don't seem to make
               much sense anymore considering what's
               taking place today?

                          PETER
               Actually not taking place today but
               what's already taken place over the last
               two weeks.

                         JOHN TULD
               So what you're saying is it's already
               happened?

                          PETER
               Sort of.

                         PETER
               Well... sir... if those assets were to
               decrease by just 25 percent, and remain
               on our books... well... that loss would
               be greater than the current market
               capitalization of this company.

               So what you're telling me Mr. Sullivan is
               that the music appears to be about to
               stop and we are going to be holding the
               biggest bag of stinking shit ever

               Well sir, I'm not sure I'd put it that
               way but let me clarify using your
               analogy, what this model shows is the
               music, so to speak, just slowing, if the
               music were to stop, as you put it, then
               this model would not be even close to
               that scenario. It would be considerably
               worse.

                         JOHN TULD
               Well let me tell you something Mr.

               pretty smart people in this building of

               and a pretty big one. You'd have to come
               out of the gate storming... 40 percent
               done by 10:15 and 70 percent of your
               positions need to be gone by eleven,

      SAM ROGERS comes across the room and over to the sinks to
      wash his hands. He looks in the mirror, and then decides to
      wash his face as well. He stares at himself in the mirror.
      The water drips off his face. He looks old. Just then the
      door opens and JOHN TULD walks into the room. He does not go
      to use any of the facilities. He stops and looks to talk to
      SAM.

     see the figure of a woman coming towards him. It is

     slowly walking towards him. They stop in front of each other
     squarely.

     SARAH is sitting at her desk staring out the window. She
     calmly gets up and walks over to the door and slowly closes
     it. Then she reaches out and twists the blinds on the glass
     wall separating her office from the floor giving herself
     total privacy. She walks over to her desk and sits down. She
     reaches over and grabs a box of tissues, methodically
     preparing to cry, almost like a surgeon preparing to work.
     She sits at her desk still seemingly calm and collected. Her
     face starts to tweak just a little, but it just will not give
     way. Again she tries. And again. She can not cry. She can't
     believe it. The deeply tragic look of total failure floods
     her eyes but still hardly a twitch on her face. Still no
     tears. Finally she makes a forced noise like a sob, but it
     isn't real and she knows it. Then she tries to laugh to
     herself, she tries again to laugh, but it too is not real.
     She does feel something, but she simply and very sadly can
     only openly express even to herself... nothing.

     PETER is still walking around on the street with the music
     playing. He crosses a large open windswept corporate plaza.
     As he approaches the building he sees SAM ROGERS standing in
     front having a cigarette. He walks towards him and then
     finally decides to take off the headphones. The music stops
     and the wind kicks in.

                  That's good. I don't much either.

     The door swings open and a catering person comes in rolling a
     cart with another large tray with more food on it. She places
     it on the table next to the other food. The abundance is
     overwhelming.

     There are 40 young, 90% male, traders jammed into the
     conference room next to the trading floor talking very loudly
     with one another. They are oblivious to what is about to

                  Thank you all for coming in a little
                  early this morning, I know yesterday was
                  pretty bad, I wish I could say that today
                  is going to be less so but that isn't
                  going to be the case. Now I am supposed
                  to read this statement here to you all
                  but how bout you read it on your own time
                  and I'll just tell you what the fuck's
                  going on here.

     THE LAWYER looks at JARED then they look at SAM, he

                  I have spent the night here meeting with
                  the executive committee and the decision
                  has been made to begin to unwind a
                  considerable portion of the firm's
                  holdings in several key asset classes.
                  The crux of it is... in the firm's
                  thinking the party is over as of this
                  morning. There is going to be
                  considerable turmoil in the markets for
                  the foreseeable future. They believe that
                  it is better to have this turmoil begin
                  with us... as a result the firm has
                  decided to liquidate the majority of its
                  position of fixed income MBS today.

     An assistant starts handing out info packets to each of the
     traders in the room.

                  You should be getting a breakdown right
                  now, you will see the accounts you are
                  responsible for today. I'm sure it hasn't
                  taken you long to understand the
                  implications of this sale on your
                  relationships with your counterparties
                  and as a result on your careers. I have
                  expressed this reality to the executive
                  committee and they understand. As a
                  result, if you are able to complete a 93%
                  sale of your assets you will receive a
                  1.4 million dollar one off bonus.

               For those of you who have never been
               through this before, this is what the
               beginning of a fire sale looks like. I
               don't have to tell any of you that the
               first hour and a half is going to be very
               important. I want you to hit every bite
               you can find. Dealers, clients, brokers,
               and your mother if she's buying...and
               obviously no swaps, its outgoing only
               today. This is obviously not the way any
               of us would like for this to be going
               down, but the ground is shifting below
               our feet, and there appears to be no
               other way out.

     SAM looks around the room again, person by person and sees
     that they indeed know what needs to be done.

                         SAM ROGERS (cont'd)
               Obviously... this is a very unique
               situation... if we are successful today
               we will have been successful in
               destroying our own jobs... I can not
               promise that each of you will be
               repositioned within the firm, but I can
               tell you that I am very proud of the work
               we have done together here, I have been
               at this here for 34 years, and I know...
               from experience people are going to say
               some nasty stuff about what we have done
               here, and what you have devoted a portion
               of your life to. But have faith that in
               the greater picture our skills have not
               been wasted, we have accomplished much,

     There is a very quiet energy on the floor. A low murmur. Then
     a hush falls over the floor as people pass on the info that
     the CEO, JOHN TULD is about to come onto the floor. He
     appears at one end of the floor and it falls silent. JOHN
     walks dramatically into the middle of the floor and then into
     the middle of the row in the dead middle of the floor. He
     looks around and stands in letting the drama build. Then he
     climbs up onto the desk and looks out onto the floor like a
     general.

               the market must eat its weak, and you
               all... are not the weak. We must strike
               quick, with no doubt, if you hear pause
               on the line, attack. By noon the SEC is
               going to be in here getting in your
               faces, sniffing around, you let us take
               care of them and you just keep going. We
               own what we are choosing to sell today
               and there is nothing they can do about
               it. 107 years ago this firm was founded,
               today we secure our place for next 107.

     He heads down the hallway and passes the HEATHER and LAUREN
     BRATBERG from the opening scene who are returning with boxes
     to lay off more people. SAM heads off towards the elevator.

     The room has ten tables formally set that line a long wall of
     floor to ceiling windows with a commanding view of the city
     beyond. The room is empty except for JOHN TULD sitting at the
     last table. TULD looks a little surprised to see SAM but
     waves him down. SAM approaches.

               Sam, please sit. Congratulations are
               clearly in order.

                  You did a hell of a job today, and I
                  thank you for it. Sit, excuse me for
                  eating but it's been a long day. Can I
                  get you anything?

                            SAM ROGERS
                  No, no thanks.

     They just sit in silence for a long beat as TULD takes a few
     more bites of his meal.

                            TULD
                  So what can I do for you?

                  I want out.

                  I'm done, I want out.

                            TULD
                  It's been a very difficult day, for
                  everyone.

                            SAM ROGERS
                  I need you to release my options, that is
                  if they're still worth anything after
                  today, and I need the bonus. I'm out.

                            TULD
                  You'll get the bonus, the options, and
                  keep your current base, but I need you to
                  stay with me for another 24 months. O.K?

     They look at each other, SAM seems to know it's not actually
     a question. SAM is a shell of himself as TULD takes another
     hearty bite of his meal. He finally looks up.

                            TULD (cont'd)
                  For God's sake man put a smile on your
                  face, you did some good today, you said
                  so yourself. I'm starting to feel a
                  little better about this whole thing.
                  You're one of the luckiest guys in the
                  world, you could've been digging ditches
                  all these years...

     SAM pushes back his chair, stands, and prepares to leave.

               That's true, and if I had been at least
               there'd be some holes in the ground to
               show for it. I'm just not quite sure how
               we fucked this thing up so badly.

     This pushes TULD a bit too far. He also senses he may be
     losing SAM. He drops his fork, and his tone changes.

                         TULD
               Jesus, when did you start feeling so
               sorry for yourself, it's unbearable...
               What, you think we may have helped put
               some people out of business today? That
               it's all just for naught? Well you've
               been doing that everyday for almost forty
               years Sam. And if all this is for naught
               then so is everything else out there.
               It's just money, it's made up, a piece of
               paper with some pictures on it so we
               don't all kill each other trying to get
               something to eat. But it's not wrong and
               it's certainly not any different today
               than it's ever been. Ever. 1637, 1797,
               1819, `37, `57,`84, 1901, `07, 1929, `37,

               motherfucker fuck me up good, 92, 97,
               2000, and whatever this is gonna be
               called. They're just the same thing over
               and over. We can't help ourselves, and
               you and I can't control it, stop it, slow
               it, or even ever so slightly alter it...
               We just react... and we get paid well for
               it if we're right... and get left by the
               side of the road if we're wrong. There's
               always been and there's always gonna be
               the same percentage of winners and
               losers, happy fucks and sad sacks, fat
               pigs and starving dogs in this world...
               yes there may be more of us today... but
               the percentages... they always stay
               exactly the same.

     They stare at each other for a long beat and then TULD looks
     down and takes another bite. He chews. He looks up again.

                         SAM ROGERS
               I'll do it John, but not because of your
               little speech, but because I need the
               money. I'm not sure how it could possibly
               be after all these years, but I need the
               money.

     JARED COHEN walking down the dining room aisle with PETER

     Fade up on SAM ROGERS standing in a hole in the backyard
     digging. Next to him is a large black medical-looking bag.

     He continues to dig. Eventually the flood lights from the
     house come on and the whole back yard lights up. Then the
     door opens and a woman in her fifties wearing a bath robe and
     slippers comes out onto the deck. It is SAM'S EX-WIFE. MARY
     ROGERS. She squints towards the back of the yard.
