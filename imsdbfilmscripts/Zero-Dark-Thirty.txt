          FROM BLACK, VOICES EMERGE--
          We hear the actual recorded emergency calls made by World
          Trade Center office workers to police and fire departments
          after the planes struck on 9/11, just before the buildings
          collapsed.

          TITLE OVER: SEPTEMBER 11, 2001
          We listen to fragments from a number of these calls...starting
          with pleas for help, building to a panic, ending with the
          caller's grim acceptance that help will not arrive, that the
          situation is hopeless, that they are about to die.

          I own you, Ammar. You belong to me.
          Look at me.
          This is DANIEL STANTON, the CIA's man in Islamabad - a big
          American, late 30's, with a long, anarchical beard snaking
          down to his tattooed neck. He looks like a paramilitary
          hipster, a punk rocker with a Glock.

          If you don't look at me when I talk
          to you, I hurt you. If you step off
          this mat, I hurt you. If you lie to
          me, I'm gonna hurt you. Now, Look
          at me.
          His prisoner, AMMAR, stands on a decaying gym mat, surrounded
          by four GUARDS whose faces are covered in ski masks.
          Ammar looks down. Instantly: the guards rush Ammar, punching
          and kicking.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Look at me, Ammar.
          Notably, one of the GUARDS wearing a ski mask does not take
          part in the beating.

          EXT. BLACK SITE - LATER

          Daniel and the masked figures emerge from the interrogation
          room into the light of day. They remove their masks and we
          see that one is a beautiful young woman in her mid-twenties.
          She has a pale, milky innocence and bright blue eyes, thin
          and somewhat frail looking, yet possessing a steely core
          that we will come to realize is off-the-charts. This is
          MAYA, a CIA targeter and subject-matter expert on her first
          overseas assignment.

                         DANIEL
          (to the guard)
          Are we gonna board up these windows
          or what?

                         (TO MAYA)
          Just off the plane from Washington,
          you're rocking your best suit for
          your first interrogation, and then
          you get this guy. It's not always
          this intense.

                         MAYA
          I'm fine.
          She's not.

                         DANIEL
          Just so you know, it's going to take
          awhile. He has to learn how helpless
          he is. Let's get a coffee.

                         MAYA
          No, we should go back in.
          Something about the strange intensity of her expression makes
          Daniel reconsider and he turns back to the interrogation
          room.

                         DANIEL
          You know, there's no shame if you
          wanna watch from the monitor.
          She shakes her head.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)
          Alright.
          At the door, Daniel hands the ski mask back to Maya.

          Ammar, bruised from the beating, is restrained with ropes.
          Maya stands a few feet behind Daniel, attentive, wary of
          what is to come. This is her first interrogation and she is
          on the verge of vomiting from the stench in the room. She
          looks around at the sound-proofed walls, the puddles of water
          on the floor.

                         DANIEL
          Right now, this is about you coming
          to terms with your situation. It's
          you and me, bro. I want you to
          understand that I know you, that
          I've been studying you for a very
          long time. I could have had you
          killed Karachi. But I let you live
          so you and I could talk.

          Life isn't always fair, my friend.
          Did you really think that when we
          got you, I'd be a nice fucking guy?

          And you're a money man. A paperboy!
          Daniel paces around Ammar, anger rising.

          He leans into Ammar's ear. Uncomfortably close.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)

          I don't want to talk about 9/11.

          No response from Ammar. Daniel starts putting on his gloves.

          Let's go.
          It all happens in a flash: in one swift motion, Daniel pushes
          Ammar to the floor, the guards pin his limbs, and Daniel
          smothers Ammar's face with a towel.
          Ammar thrashes. Daniel considers his next move.

          Maya follows Daniel's gesture to the corner of the room,
          where there's an ICE CHEST filled with WATER and a PLASTIC

          PITCHER.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)

          C'mon, let's go.
          The stress and strain on her face is enormous as she brings
          the bucket back to Daniel.
          Daniel starts pouring the water on Ammar's face, which is
          now covered by a towel. Ammar thrashes with rising panic.

                         DANIEL (CONT'D)

          Saudi group. Give me emails of the
          rest of the Saudi group! Give me

          Ammar doesn't speak. He can't.

          Daniel throws the pitcher, rips the rag off Ammar's mouth:
          and water spurts out - Ammar nearly drowned. He gasps for
          air.

          Daniel, shifting his persona yet again, touches Ammar's face

          You think this is political? If
          this was political we'd be having
          this conversation in October when
          there's an election bump. This is
          pure risk. Based on deductive
          reasoning, inference, supposition
          and the only human reporting you
          have is six years old, from detainees
          who are questioned under duress.

          with multiple points of egress and
          entries and with access to
          communications so that he can keep
