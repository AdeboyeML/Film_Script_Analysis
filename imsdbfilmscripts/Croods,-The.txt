           But not for me. My name's Eep. This, is
           my family, the Croods. If you weren't
           clued in already by the animal skins and
           sloping foreheads - we're cavemen. Most
           days we spend in our cave, in the dark.
           Night after night, day after day. Yep.
           Home sweet home. When we did go out, we
           struggled to find food in a harsh and
           hostile world. And I struggled to
           survive my family.

          all of her strength, but she manages to move it just
          enough for her to BARELY SQUEEZE out.

          face, awe turns to determination as she wheels and grabs
          the creature. She THROWS and FLIPS it over her shoulder.

          The Turkey LIFTS the creature to his mouth to DEVOUR it,
          but he's INTERRUPTED by a WHISTLING sound. He TURNS to
          see the silly little puppet dancing about. The Turkey
          Fish DROPS his meal and cautiously APPROACHES the puppet.

          The Turkey Fish MISSES the snare, LEAPS the rock and
          SNATCHES the fake bird off of Guy's head, THRASHING it.

          goes flying through the air, screaming.

          The Turkey Fish HITS the trigger. The snare TRIPS. The
          bird BITES at the cavemen, but comes up short. The
          Turkey Fish WHOOSHES BACKWARDS into the air. He FLIES a
          couple hundred feet up...

           Um, once upon a time, there was a
           beautiful tiger. She lived in a cave
           with the rest of her family. Her father

           more she could see, the more she could
           feel. Finally, she stood at the very
           edge, and she saw a light. She leaned

          Another earthquake shakes the cavern. Grug moves over to
          a wall and uses some nearby mud to paint a portrait of
          his family. He paints each member individually and then
          looks longingly at the family he will never see again.
                         
          The torch begins to go out. Grug blows on it and is
          startled by the massive Macawnivore beast, growling at
          him.

          just as frightened as Grug. Grug reaches out and pets

          Grug uses a log to wipe tar all over a giant rib cage.
          Grug runs out of the cave and into a nearby field and
          startles a pack of nesting PIRANHA OWLS. He turns back
          to the Macawnivore.

          in closer. The ground begins to break up violently as
          lakes empty themselves and entire forests turn sideways.
                         
          The Macawnivore rushes into a giant rib cage that Grug
          has coated with tar. The Piranha Owls hit the rib cage
          and stick to it. As they fight to free themselves, the
          rib cage lifts off the ground. Grug takes a giant tree
          branch, ignites it, and uses it as a rudder, scaring the
          Piranha Owls and prompting them to fly in one coherent
          direction.

          gerbils. Then Grug notices a familiar Liyote hiding
          under a nearby rock. He GRABS the Liyote. Grug sees the
          TRIP-GERBILS stranded as well. Grug TWIRLS the Trip-
