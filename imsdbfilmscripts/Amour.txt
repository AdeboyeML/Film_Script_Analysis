          SCENE 1 - INT. APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          The hallway is a mess. A window opening onto a light well is
          open.
                         
          The door to the apartment is suddenly broken open. A plain-
          clothes detective, two uniformed police officers and several
          firemen - also in uniform - enter and look around. They all
          wear gloves and masks that cover their mouths and noses.
          Behind them, the superintendent and his wife also push their
          way in. They're both holding their noses. In his free hand,
          the superintendent holds a pile of mail and promotional
          flyers. Behind him, comes a female neighbor.
                         
                          PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE

           Wait Outside please.
                         
          He signals to a police officer who herds the curious
          onlookers back out through the door.

          The plain-clothes detective has tried in vain to open the
          door on the left. It has been sealed up with adhesive tape.

           Can you try?
                         
          While the firemen go to work on the door, the plain-clothes
          detective goes into the adjoining dining room. He opens the
          windows quickly and turns to go into the room to the left via
          the double doors. They are locked and the gaps are also taped
          up. He turns to the right and goes into the living room,
          where he also opens up the windows...

          ...and comes back into the hallway, passing by the waiting
          firemen. Once again, we hear snatches of dialogue between the

          The plain-clothes detective enters the bedroom which is now
          accessible. Its windows are open and the draft makes the
          curtains billow into the room.
                         
                          PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE

          The firemen shake their heads.
                         
          The PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE turns toward the big double bed
          placed against the back wall of the bedroom. On the right-
          hand bed, there's only the bare mattress. On the left-hand
          bed lies the partly decomposed body of an old woman. Where
          once there were eyes, now there are only gaping holes. The
          corpse has been neatly dressed and is adorned with flowers
          that have already dried out a little. On her chest is a
          crucifix.

          SCENE 3 - INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT
                         
          All we see is the audience pouring into the hall. GEORGES and
          ANNE, both are around eighty, are part of this crowd. They go
          to their seats in one of the rows near the front. Once
          everybody is seated, we hear the usual ANNOUNCEMENT asking
          people to turn off their mobile phones. Some people, caught
          with their phones switched on, hasten to comply. Then the
          lights go out. APPLAUSE.
                         
          Off-screen, we hear the soloist make his entrance. THROATS
          ARE CLEARED here and there. Finally, the MUSIC begins.
                         
                         
          SCENE 4 - INT. ARTISTS DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          The music from Scene 3 continues. The soloist is surrounded
          by admirers who congratulate him.
                         
          Now Georges and Anne push their way into the room. (If the
          soloist is female, they will be carrying flowers, like most
          of the others).

          When the soloist notices their presence, he leaves his group
          of fans, heads towards them and greets them very warmly,
          visibly glad to see them.

          Continuation of the MUSIC from Scene 3.
                         
          Georges and Anne are seated side by side in the half empty
          bus. Anne talks enthusiastically, Georges says something from
          time to time, and smiles now and then. They are both relaxed
          and happy.
                         
          SCENE 6 - INT. APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          The door to the apartment is unlocked and opened from the
          outside. THE MUSIC ENDS.
                         
          Georges comes in, turns on the light. He and Anne observe the
          open door. Around the lock, one can see the traces of an
          attempted forced entry.
                         
          Georges bends down and runs his fingers over the deep
          grooves.
                         
                          GEORGES
           They used a screwdriver or
           something like that...it doesn't
           look very professional...

                          GEORGES
           No idea. Why do people break in?
           Because they want to steal
           something.

           (laughs briefly out loud)
           Hey, why not? If I thought about
           it, I could come up with at least
           three or four people we know who've
           been burgled.
                         
          After having examined the outside of the second leaf of the
          double door, he comes in, closing the door behind him.
           4.

           I'll do that tomorrow morning.
           Anyway, they didn't see anything.
                         
          He unbuttons his overcoat and heads toward the large closet
          in the hallway.

          She goes toward him, he takes her coat off and hangs it with
          his in the closet.

           that in her building, the attic
           apartment was burgled from the

           the wall, cut out all of the
           valuable pictures from their frames
           and disappeared without a trace.

          where he turns on the lights. We hear him FIDDLING AROUND,

          from the table. She goes toward the stove, turns off the gas,
          takes the egg out of the pan with a spoon and runs it under
          cold water. Like Georges, she is still in her robe.

           The saltcellar is empty.
                         
          He looks up for an instant, as if he expected her to deal
          with it. As she doesn't react, he realizes the
          inappropriateness of such an expectation, gets up himself,
          heads for the kitchen cupboards and fills the salt cellar.

           I don't know if he's going to bring
           us the CD. Maybe he won't come at
           all. In any case, he didn't mention
           it. I'd like to buy it. It was
           really good and I don't want to
           wait long for it. We could go to
           Virgin this afternoon and buy it.
           What do you say?

          He waits, looks at her. No reaction. He stands up slightly,
          leans over the table to sit beside her. Tries to make her
          turn toward him.

          wets a tea towel, wrings it out a little, comes back and
          places it on Anne's face. Waits for a reaction that doesn't
          come. Then he pulls up her hair in the nape of her neck and
          applies the cloth there. Then sits down and looks at her
          imploringly.

          Once again they both remain seated. In the background, we
          hear the GUSHING of the tap that in his panic he has
          forgotten to turn it off.
                         
          Making a sudden decision, he gets up, rapidly crossing the
          hallway, he goes into the bedroom where he starts to dress
          agitatedly, which takes him quite a lot of time. Suddenly,
          the GUSHING of the tap stops, which had accompanied us as far
          as the bedroom.

          tries to calm down, takes his chair that has remained beside

          She waits till he's outside. Tries to relax. Then she
          remembers the book. She takes it in her left hand and tries

          Then she notices that she's forgotten her glasses. She rests
          the book back on the bed cover and fishes for her glasses on

           other and who then, out of sheer
           magnanimity, decide to renounce
           their love - in fact I don't quite
           remember it any more. In any case,
           afterwards I was thoroughly
           distraught, and it took me a bit of
           time to calm down. In the courtyard
           of the house where grandma lived,
           there was a young guy at the window
           who asked me where I'd been. He was
           a couple of years older than me, a
           braggart who of course really
           impressed me. "To the movies", I
           said, because I was proud that my
           grandma had given me the money to
           go all alone to the cinema.

           him the story made all my feelings
           and tears come back, almost more

          The front door is unlocked from the outside, and Georges

           It was rather bizarre. The priest
           was an idiot. Then one of Pierre's
           co-workers made a speech that was
           embarrassingly emotional. His old
           secretary came with a radio-
           cassette player and after the
           speech she put on "Yesterday" by
           the Beatles. You can't imagine.
           Everybody turned round to look at
           her. Apparently, it wasn't planned.
           His grandchildren were there. Of
           course they giggled as soon as the
           music began. Then the urn was put
           on a huge stretcher that was
           obviously designed for a coffin,
           and out we went into the rain. They
           placed the urn on a small electric
           cart that crawled along for what
           seemed like an eternity to the tiny
           hole they had dug. A lot of people
           had to stifle their laughter. It
           must have been terrible for Jeanne.

          But Georges has already left the room with the bouquet and
          closed the door behind him. The soloist looks around him.
                         
          After a few moments we hear the VOICES of Anne and Georges in
          the distance, without understanding what they're saying. It
          lasts a while.
                         
          Finally Georges opens the door and pushes Anne, in her
          wheelchair, into the living room.

          usual landing, we see an empty room lit a giorno but without
          a window, about as large as the rooms in the apartment. It
          looks like an unpainted room in a new apartment. A couple of
          ladders are propped against the opposite wall. At the other
          end of the room, to the side, is a small door. Georges is
          stunned, and doesn't understand what has happened.

          Georges opens the small door. Behind it is a narrow,
          windowless corridor, as brightly lit as the room. At the end
          of the corridor, a door. Georges heads toward this door and
          opens it too. Behind it is a tiny windowless room, equally
          bright as the others. Everything is very quiet. Georges
          enters, turns round, then goes back along the corridor,
          crosses the room, comes through the apartment door into the
          hallway of the apartment. But it too is now empty and bright,
          with bare unpainted walls, no doors; only the door to the
          bedroom is open. Behind that too, it appears to be empty and
          bright. Georges goes toward it.
                         
          At the same time, we hear GEORGES' VOICE. At first he groans,
          but then begins inarticulately hollering, louder and louder.

          landed on the window ledge.
                         
          It walks to and fro, then finally dares to jump down inside,
          onto the floor. It starts to explore the surroundings.
                         
          We hear the TOILET FLUSH. Georges comes out of the toilet.
          The door opening frightens the pigeon. Alarmed, flapping its
          wings, it flutters about the room.
                         
          After a moment of surprise, Georges tries to shoo it back
          toward the window. But the bird escapes in the opposite
          direction. George follows it.
                         
          He closes the doors of the other rooms. Coming from the
          bedroom, we faintly hear ANNE'S VOICE.

          bird. He hits out at the bird for so long that it escapes
          back out through the window. Georges, visibly exhausted, has
          to sit down on the chest in the hallway.

          Georges wipes his face and, to the sound of Anne's cries,
          crosses the hallway and enters the bedroom.
                         
          Anne continues to cry out in a monotone to herself.

          He raises her blanket for an instant and sniffs, then

           we'll... Hold on, I'll tell you a
           story... but you must be quiet, I
           can't talk too loud, it wears me
           out... Here we go: when I was
           little... well, I wasn't as little
           as all that... it was toward the
           end of primary school, so I was
           about ten, Dad and Mom sent me to a
           holiday camp. They thought it would
           do me good to spend the summer with
           kids my own age... We were lodged
           in an old castle in the midst of a
           magnificent wooded landscape... I
           think it was in the Auvergne... I
           don't know... in any case it was
           the opposite of what I'd
           expected... We had to get up at 6
           and go for a morning swim. Not far
           from the castle, there was a pond
           fed by an icy mountain stream. We
           entered it running, in a double
           file. You know, I was never very
           sporty. They had a program to keep
           us on the go all day, probably to
           nip any potential pubescent
           impulses in the bud ... But the
           worst thing was the food. The third
           day after our arrival, there was
           rice pudding for lunch. I hate rice
           pudding. We sat at long tables in a
           huge hall. I didn't want to eat the
           stuff and the housemaster said to
           me: You won't get up until you've
           cleared your plate. So after the
           meal everybody left the room, and I
           remained seated, in tears. I had
           made a secret pact with Mom. I was
           to send her a postcard every week.

           If I was pleased with the place I
           was to draw some flowers on it, or
           if not, some stars. She kept the
           card; it was covered all over in
           stars. After three hours, I was
           allowed to leave the table. I went
           up to my room, got into bed and had
           a fever of 42 degrees. It was
           diphtheria. They took me to the
           nearest hospital where I was put in
           an isolation ward, which meant that
           Mom, when she came to visit me,
           could only wave at me through a
           window. At some point I lost that
           postcard. It's a pity.
                         
          Anne has become ever calmer during Georges' story. He still
          holds her hand.
                         
          LONG SILENCE.
                         
          Then Georges reaches across Anne's body to get hold of his
          pillow and presses it over her face. STIFLED SOUNDS from
          Anne. Everything that can still move in her body starts to
          move. Georges presses down heavily on the pillow, lies on it
          with his whole weight, for a long time, until all Anne's
          movements stop. Then he sits up, exhausted, and without
          removing the pillow from her face, remains seated beside her.

          Hallway.
                         
          The front door of the apartment is unlocked. Georges, in city
          clothes, enters with two big shopping bags full of cut
          flowers. He puts down the bags, takes off his coat, hangs it
          in the closet.
                         
          The TELEPHONE RINGS. Georges takes the bags and carries them
          in the kitchen, puts them in the sink, fills it with water.
          He starts to cut the stems and put the flowers in the water.
          We watch him doing so for a while. Meanwhile, the TELEPHONE
          HAS STOPPED RINGING.
                         
          SCENE 56 - INT. HALLWAY - DAY
                         
          Georges has opened one of the sections of the large wall
          closet. He is looking for a specific dress. He takes some
          out, puts them back inside. One of the dresses slips off its
          hanger and falls to the floor. He picks it up, hangs it up
          again. He ends up finding the one he was looking for. He
          takes it out on its hanger. Closes the closet again.

          Looks at the dress. Then he lowers his arm a little and is
          about to leave the bedroom. He catches his feet in the dress.
                         
          He just saves himself from tripping up by grabbing on to the
          wheelchair that is parked there. Exhausted, he flops down
          into it.
                         
          SCENE 57 - INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
                         
          With wide adhesive tape, Georges seals up the door frame of

          Georges is seated at the kitchen table where he had breakfast
          with Anne in Scene 8, and writes a letter. PAUSES for
          reflection. GENTLE COOING OF PIGEONS, scarcely audible.
          Suddenly, Georges starts.
                         
          At the far end of the long kitchen, beside the door between
          the kitchen units, a pigeon is walking. Georges stares at it.
          For a long time.
                         
          Then he gets up slowly and, via the door located beside the
          kitchen table, he goes into the adjoining room.
                         
          On the sofa there, he has set up his new bed. He takes the
          wool blanket from the bed and comes back into the kitchen,
          carefully approaches the pigeon that then runs off in alarm.
          Georges carefully opens up the blanket and finally throws it
          over the pigeon. But it manages to escape into the hallway.
                         
          Georges follows it. This action is repeated several times.
          The pigeon is more and more panicky, starts to fly up,
          flutters about in all directions. Georges closes the light-
          well window to cut off its escape route. This lasts an
          exhausting amount of time, but he ends up capturing it. He
          cuddles it against him, rolled up in the blanket, leans
          against a wall, then holds it as if it were a baby.

          From the adjoining room, we see Georges seated at the kitchen
          table, writing. Finally we see what he is writing:
                         
          ... you won't believe it. A pigeon came in, for the second
          time already, through the light well. This time I caught it.
          In fact it wasn't difficult at all. But I set it free again.

          Georges is lying on his bed in the adjoining room, staring at
          the ceiling. O.S., we faintly hear the SOUND of running
          water, and from time to time the CLATTERING OF DISHES.
                         
          After a while, Georges gets up and goes into the kitchen.
                         
          He remains in the doorway and watches Anne who, doing the
          dishes, at first doesn't pay attention to him, then notices
          his presence and shoots him a quick glance, saying casually:
                         
                          ANNE

           You can put your shoes on if you
           want.
                         
          Georges looks at her an instant longer, passes beside her,
          goes into the hallway, sits down on a stool beside the closet
          and puts on his shoes. O.S. we hear Anne finishing her work.
          She comes out, hangs up her apron in the closet, disappears
          for a few moments into the bathroom. Meanwhile, Georges has
          got up, and looks in the bathroom where, clearly, Anne is
          tidying her hair and sprucing herself up. When she comes out
          again, he takes her coat from the closet and helps her put it
          on.
                         
                          ANNE
           Thanks.
                         
          They head for the front door.
                         
                          ANNE (CONT'D)
           Aren't you taking a coat?
                         
          Georges thinks a few seconds, then takes his trench-coat from
          the hook and they leave the apartment.

          Four long shots: all the windows are open. The sun is

          SILENCE. Then the SOUND OF A LOCK BEING OPENED. Eva comes
          into the apartment. Remains a long time beside the door.
          Looks around her, ill at ease. Finally she hesitantly goes
          into the bedroom.

          Anne's twin bed isn't there any more. On Georges' bed lies
          only the bare mattress. Eva remains there a moment, then goes
          through the partition door into the dining room.
                         
          There, everything is as usual. Eva continues into the living
          room.
                         
          There too, everything is as usual. Eva stops by the piano
          stool. Looks out of the window, feeling at a loss. Then she
          heads toward the sofa and armchairs in the corner. On the
          table lie the remains of a snack. Eva looks at the table,
          turns again toward the open windows, through which we hear
          STREET NOISE. Then she sits down, exhausted, in one of the
          armchairs. Her diminutive frame seems lost in the big room.
