          whose legs and arms (up to the elbow) have been bit off,
          smaller, CHILD SIZE bite marks cover his body.

          They instantly fall to the side.
                         
          Will, Mike and Ben look over to see what broke their fall- a
          just as startled Pennywise, writhing in anger.

          She fires a bottle rocket at Pennywise's face, exploding
          right into his eye. The clown reels back howling.
                         
          Richie and Ben jump in and grab Eddie.
                         
          Pennywise pulls the rocket out of his burned socket and
          growls at the boys, morphing into an ORANGE GAS that shoots
          back into the fridge.
                         
          Eddie, Ben and Richie climb to safety through the window,

          Dozens of loggers are bellied up at the bar, drinking beers,
          spitting chew on the sawdust covered floor. The man with the
          ax, CLAUDE HEROUX, elbows himself a place at the bar and
          throws down a TWO DOLLAR BILL.
                                                                   92.
                         
                         
          The bartender brings Heroux a schooner of beer, one
          hardboiled egg in a bowl, a shaker of salt and some change.
          Heroux salts the egg and the beer, his piercing eyes stuck on
                         
          A CARD GAME AT A TABLE OF 5 MEN IN BACK
                         
          He devours the egg, downs the beer, then lets out a belch.
          The man next to him gives a friendly nod. Heroux doesn't
          respond. He kicks back from the bar, dragging his ax behind.
                         
          Heroux walks past a piano being played, whispers something
          into the players ear, then throws the change from his meal --
          $1.85 -- onto the piano top. The piano player tips his hat
          and changes tune to something more festive, manic almost.
                         
          Heroux continues into the back, walking like a man in a half
          dream.
                         
          At the table, EL KATOOK deals out a hand to a group of
          railroad bulls -- TINKER MCCUTCHEON, FLOYD CALDERWOOD,
          "STUGLEY" GRENIER, and EDDIE KING, a bearded man whose
          spectacles are almost as fat as his gut.

          Floyd reaches out to grab his hand when...
                         
          THUNK!
                         
          Heroux's ax falls, chopping of Floyd's hand at the wrist.
          Floyd recoils back shrieking, blood spurting from the stump,
          his severed hand remaining on the table.
                         
          At the bar somebody calls for more beer. The bartender takes
          a casual look back just in time to see...
                         
          Heroux bury his ax in Tinker McCutchoen's head. The big man
          tries to get up, blood pouring down his face, then sits back
          down again. A second chop finishes him.
                         
          Floyd, writhing under the table, gropes for his hand on the
          table above it. Heroux chops his other hand off, Floyd
          screams even louder.
                         
          Laughter from the bar as patrons rub the bartender's bald
          head for luck. The piano playing only gets more giddy and
          festive, then we see who's playing it:
                         
          PENNYWISE, fingers dancing across the keys like a virtuoso.
                         
          Heroux turns to Ed Katook, who struggles to pull his clutch
          pistol from its shoulder holster. He slings the ax sideways
          just as Katook gets the pistol out, burying it in his back.
                                                                  93.
                         
                         
          CRACK!
                         
          A shot goes off. But at the bar, conversation between two
          loggers turns to the weather. This winter will be a jeezer.
                         
          Fat Eddie King falls to the floor trying to crab away from
          the table. Heroux, bloody ax dragging on the floor, comes
          over to the fat man who pleads.
                         
                                             EDDIE KING
                    Please Claude, I just got married
                    last month.
                         
          The ax comes down into Eddie's ample gut. Blood sprays all
          the way up to the Dollar's beamed roof.
                         
          Men at the bar laugh and eat their boiled eggs, dully aware
          of the gorefest behind them.
                         
          Heroux pulls the ax out of his gut like you would a softwood
          tree, rocking it back and forth. It finally comes free and he
          brings it down again.
                         
          THWAP!
                         
          Eddie's severed head goes rolling over toward the bar, right
          to the foot of a drunk, who without breaking his call for
          another drink, kicks it away.
                         
          In back, Heroux turns to the last man cowering in the corner:
          Stugley Grenier. He takes a swing and Stugley ducks it, ax
          splintering the floor.
                         
          Stugley scrambles into the OUTHOUSE and closes the door
          behind. Heroux, now totally slicked with blood, stalks over
          and begins chopping his way in.
                         
          He finds the windowless room empty. A sound comes from deep
          in the pooping hole. He looks down just in time to see...
                         
          Stugley's boots disappear through the pool of shit and piss.
                         
          Heroux steps out of the outhouse into the carnage of the back

          shoots it with a crossbow. It goes slithering back in.

          They all nod and follow Will onto the structure, starry deep
          space through the oculus visible over their shoulders. They
          come to a child-sized TRAP DOOR with an ancient, cosmic
          marking. The only way in or out.

          The kids steal themselves, weapons ready. Mike hammers a
          clip into the stone and ties a rope to it. Nods all around.
                         
          WILL TURNS THE LATCH

          Will shimmies down about 5 feet of rope and lights a car
          flare, illuminating the chamber in a blood red pall. The
          walls inside are rough, like the surface of a meteor.
                         
          Directly under the trapdoor is a fountain like hole in the
          floor open to the reflecting pool. Floating on the water is
                         
          GEORGIE'S PAPER BOAT
                         
          Pennywise emerges from the shadows behind Will, clinging to

          The trapdoor slams shut and slices the rope. Will falls to
          the floor, flare falling into the water. It dims but doesn't
          go out.
                         
          It's near PITCH BLACK. Just Will and Pennywise. He can hear
          his friends banging on the door, calling for him but can't
          see anything.
                         
          There's scuffling all around him. Close. Will dives into
          the water for the flare. Rises. Sweeps it around.
                         
          NOTHING.

          Will drops his bag of flares and scrambles off, tripping over
          the hole in the floor, leg sloshing in the pool.
                         
          Glimpses of Pennywise scuffling in the dark like a spider.
                         
          Will finds a corner, the flare running out of spark. He
          waves it this way and that, illuminating the dark in front of
          him. Swinging his baseball bat wildly at shadows.

          Will looks at the last light of his flare, waiting for the
          end. He looks the bat in his clutch only to see it's morphed

          bald head. His claw-like hands and his emaciated acrobat-

          Will's eyes fall to the baseball bat half-way between them.
