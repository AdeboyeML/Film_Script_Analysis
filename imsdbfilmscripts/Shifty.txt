1   INT. COACH / MOTORWAY. MORNING

    A large empty coach, all dull beige seats and wood veneer,
    makes its way along a stretch of motorway.


2   INT. COACH / MOTORWAY. MORNING

    At the back of the coach we see a lone passenger. His eyes
    closed, head drooped. Suddenly he raises a hand and rubs the
    bridge of his nose. It's no use, Chris, 25, can't sleep. He
    pulls up a set of head phones, puts them on, and presses play
    on his MP3.


3   INT. COACH. MORNING

    Long shot from the front of the coach, the driver's gruff
    face to the left, empty seats filtering away from camera,
    Chris' head peaking above a back seat. We hear the music
    from his MP3 begin to play. It's Noel McKoy's "Brighter Day",
    a northern soul track that's reminiscent of Motown and
    comparable to the vocal sound of Marvin Gaye.

    The track will play over the following opening scenes, the
    credits fading subtly in and out in white text.


4   EXT. STREET. MORNING

    We follow from behind as a hooded character walks with intent
    through Dudlowe: a sprawling new town built in the fifties to
    house the east end after the Second World War.

                                                      CUT TO:

    We reveal Shifty, 25, Pakistani, as he makes his way through
    those morning streets. He blows on his hands to warm them up.

                            SHIFTY

    Suddenly he ducks down and nips through an opening in a
    fence, making a short cut.


5   INT. TREVOR HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNING

    Bird's eye view on Trevor Perry, average looking, thickset,
    pallid skin, lying beneath the surface of the bath water,
    holding his nose.


    SIDE ANGLE ON BATH: TREVOR RISES, NOT GASPING FOR AIR, JUST
    CALM, UNNATURAL ALMOST. SNOT RUNS FROM HIS NOSTRILS.
                                                            2.

6    INT. COACH. MORNING.

     Chris stares out of the window. The music still playing on
     his MP3. The coach makes a sharp left turn, the camera just
     catching a glimpse of the sign: DUDLOWE NEW TOWN.


7    INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING

     Glen, a severe almost cruel face, empty's about a kilo of
     cocaine onto a clean glass table.


8    INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING

     Jasmine, 25, pretty with out make up, dressed in a white
     dressing gown, prepares breakfast.


9    EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. MORNING

     Shifty makes his way across a patch of waste land, jumping
     over a fence at the end.


10   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING

     Suddenly Jasmine lurches toward the sink and vomits.


11   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / BEDROOM. EARLY MORNING

     In an agreeably decorated bedroom Trevor dresses for work. He
     climbs into his thick checked shirt and jeans, no real
     enthusiasm - life seems to hold no motivation.


12   INT. COACH. MORNING

     Chris watches out the window as the coach passes the same
     strip of waste land Shifty just walked across.


13   GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING

     Glen splits the cocaine into two piles.


14   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / BEDROOM. MORNING

     Trevor sits on the edge of the bed, staring at the floor. His
     mind is racing, thinking about the morning ahead of him.
                                                           3.

15   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING

     Jasmine washes away the sick with a jug of water.


16   EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. MORNING

     The coach pulls away to reveal Chris, his bag slung over his
     shoulder.

     A BEAT.

     He turns and walks off.


17   TREVOR'S HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNING

     Trevor looks at him self in the bathroom mirror, he rubs his
     face, he seems a little more with it.


18   INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING

     Glen opens a tub of Glucose and empties a measure into one
     half of the cocaine. He mixes it carefully.


19   EXT. REZ'S HOUSE / BACK GARDEN. MORNING

     Shifty opens a back gate and walks towards a house.


20   EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. DAY

     Chris makes his way through the streets, bag slung over his
     shoulder. He looks around at the old place. Soaking it in.


21   INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING

     Glen takes a spoon of cocaine from the unmixed half and mixes
     it with citric acid. He sucks it up into a syringe.


22   EXT. REZ'S HOUSE . MORNING

     Shifty quietly opens the back door to the house.


23   INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT / BEDROOM. MORNING

     Glen carries the syringe to Loretta, pretty , but with bad
     facial burns on the side of her face. He injects the cocaine
     mix into her arm. She lays back on the bed, taking on the
     rush.
                                                           4.

24   EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. MORNING

     Chris walks along a residential road, in his hand a piece of
     paper with a scribbled address. He finds the right house. He
     stands there for a moment then hits stop on his MP3. Our
     soulful soundtrack comes to an end. He pulls down his head
     phones, walks to the door and knocks gently.


25   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING

     Shifty stands at the table sorting through letters. He hears
     the knock and walks to open it. He takes off his jacket, puts
     it on a hanger and opens the front door to reveal Chris.

                         SHIFTY
               Fucking hell, man...

     Shifty can't help but smile.

                         SHIFTY (CONT'D)
               You're early!

                         CHRIS
               Shifty.

     A smile creeps across Chris' face.

                         SHIFTY
               Yes, rude boy.

                         CHRIS
               You alright geezer.

                         SHIFTY
               I'm sweet... come in, man, come in.

     Shifty and Chris embrace.

                         CHRIS
               Good to see you, mate.

                         SHIFTY
               Good to see you too, geezer.


26   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNING


     CLOSE ON: WATER GUSHES FROM A TAP.

     Chris stands splashing his face from the sink. His bag
     perched on the cistern. He looks at himself in the mirror.
                                                           5.

27   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / SHIFTY'S BEDROOM. EARLY MORNING

     Chris walks into Shifty's bedroom. He puts down his bag and
     pulls on a fresh tee shirt. He looks around at the room. New
     DVD player, LCD on the wall, a new game console, DVD's, CD's,
     lots of pristine trainers placed perfectly side by side,
     books about business, books about film, a perfectly stacked
     pile of mobile phone bills with the word "PAID" scribed
     across them. A picture of Mohammed Ali next to a picture of
     Allah. He approaches the window and looks out at the morning
     sun resting over a dull, featureless Dudlowe New-Town. He
     stands, staring.


28   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING

     Chris walks into the kitchen to see Shifty getting breakfast
     ready. Shifty turns to face him.

                         SHIFTY
               You alright son?

                         CHRIS
               Yeah I just needed to splash my
               face, freshen up a bit.

                         SHIFTY
               Have you slept?

                         CHRIS
               Did I fuck.

                         SHIFTY
               Mate, neither have I... I just got
               back from some girls yard.

                         CHRIS
               You got a bird?

                         SHIFTY
               No, no... just some fucking booty
               call.

                         CHRIS
               What, Break Glass Arse?

                         SHIFTY
               In case of emergency's, man... you
               know it.

     They both laugh. Shifty lays sausages into a pan.

                          CHRIS
               She fit?

                          SHIFTY
               What!
                                                      6.

                       CHRIS
          She fit?

                    SHIFTY
          Yeah, she's alright you know....
          She's got fucking massive Gary's.

Chris laughs.

                    CHRIS
          You always loved your titties,
          bruv.

                    SHIFTY
          You know that!

Shifty lays sausages into a sizzling pan.

                    SHIFTY (CONT'D)
          Mate, do you mind halal?

                    CHRIS
          No, no, that's sweet mate,
          whatever.

A BEAT.

                    SHIFTY
          Were you on just one bus?

                    CHRIS
          Yeah... no sorry, two. I had to
          change at Luton.

                       SHIFTY
          LUTON!

                       CHRIS
          Yeah, man.

                    SHIFTY
          Fucking random.

Shifty covers the sausages with a lid. We hear someone moving
about upstairs. Shifty quickly walks over to the freezer,
opens the door, reaches into the back and pulls out a large
bag of sweet corn.

                    SHIFTY (CONT'D)
          I've got a few things to do today
          geezer, you can stay here if you
          want, just chill out.

He rummages about, and gradually, one by one, pulls out
tightly, cellophane-wrapped bags of coke and crack. He places
them in the pockets of his hooded top. Chris watches Shifty
closely, but doesn't say anything.
                                                           7.

                         SHIFTY (CONT'D)
               Or you can come with me?

                           CHRIS
               Whatever.

     A BEAT.

                         CHRIS (CONT'D)
                   (whispers)
               Does your brother know you keep
               those there?

     Shifty shakes his head.

                         CHRIS (CONT'D)
                   (Whispering)
               You not worried?

                         SHIFTY
               Mate, he doesn't eat vegetables.

     Shifty walks past Chris and taps reassuringly him on the arm.


     WE STAY ON CHRIS' FACE, AS HE TAKES IT IN.

                         SHIFTY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
               Apart from in a pot noodle.


29   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / STAIRWELL / KITCHEN. MORNING

     We follow Trevor from behind as he descends the stairs and
     walks into a large, smartly decked kitchen, an eight-year-old
     boy, Freddie, circles the kitchen-table smashing a Darth
     Vader into passing stools. Katie a three year old baby girl
     eats breakfast and Jasmine beats eggs in a bowl whilst
     talking on the phone.

                           JASMINE
                     (on phone)
               ... she's living like a drifter babe,
               I'm telling you, she's split... sort
               of... with Stefan... I know she did...
               but she stays at Mike's in the
               week, and then she's back at
               Stefan's at the weekend... with the
               kids (to baby) Katie, darling, stop
               banging your bowl...

     Trevor considers the bowl of cereal and fruit juice laid out
     for him. His stomach churns. Cold sweat smothers his brow.
                                                            8.

                           JASMINE (CONT'D)
                     (on phone)
               ...Neither knows about the other, and
               then she expects me (she drops to a
               whisper) to fucking cover for her
               (normal volume) Stefan's my mate
               for Christ's sake, I'm not getting
               caught up in that whole mess (to
               boy) Freddie, sit down and finish
               your breakfast!

     This is too much for Trevor. He turns and walks away from the
     table.

                           JASMINE (CONT'D)
                     (on phone)
               ... and she has a go at me for taking
               on too much
                     (she laughs - then without
                      looking up)
               Babe, I'm cooking you some eggs...

     SLAM - the front door crashes shut - he's gone - his
     breakfast untouched.

                             JASMINE (CONT'D)
               Oh... what... nothing, Trevor's just
               walked out without touching his
               breakfast... I don't know, I thought
               so anyway...


30   EXT. DRIVEWAY. MORNING

     Silence. Trevor soaks it in - deep breaths - panic subsiding.
     He approaches his work van. "T. PALMER - BUILDER'S MERCHANT"
     inscribed on the side. He gets in - suddenly his mobile rings
     - he answers.

                         JASMINE
               What's the matter?

     Off screen Katie continues to bash her bowl on the tray.

                         TREVOR
               Nothing, I'm fine.

                         JASMINE
               Why didn't you say good-bye?

                         TREVOR
               You were gassing away to Nicola...

                          JASMINE
               And why didn't you touch your
               breakfast?
                                                           9.

                         TREVOR
               I'm not hungry.

     Off Screen Freddie yells.

                         JASMINE
               What's the matter with you?

                           TREVOR
               I'm fine.

     She runs the tap, water gushes on to the discarded eggs.

                         JASMINE
               Where's the grey suitcase?

                         TREVOR
               What? I can't hear you babe.

                         JASMINE
               I want to start getting stuff ready
               for next week - where's the grey
               suitcase?

                         TREVOR
               I'll find it when I get home.

                         JASMINE
               It's all right babe I'll get it.

               Jasmine, I'll get it when I get
               home.

               I'LL FIND THE FUCKING THING WHEN I
               GET HOME.

     CLICK!

     He breathes in hard, takes a moment to calm down and then
     starts the engine.


31   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / FRONT ROOM. MORNING

     Jasmine drops the phone by her side, shocked at Trevor's
     temperament, and watches through the front room window as he
     drives away.
                                                          10.

32   INT. SHIFTY'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING

     Shifty's laying out the breakfast. At that moment, Rez,
     Shifty's brother, walks in. Mid 30's, portly. He sees Chris.

                          REZ
                   (PAKISTANI - SUBTITLED)

     Chris stands and goes to embrace Rez, but Rez walks past and
     grabs a glass of orange juice from the side.

stare.

Chris looks back down at his magazine. Rez knows he hit a raw
nerve. An uncomfortable silence. Shifty tries to break the
ice by talking about a more trivial topic.

     Sitting, staring, suddenly Jasmine notices something on the
     tiled surface. She rubs her finger over it to reveal the
     residue of a white powder.

frail man, eyes sunken, hair thinning. His denim jacket
giving him the only dignity from looking like a walking
corpse. Seated next to him is Loretta. She's pulling out a
crack pipe itching to take a hit. Shifty leans through the
window and in one swift move takes a package from Lenny,
slipping it into his jacket, and drops a pile of cash into
his lap.

     Bob comes around from his side of the desk.

                         BOB
               No, Trevor, no.

                         TREVOR
               Bob just hear me out.

                         BOB
               Get out of my office.

                         TREVOR
               Bob please I've paid out on all the
               materials, I've lost money.

                         BOB
               You should have thought about that
               before you started bringing drugs
               onto my site.

                         TREVOR
               You owe me money.

                         BOB
               I owe you fuck all.

                         TREVOR
               YOU OWE ME MY FUCKING MONEY.

                         BOB
               Tell it to the police, and I'll
               tell `em why you got kicked off the
               fucking job.

                         TREVOR

                         BOB
               Fuck off, Trevor.

     Bob turns and walks out the porta-cabin. Trevor follows.

                          TREVOR
               Bob.

     Bob ignores him.

                         TREVOR (CONT'D)
               Bob I need this money.

     Bob stays quiet, approaches a workman and starts talking to
     him. Trevor stands behind them.

                          TREVOR (CONT'D)
               Bob!

     Bob turns to him, and puts out his hand.

                         BOB
               Thank's for coming today Trevor,
               we'll definitely be in touch.

     Bob's hand hangs there. Trevor looks at him, to the hand. Bob
     turns away and carries on talking. Trevor stands for a moment
     then turns and walks away. Trevor's face is awash with
     emotion, it looks like he wants to cry but he holds it
     together.


61   EXT. HILL TOP. DAY

     Shifty and Chris sit atop of a hill looking out across a
     skate park - The camera observing them from behind. Shifty
     hands Chris a rolled spliff. Shifty doesn't say anything,
     doesn't want to push Chris.

     Chris looks back out over the estate. Shifty's phone starts
     ringing. He looks at the screen it reads Trevor P MOB. He
     hits reject.


62   INT. TREVOR'S VAN. DAY

     Trevor gets the answering machine. He smashes out at his
     dashboard.


63   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. DAY

     Rez carries a bundle of dirty clothes to the washing machine
     and clumsily throws them in. He pulls out the powder tray but
     it comes out completely from the machine.

                         REZ
               FUCK!

     He tries to wedge it back in but it doesn't want to go. Rez
     gets down on his knees and tries again, to no avail. He looks
     in the gap, and sees something.
                                                          30.

     He sticks his fingers in and starts rooting around. He has
     something; slowly Rez pulls out a large, see-through,
     watertight bag brimming with wraps of cocaine and crack. Rez
     sits back against the machine just staring at it.


64   EXT. HILL TOP. DAY

     Shifty and Chris just sit. Suddenly Chris notices something.

                         CHRIS
               What's that?

                          SHIFTY

65   EXT. PARK. DAY

     Shifty and Chris approach an extreme sports park ride that
     helps build upper strength. At either end of a raised beam
     are two handles.

                         CHRIS
               What does it fucking do?

     Chris grabs the handles and starts moving with it.

                         CHRIS (CONT'D)
               Mate, grab the other end.

     Shifty grabs the handles and starts running parallel to
     Chris, suddenly they both lift off the ground.

                         CHRIS (CONT'D)
               FUCKING HELL!

66   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN / BATHROOM. DAY

     On Jasmine's kitchen floor, just outside the connecting
     bathroom, are stacked a variety of toiletry goods. The sounds
     of scrubbing and movement echo out. Jasmine, her dressing
     gown grubby and soaked, cleanses, scrubs, and cleans the
     emptied bathroom like a woman possessed. She's purging her
     haven, washing away the sin that has tainted her sanctum.
                                                          31.

     A fairly respectable but featureless tenement block looms.


68   INT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS/CORRIDOR. DAY

     Shifty and Chris stand before a racing green door upon which
     a small ceramic emblem of a cat nestles under the number
     eight. Shifty knocks on the door. Silence. He stares at the
     emblem of the cat.

                         SHIFTY
               Fucking cat lovers.

     Shifty laughs. Then they stand for a second waiting. Shifty
     knocks again.

     A BEAT.

     Shifty bends down and looks through the letterbox. He sees a
     shadow approaching. He stands back up. The latch snaps,
     echoing down the clinical looking hallway.

     INT. VALERIE'S FLAT / HALLWAY. DAY

     We follow Shifty through a corridor deprived of light and
     colour. Valerie, who leads the way, is considerably smaller.
     We open into the front room and Valerie's revealed for the
     first time. At 5'5" with long arms book-ended by bony hands
     and a sculptured face, she smacks of an ageing Goth and is
     clearly an old hippie, her brain starched by LSD. Sleeping
     cats inhabit the surroundings like stationed guards.

     A BEAT.

     Valerie looks towards Chris.

                         SHIFTY
               Valerie, this is Chris, he's erm,
               he's an old friend of mine, we grew
               up together. He's cool. We go way
               back. So it's cool, you know.

                         CHRIS
               How you doing?

     He offers a hand that she takes politely.

                           VALERIE
               Yeah. Hi.

     A moment of uncomfortable silence.

                         SHIFTY
               I called yesterday but you were
               out.

               Did you say two o'clock.

                         SHIFTY

     INT. VALERIE'S FRONT ROOM. DAY

     Chris looks about at the bits and bobs that litter her front
     room. Sleeping felines. Chintzy ornaments of cats. He picks
     up a framed photo of her daughter, Loretta, in better days,
     fresh faced, before the scars, ready to take on the world. He
     looks slightly shocked to see this.

                                                       CUT TO:

     Chris sits in a sunken armchair, and looks around the room.
     He looks closely at a sleeping cat near his chair. He moves
     his foot and touches it but it slides along the floor, not
     moving just solid, as if frozen. It dawns on Chris that all
     the cats in the room are stuffed.
                                                          34.

     Chris sits back in the chair, suddenly from next door, the
     deep hum of a drum and bass track starts thumping through the
     wall. It's so heavy it makes the shelves of chintzy cat
     ornaments rattle.


71                                                                   *
     INT. VALERIE'S KITCHEN. DAY

     Valerie prepares the tea whilst Shifty leans against the
     counter top.

                         SHIFTY
               How you been, alright.

                         VALERIE
               Yeah, I'm alright babe, you
               alright?

                         SHIFTY
               Yeah, I'm alright.

                         VALERIE
               Good, good.

     Silence as Valerie prepares the tea.

                         SHIFTY
               She visited you yet?

                         VALERIE
               No... not for a long time,
               Shifty... not seen her for a long
               time really, darling.

     Shifty walks over to Valerie and starts helping her make the
     tea. He seems to know where stuff is in this kitchen. He
     places a hand on her arm.

                         SHIFTY
               She'll come back one day.

     They carry on making the tea.


72                                                                   *
     INT. VALERIE'S FRONT ROOM. DAY

     The drum and bass track continues to thud through the wall. A
     fresh pot of tea stands next to an empty can of soft drink.
     Shifty pulls out two rocks of crack and places them before
     Val. Chris watches with intent. He almost can't believe what
     he's seeing. She opens the cellophane and places down a small
     yellowy lump. Then carefully she fashions the can into a
     smoking utensil. At that moment, one of her cat ornaments
     falls from the shelf because of the vibrating bass. Valerie
     walks over, picks up the china tabby, and places it carefully
     back on the side. She sits back down, clearly distressed by
     the music.
                                                           35.

      We're tight on the can as Valerie lifts the paraphernalia to
      her mouth and takes a hit, a small grimace etched across her
      lips. She gestures with her hand offering Chris some.

                          CHRIS
                No, no, I'm fine......thanks
                though.


      CLOSE ON SHIFTY.

                          SHIFTY
                Look Val we're gonna have to do
                one...


      THE CAMERA PANS TO VAL- SHE LOOKS ANAESTHETIZED - BACK TO
      SHIFTY...

      Shifty nods at Chris for them both to leave. The thudding
      bass echoes out as they exit the flat. Chris looks slightly
      unsettled by what he's seen.

      EXT. OUTSIDE VALERIE'S FLAT. DAY

      Shifty shuts the door to Valerie's behind him. They go to
      walk off when suddenly Shifty stops dead in his tracks. He
      pauses for a while, and then shouts to Chris who has carried
      on walking.

                          SHIFTY
                Geezer, give me a minute.

      Chris turns to see Shifty pulling up the sleeve on his
      jacket. Shifty reaches through the letterbox and manages to
      unhook the latch. The door swings slowly open, the drum 'n'
      bass booming out.

      INT. OTIS' FLAT / FRONTROOM. DAY

      Shifty enters. The CAMERA follows. We're introduced to a dark
      hallway, clothes, magazines and CD's litter the floor. Shifty
      peers into one of the bedrooms leading off from the hallway -
      a mattress with no sheets. Shifty carries on down the
      hallway. Reaching a door, he slowly pushes it open, to reveal
      a grotty front room. On the TV a violent movie scene plays
      out, the sound turned down. A wiry looking 18 year old,
      Otis, sits on the sofa rolling a spliff, absorbed by the
      films images. A chavvy-looking bird sits to his left. Shifty,
      cool as a cucumber, rolls into the front room, straight up to
      the stereo, and turns it off. The young kid sits there, just
      staring, a spliff held in his two hands, totally flummoxed.
      Shifty stares him out.
                                                          36.

     Shifty looks about at the room.

     Otis looks at his girlfriend, and back to Shifty, utterly
     confused.


76   EXT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS. DAY

     Chris watches a young mum below, she can't be more than 16,
     pregnant, and with another baby in a pram. He looks saddened
     by the girl. He turns and walks into the flat.

               YEAH?

     At that moment Otis and his girlfriend look up to see Chris
     standing in the doorway. His presence adds menace to the
     situation.

                         OTIS
               Yeah, alright, yeah.

                         SHIFTY
               Because if I hear one word of
               complaint from next door, just one
               single complaint, I'll come back
               here and I'll take your TV, I'll
               take your stereo, and I'll shove em
               up your birds arse.

     He lets the words sink in. The girl looks a little shocked.

                  I'm sorry.

     Silence. Shifty stares Otis out. Otis looks away. Shifty
     picks up a biro from the floor and writes a number on Otis'
     wall.

                            SHIFTY

     the tenement block, Shifty's phone vibrates.

          Only if you get caught, mate.

Suddenly from around the corner we see someone come sprinting
past. .

                    SHIFTY (CONT'D)
          Malik?

Malik, small, Turkish, stops dead in his tracks and spins
round, he carries a large black holdall.
                                                44.

          bruv... I didn't even notice you.

                    SHIFTY
          What's going on?

                    MALIK
          Long story, geezer (Looks at Chris)
          you alright mate?

                    CHRIS
          How you doing?

          Malik, this is an old mate of mine,
          Chris.

                    MALIK
          Someone's gotta be.

Chris laughs.

                    SHIFTY
          Where are you going, man why you
          running?

                    MALIK
          Fucking hell, do you remember I was
          telling you about Craig?

                    SHIFTY
          No.

                    MALIK
          Yeah you fucking do, Craig Whittle,
          the guy who's seeing Desmond
          Dodge's sister.

                    SHIFTY
          What, Craig, small Craig.

                     MALIK
          Yeah, yeah. D'you remember I told
          you he had that job at the
          pinnacles, the, erm, storage
          warehouse.

                    SHIFTY
          Yeah, go on.

He doesn't.
                                                          45.

                         MALIK
               Anyway, Craig tells me every
               Friday, on the fucking dot, a
               delivery gets made, all this top
               fucking electrical gear...

     Shifty offers him a cigarette.

                         MALIK (CONT'D)
               Cheers mate... yeah every Friday
               [lights his fag] they make this
               fucking drop off, but because the
               lorry can't reverse into the
               courtyard, something to do with the
               angle of the gates or something, I
               dunno mate, you'll have to ask
               Craig, they fucking, cos they can't
               get in, they leave all these crates
               sitting on the fucking road...

                         SHIFTY
               What... are you on your way there
               now?

                         MALIK
               What... no, no, no, I drummed the
               place ten minutes ago blood. This
               fucking... forklift went inside

               fucking, I nipped in, started
               whacking in the gear, only turns
               out they've got another forklift...

                         CHRIS
               Hold up, hold up...Why are you
               running?

                         MALIK
               Cunt caught me right in the middle
               a loading up.


     CLOSE ON: SHIFTY AND CHRIS' FACES DROP.

                         MALIK (O.S.) (CONT'D)
               Are you sure you don't want
               anything, I'll do you a proper
               deal, sort you right out?

     At that precise moment a plain clothes police car comes
     heading toward them. The siren blares out. Chris and Shifty,
     caught between a rock and a hard place, turn and sprint.


84   EXT. BACK STREETS. DAY

     Chris runs, suddenly Shifty overtakes. Chris is fast but
     Shifty's like a whippet.
                                                          46.

                            SHIFTY
               Follow me.

     Shifty swerves down a side lane, Chris follows.


85   EXT. ALLEYWAY. DAY

     Malik's legging it down an alleyway, he throws the bag over a
     wall and goes over after it, he vaults, landing knee deep in
     a shitty garden pond.

                            MALIK
               Fuck.


86   EXT. SIDE STREET. DAY

     Shifty and Chris sprint, the police close behind.

                         SHIFTY
               This is bollocks.

     Shifty vaults a brick wall, Chris follows. The drop on the
     other side is far deeper than expected, they hit the floor
     hard. Suddenly they see something that grabs their attention.


87   EXT. CYCLE TRACK. DAY

     Shifty and Chris come swerving around the corner on the
     crappest kids' bikes you've ever seen. Shifty's knees are
     near his chin, and Chris' bike is pink with a fairy flag
     whipping off the back.


     THE CAMERA RIDES PARALLEL WITH THEM AS THEY HURTLE ALONG THE
     CYCLE TRACK.

     It's not perfect but it's better than running. Shifty starts
     cracking up laughing. Chris' face looks a little more
     serious, however. He doesn't find this all quite as funny as
     Shifty.


88                                                                   *

     Shifty sits in an underpass. Random graffiti tarnishes the
     walls behind them, their bikes lent against the wall. Chris
     is stood up, leaning on his knees, breathing hard.

                         CHRIS
               Mate, I'm telling you, this is no
               way to live.

     Chris sits down next to Shifty.
                                                          47.

               I'm serious, mate, you need to get
               away from this shit, come and live
               with me for a bit.

     Shifty looks at Chris, and reaches into his pocket pulling
     out a pack of fags.

                         CHRIS (CONT'D)
               I'm serious, mate... Why not?

     Shifty doesn't say anything.

               You'd love Manchester, man, it's
               full of fitness.

     Shifty stays quiet, and smokes. They sit their for a moment.

                         SHIFTY
               I can't just fuck off.

                         CHRIS
               Yeah, you can.

     Shifty looks at Chris.

                         SHIFTY
               Yeah, but I wouldn't mate... I
               don't want to... I'm perfectly
               fucking happy where I am...

     He stands there for moment, thinking. He walks over to
     Loretta and pulls back the sheets. He leans over and starts
     kissing her all over, she tries to ignore him, but he's
     licking her ear, grinding his crotch into her arse.

104   INT. BLAIR'S HOUSE / FRONT ROOM. DAY

      Blair sniffs up a line of coke and offers some to Shifty and
      Chris who decline. The mellow tunes plays out. Chris passes
      the spliff to Blair who takes a deep drag. Shifty sits back
      and looks at the clock on the wall. It reads 18:45. He thinks
      for a moment. He looks at the lines of coke lined up on
      Blair's table. He looks back at the clock. 18:46. Chris is
      watching Shifty.

      Silence as Trevor and Malik drive. Suddenly Trevor notices
      Shifty and Chris walking down a grass verge, making their way
      beneath the underpass.
                                                              57.

      He brings the van to a halt at the side of the street. He
      exits the van, leaving Malik sitting in the back passenger
      seat slightly non-plussed.


109   EXT. UNDERPASS. DAY

      Shifty and Chris walk through the tunnel, from the far end we
      see the shadow of a heavyset man approaching. Shifty and
      Chris walk unfazed. Shifty recognises the guy.

                Where you been geezer, I've been
                trying to get hold of you.

      He stops about a foot away from Shifty. Too close for
      comfort. Shifty takes a step back.

                          SHIFTY
                I've been busy, mate. You alright?

He pushes Shifty hard. Chris steps up.

Trevor's on Shifty and has him pinned up against the wall,
his hefty hand gripped around his neck, Suddenly he brings a
Stanley knife up to his temple.

Trevor edges the knife harder into Shifty's neck. Slowly
Shifty surrenders the large bag of coke and a cellophane bag
of crack with about two grand in cash.

      Trevor's eyes are bulging, face crimson with rage, his knife
      nestling at the tip of Shifty's Adams apple.

       She's at him, screaming, hitting. He just stands there limp,
       absorbing her blows.

       Shifty is then down in the kitchen, at the washing machine.
       He pulls out the powder tray, nothing there, he's digging
       about inside, he gets a torch, he's trying to peer in,
       frantic.

Rez pushes Shifty again hard. Shifty grabs Rez but Rez
punches him around the face, they fall to the floor in a
messy clinch, Rez pulling at shifty's face, hitting him.

                     SHIFTY

Rez storms off upstairs. Shifty stands just rubbing his face
with his hands muttering under his breath.

      Shifty stares at Glen, seething.

                I didn't think of it, cos I'm not
                that fucking stupid.

      There's a knock at the door. Shifty hesitates, then answers
      it.

                          CHRIS
                Mate, can we go?

                leaving.

      Shifty goes to walk out with Chris. Glen follows them into
      the corridor.

                          GLEN
                Couldn't show your face after what
                you did.

                          CHRIS
                What did I do exactly.

                          GLEN
                Get the fuck out of my house.

                Or what... you gonna kill me like
                you did Serena.

      Suddenly, with out hesitation Chris grabs Glen by his tee
      shirt and slams his forehead into Glens nose. It breaks in a
      clean crack, blood spurting out. Glen doubles over, holding
      his face. Chris smashes his fist into the back of Glens head,
      Glen goes down on his knees. Chris is kicking him. Shifty
      comes in and pulls him away, laying in a few boots himself.

      Glen stands up.

                          GLEN (CONT'D)

      Shifty and Chris cross a field, trudging through the ankle
      length grass. They reach a hedge. Shifty reaches into the
      bushes and starts rummaging around. He pulls out a black bin
      liner containing something heavy. He unwraps one bin liner to
      reveal another which has been tied with elastic. He undoes
      another black bin liner until finally he's left with just a
      leather sports bag.


139   INT. RANGE ROVER. NIGHT

      Through the front windscreen we see a sign indicating a

                Yeah but she didn't did she.

      Shifty leans forward and opens the leather sports bag. He
      pulls out a .38 six shot revolver and a hand full of bullets.
      He starts loading the gun. Chris stands up.

      Shifty steps out the front door to look about. It's a nice
      day. He looks up and down the street, nothing. He goes to
      walk back in the house when suddenly his eye catches
      something on the floor. He reaches down and picks up a large
      jiffy envelope that's been left leaning against the bin
      cupboard. Scribed across the front is: SHIFTY

175   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / FRONT ROOM. NIGHT - PAST

      CAMCORDER: Jasmine peers into the lens. She then turns the
      camera and follows Trevor who plants himself on the other
      settee, he looks uneasy.

                          TREVOR
                Babe, do me a favour.

      There is a colossal banging sound.

                          TREVOR (CONT'D)
                What the fuc...

      Trevor's up on his feet. The banging becomes a crash as
      something gives way.

                          JASMINE
                TREVOR WHAT IS IT? PHONE THE
                POLICE!

      Three heavyset men in balaclava's charge into the front room.
      Jasmine screams, dropping the camera on its side yet still
      giving a viewpoint on events. Three men are on Trevor, he's
      receiving a serious beating.

      THE MUSIC ON THE SOUND TRACK BEGINS TO GET LOUDER.

      A man grabs Jasmine by the hair and drags her to the middle
      of the room, she attempts to fight back, feisty as ever. This
      is bedlam. Suddenly someone rushes in from the left and lays
      a vicious right hook to Trevor's head. He goes down like a
      lead weight. Jasmine's crying, fear washing over her. A child
      cries out from upstairs.

                            VOICE (OS)
                Tell that fucking slag to stop
                crying... NOW!!

      Two hooded men drag Jasmine off to another room. She's
      fighting back clawing at them. Trevor's face is pressed
      against the cold lino flooring. Someone has grabbed the
      camera and angles it on Trevor's bloodied features. Congealed
      blood envelopes his eyes and nose cavities.
                                                              84.

      A hand moves into shot and grabs hold of his face, squeezing
      his cheeks so he looks sadly comic. Trevor's eyes flicker
      open.

                          VOICE (OS) (CONT'D)
                Look into the lens...

      Trevor fails to comply. The hand slaps him hard and grabs his
      face again.

                          VOICE (OS) (CONT'D)
                Look into the FUCKING lens!!!

      Trevor complies.

                          VOICE (OS) (CONT'D)
                Say you're sorry.

      Trevor begins to weep - a painful sight.

                          VOICE (OS) (CONT'D)
                SAY YOU'RE FUCKING SORRY!!!
