          The best advice I can give you
          undergrads is to fail. Failure is
          a virtue in today's society. Human
          error is a badge of honor. If
          you're the alcoholic child of a
          celebrity, you can blame them and
          earn a year on the best-seller
          list. If you're a celebrity, your
          mistake will earn you a People
          magazine cover. It's post-
          Watergate morality. Take
          responsibility for your mistakes
          and make a quick buck while you're
          at it.

          it slides further than he had planned and almost hits
          it. Getting out and trudging through the snow, in his

          The door swings open and there stands GUY, a handsome
          thirty-year-old wrapped in a blanket. Dale comes from
          the bedroom, fastening a man's robe and staring at Kirbo
          in disbelief.

          Kirby? What are you doing here?
          His entire world has collapsed. He can't swear, shout
          or cry -- he can only dash toward the car frantically.
          Falling in the snow once or twice, he eventually jumps
          into the car and tries to peel out, but it just spins
          in the snow. Meanwhile Guy has put on heavy boots and
          comes running out to the car where Kirbo stands on the
          gas to no avail.

          I realized what a terrific person
          she was and how much fun it was
          knowing her and I thought of that
          old joke, you know, this guy goes
          to a psychiatrist and says, 'Doc,
          uh, my brother's crazy. He thinks
          he's a chicken,' and the doctor
          says, 'Well, why don't you turn
          14 him in?' And the guy says, 'I
          would, but I need the eggs.' Well,

          And she's been doing a lot of coke
          .. Well, anyway, I confronted her
          at the apartment, and at first she
          denied everything, but then she
          went crazy -- and now she's locked
          herself in the apartment and she
          won't let me back in... I'm really
          worried about her.

          Yeah, well, yesterday's editorial
          achievement is today's garbage
          wrapper, right...?
          Kevin tries to laugh charmingly. Alec tries to laugh
          along with him, but suddenly rage returns.

          You little shit!!!
          He grabs Kevin. Kevin tries to fight back, but Alec is
          so overpowering he pushes Kevin up to the railing of the
          fire escape, and then pushes him over. Kevin hangs
          upside down as Alec holds him by his legs. Dozens of
          scraps of paper fall from his pocket.
          Leaning out the apartment hallway window, Leslie sees
          them.

          She has been holding onto the bars with her bare-hands,
          but the bitter cold makes her wince as she removes her
          hands. Alec is overwhelmed with feelings as he takes her
          hands and holds them to his mouth, breathing warm breath
