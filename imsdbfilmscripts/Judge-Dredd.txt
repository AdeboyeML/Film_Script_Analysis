          Nine years ago, the Lawgiver Model
          Two replaced the Lawgiver Model One.
          The difference lies in two areas:
          The computer chip and the ammunition
          coding. Like the Model one, the
          computer chip recognizes the
          thumbcode of all Judges. Judges
          may use each other's firearms; but
          a suspect dare not use a Judge's
          .weapon against "a Judge.
          ANIMATION reminds us of this in non-gory fashion.

                         CENTRAL(CONT'D)
          However, the ammunition coding in
          the Model Two is not cued to the (X)
          thumbcode recognition chip.
          Instead, it is coded to the personal
          DNA of the Judge using the weapon.
